This Golden Age Story is a fine way to have fun and enjoy the feel of storytelling form that era and a lot of fun entertainment for the commute or vacation trips."},{"Title":"Hurtling wings (Classic fiction series)","review":"I actually listened to the audiobooks and I loved it. These audiobooks are fully dramatized stories with music and sound effect. Like Graphic Audios, except this story and all the other Golden Age Story audiobooks do NOT drawn in the sound effects that Graphic Audios' does.In this audio the sound effects are background sounds. And the story itself is what makes the story a blast to listen to. This story was about test pilot Cal who enters and flies in The National Air Meet competition. He wants to win the contract for Air Mail Transportation. As usual there is a dame in the story (a bit of romance) but this dame is a strong lady! I like strong women! And of course there are villains and danger! Cool thing is that the story is so real, you can tell that the author knew how to fly and has been there."},{"Title":"Hurtling wings (Classic fiction series)","review":"Pulp fiction reached its zenith during the 1930's and 1940's. Magazines like Argosy and Five Stories Monthly were springboards for famous authors like Edgar Rice Burroughs and Isaac Asimov. Another prolific and popular writer of that era was L. Ron Hubbard. His flying ace tale, \\"Hurtling Wings\\" was originally published in 1934 in \\"Adventure\\" magazine. The mythologist, Joseph Campbell writes that \\"popular tales represent the heroic action as physical,\\" and this tale about Cal Bradley, daredevil racer and test pilot is no exception. Heroic Cal Bradley flies in the face of saboteurs and sabotaged planes to try to save Speed Kyle's aircraft company. Hubbard knows how to write a page turner...his \\"pulp hero,\\" Cal Bradley, man of courage in the cockpit races, rolls, and dives in a non stop fight to win."},{"Title":"Hurtling wings (Classic fiction series)","review":"This is the story of a racer and test pilot Cal Bradley who has entered an air meet to win air mail contracts. It was the creating of the air mail routes that really paved the way for commercial flight. This is a story that takes this one historical fact and builds an exciting adventure around it."},{"Title":"Hurtling wings (Classic fiction series)","review":"\\"Hurtling Wings\\"by L. Ron HubbardMulticast PerformanceProduced by Galaxy AudioApprox 2 hoursI've got to tell you, these audio book releases from Galaxy audio are just plain fun. During the mid-20th century L. Ron Hubbard eked out a living by writing stories for the many pulp fiction magazines that were in heavy circulation at the time. He wrote the stories in various genres so he could cover a wide range of the publications and even used aliases/pen names for some of the stories. Some of the genres he wrote in are; Science-Fiction, Westerns, Mystery, Fantasy, and Adventure (the adventure could be further broken down to sea, air and orient adventures.) Galaxy Press began re-releasing these stories and packaging them down to books that cover the various genres. Galaxy Audio in turning these into audio books has gone a huge step further by creating some very entertaining audio drama with each book.Each book contains one or more stories, and with the audio books these come out to about 2 hours of pure audio pleasure. Using a cast of very talented vocal actors, these stories come to life in full audio glory. The actors not only perform the characters they create the mood and express the action they make you HAVE to listen to the stories. The sound effects are not simply thrown in when the story asks for it but instead layered into the full production so that they fit perfectly in to make the full experience completely engulf the listener.So with all that in mind I try out another genre in the Hubbard/Galaxy inventory and gave \\"Hurtling Wings\\" an air adventure a listen. Soon I was caught up in the action and enjoying the full theatrical spectacle that is this audio book.Hurtling Wings was originally published in \\"Adventure\\" November,1934, and seems at first like a simple story about aircraft racing teams competing in various aerial events. But with Hubbard's stories from the Golden Age nothing is simple. Cal Bradley is a daredevil racer and test pilot and during the acrobatics section of the event loses his plane in what turns out to be sabotage. Speed Kyle's company which builds the best planes around needs a good pilot to show of his planes at this event. This National Air Meet is important because the winner of the meet could get a valuable air mail contract, which could pull Speed's company out of the possibility of financial ruin.Cal happens to be dating Speed's daughter Georgia, and this means they could be together more, but the sabotage follows Cal as it turns that some of the other businesses competing are not very honest. During the various flying contests Cal battles sabotaged planes to keep them in the air and battles the saboteurs to keep everyone around him safe. The excitement of this story will have you on the edge of your seat the whole time and not until everyone is safe and back on the ground can you relax.Check out this latest release from Galaxy Audio for some exciting air adventures from the Golden Age of stories."},{"Title":"Banned: Classical Erotica : Forty Sensual and Erotic Excepts from Aristophanes to Whitman-Uncensored","review":"There is an unfortunate idea current, that sex was invented in the 20th century and before that Victorian ideas held sway all the way back to the dawn of time. This book is a refreshing antidote to that idea, with its merry quotations from over 2,000 years of erotic writings. It also has some examples of bowdlerized and direct translations, which are interesting not only in themselves but as a way of recognizing stealthy censorship.All in all, this is a marvelous resource."},{"Title":"Challenging Chomsky: The Generative Garden Game","review":"For anyone even mildly interested in linguistics, this book is a unique delight. It is a primer on modern linguistics, disguised as a playful examination of Noam Chomsky's mind, disguised as a collection of whimsical fables. In it, Chomsky (the father of modern linguistics, reigning from his perch at MIT) is presented as the omnipotent 'Master of the Maze,' vanquishing all who challenge his hegemony of the 'Generative Garden.' At its surface, the book poses as an instructional tour of 'the Maze' for you, the hopeful but naive young warrior who dares to match wits with the Master. At each fork in the road, a dire warning is given in the form of a tale of some long-ago warrior that met an untimely end on the spot. The traps and distractions are revealed, the blind alleys and sudden drops are marked. Alternating with these second-person italicized passages of alliterative whimsy is a parallel, more serious, discussion of Chomsky's linguistic edifice of theory and argument. Here, the forks in the road are represented as a series of conceptual distinctions that Chomsky has applied to the topic over the decades since his seminal &quot;Syntactic Structures&quot; was printed. These are beautifully succinct and hone in like scalpels to the essential issues. And then, before your eyes glaze over, its back to the Garden Game and the words of wisdom to those who dare. Most of the major conflicts (as of the time of its writing, i.e., 1989) are humorously portrayed, although I'd bet some of the participants would take issue with Botha's judgement of victory for Chomsky in their case. Amusingly, Botha's own minor run-in with the Master (or his fans) is depicted discreetly as almost a non-event beneath the notice of Chomsky. Basically, this is a work of pure love and devotion to the author's chosen field of study, delivered as a left-handed tribute to the intellectual giant who made it all possible.P.S. -- For those of you who are mostly familiar with Chomsky's political writings, I commend this book as a small grain of salt to be prudently kept handy."},{"Title":"Challenging Chomsky: The Generative Garden Game","review":"Chomsky's theory is difficult to most people because there are so many concepts which look alike but in fact are different by nature. Botha's book offers a very good help to the reader who is interested in getting to know Chomsky's linguistics. The book consists of a series of pairs of concepts which make people puzzling, for example, initial state vs. steady state, stable vs. steady, mind vs. body, external autonomy vs. internal autonomy, linguistic universals vs. cross-linguistic generalizations, problems vs. mysteries, and so on and so forth. It should be recommended as a desk-top handbook to the reader of Chomskyan literature."},{"Title":"The Cain Conversion","review":"This is a cool book with lots going on. I am always up for a good old spy vs. spy and this book is that at the base, but the author through in a psychopathic killer into the mix. The story is a fun read. The characters are well enough written and the plot construction is believable. Overall the mix of the two types of genre is done very well and it gives you a book that you run through. You do not have to think too hard to read the book which for escapism is good. It is an enjoyable book to pass the time on a summer weekend."},{"Title":"Upgrading the Cruising Sailboat: Spurr's Boatbook, 2nd Edition","review":"This is a great book for the cruising sailor who owns a \\"good old boat.\\" The information is indispensable and the book is profusely illustrated.

Buckner has a gift for keeping readers turning the pages with just the right mix of action and suspense. The descriptions of the future world and its culture are eerily believable, and the characters have an emotional appeal that will really make you want them to succeed in their quest to create a tiny pocket of freedom in a world controlled by mega-corporations. This would make a great movie!"},{"Title":"Neurolink","review":"It's the 23rd century, and the world is a wasteland caused by pollution and global warming. Exposure to the unfiltered air or water leads rapidly to cancer or other nasty conditions. Giant corporations, now known as Coms, dominate the world, and their privileged executive class as well as many of their protected employees, or \\"protes\\", live in domed cities. The Coms are in a more or less constant struggle with the Orgs, especially the biggest, baddest Org of them all, the WTO. (It's worth mentioning that a significant, and possibly dominant, part of the WTO are its AIs.) The Coms are not the good guys.This doesn't seem like a promising set-up, and I have many complaints about the details. Despite that, I found myself enjoyng the book.Dominc Jedes has wealth and position beyond the dreams of avarice. He's the (cloned) son of the president of ZahlenBank, one of the most powerful of the Coms. If he's lately been having some disagreements with his father, finding some of his decisions affecting protes to be a little too ruthlessly pragmatic, he nevertheless believes in the system and loves his father. His father's approaching death is an added source of tension between them, as the elder Jedes has chosen to forego what aggressive medical care could do for him, in favor of creating a neural profile that will live on in the computer network after his physi cal death.On what proves to be the last day of his father's physical life, Dominic unwisely makes a joke in a board meeting about dealing with the problem of an unprofitable mining sub that ZahlenBank got in a foreclosure by freeing the protes and giving them the sub. This unfortunately strikes his father and the board as a wonderfully clever idea--no costs for continuing to support these now-useless workers! Then Dear Old Dad promptly dies, the freed protes start broadcasting to the world for more discont ented protes to join them, and ZahlenBank is suddenly in deep, deep trouble. The WTO steps in with an offer to arrange negotiations, if Dominic will meet with the protes alone, accompanied only by a WTO agent. He reluctantly agrees, and unhappily finds th at he is accompanied also by the hated neural profile of his dead father. (The NP insists it's the real thing; Dominic does not agree. Dominic also believes it lacks the humanity and honor his father had; I think the evidence is that he had an overly-rosy view of his father.) In short order, Dominic is getting a very exciting look at how the other 90% lives.As I said, I have a lot of specific complaints. The background feels as if it was insufficiently thought out. Europe seems to be about all that sort of survived the collapse. If the ice caps completely melted, why didn't all that cold, fresh water running into the Atlantic do bad things to the Gulf Stream and the North Atlantic Drift? If Europe is the last economy standing, why is the basic currency the deutchdollar rather than the euro? And if giant multinational corporations are the bad guys, how can the WTO be the good guys? And Dominc seems quite improbaby nave. What Dominic isn't, though, is either stupid, or improbably virtuous. He's a basically likable guy who's a product of his society and upbringing. He has believably human and reactions to the individuals he meets, for both good and ill, and alters his assumptions about how the world really works only with a plausible amount of resistance and mental pain. All in all, this is an enjoyable light read."},{"Title":"Neurolink","review":"This is an entertaining novel with a fast-moving plot. Banker Dominic Jedes must deal with the computer-generated replica of his domineering dead father--just at the moment that he must go quell a worker rebellion in a submarine. The characters are well-drawn--and boy, do they have relationship and boundary issues! The conflict with the workers turns out to be much more complex than the financial data that Dominic is accustomed to handling at his office. Very enjoyable. I couldn't put it down, and then I hated for it to end!"},{"Title":"Neurolink","review":"I loved this book! NEUROLINK is both suspenseful and thought provoking. The action is fast and unpredictable. The descriptions are mesmerizing, and the characters really come alive -- especially Dominic, the main character, plus the weird nano-computer that's living inside his eye. Very fresh ideas. This book kept me turning the pages right through to the end. I liked this every bit as much as Buckner's first book, HYPERTHOUGHT, which was also a great read."},{"Title":"Neurolink","review":"There's really nothing out of the ordinary about this book, the plot progresses exactly as one would expect with no real surprises, but the story is told in an entertaining way and the characters are quite relatable. If you're a fan of the genre you've probably read stories very like this one before, but you'll probably enjoy this one as well. If you're not familiar with the genre, this would make a reasonable introduction. But if you're looking for something new or unique, this is not it."},{"Title":"Neurolink","review":"Two hundred years from now, Earth has become a toxic wasteland. Everyone lives in domes. Global warming has pushed the temperate climates farther north, rendering the area around the equator uninhabitable. Corporations called coms have takien over, ruling billions of protes, or \\"protected persons\\" (actually, little better than slaves).Dominic Jedes is about to become president of ZahlenBank, the only institution more powerful than the coms. He isn't just the son of Richter Jedes, the bank's founder, he is an exact genetic copy of his father. He directs the bank to give two thousand protes their freedom, trapping them in a rusting, malfunctioning submarine at the bottom of the ocean. They are supposed to die, but they don't. They broadcast an untraceable and continuous message over the Net, encouraging others to join them. The free protes get thousands of takers.Every minute that the message is broadcast, ZahlenBank's financial condition is damaged. Dominic is forced to go to the sub, and somehow shut off that message. For someone who has spent his life in filtered air, and with the finest in designer medicines in his bloodstream, when Dominic enters the sub, he feels like he has descended into hell. It's hot, stinking, packed with people, and the oxygen-generating system is on the verge of collapse. People are constantly putting up walls everywhere, so any attempt to reach the bridge quickly becomes impossible. Within minutes, Dominic feels like he has contracted some major disease. When he first reaches the sub, Dominic wants to reach the bridge, expose the sub's location, have everyone arrested, and get back to cleanliness as soon as possible. The longer he remains on the sub, the more sympathy he has for these people, and the more he wants to help them, instead of turning them in.This is a strong, well done piece of writing. It has good characters, good society building, and an interesting story. The reader will not go wrong with this novel."},{"Title":"Neurolink","review":"M.M.

Characters become real as this fast-paced story grabs the reader and takes him on a great adventure. Dominic Jedes is conflicted and stressed and his love-hate relationship with his father rings true. The fiery Major Qi, a real punk chic, is as cunning and strong as she is beautiful. The underwater scenes are vividly described and the action dramatic. Neurolink will establish Buckner as one of our best science fiction writers. This story is an intricate and intriguing weave of science and survival. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good story."},{"Title":"Neurolink","review":"The book feels like a short story which was written for non-science fiction fans and then expanded into a novel, or perhaps is the novelization of one of the bad computer adventure games that came out in the early 90s. The setting is entirely too simplistic and not explained believably. The world is essentially run by one bank, which has one rival organization - the WTO. It isn't explained well how this situation evolved or why the citizens have gone along with it for decades. Nor is it presented as an interesting study in cultural evolution, a la 1984 or Brave New World - it is just a cheap generic framework in which to throw a story.That could be forgiven if someone interesting were done within that framework. Unfortunately, the characters are one dimensional, their actions make little to no sense, and there isn't a lot else going on in the novel. There is really only one vaguely fleshed out character - the main one - and his coming-into-his-own story arc is painfully obvious from the start. Despite a few glimmers of background and motivation, there really aren't any other characters with personalities in the entire book. The protagonist stumbles through a series of encounters, learns a few lessons, and then gets to make the big decision about what happens to the world he lives in.So perhaps the story could be redeemed by some gripping action sequences or imagery. No such luck - it isn't even told well. During the week and a half or so during which the novel is set, the main character eats 2 or 3 meals, sleeps 3 or 4 times and goes to the bathroom maybe twice, but we get the details of all of these encounters. There are almost no interesting (or believable) conflicts and the ending (which is visible from a mile away) still manages to feel arbitrary. The fairly random decisions made by the rest of the cast will leave you scratching your head, and ultimately you will be left wondering how so little managed to happen over the course of so many pages.Take my advice and read a collection of sci-fi short stories instead!"},{"Title":"Boa Constrictors (Animals of the Rain Forest)","review":"\\"Boa Constrictors,\\" by Sam Dollar, is part of the \\"Animals of the Rain Forest\\" series of books for young readers.

It will not include page numbers or images, and therefore is virtually worthless. The text is wonderful, but it is of no help to me as a student trying to write an art history paper if I can't create citations or imagery (which is not referenced in the text itself so I can't simply google the images). So much for trying to save money by renting it; maybe if you buy it everything will be there but I don't have $30 to splurge, especially since I just wasted $11."},{"Title":"Maigret and the young girl","review":"Set in smalltown USA and written while Simenon was living there, L'horloger d'Everton nevertheless has all the familiar characteristics of Simenon's unique approach to the crime novel. The central crime incident takes place \\"off-stage\\", when Ben, the 16 year-old son of watch repair man Dave Galloway disappears with a car, a gun and the 15 year-old daughter of his neighbour and soon becomes a fugitive from the law. Simenon's focus however is on the factors underlying Ben's out of character behaviour, examining the background of Dave Galloway family background, his own broken marriage and his relationship with his son, and as well as the monotony and watchfulness of the small community in which they live and their own peculiar form of rebellion against social and bourgeois expectations.If it doesn't reveal anything significant or different from other Simenon novels with a similar subject matter, the novel's American setting brings in another in a further aspect outside the usual Simenon case - that of the nature of press reporting and the whole circus of the US judicial system."},{"Title":"Crash Dive","review":"Thanks to Amazon.com for even getting me interested in this book as well as all the reviewers that caught my attention. This debut book by McKinna was a treasure find! I am not a diver and did not quite understand all of the diving and sailing stuff but it was a relentless action/adventure story with some good surprises - and I like that! The characters were well written and I felt like I was kind of reading a well made action movie in the tradition of DIE HARD in the diver's seat, so to speak. I like Ben Gannon and his woman Sass, and the cajun friend Rolly was fun to follow. The bad guys were bad and colorful and Sligo was exhausting to read with his constant cocaine snorting and relentless smuggler's smack. The story and action were very fun to read and I already bought the next book - TIGER REEF, and will be reviewing that in about a week. Great debut Mr. McKinna and am looking forward to your next book. Good luck!"},{"Title":"Crash Dive","review":"As a diver, I really loved Crash Dive and the other two books in this diving adventure series, Tiger Reef and Shark Lake. These are really superior underwater thrillers, and I'd recommend them to anyone who likes diving and high adventure (I don't know what the reviewer before me is talking about--he sounds like a bitter crank who can't get his own work published to me). John McKinna is really great writer who knows how to spin a great yarn with excellent characters and action. Crash Dive is about a terrorist attack on a Gulf of Mexico oil rig, but it's also about Cuba, and a whacky drug smuggler who can't get out of his own way, and international politics, and a cool working-class hero (Ben Gannon, a commercial diver) and his 'way cool girlfriend \\"Sass\\". I think I'm in love with her. I loved McKinna's way with a story, and I've bought all his books since reading this one, including his World War Two novels under the pen name John Mannock, Iron Coffin and The Sen-Toku Raid. Do yourself a favor and check this author out, under either of his writing names, because he's very, very good. Ignore Cranky below--Crash Dive gets five very enthusiastic stars."},{"Title":"Crash Dive","review":"John McKinna, who also writes WWII thrillers under the pen name &quot;John Mannock&quot;, really produced a winner with this first novel in his seagoing thriller trilogy featuring intrepid, globe-trotting commercial diver Ben Gannon. Superior writing and a dry sense of humor are what distinguish CRASH DIVE and its two companion novels, TIGER REEF and SHARK LAKE. As a recreational diver myself, I found McKinna's technical knowledge (he was a commercial deep-sea diver himself for nearly 20 years) and characterizations (he's a genuinely gifted writer--more like Patrick O'Brian or Nicholas Monsarrat than some pulp hack) to be far better than those of, say, the ubiquitous Clive Cussler. McKinna's hero Ben Gannon is far more believable than Cussler's Dirk Pitt, who is something of a superman in skin-tight black rubber. Gannon is a regular guy with an uncommon amount of resourcefulness and adaptability, which makes him a good stand-in for the reader: you can easily imagine yourself in the dilemmas Gannon encounters, and enjoy beating the odds with him. McKinna's CRASH DIVE anticipated the terrorist attack on America by several years, the target in the novel being an offshore oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico. Prescient. The other two Gannon novels examine, with thrilling dramatic license, modern piracy in the Java Sea (TIGER REEF) and the violent dissolution of a small African country in the throes of revolution (SHARK LAKE). All are excellent reading. In addition, McKinna's IRON COFFIN (also available on Amazon), written under the pen name &quot;John Mannock&quot;, is a superb WWII novel about a damaged German U-boat that occupied the Top Fifty Paperback Bestseller's List in the U.S. in the winter of 2004. If you want to read an excellent modern author's debut books, you can't go wrong with the Ben Gannon diving series. McKinna/&quot;Mannock&quot; is one of the very best."},{"Title":"Crash Dive","review":"This book is about a tough guy in a tough situation. It's a great summer read...nothing fancy...just a fun adventure to get involved in. If you like books about the ocean, diving and intrigue, this is one to add to your list. I plan on reading all the Ben Gannon books when I get a chance."},{"Title":"Crash Dive","review":"I hope every person with an interest in diving discovers John McKinna's excellent, realistic adventure trilogy about commercial oilfield diver Ben Gannon. This novel, \\"Crash Dive\\", is the first in the series, and the first of the 3 that I read. I was really impressed with the author's storytelling skills, his wry way of expressing himself, and his in-depth knowledge of offshore diving. Not surprising since he's a veteran commercial diver himself. \\"Crash Dive\\" is amazingly prophetic--written in 1999, it's about an Arab terrorist attack on an American oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico. Fast-paced, full of black humor (like the other Ben Gannon books, \\"Tiger Reef\\" and \\"Shark Lake\\", and surprisingly heart-tugging for this type of novel...you really like the characters. In fact, along with twists, turns, and pacing, the expert characterization is what really makes John McKinna's books stand out, in my opinion. They really grab you and pull you in, and you hate it when they're over. I highly recommend \\"Crash Dive\\" and the other two Ben Gannon novels--as an adventure writer, author McKinna is definitely a cut above the rest of the pack."},{"Title":"Crash Dive","review":"I just really liked this. I'm the kind of girl who likes outdoor activities, including diving, so I really got into Crash Dive.

An exciting read that makes you think. This writer has another fan."},{"Title":"Crash Dive","review":"Great book from an interesting author! He's used to be a professional offshore diver, so he knows what he's writing about . . . which is important in this kind of undersea fiction.

The firstin a series written by ex-commercial diver John McKinna it's packed full of great adventure far offshore in the oilfields of the Gulf of Mexico. Superior writing, odd characters, unexpected twists and turns, real diving knowledge, and a warped sense of humor make Crash Dive (and Tiger Reef) a really enjoyable reading experience. If McKinna can maintain this level of storytelling and not become boring and repetitive, like Grisham did, he'll get my money every time. Great."},{"Title":"Crash Dive","review":"What if terrorists came to America, well-armed and well-prepared? Where might they strike? Well, in John McKinna's excellent novel, CRASH DIVE, they choose an isolated high-tech oil rig as a target. Good concept! McKinna builds his story of an ordinary working guy (a comnmercial diver)who's thrown into a desperate situation beyond his control, far from help, with an expert sense of pacing and intrigue. Because the author was actually an offshore oilfield diver, there's a lot of interesting detail here about diving. But that doesn't detract from the story. McKinna is adept at moving things along, even with the inclusion of more technical stuff. His hero, Ben Gannon, is likeable and real, and his villains and supporting cast are well-drawn and surprisingly humorous. If you like your adventures hard-hitting with a little bit of wackiness thrown in, you'll like CRASH DIVE. This book makes you wonder, like the World Trade Center bombing did, if Middle Eastern terrorism is really all that far away from America's shores."},{"Title":"Crash Dive","review":"Crash Dive is hard to put down once you have started. The author is a master story teller. I am going to buy his other books."},{"Title":"Crash Dive","review":"Fantast--Well, see my review for the other book in this diving series, TIGER REEF!"},{"Title":"Crash Dive","review":"As a writer, I know how hard it is to produce a book, but I couldn't finish this one. Can anyone write about something other than terrorists and drug dealers? How about some pure adventure, no suspense, no intrigue, just a lot of diving, a little fun, maybe some romance (but not essential), and some writing that conveys an author's love of the sea and all that lives in it. Any diver knows there is enough adrenaline in simply going under water, but I guess people who read books and don't dive, they don't have a clue how fascinating and exciting being under water is. They continue to read those pie in the sky Cussler fantasies. Are there any readers who like realism?If I buy another McKinna book, it will be a non-fiction one. I'm tired of fantasies. The real thing is just as exciting, but then I'm spoiled, because I was an oilfield diver too."},{"Title":"Crash Dive","review":"This is my first McKinna book. I love his style. Fast paced yet detailed. Even the most experienced diver will enjoy this. Should be a movie!"},{"Title":"Crash Dive","review":"This is the first novel by John McKinna who was a commercial diver before he began writing.This is a good action novel. I'm a big Cussler fan but I don't think McKinna is quite there yet.If you are interested in what goes on around commercial dive sites {and most divers are} I think you'll enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Crash Dive","review":"You know it's good when you can't stop smiling! This is one of those books that can keep you up all night long, forget dinner, forget television, you are there peering over Ben Gannon's shoulders. You don't have to be a diver to understand it, although you will enjoy it even more if you are. I find myself having to translate the book into Spanish for my friends in Spain, fellow divers, and for my Dad in the Caribbean. A free effort, I wouldn't even dream of it if I didn't think it was worth it. Once again, thanks for the great job Mr. McKinna!"},{"Title":"Crash Dive","review":"Great book. Fast action and some very good characters. Terrorists really could try and blow up a US oil rig, couldn't they? A down-to-earth hero who happens to be an oil patch diver tries to stop them, along with some of his rough-and-tumble buddies. This novel, by a former commercial diver, is better than most of this type. Well worth the time. I found this book after reading the 2nd one in the series, Tiger Reef, which was somewhat zanier, but also a great adventure read. Great fast reading."},{"Title":"Crash Dive","review":"I gave Crash Dive a try after seeing it advertised in the April, 2000 issue of Skin Diver Magazine. As I sport diver of over thirty years experience, I was delighted to find a novel packed full of fast action, dark humor, and technical diving detail. Author John McKinna has a rather unique style for a thriller writer--something like Carl Hiassen meets Clive Cussler--and I found his off-the-wall approach very entertaining. His own experience as a commercial diver shows on every page, but his style is wry and fast-moving. I liked this novel very much, and have already ordered a copy of the sequel, Tiger Reef, that will apparently be hitting the bookshelves in a month or so (May, 2000). I'm hoping it will be, like a Crash Dive, an exceptionally good sea thriller."},{"Title":"Crash Dive","review":"I enjoyed this &quot;Techo-thriller&quot; and read it almost straight through. This was the first &quot;Off-shore Oil Rig&quot; thriller that I recall in the hundreds that I have read. It's full of action and great descriptions of off-shore oil rig installations and commercial diving. The main character, Ben Gannon, could have a great future. I recommend it to techo-thriller fans. AND I recommend that the author employ some technical reviewers with experience in areas the author is not before the next book goes to print. Aviation/helicoptors would be a good area to focus on first."},{"Title":"Crash Dive","review":"&quot;Crash Dive&quot; really caught my imagination. It's a tough little blue-collar story with a number of clever and unexpected twists.

I'll be looking for your next one."},{"Title":"Crash Dive","review":"John McKinna is a refreshing new voice in the action/adventure genre.

Very interesting diving and offshore scenes. Try this. Highly recommended for thriller fans."},{"Title":"Crash Dive","review":"I found this book to be a fun , fast paced read. The information about the oil industry and deep see drilling was really interesting. Mr. Mckinna's writing was quite vivid and involving with some interesting plot twists. The only thing I had a problem with is that a few times his lead charactor's actions were a little unbelievable. Not like Clive Cussler unbelieveable, but just a little over the top. I would certainly recommend this book to anyone who likes the action genre."},{"Title":"Crash Dive","review":"This was a fun book to read. I've never working in the oil business, except for pumping gas when I was a kid, but this book held my attention. Lots of things going on. . ."},{"Title":"Crash Dive","review":"Crash Dive is a fine novel. Diving-oriented thrillers of this quality are rare- most of them read more like science fiction. This is a tough, funny, blue-collar action story set in the real Gulf oilfields off Texas and Louisiana. Do yourself a favor and try this enthralling novel."},{"Title":"Crash Dive","review":"We don't have water out here in Oklahoma where I live, but we sure have a few oilfields. Anyone who ever worked on an oil well will love this book. The hero, Ben Gannon, is an oilfield diver in the Gulf of Mexico, but you don't have to be a diver or have roughnecked a well to enjoy CRASH DIVE. This here is one first-class job of storytelling. I really liked how the Arab terrorists sneak up on the Louisiana oilfield from Cuba. Hell, they could really do that, couldn't they? Glad I'm up here in Oklahoma. All we have to worry about up here is folks like Tim McVeigh. Bottom line: CRASH DIVE's a heckuva read, and John McKinna's got a nice feel for words. This one won't disappoint you."},{"Title":"Crash Dive","review":"Oh, man, I love this book! This CRASH DIVE is starting to show up in the oilfield, and us offshore boys LOVE this book! Mean-a$$ toolpushers, tobacco-spitting good ol' boys, divers, A-rab terrorists, the Mossad, and a psycho-clown drug smuggler---Man, this is perfect. We fixing to crown McKinna King Of The Oil Patch for writing this. You just KNOW this guy spent YEARS out here! How else could he get it so right? This is a great book to take offshore, whether you're a diver, a driller, a wire-liner, or a roustabout. We love it out here."},{"Title":"Crash Dive","review":"All right, McKinna. Now that you've written a book, I suppose you're going to forget all your old oilfield diving buddies in Galveston. Maybe turn into some kind of big shot. Come on back to Tejas, bud. Mas tequila, hombre! Anyone reading this: buy McKinna's book, it's great. Boats, guns, and heavy equipment going BOOM! Plus a lot of laughs. It's worth the money. And he was the real deal. A real oil patch diving rat. Who knew he could even read?"},{"Title":"Crash Dive","review":"As a roustabout on an offshore drilling rig in my pre-law school days, I spent a significant amount of time watching the activities of commercial divers who were called out to solve problems for us underwater. These guys are, as they say, a Breed Apart. All day and all night, in virtually any kind of water or weather, these divers would jump, one after another, linked to the surface only by a single long breathing hose, and perform their underwater tasks. Their activities always fascinated me, stuck up on the drilling deck, but I also found it frightening. To this day, the memory of seeing those guys leaping into that black water at midnight, eighty miles offshore, gives me a chill. So it is with great delight that I recommend John McKinna's novel &quot;Crash Dive&quot; to lovers of sea fiction. I never got the impression during my roustabout days that most commercial divers were particularly literate, but McKinna is a notable exception. His pacing is sure, his descriptions vivid, and his characters terrific. The novel is also suffused with black humor. All in all, a tremendous read, and an accurate document of the lives of offshore divers and rig personnel. Do yourself a favor and get this one."},{"Title":"Crash Dive","review":"Interesting, believable sea thriller. Arab terrorists ride a smuggler's boat up from Cuba to attack an American oil rig. Professional divers get caught in the middle, and sparks fly. Author McKinna got my attention and held it for 400 pages, which is more than I can say for ninety percent of the fiction I'm dumb enough to buy these days."},{"Title":"Crash Dive","review":"This is a good novel. CRASH DIVE delivers a well-paced story peopled with well-drawn characters. Terrorists attack an oil platform in the Gulf of Mexic and are opposed by a heroic professional diver and a renegade Mossad agent. Though the villains at times seem too crazy and accident-prone to get out of their own way, their contortions make for great entertainment. Good descriptions of technical diving too. Get this one."},{"Title":"Crash Dive","review":"McKinna uses his life's experiences for an incredible story background. The novel is fast past and action filled. It is filled with rich characters and plenty of twists along the way. You should not miss this one."},{"Title":"Crash Dive","review":"Whoa! Where did this guy come from? CRASH DIVE author John McKinna, we're told on the cover credits, is a former professional commercial oil field diver. It shows! This book is one tremendous read: a high-adventure sea story with a surprising amount of dark, zany humor mixed in. McKinna's style is a mix of Robert Ludlum, Elmore Leonard, and Carl Hiassen. In addition to making me laugh out loud on a number of occasions, CRASH DIVE is a fascinating document of what it's really like to work in the offshore oilfields on the big rigs. And while there is plenty of action, the story is primarily character-driven. My favorite is the madcap drug-smuggler Jeremiah Sligo--a creation worthy of Elmore Leonard at his finest. It's always a pleasure to take a chance on a new writer and be surprised and delighted instead of disappointed. CRASH DIVE did it for me. I highly recommend it to both men and--oddly enough--women. There is a strong, believable female character named Sasha in the book, which is a bit unusual in an adventure novel. Here's hoping that McKinna follows up with a sequel to CRASH DIVE in the near future."},{"Title":"The Golden age of air racing, pre 1940","review":"This book is a good read on a chapter by chapter basis. Each chapter is devoted to a specific event, plane or pilot. Each chapter took me about an hour to read, so there are many hours of enjoyable reading to be had.Aircraft information includes the basic size wieght speed engine and usually a 3-view of the airframe.There are numerous listings of race results through the various years. If you like to go through the results and find out who flew what how fast, its probably here.There are lots of photos and drawings to use as reference while reading.If I had to say one negative thing about the book, it would be &quot;It sometimes got bogged down in detail&quot;. But if detail is what you are looking for, this may be a book for you."},{"Title":"Thief","review":"If a book succeeds on its own terms, I generally consider it to be a success. I don't expect every book I read to be a literary masterpiece, nor do I expect every book I read to present new and original ideas.Thief, however, fails to live up to even its modest potential: it is terribly written, and it rather ineffectively veils a vitriolic and naive assumption that wealthy Americans are to blame for the world's problems behind its purported glimpse into the life of a criminal slum resident.On the first point, the chief fault is the author's complete lack of narrative consistency. Is this a detached description of a person's life? Fine, then why break into first person every fifth page to complain about how Americans are to blame for his plight? Is this a firsthand description of slum life in a third world country? Then pony up, and drop the half-baked character development and one dimensional supporting cast (complete with a pedophilic priest).Much more egregious an offense, however, is the author's clear intent to \\"expose\\" the complicity of America, and in particular its wealthy elite, in the miserable existence of the third world poor. Expose might be the wrong word, though, since there is nary a shred of evidence to support the author's frequent and increasingly bitter claims that America is much more responsible for his character's plights, than, say, the Peruvian government or the native middle class. No, they are, as the author explains at the end, a really friendly bunch, not like those Oprah fans in hollow, cosumerist America (and bewarned -- Oprah makes an uncredited and wincingly obvious cameo). If this was to be a anti-American diatribe, it would be much more palatable with even a modicum of evidence, the lack of which speaks volumes on the depth and maturity of the author's views.So, to summarize: this book fails at both its stated purpose as a work of fiction, and at its true intent, which is to rail against America as the source of suffering in the world. And it's rife with spelling errors, to boot. Just awful."},{"Title":"Thief","review":"This was a great idea for a story. Great potential for theme and plot, etc. But the execution didn't even come close to living up to that potential. The author rambles on and on re-empasizing the same points over and over again, trying to show a theme. The plot is pretty good except that it trails off and the ending is very poor. It is very good about 2/3 through and then it becomes worthless.Now for the incredible \\"what was he thinking?\\" part: the lack of editing. I can't even beleive how sloppy this book is. There are misspelling and errors all over, and in a few parts there are crazy typos such as the letter \\"b\\" being in the middle of a sentence. What is up with that? If you're going to take the time to write and publish a book, edit it for god's sake! My guess is this thing took a couple dozen hours to write and wasn't even read though, let alone fully edited, after the writing process was done."},{"Title":"Thief","review":"This is a dreadful novel, taking a potentially intriguing situation and contorting it, through clumsy prose, inconsistent narration, and absurd melodrama, into a complete disaster.The narrative lacks any sort of authorial detachment, and we're thus bombarded with heavy-handed platitudes and insipid sermonizing--giving the characters all the depth and nuance of \\"good guys\\" and \\"bad guys\\" in an after-school special. There is a predictable reliance on cliches (the priest is a 'deranged sexual predator'; someone's head 'filled with rage'; a feeling 'swept over him'), and a discernible lack of copyediting, e.g., \\"You're very, very, dirty.\\"In short, this is the sort of effort you might expect from an eager (if not particularly talented) freshman in a high school writing program.

The thing that makes the book so interesting is that Jonjak never fails to point how how easily preventable every step along the way was.

The story is the simple and inevitable progression of a young child who is abandoned on the streets and how he develops into a brutal and horrific monster. It is a fascinating look at the creation and the nature of evil. At every step along the way the child, the adolescent, the young man that eventually becomes the thief is denied assistance by the very people he can\`t help but admire for holding the key to the understanding of morality and goodness that is forever lost to him.In \\"Thief\\" Ben Jonjak realizes much of the potential he flashed in his first work, \\"Glorious Failure.\\" \\"Thief\\" is a much darker novel and much more single-minded. It immediately brings to mind the great short works of Hemmingway and London, \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" and \\"The Call of the Wild\\", not for any thematic relationship but because the novel has the flavor of something that was constructed over a few brief nights of feverish inspiration. Though only a hundred pages, \\"Thief\\" is a satire of inestimable weight and does not shy from the unanswerable questions of morality its subject matter suggests.Of all the young writers working today I look forward to the works of Ben Jonjak above all others.

Seventeen-year-old Matt Hunter never realized that his entire world would be flipped upside down during the course of one foggy London night. Accompanying his somewhat mad father, Lord Brockton, to the docks one night, quickly turns into a nightmare. Seven years ago, Matt's mother, Lady Brockton, was brutally murdered, leaving her husband and son behind. Since that day, the financially sound Lord Brockton has spent every waking hour fanatically searching for her killer. When he feels that he has found the culprit, he lets Matt in on his little secret, but soon ends up dead himself. Now Matt, with the help of a few friends, is determined to catch the vicious murderer himself. A murderer with a deadly secret, who will do anything to keep his plans under wraps. Plans that could destroy the British empire, and the rest of the world as we know it.Being a fan of mystery and historical fiction books, I was happy to discover Mel Odom's HUNTER'S LEAGUE series. However, I never realized that A CONSPIRACY REVEALED would be so chock full of science fiction as well as the previously mentioned genres, which was quite a nice surprise. Matt is a character that will intrigue all readers, as he is mysterious; while his barrage of friends, and foes make for an exciting story filled with mechanical gargoyles, high adventure, and murder along the London streets - and below them. HUNTER'S LEAGUE is a wonderful find, as it is one of the only teen fiction series on the market right now, geared mostly towards males. An intriguing, \\"Indiana Jones\\" - like adventure that will keep the reader gripping the edge of their seat until the last page is turned - and after.Erika SoroccoBook Review Columnist for The Community Bugle Newspaper"},{"Title":"A Conspiracy Revealed (Hunter's League)","review":"This was a gift to my grandson.

He has ordered the others and is anxiously awaiting. I will definitely order more items online."},{"Title":"Party Politics in the Age of Caesar (Sather Classical Lectures)","review":"I ordered this book because I was busy drafting my own novel set in 80BC -50BC and with my lead character being an ambitious fellow from a leading Roman political family I was getting awfully frustrated trying to get to grips with the complicated mechanical workings of late Republican politics. Then I found this work, set 70BC - 50BC and I had to pinch myself for it was as if it had been written personally for me, so well did it cover everything I wanted to know. I possess many books on politics in this period but none of them impart a fraction of the knowledge this work contains within 255 pages. Yes its an old work, 1949 first printed. But it stands the test of time.The late Lily Ross Taylor in splendid easy to read prose has beautifully articulated all the facets of political life at the time of Julius Caesar. The relations of nobles to clients, the manipulation of the state religion for political purpose (for religion and lawmaking were inseparable), how Romans voted + how to get the vote in your favour and the way the various institutions/magistracies worked (or rather - were supposed to work). Finally the concept that Roman politics was not so much about \\"party\\" systems (for none existed) but forming/aligning oneself with \\"a loose aggregation of like minded associates or friends\\" to get your way.All the great names of the era and their roles and interactions are covered in painstaking detail. So many gems are uncovered. An example being the chapter \\"Cato and the Populares\\":Caesars battle with Cato. Seeking to bring Caesar to justice for in 58 BC for perceived disregard for state protocols/and irregularities with Treasury monies during his time as Consul, Caesar manipulates the Tribunate to honor Cato with a posting to Cyprus to govern a newly aquired province following the nonsensical dismissal of a King whose only \\"crime\\" was failing to pay his bribes to the right people quick enough (the Triumvirs). Cato accepts due to his unbreakable commitment to do as the state wants (though he is livid at the ruse) and Caesar staves off another threat. The book is just full of such accounts among protagonists and makes for page turning fare if you are a true Romanofile.By the time you have combed your way through this fascinating work, you will be in awe as to how anyone ever got anything worthwhile done or legislated. Anarchy, bi-partisan politics, violence, abuse of office, petty jealousy, murder, bribing, backstabbing, frontstabbing, use of marriage and divorce to improve career prospects - its all covered. By the end of the book you are left in no doubt as to why two civil wars followed and Emperor rule was established and the old Republic deserved the thumbs down. The worst modern democracy on a bad day was tame compared to this."},{"Title":"Party Politics in the Age of Caesar (Sather Classical Lectures)","review":"For those looking for a tight, readable introduction on political life in Republican Rome there is no better place to start than Lily Ross Taylor's 1949 classic, \\"Party Politics in the Age of Caesar.\\" She reviews a wide range of institutions and practices -- from religion and the law courts to voting assemblies and political campaigning -- and does so in a way made especially easy to grasp for contemporary readers, often comparing and contrasting how modern notions of political parties and religion differ from those of ancient Rome.Taylor stresses that we cannot think of modern political parties when studying the fall of the Republic. The parties were not between the patricians and the plebeians as in the early Republic, she says. Nor was it a struggle between conservative and liberal forces in the polity, although the contest often took on that form for personal reasons. The author argues that the struggles that brought about the parties were over competition between the nobles for political advancement. The resulting \\"parties\\" were in actuality alliances based on friendship and family obligations. Taylor emphasizes how personal the entire system was. She compares gaining office in the late Republic to winning an American major political party nomination at a convention (note: Taylor was writing in the 1940s when Democrats and Republicans still picked their presidential candidates in back room wheeling-and-dealing). The world of nineteenth and twentieth century American political \\"bosses\\" and \\"machines\\" would thus be very familiar to Cicero and his colleagues. As the hunt for securing the spoils of empire intensified, Taylor writes, these alliances of friendship began to harden and take on a semi-permanent nature.Taylor blames nineteenth century historian Theodor Mommsen with promoting the myth that the struggle between optimates and populares was one pitting a senatorial party against a popular democratic party. She argues that the optimates/populares conflict was an internal struggle in the noble class aimed at their own personal gain and was not at all about any notions of democracy. She maintains that the populares were, on the whole, frustrated lower level nobles who were cut out of the major spoils of empire by the older, more prestigious families. It was at the people's expense that the populares manipulated the masses to circumvent the powerful grip of a faction of high noble families in command of the powerful Senate. In theory, their differences were based on policy, but in reality, Taylor argues, is was only a difference in political means at achieving identical ends.The Roman nobility has often been compared to the British ruling class in the way they dominated government. Taylor, however, suggests that by comparison the British were much more open to new blood outside the traditional families than the Romans. Indeed, in the last 150 years of the Republic only 10 \\"new men\\" (i.e. men without Senatorial lineage in their family) rose to the consulship, and only one man did it in the last half century (93-48 BC) -- and that was Cicero. She writes that the closed political system of Republican Rome is more analogous to the ossified patriarchate of the Republic of Venice than any modern system.Perhaps the most fascinating and illuminating section of this book, at least for me, is Taylor's detailed accounting of the step ladder political game that Roman aristocrats competed in. The path to power and success was clear and to a certain extent regimented: early education consisted of history and especially public speaking; then military service began at age 17, often as a military tribune; around 20 years-old he would begin to appear in the Forum to make small speeches for his family; at 30 he would be elected quaestor, which assured membership in the Senate; after the one year term as quaestor, there was a mandatory 9 year break before he could run for praetor, during which time he would likely serve as a legate of a governor in command of some province to gain further military experience and might also run for the optional office aedlie as a way to curry favor with the masses by throwing lavish public festivals and games at personal expense; by age 39 or 40, if all had been going smoothly, he would secure one of the 8 praetorships; after that it was back to the field in a headlong rush for military glory and riches all so that he could achieve the dream of all young nobles, to be elected consul in \\"his year\\" (i.e. age 43, the minimum age for holding that office). The stakes were high and the competition intense, especially as there were only two consulships elected every year, one each reserved for noble families from the patricians and plebeians. This political cycle consumed nearly all the energy of the leading families, as they were either in the race themselves or looking to secure advancement for a son or son-in-law. It was literally what life revolved around for the several dozen families that ruled the Republic.Both sides in the ensuing civil war claimed to be fighting to preserve the old Republic. Caesar was striving to save it from the tyranny of the oligarchy; Cato from the tyranny of the demagogic despot. Despite the high flown rhetoric, Taylor says, both sides were drawn by personal loyalty and interest, not ideology. All would agree that austerity, justice and honor were the guiding principles of the Republic, but no one represented that ideal better than Cato who, both in life and in death, exemplified what all nobles held to be truly Roman.After the civil war and Caesar's murder, Augustus ascended to absolute power, instituting a Nazi-like regime, according to Taylor, but carefully cloaked in the spirit and words of his uncle's archenemy, Cato. The great Republican's legacy flourished while Caesar's wilted. He came to represent liberty and virtue, the highest ideals of the Republic. There was never a party of Cato, the author says, but rather a cult of Cato, and it had no opposition."},{"Title":"Party Politics in the Age of Caesar (Sather Classical Lectures)","review":"If you want a level of detail greater than \\"Caesar vs Senate, Caesar=tyranny, Senate=democracy,\\" then you should read this book.Taylor explains how Roman society was set up, how the various classes and groups of Roman society manifested themselves in politics, how the election cycle/balance of power sorted things out, and how politicians kept busy Monday-Friday, 8-5.Taylor offers the same level of detail on Roman Republican politics that you would get on American politics following major news outlets in an election season. He explains how Roman electoral districts were arranged and how that set up affected nominating processes and political strategies. He also walks through a typical campaign for an elected office.Taylor discusses how social and economic trends affected politics, too. For example, Rome's 34 electoral districts (similar to America's US House districts) were originally full of small-land-owning citizens in the vicinity of Rome. But, over the centuries, the farm land around Rome consolidated into large plantations, so the land-owning citizens registered in the 34 districts shrank in number and were mostly the rich nobility. Towards the end of the Roman Republic, the urban district with a gazillion people carried as much weight as the rural district with one giant plantation.If you're looking for that level of detail, I recommend this book. If you're looking for even more detail, like analysis of a particular issue in a particular election, I do not recommend this book."},{"Title":"Party Politics in the Age of Caesar (Sather Classical Lectures)","review":"I've read a lot of history and a lot of historical fiction on Rome.

Rick and Nikki are two tormented people who needs each other to face their fears and get on with their future. What I love so much about this book is that there isn't any whiny hero or heroine. These two characters are extremely well matched. If you expect to see the usual I hate you/I love you characters you won't find it here. The sex will set the sheets smokin'. Nikki a GEM gal is of course worthy of the hero. Rick is very much an alpha male but he does not just redeem himself at the end of the book the way most heros do, instead he will redeem himself as the book progesses. Nikki is fragile but suprisingly strong and never acts the victim or a wimp. People who read Suzanne Brockmann will love this book, bbbuuuuttt in my humble opinion I think that Gennita Low is even better. Why do I say this considering that Suzanne Brockmann (whom I enjoy a lot too) is the queen of the men in uniforms also known as the tall,dark, and dangerous genre? Unlike a Brockmann book where I wish sometimes for more love scenes, more action, more romance, more this or that, I find that Gennita Low is able to maintain a balance on all the things I want. Nothing is sacrificed and that is incredibly hard for an author to do, and this is only her second book!! The first book INTO DANGER was more lighthearted and playful. FACING FEAR is even hotter than the first book, but it is much much darker. It deals more with the psychology of the human psyche. There is a surprising twist at the end and it will be revealed in one of the most touching scene. This book is just excellent. I can't stand waiting another year for Gennita Low's next book to be out."},{"Title":"Facing Fear","review":"Facing Fear is the follow up book to Into Danger by new author Gennita Low.Nikki Taylor is a woman of mystery.

Nikki and Rick are a couple that have to overcome a lot to have a future.Gennita Low is an auto-buy for me. I am looking forward to the next book in this wonderful series."},{"Title":"Facing Fear","review":"I stand in awe of Gennita Low's talent to weave this tale and take me on such a fast pace complex journey. Facing Fear is a contemporary romantic suspense book that could be considered a sequel to her first book Into Danger, although it certainly can stand on its own. Not for the faint of heart nor is it a book for those who aren't willing to explore the psyche. This book is an incredibly edgy and darkly sensual love story. It is a fascinating dichotomy, complicated and tantalizing. The pace is generally fast but it is a labyrinth of dark delights and introspection, at times much like a lasciviously performed dance, a slow strip tease of the senses. She has the talent to slow down the pace when it is needed in order to fully explore and experience the depths and fullness of her characters without causing the story to lag.Normally when I get a new book I inhale it in a nonstop read, then I go back and reread it. Many times reading a romantic suspense book is similar to a fast food meal for me. It is satisfying, filling and I enjoy it while I am consuming it but I don't think too deeply about what I am actually eating and I don't spend a lot of time at the table. This book is like a multiple course gourmet meal served in a four star restaurant with a darkly sensual ambience. You'll savor and ponder each course and its presentation while still eagerly awaiting the unveiling of the next dish. There is a very thoughtful chess game being played out on many levels throughout the book. The hero and heroine are full and complex, introspective and not always comfortably so; both are \\"darkly tortured\\" characters. They are strong yet incomplete without the other in a fundamental way. Rick Harden is an extremely sexual alpha male. At times he will make the reader uncomfortable but at the same time he makes you want to capitulate and explore his dark appetites. Nikki Taylor is a fascinating woman whom only another woman would have the insight to balance and draw in a manner that works. This book illustrates beautifully why Gennita Low is a rising star in the Romantic Suspense genre. I can't wait for all the other characters she has created to have their own stories!"},{"Title":"Facing Fear","review":"I just finished Gennita Low's entire series. If you love international espionage, edge of your seat action, and love scenes that will fog your glasses, then this series for you. I will say if I had to pick a favorite, this one was it. She weaves a tale of lost & found love against a backdrop of Washington DC. Her characters are strong, witty, and can kick [...]if need be.You also need to visit her website [...] where she gives you background on the characters & missions, as well as some really NICE photos of her Navy SEALS.I love to read serial novels. I enjoy the character and relational development that cannot be perfected in the frame of one novel. I am looking forward to the next one. Don't keep us hanging too long Gennita.Also recommended Cindy Gerard's \\"Bodyguard\\" series, Carla Neggers."},{"Title":"Facing Fear","review":"I enjoyed Gennita Low's debut novel, Into Danger, a sexy, fast-paced romp in covert ops and spy games. While Facing Fear doesn't have the same sassy attitude, it more than compensates with a powerful emotional punch that lingers long after the spy games are done. The suspense is solid, with a fascinating inside look at how bureaucracy drives intelligence ops, but this story seethes with the power of its two major characters whose unflappable exteriors mask two tortured souls. I especially enjoyed the way the author incorporated an element of Asian mysticism-- it really sets this book apart. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Facing Fear","review":"This book was excellent but have to admit I read these books out of sequence.Into Danger should have led into Facing fear but I ended up reading the last one next which was the Hunter.It should have been The Protecter. I still like her leading into the next book at the end of each book and have enjoyed all of them although I managed to mix them up.She manages to bring the main characters together very nicely at the end of each story,with you wanting to know what happens to some of the secondary characters. I hope we find out what happens to Cam and Patty and Also will Alex ever capture T. as she has avoided him in almost every book ,Wonder too, if Jed will ever meet his match. Hopefully a lady will come along and knock his socks off as he is so full of himself."},{"Title":"Facing Fear","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever had the pleasure of reading. Ms. Low is able to pull her readers into her stories and make them emotionally involved. Her first book Into Danger was spectacular and this one was no disappointment. Her characters are so realistic and her plots are exetremely developed. She is able to combine a love story and a spy mystery into one book without losing the readers interest. Ms. Low is a break through author. However, she has capture me as an avid reader and fan for the rest of her writing career! Her characters are hot and her love scenes are hotter. She is on a level parallel to Linda Howard and Christine Feehan! I can't wait for the next one!"},{"Title":"Facing Fear","review":"This is the second book by this author and I have to say, I loved this book. Her (Gennita Low) first book was a keeper also. There was a twist in the middle of the book that I did not see coming. I won't spoil it here. Rick Harden has had a hard time of it to say the least. He lost his wife (Operative/Spy) ten years ago in an assignment and has been trying to come to terms with it since then. Rick is a great hero. Not all good. Some nice edges. Rick has been trying to piece together the details of his wife's capture and death for years. In the meantime, his boss has been selling out his country and though he is behind bars, he is creating havoc for those who knew him. Enter ex-operative Nikki. Resembles Rick's ex-wife...working for an Admiral to try and find out what Rick really know about his boss's deception. There are twists and turns and a hauntingly beautiful love story. I highly recommend this book. By the way, thanks Ms. Low for finally giving us an Asian heroine and a genuine two-dimensional hero."},{"Title":"Facing Fear","review":"As the Chief of Operations for the CIA Tiara Task Force Two, Ricardo Harden knows that Internal Investigations (Eyes) will look closely at his activities since arresting his superior Gorman for treason. Though he is innocent, he realizes he will be the fall guy and probably deserves to be so as he ignored signs of sedition so he could be the safe bureaucrat.Nikki Taylor is assigned to investigate Rick, but not for \\"Eyes\\". Admiral Madison wants to know if Rick would make a good chief of Tiara. Nick is stunned because Nikki looks like his wife who vanished during an operation ten years ago. As they make love and fall in love, he hides a secret about his wife that ended his career that he will never reveal while she has even more clandestine confidential information about who she really is.FACING FEAR is an engaging espionage romance that emphasizes the internal politics of protecting your butt when scandal happens. The Agency looks bad as it prefers to ignore a potential monstrous flaw in its process in order to find a scapegoat so that the higher ups in government remain untainted (perhaps that is why the real life leak of the agent's name last Spring still remains unresolved in spite of the President's public desires). The story line contains major twists that will shock readers yet seems apropos because the lead couple make it believable. Fans of terse internal affairs CIA tales with a strong romantic underpinning will enjoy soaring with Gennita Low's fine taut thriller.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Facing Fear","review":"With all due respect to the other reviewers on this site, I have to desagree with their assessment of this book. I found it dragging and very repetitious. How many times did I have to read about what the bad guys did to the heroin? She keeps on coming back to that over and over again as though there was a chance that the reader had forgotten her ordeal. The author repeats herself too much and it almost becomes condescending. I'm not an idiot and I do not hava a short-term memory and I do tend to remember what happened 10 to 50 pages earlier in the book, so I would appreciate not being talked down to in this way.The only reason I gave 2 stars is because the first quarter of the book was alright. However, after the hero found out who the heroin really was, it just went down from there and I was skimming the pages more often than not. Frankly, by the end I didn't care who the bad guys were, I just wanted to be done with the whole thing.Not recommended."},{"Title":"Facing Fear","review":"I really enjoyed Gennita Low's first novel \\"INTO DANGER\\", but this one was not anywhere near the same level. I felt absolutely no sympathy for the character's emotions. The sex scenes were like page fillers that seemed overdone after the first few times. The suspense started out fine and then just lingered with the same question for most of the book until it just started going down, down, down. I was so bored near the end that I had a difficult time finishing it. It was wordy, repetitious and did absolutely nothing for me. I was really hoping for more from this new author. I read in another review someone mentioning how Ms. Low's writing got better for this novel. I guess if you are really fascinated with all the boring bureaucratic mumbo jumbo than you will be captivated by this book. The premise for this story was intriguing, but never quite lived up to its potential. I hope her other books are better than this one. The contrast between the first and the second are night and day."},{"Title":"Facing Fear","review":"I did read several reviews before I invested my $5.99, and being a bit of a sucker for amnesia plot, I went ahead. But this is Erotica - complete with bondage and battery-operated sex toys, which isn't my cuppa, so I feel it my responsibility to let other unsuspecting readers know. What's weird is that the non-Erotica parts are actually pretty good. Having said that, as other reviewers noted, MANY MANY points are reiterated over and over, as if the readers can't keep a thought in their heads, which is annoying. And yes the plot is far-reaching, but that's okay for me, books are escapes. But I never really grew to like the hero. He starts as a terrible person you wouldn't wish on any heroine, and then he gets a bit of redemption, then he gets all creepy and unredeemable again. Then you think you've reached the end, but no, there's more. So you slog along, then you think, oh, here's where it ends, but wait...there's even yet more. There were probably four logical ending points but the story continues to bring in more and more. Like others I starting skipping pages (the Chinese Grandmother flash backs in particular because after about halfway through I realized they don't add anything to the plot - the three \\"lessons\\" and the rest is more sort of reflexive author posturing.) But the plot does take a lot of unseen twists and turns and did keep me reading. Overall, because you sort of get sucker-punched with the bondage etc, I can't recommend it."},{"Title":"Facing Fear","review":"Gennita Low's books are usually excellent reads; I've read a lot of her books. However, there was something about this book that had me skipping pages -- I was getting so SICK and TIRED of the \\"poor me\\" Leah/Nikki saga that I just started flippin' pages (which is so not like me; it just seemed like the same earth was plowed over and over and over), so I must say that this book wasn't one of the better books I've read by this author. I have read the whole series of books before this book and I really like the characters this author has developed in the series. I have a feeling another book about Cam/Patty Ostler is in the works (because I don't think we ever found out what truly happened to those young, budding lovers; other than they're in a crate somewhere, someplace, out there....) *Hope those were not the pages I flipped.Having said the above, it took me a long time to finish this book. The storyline was somewhat far-fetched -- How come Nikki/Leah could remember everything her grandmother told her about chuung, ghosts and frozen hearts as a kid but couldn't remember other things? -- it just -- wow, the plot just drug on and on, and there was so much information thrown in this whole mix; I wonder if the writing partner didn't do most of the writing and was just supervised by Ms. Low. I hope I am wrong about that because it really, really honks me off when an author gives up their name for others to write behind. Case in point: James Patterson (author de jour or whoever needs a leg up at the time) and Sherrilyn Kenyon (Diana Love)."},{"Title":"Facing Fear","review":"OK, I tried with this author, but obviously we just don't mesh well. The first book I barely got through, but I thought I give her 2nd book a try. No such luck. I couldn't even finish it. If a book does not grab my attention by the first 100 pages, I'm not wasting my time. I can't really describe why I didn't like it, except that I just could not get into the book to save my life. I think the book has all the necessary ingredients, it just didn't flow very well to me. Sorry to say, I'm done trying."},{"Title":"Facing Fear","review":"This was the first time I've read anything from Gennita Low. Frankly, I thought the entire storyline was ridiculous and far reaching. I know everyone wants to strike out at the government, CIA, FBI or whatever, but this storyline didn't even make me believe that this could happen. I kept hoping it would get better as I read the book but the author kept repeating key events over and over again. Can a person really NOT know who they were for 10 years? The hero was described as being some God in the bedroom who could go for hours and hours and satisfy ANY woman he was with. He's basically a pig who used and abused women shamelessly and then tossed them out after he was through. The heroine only got her memory back once she had some hot sex with her ex-husband??? Oh please!! I didn't care for any of the book .... the storyline, hero, heroine or supporting characters. I will not read any more from this author unless it's outside the scope of this series."},{"Title":"Facing Fear","review":"This is my first from Gennita Low. I was so enthusiastic to read it because of glossy reviews. What a disappointment... This is a US government suspense. Consequently, the main idea was good in the beginning. The factor of ethnic flavour (the heroin is Asian) is also something new in this genre.[...] Ms Low repeats every single detail so many times that that made me almost thrown up. After some time I gave up counting to read how many times the bad guys tortured, raped etc. the heroin. How can it be possible to have operated perfectly after what happened her skin, face, body? Plastic surgery has lots of limitations Ms. Low.Actually I found the heroin totally dumbfounded. The hero is irritating and his fetish about long long hair is gross.Is it really possible if a person really is unaware of herself throughout 10 years and then remembers everything in bed with her \\"husband\\"?This book needs a good editing, but it is too late. Normally Avon is quite precise in this matters, perhaps they were in a hurry. Despite what I wrote, I am planning to give this author another try, maybe I will order her first or next work. I hope she improves herself in writing, as I mentioned before she has some great ideas.[...]"},{"Title":"Facing Fear","review":"Yeah, this book may be a bit &quot;darker&quot; than Gennita Low's first book, &quot;FACING DANGER&quot;, but boy-oh-boy is it good! It has plenty of plot twists to keep the reader on the edge of their sofa - - and enough HOT love scenes to require the ceiling fan on HIGH for the whole book.And just when you think you can't find anything hotter than the pearls scene in the last book - - Ms. Low discovers a whole new use for seatbelts.Yeah, it's a keeper. Trust me, read it with someone YOU love! (They'll be sending thank you cards to Ms. Low too!)"},{"Title":"Facing Fear","review":"Ms. Low is fast becoming one of my favorite suspense romance authors!!! Her fast paced, steamy romance, and page turning suspense are not your typical suspense type read. Ms. Low combines, spy action, spy suspense, and yummy hero's in such a way you will be hard pressed to put the book down until you've reach the final page! I can only say that I am waiting not so patiently for her next read!In &quot;Facing Fear&quot; Nikki our heroine is working toward finding her past. All she knows was that she was a government agent that was left behind during a mission gone bad. She has very little memory of who she was and as a result, has made a deal to do one more mission with the end result being she finds out who she really is. This seems like an easy task but there are many challenges, and fears that she must face. One is CIA Operations Chief Rick Harden. She has a connection to him but how?Rick is under a microscope yet again. His boss has just been captured selling government secrets, an undercover SEAL agent has been responsible for finding the mole in the TIARA office. Rick is saavy enough to realize that he will also be considered a possible leak. Now not only does he have to decide if he wants to do anything to salvage what's left of his career, he now finds himself drawn to Nikki the one person he knows it out to get him...but how? Nikki strongly reminds him of his dead wife and she has touched him in such a way that he begins to feel protective of her. This could only mean more trouble.This was as I stated earlier a very fast-paced read. There are so many twists and turns that you have no real idea who the traitor is until the end. Rick is beyond your typical tall, dark, and yummy hero and is a real treat for readers as a result. The chemistry between Rick and Nikki is explosive and hot! If you love edge of your seat reading do yourself a favor and pick up Ms. Low!!!"},{"Title":"Facing Fear","review":"I have read most of the reviews on the book by other customers.I agree that the book did have a bit of repetitive concerning the trauma that Leah/Nikki endured as a prisoner of war. Which is why is it four stars versus five stars. But I also believe that was the crux of the story. Leah/Nikki coming to terms with who she was and had become. It is a story about her coming back from a horrendous experiences and finding love again - with her husband who after 10 years still held a torch for her, dreamed about her, and loved her.I imagine it depends on what someone is looking for in a book. I, for one, recommend this book to people that have enjoyed her other books or books by Suzanne Brockmann. But be aware, there is less military drama and more espionage."},{"Title":"Facing Fear","review":"We met Rick Harden in Ms. Low's first book, Into Danger. In this book the fallout from the arrest of his boss almost buries him. Nikki Taylor is the woman assigned to investigate Rick - not only to see if he was involved in his former boss's activities, but to evaluate his potential as a leader for Tiara. The only problem? Although Nikki looks nothing like her, she acts just like Harden's ex-wife Leah who died 10 years before.The characters in this book are so intriguing. Rick, a character I didn't particularly like from Into Danger, is turned into a hero to die for. Nikki, the first Asian heroine I've ever read, is mystical and mysterious. Together they are hot!I recommend the book highly!"},{"Title":"Facing Fear","review":"Great book. Loads of suspense. A complicated plot that holds you interest and great romance. I love Gennita Low's books."},{"Title":"Facing Fear","review":"Low's second novel has a less complicated but tighter plot and I thought it much better than Into Danger. The (...) is still beyond steamy but now it is part of the plot and not laminated on because \\"that's what you do\\". Nikki has lost years out of her life, reconstructed from data but not from the memories she carries with her. Her capture and degrading torture, her rescue and recovery-- these are classic themes of the genre. Also, Nikki's memories of her grandmother's teachings were central to her recovery and really gave a necessary ethnic flavor. Regaining her husband and re-establishing trust - a great read, and would have been without all the bedroom action. And Low leaves the door open for a sequel with ancillary characters. I'll be watching for the next one."},{"Title":"Facing Fear","review":"Very good author: My advice is to read everything Gennita Low has written. I was not disappointed in any one I read"},{"Title":"Facing Fear","review":"this book was just great. Lots of your sexy and real life hidden secrets of the US. Speaks of different agencies and what goes on and of course you will always have those who double cross the United States. But all eventually get caught. Loved it."},{"Title":"Facing Fear","review":"I enjoy reading books that are part of a series. I absolutely loathe having to re-read what I read two books ago to explain the current one. Ms. Low is able to introduce threads that faintly whisper of a future character development without explicitly saying when or how: we are left with the expectation. The character then is rewarded with his (or her) own story and all those &#34;I wonder why&#34;s, and &#34;huum&#34;s we experienced when we first met them are hinted at, pulling you in like the fly to the spider.All the elements of an exciting read happen: danger, romance, drama, and sex. The difference between Gennita Low and most authors of the military &#34;danger, romance, drama, and sex&#34; variety is that each story is different, not a cookie cutter version of the initial book in the series with a change of name of the characters. And, since I happened to just pick a title when I first read Ms. Low, I can pretty much guarantee that whether you read the different stories forward, or decide to dig out the stories prior to one you are reading, they stand alone.Thank you Ms. Low."},{"Title":"Facing Fear","review":"Love all the Gennita Low books. Loved how all the stories from each book tie together with each other. Doesn't matter which one you read first!! They all make sense in the end."},{"Title":"A backward glance","review":"In this orderly collection of autobiographical sketches Edith Wharton - generously and with nearly photographic recall - begins by inviting readers into her early life in nineteenth-century New York. We are treated to its cast of characters, old New York, country life up the Hudson River, the clothes, the houses, and the remarkable (and unremarkable) personalities - Washington Irving was a friend of the family - as well as the sensibilities of a sociable, bright, and wonderfully observant little girl.Edith began to read so early that it surprised her upper-class (but unintellectual) family. Before long she became an &quot;omnivorous reader,&quot; happiest plowing through the volumes of the classics in her father's library. She soon found that she required time alone - to invent characters, to make up stories. She knew that she had to write fiction - from childhood on, despite realizing by young adulthood that &quot;in the eyes of our provincial society authorship was still regarded as something between a black art and a form of manual labor.&quot; Of the social imperative to closet one's writing urges she elaborates: &quot;My father and mother were only one generation away from Sir Walter Scott, who thought it necessary to drape his literary identity in countless clumsy subterfuges, and almost contemporary with the Brontes, who shrank in agony from being suspected of successful novel-writing.&quot; The idle rich, Wharton makes clear, were intended to stay idle - and not busy themselves with writing, especially for (horrors!) pay. Her descriptions of her early popular successes are memorable.In subsequent chapters Wharton lays out her well-thought-out opinions regarding childhood, self-discovery, the formation of the writer's imagination and intellect, and the importance of finding one's own way - as an intellectual and as a social being. There is dry humor, too. She treasured good literature and good conversation - and pursued (and found) them throughout her life. She loved beautiful things and places, too. Finally, she describes her sojourns abroad (mainly England, France, and Italy) and the relationships and places that sustained her and nurtured her creativity, her productivity - and her soul.Lifelong friends play a central role in much of this memoir. She describes people well, without breaches of privacy or confidences. This is not at all limiting. She writes tenderly of the blossoming of her friendship with &quot;American gentleman&quot; Egerton Winthrop, a man of &quot;cultivated intelligence,&quot; a shy, physically awkward man whom Wharton considered &quot;the most perfect of friends.&quot; Others were George Cabot Lee, Vernon Lee, Howard Sturgis, Geoffrey Scott, Percy Lubbock, and most of all, Henry James, who is drawn wonderfully (and not uncritically) in this book. Of her friendship with James she remarks &quot;The real marriage of two minds is for any two people to possess a sense of humor or irony pitched in exactly the same key, so that their joint glances at any subject cross like interarching search-lights.&quot;I loved this memoir, and greatly admired Wharton's ability to reveal herself and her world so fully and well."},{"Title":"A backward glance","review":"Such a lovely child, so patient and well behaved. New York and its society are made magic by her eyes. The opening sections of this memoir are a delight as Mrs. Wharton recounts the sights and feel of New York City in the 1870's. I liked it that she gave us a knee-high view of taking a walk with her beloved father and meeting his friends along the way. (She could never tell what the people's faces looked like, as her view only extended to their knees). Her total recall of her very best bonnet is amazing, and a very pretty bonnet it must have been.If there is such a person as a \\"born writer,\\" Edith Wharton is that person. Before she could write, she made stories, and situations \\"flew around her head like mosquitoes.\\" The world she lived in had no place or interest in a writing lady, so she made her own world, and it was a life-long undertaking.When Mrs. Wharton received her first acceptance of publication, she was so excited she \\"ran up and down the staircase in glee.\\" I couldn't have been more surprised if I had read that George Washington played kickball in the back yard. Mrs. Wharton rarely lets you see anything but a very reserved and proper Victorian lady. Yet she did get a divorce (though it is never mentioned.), she lived almost her entire adult life abroad; she compartmentalized her friends like a butterfly collector, and had no interest in being part of the New York society she describes so well. When she was well into her writing career on a family visit to New York, she was invited to a dinner party where she was told a \\"Bohemian\\" would be one of the guests. When she got there, she discovered that she herself was the \\"Bohemian\\" in question.The book has a wonderful introduction by that fine author of New York manners, Louis Auchincloss, who is obviously fond of Mrs. Wharton, but not intimidated. Mrs. Wharton has a couple of insightful (and often hilarious) chapters on Henry James that are alone worth the price of the book. But then there are the \\"friends.\\" I felt I was being buried in endless pages of formal introductions to people I had never heard of, who wrote books that were never read, who gave parties which are long forgotten, and men who were great conversationalists according to Mrs. Wharton, though the witticisms she quoted were so arch and refined, I felt they belonged in bad drawing room comedy.The book reads well, except for the stretches of introductions. Mrs. Wharton firmly believes that if you can't speak well of someone, you shouldn't speak of him or her at all. Not a bad idea at that"},{"Title":"A backward glance","review":"Edith Wharton wrote &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot; (I believe it won the Pulitzer), the only fiction she wrote that I have truly liked--and an excellent book. She also wrote much nonfiction, and I have enjoyed her travel writing very much.In this book, Ms. Wharton reflects on her childhood and adulthood to middle age. (A short biography of her life is included in the introduction by Louis Auchincloss.) She speaks of her parents and growing up in 'Old New York' and living on the Gold Coast of New England with her husband.Ms. Wharton was a great friend of several men of letters who were prominent during her era, including Henry James. Her writing describes these relationships in part. She may have had an affair with one of them (not James), but unlike writers of today, more is not said than said. Mrs. Wharton divorced her husband in an era when it was not the best thing to do if one wished to remain a member of high society. She seems to have cast off New York society and moved to France to live permantly after her divorce. If you're interested in the story behind the story in &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot; this book is a good resource.In addition to her early years in America and later years in France, this book covers some of Ms. Wharton's travels in France and the Mediterranean. The most evocative sections cover her experiences in a trip to the French front in WWI. During WWI, she became a reporter and sent information to a New York newspaper on a regular basis."},{"Title":"A backward glance","review":"This autobiography which really gives a feel for the times in, which Wharton lived as well as for her own life experiences, contains some the most stunningly succinct annecdotes I've ever read. Wharton is truly brilliant at conveying the importance of literature in her life and sharing the possibilities of the literary life with her reader. She reaches through time to inform us of universals and redefine our value systems without being the least bit pedantic. She is a genius. And her autobiography is as entertaining and resonant as a great novel."},{"Title":"A backward glance","review":"If you like autobiographies or memoirs by literate, intriguing, strong women, you should enjoy this one by Edith Wharton. She was born in 1862. Her father was a Jones, the family that inspired the \\"keeping up with the Jones's' expression. She had a privileged childhood living in New York City, traveling in Europe for 5 years between the ages of 4 and 9 years of old, and spending summers in Newport. She was friends with Teddy Roosevelt. Her ancestors mingled with the founding members of America so it's fun to read about her family stories.As a published writer, Wharton wrote novels, short stories and non-fiction and was one of the first American writers on interior design. Her 1897 book THE DECORATION OF HOUSES is considered a classic in the field of interior design. She is one of America's first interior designers. In 1905 her novel, HOUSE OF MIRTH, was the best-selling book for the year. Her novel THE AGE OF INNOCENCE earned the Pulitzer Prize in 1921. She is the first woman writer to receive the Pulitzer award and she also received an honorary doctorate from Yale.Living overseas in France as an adult, Wharton met a mix of fascinating people who populate this book. Her friendship with Henry James, and insights on the man, is worth reading this autobiography alone for. When James died, Wharton wrote: \\"We who knew him well know how great he would have been if he had never written a line.\\"If you like examining an era through the lens of one person's life and perspective, this is like time-travel back to the gilded age and the early years of the 20th century. Wharton died in France in 1937. Her autobiography doesn't include all of the elements of her life: a divorce and love affairs. It's said that what was left out is as interesting as what Wharton chose to include. Writers then were more discreet and genteel about personal affairs, but her cosmopolitan and cultured glance is not provincial.What is fascinating about Wharton, is that although many of her heroines in her novels were passive and tragic (Lily Bart, for example in HOUSE OF MIRTH who eventually commits suicide because of the lack of options for women who were dependent on men), Wharton herself was proactive and positive about creating a fulfilling life for herself. Perhaps it was her family fortune and monies from writing which enabled her options which her heroines didn't have. Their lot which was more usual for women of that era which Wharton was trying to highlight in her novels.This is one of my favorite autobiographies, almost novel-like, and would be a fascinating and literate selection for a book club discussion. It would be enlightening to take a class based upon the autobiographies of women writers and artists and compare and contrast influences and inspiration among them."},{"Title":"A backward glance","review":"Although billed as an autobiography, it is more appropriately called a memoir. Full of name-dropping and vignettes, it is delightful. It bogs down a bit with all she writes about Henry James. I particularly enjoyed her comments on World War I. I wish she had written more.Most difficult for Edith, I imagine was not being able to write about Morton.She must have been quite a woman."},{"Title":"A backward glance","review":"Edith Wharton's autobiography was moving and reveals a very modern woman living in times that were more modern than I have ever supposed. Friends with Henry James and royalty, Miss Wharton seemed to live a charmed life even through war when she gave selflessly. Another living testimony to enjoying the freedoms and fruits of the labors one sows."},{"Title":"A backward glance","review":"Unfortunately, A Backward Glance was a disappointment. I love the way Edith Wharton writes, but in her autobiography she was dry. I only read only a quarter of the book and then put it down. It's hard to get through. I don't know if I can pick it up again. I would actually like to send it back, mainly because it was an expensive book; more than I usually pay."},{"Title":"Feminization of America: How Womens Values Are Changing Our Public and Private Lives","review":"\\"The Feminization of America\\" by Elinor Lenz and Barbara Myerhoff examines in accurate detail the cultural benefits to humanity of key female traits. The book forms the basis for a perspective that goes one step beyond feminism. It sets the guidelines for what can be termed Radical Feminism.Whilst feminism seeks gender equality, Radical Feminism recognizes that there are significant differences in the basic approaches of women and men. The testosterone that appears to control male instincts leads to competition, confrontation, and violence. Women, on the other hand, are born with a basic instinct to nurture - their own children as well as those around them. They a far more prone than males to seek constructive compromise.Women can thus be far more talented at negotiation and interacting with others in a constructive rather than a destructive manner. For this reason, in major areas of world interaction, women would make superior managers - in politics, in business, and in religion.This book points out specifically how critical a feminine approach to religion could prove to the on-going future of the world. It points out how the anthropomorphic attribution of male characteristics to the Divinity have led to inter-religious strife down the ages. Recognizing the feminine aspects of the Divinity would lead to a better world.This book was originally published in 1985, and is in great need of a reprint! It is a true service to world culture that Amazon.com has made this book available."},{"Title":"The Universe Makers: Science Fiction Today","review":"Wollheim's the man. He charts a history of SF's major developments by profiling the contributions of the genre's giants, from Verne and Wells down to the author's own contemporaries (Heinlein, etc.) and also shows some of the challenges to which SF must respond -- namely overpopulation, pollution and the threat of nuclear war.

In spite of the intuitive appeal of these ideas, in too many organizations managers have a hard time applying them practically and measuring their results. This book directly addresses these issues in a manner that is both accessible and practical. To be sure, many more articles and books will be written on this subject; this one, however, should stand the test of time because of its usefulness to managers who actually have to implement these ideas and live with their results."},{"Title":"The Path of Mysticism","review":"\\"Mystical Christianity\\" by Chris Lindsay is, I feel, a sincere attempt to justify one's move away from the Church to go further inward toward God. This thin volume of 50 pages should not be considered a comprehensive treatise, but one man's list of reasons to look deeper than his church. Recognizing the greatness of one's need for God and the insufficiency of consensus forms of public worship to answer his need, is the seminal step in making a \\"mystic.\\" The \\"mystic\\" simply knows he must go deeper than others do, yet the mystic will soon realize that his private path is just that--meant for himself and not for all others. There could be no institutionalizing of mysticism or else you would only be inventing yet another religious tradition. (I wish there was some word here other than \\"mystical\\" to describe the inner art and worship one attempts in order to practice a deeper faith than those around him. The word is fast becoming iconical itself--antimystical.)Eugene O'Neill's wonderful line comes to mind, \\"We are born broken. We live by mending. The grace of God is glue.\\" The true grace we all need is always administered by God Himself to each individual privately and is not received in a congregation. Lindsay's book points this out, yet far too much effort was put into denouncing organized religion. Though this is sometimes a necessary step for those new to a private path to God, the first and last lesson of anyone on this path is always Love, which prefers rejoicing in Truth over whining against preceived error. As Emerson encourages us, \\"Don't be a cynic and disconsolate preacher. Don't bewail and bemoan. Omit the negative propositions. Nerve us with incessant affirmatives. Don't waste yourself in rejection, nor bark against the bad, but chant the beauty of the good.\\" Lindsay may yet find a future need along his spiritual path to return to the Church he now rejects as he spirals wherever the Spirit leads him.If one has been steeped in a traditional religion most of their lives, the first step away from it and deeper into God always feels like a betrayal. To overcome that sense of betrayal one must make his long list of justifications, much like Martin Luther, in order to give himself permission to do what he feels is more authentic to his Soul. And following one's Soul is what the \\"mystical\\" path is all about--supplanting the authority of the Church with the authority of the Soul. But to spend much time denouncing what others hold so adamantly, particularly when it was an earlier, seminal belief of one's own, is similar to a middle school student making fun of an elementary school student. One simply has to go through each stage of their development.The sticking point is when one sees another struggling in the elementary school under the confining belief that there is no higher school. But that very struggle is the effort required in the Soul to make a \\"mystic.\\" A simple metaphor here describes what we sometimes unwisely desire to do: a child of a farmer sees the emerging chick struggling to get out of its shell and compassionately wants to help it break its confinement. But if she does, the chick soon dies because it was exactly that struggle to get out of the shell that would have strengthened the chick sufficiently to live. Those who struggle in their particular religions with traditions, doctrines and practices that are spiritually anemic, or that offend the Soul, are meant to feel offended, are meant to look deeper. Their discontent drives them to their depths where God is found never to have left them in the first place to reside solely in scriptures, chapels, ordinances and priesthoods, but ever residing in one's heart, though little noticed. I believe this revelation is meant to be a personal experience, never forced, and perhaps not even pointed out. Yet each life finds some exemplar who give suggestions and gleams. But to reveal an entire system is just to make another religion, albeit subterranean, under the foundation of our earlier religious system. Lindsay is correct in pointing out that systems don't save us, yet every layer of spiritual education we go through leads us to the next deeper layer as the growth rings of a tree exhibit the latest one subsuming each earlier ring of progress. Erasing our history might erase those lessons learned. All things reveal God, even indirection.Eric Hoffer tells us, \\"The craving to change the world is perhaps a reflection of the craving to change ourselves....Our quarrel with the world is an echo of the endless quarrel proceeding within us. The revolutionary agitator must first start a war in every soul before he can find recruits for his war with the world.\\" Though Chris tells us long and hard why we don't need an organized Church, his book is weak in telling us why we need a more personal God than the Church can give us. His wonderful idea of walking and talking in the Spirit could have been fleshed out with greater explanation of the disciplines involved in \\"mystical Christianity\\" and the war we fight within to raise our pitiful selves toward God.Weaknesses notwithstanding, I nonetheless applaud Lindsay's genuine effort, moral courage and sincerity. His book will likely not cause a great stir, as disinterested others will only view him as misguided or heretical, yet there will be those few who will be drawn to his book as but another expression of the depths of the Soul. Though it may appear to some that Lindsay has offended the work of God, his book does not offend the Soul that ever leads to God. All our answers are within. We are our own bibles. Said William Law: \\"The pearl of eternity is the Church or Temple of God within thee, the consecrated place of divine worship, where alone thou canst worship God in spirit and in truth....When once thou art well grounded in this inward worship, thou wilt have learned to live unto God above time and place. For every day will be the Sabbath to thee, and wherever thou goest thou wilt have a priest, a church, and an altar within thee.\\" Inward, Ho!"},{"Title":"The Path of Mysticism","review":"I was impressed with Lindsay's approach to this book. I felt that he supported his arguements well, and did his best not to offend those people he disagreed with. Lindsay states his ideas about Christianity clearly and succinctly, and has clearly reached some kind of personal breakthrough based on what he talks about in the book. Lindsay's parables, while not astounding, make their points well and are useful to help move the book towards its conclusion. I would recommend this book for anyone looking for another way of viewing Christianity beyond simple blind obedience. I do have a few complaints about the book.I wish it was longer, because I get the feeling that Lindsay had more to say than he actually wrote. I would have liked to see some more scholarly comparisons between Lindsays Mystical brand of Christianity and what he calls Fundamental Chrsitianity. I would also have enjoyed more history about the Bible and its authors or additional history of Christian Mysticism in general, but the book works without these topics.In the end the book keeps its focus tight on Lindsay's own personal revelations and how they changed his understanding of Christianity. On that subject the book succeeds admirably. Should the book ever be updated though, I would love to see the sections that I mention included."},{"Title":"The Path of Mysticism","review":"Kudos to the author for having the courage to challenge the long standing authority of the pulpit. I can understand the need to contanstly explain that this is not written as an attack against fundamental christianity, as many would see it that way. When did faith become a belief in a ridgid system with egos and the need for authority instead of the simple truths uttered from a man....I say a prayer for people willing to step outside the proverbial box western religion has placed us in with no room for those who would think for themselves and question our beleifs, they need support, not dissaproval."},{"Title":"Village England","review":"A wonderful journey through all of the most delightful places in England.

This book had to be written exactly because other writers have not been willing to examine all dimensions of Woolf's death. Hurray for Alma Bond for applying her psychoanalist's expertise on this literary/historical subject!"},{"Title":"Who Killed Virginia Woolf?: A Psychobiography","review":"Virginia Woolf, born to Leslie and Julie Stephen in 1862, came into a world that was stacked against her chances of emotional success. Both her parents and close family members had emotional problems she could not avoid. This background formed a vital part in preventing Virginia from forming a close bond with her mother. The result of this was that she suffered from unresolved emotional problems for the rest of her life.All of her life, Virginia found herself immersed in the world of art and literature. Her father was considered by many to be her mentor in nurturing her talent at an early age. Leonard, her husband, protected her against outside pressure that most writers face from critics, editors and the like. Her lover, Vita Sackville - West, she was the conduit to allow Virginia's genius to reach its peak. Woolf always needed the help of others to survive.Virginia ran into problems at the two most important stages of a child's emotional development. They are known as Symbiosis and the Rapprochement stages. If the infant experiences any breakdown in these processes, the consequences can be severe and last a lifetime.Symbiosis occurs between the first to fifth month of a child's existence. It is the stage of sociobiological interdependence between mother and child. Rapprochment occurs around the age of two, where the child seeks to be reunited with the mother, after finding the outside world too hard to cope with. When Virginia wanted to be reunited with her mother, her mother was not available to her. This inability to be as one with her mother affected Virginia all of her life. It led her to be constantly plagued by alternating states of mania and depression.The Stephen and Woolf family members had a repetitive behavior pattern. They only gave to others a little of themselves, to ensure they would not lose part of themselves. It did not occur to them that by allowing a part of themselves to be consumed by another being, in a caring and sharing relationship, that this would not destroy their self. Indeed it would strengthen their belief in themselves and make them a more emotionally robust person, to take on and conquer what the world might throw at them.Virginia Woolf wrote: \\"Every secret of a writer's soul, every experience of his life, every quality of his mind, is written in his works.\\"Doctor Alma Bond believes that this is indeed true of the works of Virginia Woolf. The writer's internal anguish about what problems were confronting her at various stages of her life flowed through into her novels. This characteristic of Woolf, allowed the author to utilize her professional skills to present to the world the tormented soul of a very talented person.This is the most interesting book I have read in a long while. I thoroughly recommend it to those who wish to be entertained and gain a better understanding of themselves as well."},{"Title":"Who Killed Virginia Woolf?: A Psychobiography","review":"After seeing &quot;The Hours&quot; I knew I had to read more on Ms Woolf.

Each group of quotes on a subject is then put under headings such as: &quot;HIS CHOSEN AEROBIC ROUTINE,&quot; &quot;JUST ONE OF THOSE DAYS,&quot; and &quot;PLEASE CONFUSE ME WITH THE FACTS.&quot;The original Sidney Paget drawings are throughout the book, and the cover looks suitably Victorian/Edwardian. It's a small volume, but it contains, as the back page says: &quot;THE WORLD ACCORDING TO HOLMES.&quot;Keep it close by, as a reference tool, or just a book to thumb through. It's worth it!"},{"Title":"The Quotable Sherlock Holmes","review":"I like to be a really arrogant know-it-all and pretend to be Sherlock Holmes. My long-suffering friends know this (one of whom has even agreed to be my Watson, on the basis that she puts up with my arrogance, insanity, and over-analysis of everything) and hence chose to provide me with this indispensable book. After all, I need witty, pithy quotes to use after I've finished complaining that \\"my mind rebels at stagnation.\\" This book serves that purpose wonderfully. It is a compilation of Holmes' funny, witty, provocative, intelligent and perceptive statements from the entire Canon. Of course, the book is in no way a replacement for the stories themselves; it is, however, a wonderful reference (it's divided into chapters, each dealing with a particular aspect of Holmes' existence) as well as a pleasurable read.It ends, particularly fittingly, with a very famous quote (aren't they all?): the game is afoot.The game is certainly afoot. For this is a book that plays The Game - it pretends that Holmes and Watson really existed (oops. Did I just imply the two aren't real? Of course they're real!) The introduction, written by the grandson of John Watson, claims the book to be a lost, and now found and published, manuscript. It's written with wit and humor (and a few stabs at modern academia) and is an entirely fitting complement to Holmes' wit."},{"Title":"A Day To Pick Your Own Cotton (Shenandoah Sisters #2) Large Print Edition","review":"Great story that can teach us all--easy reading This is part of a series.

But in the final days of the Civil War, they both lost their families to marauders, and now they share an important secret. After Mayme, fleeing the scene of her family's murders, came across Katie, the only survivor at her plantation, Rosewood, the two girls decided to live there on their own and pretend that Katie's mother is still alive. As if that were not difficult enough, now they must protect three other people as well. Emma, a former slave, and her baby, William, are hiding at Rosewood from William's father, the son of Emma's former master. And Aleta, a young girl whose mother died as they fled from her abusive father, is living at Rosewood and is determined to never return home. Mayme and Katie have other worries as well. A loan is due soon at the bank, and if they don't pay, they will never be able to protect their secret.This was a good sequel to \\"Angels Watching Over Me\\" that continues the story of Mayme and Katie, and introduces some new characters as well. I really enjoyed the first book, and this was an excellent sequel. It brings to life the dangers of the post-Civil War South and is a heartwarming story of friendship.

Most of the people are either running or hiding from danger.This second book brings into focus the viciousness of the baby's father and his intent on getting rid of both mother and baby. What follows is dynamic love and perserverance and the ugliness of some men's minds and their wicked meanness is almost too much to absorb.The girls are maturing quickly and when the bank loan comes due with no money to be had, reposession is a very immediate possibility.

In this book the two unlikely friends, one a recently freed slave and the other the daughter of a former wealthy slave owner, continue to attempt to keep the fact that they are alone on Katie's plantation a secret. The two girls struggle to make things look \\"normal\\" on the plantation, but along the way they encounter new friends, a new roommate, dangerous visitors and financial difficulties. The story has a little of everything, there are moments that are light-hearted and humorous, others that are sad, and some that are filled with suspense, and the result is an overall enjoyable read.While A DAY TO PICK YOUR OWN COTTON is book two in a series, the author provides enough background so that it could stand on its own. However, I think I enjoyed the book more having read the first because I had a stronger emotional connection to the main characters. Overall, this is a fast paced story that highlights many aspects of everyday life in the Post-Civil War South. The Christian themes in the book are subtle and unassuming, it was touching to watch Mayme and Katie struggle to understand God and develop a relationship with him.

Though each aircraft achieved some success, the effect they had on the air war was minimal.As with other volumes in the series, the book is a combination of narrative, including first-hand accounts of flights and combats, dozens of photos including rare color shots and over 20 color profiles by Creek and Tom Tullis.Very nicely done!"},{"Title":"Jagdwaffe V5 Sec 4- Jet Fighters and Rocket Interceptors 1944-1945 (Luftwaffe Colours)","review":"If your interested in this luftwaffe aircraft,It is must to get.A true Collectors Book,Very Informative.Not Much info on luftwaffe officers involved.Statatiscs are bare mininum.But good pics"},{"Title":"Jagdwaffe V5 Sec 4- Jet Fighters and Rocket Interceptors 1944-1945 (Luftwaffe Colours)","review":"Another excelent book showing the final years of the war with the jets like Me 163, He 162 and Me 262, have a lot of drawings and photos."},{"Title":"Too Many to Mourn","review":"Not since Barometer Rising, have I read such a descriptive, and detailed book about the Halifax Explosion. The author of Too Many To Mourn has gone to great lengths to research the details of the actual explosion and the devastating aftermath that followed. I made this year my goal to learn more about the history of Halifax and Nova Scotia itself. After living here all my life, I can finally pinpoint the area and surrounding communities that were directly hit by the explosion. I highly recommend this book to all those who have any interest in the worst manmade disaster to hit this area. Better still, out of the estimated 2000 killed, try to imagine the loss of 46 family members .... in one day !"},{"Title":"Too Many to Mourn","review":"This book was most interesting and in depth. It brought a real family viewpoint of what everyone was doing before the explosion, their daily routine etc. It's done in such a way, that it will go through the Jackson Family aspect, then also have excerpts of the historical data, intertwined through the book. Then shortly into it, it goes into the explosion, how each person was killed, and then it goes into the survivors recovery. I Loved it. I was interested in it as my Grandfathers First Wife was killed in this explosion and wanted to learn more about the event. Highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Too Many to Mourn","review":"After having visited Halifax on many occasions, including the exhibit about the Halifax Explosion, reading this book brought forth the brevity of this disaster. The descriptive writings of these authors, coupled with extensive research, left me wanting to read on and on. I thought that its telling was put forth in a manner which was easy to read even though it's content was so tragic. For many of us Canadians who never visit Halifax, this book is some of the only historical account of this event. Of those with whom I have shared this book, we have all remarked that we had no idea that this even happened, let alone in Canada. A great book for history buffs."},{"Title":"Too Many to Mourn","review":"I read this book with a different perspective than other reviewers. I found this book researching my family history. My grandparents were James A. Jackson and Mona Mullane Jackson. My great Aunt was Sophye Jackson. I never knew my grandparents but grew up knowing Aunt Sophye as my mother's beloved Aunt. We visited her in Seattle and she came to stay with us from time to time. I am fortunate to have some of her treasures. I never knew why she never had children, but now I do. I also have treasured photos of my grandparents and Aunt Sophye. I hope to be able to get in touch with the Authors of the book and travel to Halifax sometime in the future. I found this book to be very interesting and heart wrenching. I now understand the meaning of courage and strength and I finally know that I am indeed half Irish!"},{"Title":"Too Many to Mourn","review":"I just stumbled across this book one day a few years ago and deicded to see what it was all about. I had never heard of the Halifax explosion before I read the description. I bought the book and it really is an icredible read. A lot of detail and you really are swept into the lives of the people who lived this horrible disaster. I learned a lot about the many aspects of the fallout of this type of explosion. The ground shock, total instant devastation of everything close by, and then the far-reaching effects. I was really shocked. Great book!"},{"Title":"Too Many to Mourn","review":"I was very pleased with the condition of my book and the delivery was so quick I was really surprised. Thank you."},{"Title":"Too Many to Mourn","review":"What a heart wrenching story...the enormity of the destruction is unimaginable. A difficult story to read yet one you can't put down. It's hard to believe that anyone survived."},{"Title":"Working With The Law","review":"If you just can't get past the several (not many, just several) typos in the book, then you'd be better off buying a much more expensive, yet well-edited and excellent book by Jerry and Esther Hicks. However, if you're like me and can look past the small flaws here and there, this will be a very easy and satisfying source of marvelous information for you! This is one of the few books in my library of research that I have read over and over! Raymond Holliwell speaks plainly and clearly about how the Universe works and his methods are tried and true by myself, so I can vouch for his information.What I enjoy most is the fact that he doesn't beat the same drum repeatedly through the book. He breaks down the information so it's easily read and has all the information you'll ever want for living inside of 200 pages! It's a small book and for myself personally, I've written notes and thoughts in the margins and back. I plan to keep this book handy, because just reading his words gives you the vibration that makes you happy. It brings you back to a more grounded place, reading the information he details.I give this one Five Stars because it is simple, describes the Universal Laws well and doesn't fatten the book up with overblown stories and unnecessary \\"stuff\\"."},{"Title":"Working With The Law","review":"A STRAIGHT TO THE POINT FOCUSED FORMAT!

This book sets the foundation for every single self help seminar/writing that's out there. Although it was written so long ago, it sounds refreshingly modern and applies to every aspect of our lives. You can literally read this over and over and come away with something new each time. I've recommended it to friends and co-workers alike. This is one piece of literature you should own, it has so much depth and so many life lessons. If your reading this, or if you've come across this book by accident; I ask that you give it a chance.

I will be reading this book the rest of my life. What I like best about \\"Working With the Law\\" is that it is easy reading. Each chapter is about 15 pages, so one can easily go through the chapter slowly and capture what Raymond Holliwell is conveying.I already have visible results in my life from applying these Laws. I am grateful I became aware of this book from the audio/video series by Bob Proctor http://www.the11forgottenlaws.com/?p=1227 I recommend this knowledge to everyone who wants to improve the life they have been given.

It has been out of print for quite sometime and now I see that it is back. This is the common sense approach to how to live our lives. I have read this book over and over throughout my life. It will give you the simple understanding of how to have everything you could ever want in your life, provided you understand and respect the Laws of the Universe. It will give you a better understand and provide growth of your sprituality. I highly recommend this to the whole world!"},{"Title":"Working With The Law","review":"Holliwell's book is phenomenal. It's concise, yet extremely dense. As a student of the Law of Attraction, I have a deep appreciation for authors like Wallace Wattles, Charles Haanel, and Napoleon Hill (who's works are the foundation of the film \\"The Secret\\" and the current Law of Attraction craze.)That said, I hold, \\"Working With the Law,\\" above them all, simply for the reason that this book was published in the 60's (rather than the turn of the century) making the text more contemporary, therefore easier to understand.The best part of the book though, I feel, is how it explains the correlation between the law of attraction and religion. As a practicing Catholic, I sometimes run into those in my faith who condemn me for following the Universal Laws.Christian, Muslim, Jew, et al. who are reluctant to embrace the Law of Attraction should read this book before they write off the Universal Laws that govern this world. Holliwell's book explains that God and (LAW) are really one in the same."},{"Title":"Working With The Law","review":"A positive, powerful book. While the ideas have been expressed by others both before and after Mr. Holliwell, he sets them out in a new perspective. Highly recommended to anyone who wants to greatly improve his/her life. This ranks up there with Venice Bloodworth's \\"Key To Yourself.\\""},{"Title":"Working With The Law","review":"This is a great book for those wanting to understand how to change their lives. It's an easy to understand \\"walk-thru\\" of the universal principals - including the Law of Attraction - which THE SECRET expounds on. There are other universal laws that work in conjunction with the Law of Atrraction. I would suggest to the readers that they read WORKING WITH THE LAW, not once but twice, before they can begin to really undersand what THE SECRET is talking about."},{"Title":"Working With The Law","review":"I've owned this book for several years, lost it, missed it and found it again on Amazon.

I have read many books on the Law of Attraction from The Secret to The Science of Getting Rich and although all books have given many perspectives and understanding, Working With The Law has been life changing. It wasn't until I read Raymond Holliwells perspective on the Law of Non-Resistance and The Law of Attraction did I start actually seeing amazing changes in my life. I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Working With The Law","review":"I can not put into words how great this book is. For all those who want to dig deeper spiritually but without all the complexities. Raymond Holliwell uses simplicity that you can understand and apply to your daily life. VERY well written!!

It is MUCH deeper than that."},{"Title":"Working With The Law","review":"I found the book overly simplistic long on theroy and short on logical thinking. But I must admit that his chapter on the Law of Attraction very unique. I have read everything that has been written on the Law of Attraction Holliwel's use of the theroy of we get the results of our \\"expectations\\" is brilliant and made much sense. Thoughts are a function of the ego and are not very useful, but expectations are are a function of the inner being . . . much more authentic.That chapter and the chapter on non-resistance made the book worthwhile, but otherwise the book was pretty outdated theroy."},{"Title":"Working With The Law","review":"This is a great book and everyone should read it at some point in their lives."},{"Title":"Reclaim your Light through the miracle of Rapid Eye Technology","review":"I am so glad that Ranae developed the wonderful method of R.E.T (Rapid Eye Technology) for it is the best therapy I have ever done for healing me and freeing me from my past trauma. I am a survivor of severe child abuse. I did years of various methods psychotherapy, read hundreds of psychology text books and self-help books, tried various alternative healing techniques like Thought Field Therapy and EMDR which were very helpful and I did a lot of healing and increased my awareness but I was still stuck. I began to realize that with my level of severe abuse and all the issues I had to work through it would take the rest of my life and I still wouldn't be done. Psychotherapy was just too slow. I am amazed at how quickly RET works. As I read through Ranae's book I could see all that I had learned from in her work. She has studied psychology and the roots of trauma and how it effects us on a body/mind/spirit level very well. She has put all the methods that I read were effective all togehter into one method and it works so quickly and deeply. I have never been able to let go of core issues, pain, resentment, anger and fear as quickly and DEEPLY as this before. I feel so much better! I have never felt this good ever in my life."},{"Title":"Reclaim your Light through the miracle of Rapid Eye Technology","review":"I was disappointed in this book. Nowhere does it tell how to actually do this Rapid Eye Technology. It just tells you to buy her videos or to see a &quot;technician.&quot; I'm giving it two stars instead of just one because the author sounds like a genuinely good person. She describes how she fasted and prayed and asked God to give her a technique that would help people. She also includes several chapters on what she calls life skills.

Quite a few of the leaders have serious eating and behavioural disorders and my question is if this works why do we have leaders with obesity and very serious emotional problems. athey are much like the Mormon church who strikes back at anyone who dares question.

When they get careless and reveal their presence, the supermarket owners bring in a cat, to the shock and dismay of Mrs. Mouse. But all ends happily, as the mice win over the feline gourmand.My two-year-old is completely entranced with this book.

Sure to become a favorite!"},{"Title":"Meet Pablo! (Backyardigans)","review":"I was happily surprised how cute this little book is. It looks like a stuffed animal with the belly part as a minibook. The head has a place to put your hand in like a puppet. The story is simple (4 pages). Pablo shows his backyard and then a scene of him dressed up for three adventures. Ends with backyard and the words \\"I can go anywhere in my backyard\\". My 13 month old loves it."},{"Title":"Meet Pablo!

I completely lose myself between the covers of these books. I love learning how life was back in the late 1800's and early 1900's in the Dakota Territory. There were many hardships, but also much love and fellowship. The town is aply named \\"Blessing\\". I would highly recommend all the Laurraine Snelling books on the Dakota Territory!"},{"Title":"The Reaper's Song (Unabridged Audiobook)","review":"The Red River of the North Series became near and dear to my heart. I simply could not wait to start the next once as soon as I finished the last one.

I highly recommend the entire series from beginning to end."},{"Title":"The Reaper's Song (Unabridged Audiobook)","review":"The Reaper's Song is the 4th book in the Red River Of The North series,and it was also an interesting read about the immigrant Norwegian relatives,and some new unrelated newcomers as well. I am very much enjoying reading how this community In North Dakota is growing and what life must have been like for them back in the 1800's in that part of the country especially."},{"Title":"The Reaper's Song (Unabridged Audiobook)","review":"I understand that the series was written to be \\"historically accurate\\", but really honestly does every person in the book have to succumb to some horrible debilitating accident, disease, or death???? Although this may have been true to life for that era of time, there is definitely nothing enjoyable about reading so much detail about so much misery. When a person is reading a fiction series, at least I for one want it to be an enjoyable read, even if the subject matter is serious. It could have been written as historically accurate without continual devastating events one on top of the other. I also started losing track of the characters, there were so many and they just sort of get all jumbled in the mix. I enjoyed the first and second books in the series, the third I liked less, and this fourth one I just couldn't continue...I quit about half-way through it and will not read the next."},{"Title":"The Reaper's Song (Unabridged Audiobook)","review":"I enjoy a good historical fiction book that doesn't have extraneous sex scenes in it.

It is interesting to read about the specifics of pioneer life and farming. This book was a little slower in parts than the first three books in the series but continues with developing characters and a few new storylines. I like the faith based application of dealing with events in our lives that we don't understand why God allowed. Also, touched on addiction with one of the characters. Good book with life lessons woven into the storylines."},{"Title":"The Reaper's Song (Unabridged Audiobook)","review":"The Reapers' Song (Red River of the North #4)As I read this series of books through the 2nd time in 2 years; I am still enthralled with the writing of Lauraine Snelling. These books are SO true to life, as to how the immigrants came from the old country, and settled a town. As someone who has studied genealogy and history, you are taken back to life as it truly was. As the families of Blessing, in Dakota Territory settle into their land and lives, good things come upon them as well as the bad things. Lauraine Snelling gives us a hint with her title, and people do pass on into the next life. The saddest part of the book is what happens to Ingeborg. I will not spell it out, because I like to be surprised myself when I am reading a book. I don't feel like reading through a book review that tells you everything BEFORE you've even read the book. Why read it then, if you know what's going to happen before you read it? Anyway, this book tells of sickness, a couple of new main characters, a serious accident, domestic abuse, family arriving from Norway, a marriage, a new vital building added to the town of Blessing, and an adoption. This is another one of Snelling's books that adds to the life of the town of blessing, and the life of the Bjorklunds."},{"Title":"The Reaper's Song (Unabridged Audiobook)","review":"Book 4 was still a great story, besides the at times slow movement of the story forward.

Ms. Snelling is one of my favorite authors and this is one of my favorite books. I have rad every book numerous times and would recommend them for anyone. Ms. Snelling knows real-life situations that pertained to the late 1800s and writes about them. I personally believe &quot;A reader from Alberta, Canada&quot; must have only skimmed the book and I suggest that she get her facts straight."},{"Title":"The Reaper's Song (Unabridged Audiobook)","review":"This is a sad book at times, but it brings out the truths of life for the homesteaders. Although I wish Ingeborg would get her baby, I also know that her situation was very real for many women. Alberta, Canada hasn't read this book because she doesn't know what she is talking about at all. It's a great book in a great series, I love them all."},{"Title":"The Reaper's Song (Unabridged Audiobook)","review":"After reading the review by &quot;A reader from Alberta, Canada,&quot; I am appalled by the misinformation this person provides. Just to make sure, I went home and read the entire series, and there is NO instance where they laugh at Andrew for being naughty, and there is at least one spanking, where Andrew let the sheep out when he knew better. &quot;Alberta, Canada&quot; obviously has this book mixed up with something else."},{"Title":"The Reaper's Song (Unabridged Audiobook)","review":"Very good book.

She makes you care for the Bjorklund family and worry about their future."},{"Title":"The Reaper's Song (Unabridged Audiobook)","review":"I was looking for new book to read when I picked up the first book in this series. I found the first book to be very boring, but I kept reading the consecutive books until this last one. These books frustrated me. Being a mother myself, I could not stand to see how Ingeborg disciplined her youngest son. They found it funny when he hit his brother. And then his brother got in trouble. They found it funny when the little boy whined. I'm sorry, but this kind of child raising brings up spoiled brats. You know there is a problem when the reader is giving the characters advise on how to raise their children. My advise: Don't even start reading the series."},{"Title":"The Reaper's Song (Unabridged Audiobook)","review":"Even though I felt book 4 was just a bit dragging at times, it kept my interest because it built on the life of Hjelmer.

Haaken contracts mumps as they spread throughout the families, and the Bjorkland matriarch arrives with 4 others for vacationing -or is it a move?A very dramatic incident occurs when Anner, an angry farmer, has a farm accident.During a 6 wk absence of her husband and against all advise including his, Ingeborg returns to her britches and plowing and has a freak though serious accident. Zeb MacCallister, a fugitive caring for orphans Manda and Deborah, joins the prairie families. Manda talks too much.Blessing women are discussing the possibility of women's votes and the fact their area is about to become a state. Katy and Zeb are extremely attracted but speak completely different languages.A bank is opening, several weddings take place, and near the end of the book Zeb sees his siter momentarily and gets a painful scare which forces him into an even more painful decision.Despite a slight discrepancy in timeframes by the author, I am glad I already have purchased book 5 in this series."},{"Title":"The Reaper's Song (Unabridged Audiobook)","review":"I liked this book.

Every family should inform themselves and prepare for the eventuality of having to make it on their own for an extended time.

It goes from mild first aid in the field, to hardcore food storage and living off the grid. Something for everyone. Take what you like/need and leave the rest, but definitely pick up.

What I like best about the book is the author suggests books for each section that he writes on. Each chapter has a complete list of resources for you to consult if you want to dive deeper into a particular subject. The stories he includes about how real people survived in different situations was of particular interest to me. If you would like to know how to calculate a year's supply of food, survival strategies that will keep you alive, make a knife out of a stone, which weeds are edible, how to preserve meat, how to make adobe blocks, how to build for earthquake resistance, how to deal with puncture wounds, emergency childbirth, healing with herbs, how to spin yarn, how to tan a hide, how to make a basket, how to use a gourd, how to make soap and the basics of metalworking, then this book is for you. This list is just a small sampling of what this book covers. There is so much more info that Matthew Stein provides. I've purchased two copies so that I have a back-up."},{"Title":"When Technology Fails: A Manual for Self Reliance & Planetary Survival","review":"Great general book on how too stuff.

It definitely looks to be a definitive text on the subject of sustainable life in the absence of technology. I say that it 'appears' so because I haven't finished reading it but even just a quick flip-through gives you a sense that there is an immense amount of information inside. There are diagrams and charts and very good descriptions of the subjects of each chapter. The drawback, which is hardly even one, is that for the amount of information you get the book is on the hefty side. It is paperback however the length and width dimensions are larger. For a book you keep on the bookshelf it's just fine but if you were packing it up or thinking of taking it around with you then it may get prohibitive. I still gave the book a 5 star rating because the larger size is to be expected and for the money it is easily one of the best deals on books of this sort."},{"Title":"When Technology Fails: A Manual for Self Reliance & Planetary Survival","review":"This is a comprehensive guide for anyone who wishes to learn a little or a lot about survival.

It also includes natural medicine, homeopathy basics, water storage, solar power, emergency measures, and alot of statistical information that I wasnt aware of. The book is almost 500 pages and he backs up all of his opinions with many resources, so that if you are particularly interested in, for example--earth based shelters or fuel cells for steam energy, you can find more info on it from his links. I am a preparedness person, not an extremeist, and I got alot of useful info from the &#34;low tech medicine&#34; cabinet to water purifying options, and how many gallons a system realistically purifys and how to be sure the system you are getting removes cysts like Cryptosporidium that can survive bleach!

A HUGE NEGATIVE was having to wade through 50+ pages of the author's half-researched analysis of how humanity is destroying the earth. I guess he felt it necessary to cherry-pick the latest gloom and doom headlines -- even rank-ordering which ones he thinks are most likely, based on his (complete lack of) experience -- to justify the rest of the book. (I did as a professional analyst what he has attempted to do as an amateur with a few one-sided sources.) It was unnecessary, as Mr. Stein is an engineer -- which IS his expertise -- and provides very good advice in that realm, and good, helpful diagrams and warnings as well (I'm an engineer too).BUT, if you can get past the political opinionating and slavish devotion to Jimmy Carter, it's a pretty good book."},{"Title":"When Technology Fails: A Manual for Self Reliance & Planetary Survival","review":"Engineer, builder, outdoorsman, Matt Stein has the rare ability to see the big-picture spectrum of modern technology, then categorize and simplify its survival components.

Intelligently researched and clearly presented."},{"Title":"When Technology Fails: A Manual for Self Reliance & Planetary Survival","review":"Super book so far... not finished with it yet.

Anybody out there willing to take on the task?"},{"Title":"When Technology Fails: A Manual for Self Reliance & Planetary Survival","review":"I am not impressed with this book. In brief, it might serve as a general, and i mean general, guide to things that should be attended too. but once you look up the chapter, find another source for your information because your life might depend on it. It does list places to find supplies, that might be useful, but that you will find referenced in other sources that are better vetted.don't bother with the revised edition. it seems the revisions are all about global warming, (which has been totally discredited. Anyone with even a smidge of reason left in their noodle after suffering 12 years in a government propaganda camp can discern this fact from the available evidence.) some other politically ignorant musings, and \\"prophacies\\" by self proclaimed spiritualists or natives who have a special connection to the earth, becasuse they aren't \\"consumers in white trash america\\" or something like that. At any rate, there is a pile of that sort of gibberish. I hit a few topics that I know a little about and found gaps or errors so basic they put the value of the whole book into question. in the chapter about guns he referes to magazines as clips. And a fixation on being able to kill a bear with higher caliber ammo. What about rioters and attacking gangs? He doesn't seem to think a battle rifle would be useful. Rediculously basic stuff here. In the chapters about that global warms business he misquotes revelations 11:18. (probably a \\"revised bible\\" that preaches environmentalism)but he didn't site from which bible. in the section about possible disasters he seems fixated on the consequencies of our abuse of the environment. no mention, that i have seen yet, of hyper inflation, riots, etc. i would give the book a one star but i don't hate it. I gave it 2 because i won't be tossing it, yet. I suggest you visit [...] for more and better information and resorces for the topics that this book trys to address. one last note, the author said he recieved a prompting from god or the spirit, or whatever it is, to write the book. What? I am not sure God; The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost would be referred to as whatever it is by someone who actually listened or tried to listen to him. I specuate that the author might just be trying to appeal to a higher authority so fewer people will question his apparent ignorance. Dont trust your life to this book, if you buy it or own it, pick a subject, research it else where. Get a copy of Patriots, by rawles instead."},{"Title":"When Technology Fails: A Manual for Self Reliance & Planetary Survival","review":"Amazon kept me hanging for months promising a book they never delivered.I finally got it at the local library."},{"Title":"When Technology Fails: A Manual for Self Reliance & Planetary Survival","review":"This is a great book about preparing for short-term societal or environmental crises - how to conserve water when the water's not running (after a hurricane, say), how to stay warm and safe when the ice-storm of the century wipes out your natural gas and electricity, or an earthquake shakes your house down around your ears in the middle of the night.The true beauty of this book is the wealth of information for longer-term &quot;doing without,&quot; or slow erosion of a situation of plenty we now take for granted. Here is information on dealing with medical problems when no doctor is forthcoming, growing food organically and with your own saved seed, how you might store food over the winter with no refrigerator.If we lost the luxury of the machines that run our world, would we find ourselves back in the stone age, having lost the knowledge handed down for generations beyond count of how to shelter, clothe, feed and doctor ourselves? These skills are all touched on in this book, with voluminous resource lists so that the reader can learn more about any of these subjects.Technology, too, is given its due - renewable energy sources like solar and wind are discussed and the best water filters on the market.Change is coming. That's apparent. If you're worried, wary - this is a good book, a jumping-off place to learn skills you may some day be very thankful for, or at least gather a library of relevant information against the day when it is needed. Survivalist paranoia not required."},{"Title":"When Technology Fails: A Manual for Self Reliance & Planetary Survival","review":"Matthew Stein has written a clear, concise book on the subject of survival that, while educating, also does what few others have managed to do - entertain and engage the reader.Throughout the book you'll find personal stories accompanying the text to further illustrate or drive home a point. The use of these asides brings you into Matthew Stein's life, as he recounts personal stories of survival and tells the stories of others who have managed to overcome the odds to survive.Not just a survival book, Matthew also covers topics like alternative therapies; how to create a survival mindset; survival strategies; renewable energy; companion gardening; prophecies etc. as well as all the regular topics found in such books - edible plants; first aid; making a survival kit; growing, hunting and foraging; making tools; creating shelters; spinning/weaving/tanning etc.The book has some great illustrations that make plant identification and first aid that much easier to understand and each chapter finishes with a reference section listing books (along with a short review) and resources (with web addresses where available).This book is supposed to have been 15 years in the making - and the time and effort taken by the author to research his topic really shows. When Technology Fails belongs in your survival library - as the publisher says, &quot;it's a user-friendly manual for the 21st Century&quot;."},{"Title":"When Technology Fails: A Manual for Self Reliance & Planetary Survival","review":"Most of this book is very good. It is a good survey of many issues related to self-sufficiency. It has great references that make it easier to find the materials needed for a more in-depth understanding of most of the topics.However, I had the feeling while reading the book was that it was written by Abby (Dharma's mother from Dharma &amp; Greg). Great, pragmatic information is tainted with pseudo-science nonsense and newage garbage. Most of which is harmless, but some of it may be downright dangerous.For example, there is a half page editorial on the moral issues of hunting followed some pages later by a long discussion of tanning. There is a story of how blessing water turned undrinkable swill into sweet healing water. There's enough folk and eastern medical advice to make your head swim.If you believe everything you read, this probably isn't the book for you. However, if you can discern the likely from the silly, you might find this book useful."},{"Title":"When Technology Fails: A Manual for Self Reliance & Planetary Survival","review":"The content of this book is diverse and well researched. One of the strengths of this books is the vast amount of information it covers in an easily accessible way. It is like a tour through many alternatives to our traditional technological solutions. It gives you a view into such topics as low-tech healing, alternative shelters, power, heating, effective methods for growing food, tool making, and much, much more. If you need to know more about any particular topic you will find an abundance of references at the end of chapter.The title &quot;When Technology Fails&quot; does not seem to fit the content well. The book does have a few sections on emergency preparation, procedures, and first-aid, but that is clearly not the heart of this book. It is also not an anti-technology book. It is full of technological solutions, however they are low-tech and earth friendly technologies. This book is much more about our future and how we can live using much more earth friendly and sustainable practices. Chapter 2, &quot;Present Trends, Possible Futures,&quot; is a MUST read for everyone. Stein shows the reader, very clearly, how we can all still live in relative comfort AND dramatically reduce our impact on the environment.The book is very well written with many examples and illustrations to highlight his teachings. Its is also a fun read, which is unusual for a &quot;how to&quot; manual. There are many beautiful and powerful quotes and several ideas that will challenge your thinking. I have thoroughly enjoyed reading this book."},{"Title":"When Technology Fails: A Manual for Self Reliance & Planetary Survival","review":"\\"when technology fails\\" is misleading to the content of the book.

On a planet where the estimated long-term carrying capacity is on the order of 1 to 2 billion people, if we can't control our own population growth, nature will do it for us. Most people would agree that it is much more humane to provide family-planning eduction and birth control materials for all people on earth than for the population to find its natural level through starvation, plagues, and wars. \\"when technology fails\\" page 461.8. share the wealth9. reach out to developing countries10. replace coal-burning power plants11. global relocalization12. make decisions based on sustainabilityDO YOU NOW UNDERSTAND WHY IT WASN'T EXACTLY WHAT I EXPECTED FROM THE TITLE.WHY DID I TYPE THIS?

One of the things about our modern society that concerns me the most, is as new technology makes our lives simpler, we (the people not involved in implimenting the new technology) lose track of how things really work. This book is a handbook that describes the systems and techniques that our grandparents once knew and we (as members of modern society) have never learned.There are a lot of books out there that focus on singular aspects of what this author undertakes. I have not ever seen a book as comprehensive as this on the subject. Although the author is an engineer, the book is written for the layperson- and he does a great job doing it. It shows; he has extensively researched all of his topics and offers a huge reference section at the end of each of his chapters.This author has a keen understanding of where the modern world is going- if something isn't quickly done to change its course; but rather than just complaining about the problems the world faces, he offers time proven solutions that every one of us can utilize, on our own.With the threat of higher utility bills on the horizon, the timing of this book is uncanny. I truely believe that this may be one of the best books to have in the reference section of your personal library!"},{"Title":"When Technology Fails: A Manual for Self Reliance & Planetary Survival","review":"There is a lot of good information in this book, especially good are the reference and resource areas and websites the author includes.With that said, I found a lot of stuff that simply wasn't practical or necessary to have. Some questions I have after reading it are: Where would the average person store that roughly 1200 lbs of grain, 240 lbs of legumes, 200 lbs of dairy, etc, etc. needed for a family of 4 to survive a year? And what would you do at the end of the year when you had eaten all your food? Also the average uban dweller probably isn't likely to be able to drill their own well for drinking water. And what about your neighbors? Is it really practical to expect that they would let you eat drink and be merry while the whole village starved?Some of the things the author lists for survival also seem ridiculous. How about the condom that you can put in a sock to create a water bottle. Why not just keep a couple water bottles around? He lists a compass and matches and candles. Unless you are planning to do hiking in previously unnavigated areas, the compass seems not necessary. Candles and matches! I live in South Florida where we get a lot of power outages from hurricanes- the last one left us without electricity for two weeks. My best suggestion is a couple really good flash lights (battery powered and solar) and some solar lanterns and stock up on those batteries.I couldn't decide if this book was for the end of the world, a nuclear attack, or a beginning primer to for the end of fossil fuels. This book seemed more like a hodge podge of other more succinct works giving the most extreme examples.Since we aren't at the end of the world yet, there are lots of ways to reduce your personal dependence on the modern electrical grid. If we all do this collectively, then a manual like this becomes less necessary. Buy compact fluorescent light bulbs- 1/4 the energy usage- lasts 10x as long. Get a tankless water heater or one that is solar powered. Turn off your lights and unplug your appliances when you aren't using them. Buy appliances that have an energystar rating. Plant some trees- they will give you shade and soak up some of that carbon modern societies love to emit. Plant some vegetables. Compost & buy a rain catcher for plant irrigation. Recycle everything! Buy a hybrid car. Plan your shopping excursions to maximize your time out driving. ETC, ETC. And most importantly demand an energy policy that works from your elected officials!You can also buy those appliances that won't leave you stranded if there is an extended outage. Solar cookers, gas grills, solar refrigerators, and like I noted earlier the flash lights and solar lanterns. Stock up on some water and non perishible items if you live in a place that gets hit with hurricanes.So, in sum, while this book gives a lot of good advice, its not very concise and also gives you a lot of info that you won't likely need."},{"Title":"When Technology Fails: A Manual for Self Reliance & Planetary Survival","review":"When Technology FailsA good engineer understands technological theory and is able to apply it in the real world. A good teacher helps other people grasp an abstract idea and its concrete manifestations. A good writer can get an idea across to the reader.In his new book &quot;When Technology Fails&quot;, Matthew Stein succeeds as an engineer, teacher and writer. He demonstrates his broad knowledge of the field of self-reliance. He helped me better understand self-reliance concepts and, especially, their many applications. He writes clearly and concisely. It's a good how-to and why-to book. It does remind me of The Whole Earth Catalogue as the jacket suggests, but it covers many topics more deeply than its predecessor. The extensive bibliography makes it an excellent reference source if you want to explore a topic more, but one gets plenty of practical advice without going further. It also reminded me of my old scout handbook, loaded with self-reliance tips for everything from emergency survival to first aid to energy efficient, low-cost housing. I'm not wild about the book's title. Stein is an MIT-trained engineer, not a survivalist reactionary. The book also provides low-tech, not no-tech solutions.When Technology Fails is a well-written, useful source of information and ideas for both the neophyte and old pro interested in becoming more self-reliant."},{"Title":"When Technology Fails: A Manual for Self Reliance & Planetary Survival","review":"What I love about Stein's book, \\"When Technology Fails\\" besides the incredible in-depth information on alternative health remedies, is he simplifies the job of disaster preparedness for those of us who don't buy into the media-based fear, are not survivalists, or retired boy scouts but want to take prudent action to protect our families - just in case. As Stein commented on a recent appearance on \\"The View from The Bay\\" ABC news Channel 7 in San Francisco, preparedness is like auto insurance, we hope we never have to use it and it's a good thing to have around when we need it.As a mother of four children living in San Francisco, the book leaves me feeling empowered with the basic facts along with plenty of options to consider without outfitting a nuclear safe compartment for a family of six in my backyard. Living in California, my husband and I had wondered for example, if we could store an adequate supply of water in our city garage for our family in case of earthquake. One of the helpful hints we got from Stein was to buy a water filter and treatment tablets used by hikers and climbers because they are both effective and compact.While it isn't easy to consider the unthinkable, especially when you are responsible for young children, knowledge is power and \\"When Technology Fails\\" put that knowledge right in the reader's hands. We can't and don't control disasters and/or world events but we do very much have choice about our own abilities to respond if necessary. We don't need to buy into the fear but the facts are certainly helpful.Don't read it cover to cover. Read it like an encyclopedia.

That temporary termination of electricity is the most commonly encountered example of how our lives are affected when our technology fails. That's why in the age of the electric lightbulb we still buy candles. Now in a newly revised and substantially expanded edition, \\"When Technology Fails: A Manual For Self-Reliance, Sustainability, And Surviving The Long Emergency\\" by engineer and building contractor Matthew Stein provides a comprehensive and thoroughly 'user friendly' instruction guide to preparing for both temporary and extended technology collapses and dramatic adjustments necessitated by local phenomena and global environmental trends ranging from the inevitable diminishment of petroleum as a source of energy, to climate change, to economic collapse. Addressing issues ranging from self-reliance, to emergency survival, to low-tech medicine and health, to water quality and treatment, to shelter, food, clothing, low-tech chemistry, and more, \\"When Technology Fails\\" is invaluable and a core addition to personal and community library reference collections."},{"Title":"When Technology Fails: A Manual for Self Reliance & Planetary Survival","review":"A decent read with lots of information to varying depths of coverage that covers all the important topics relating to self-reliance specifically in the context of a possible future global scenario of technological failure, power outages, infrastructure collapse and resource shortages.The opening chapter \\"Present Trends, Possible Futures\\" provides an excellent introduction to why self-reliance and consideration of a bleak future is wise. Matthew talks about flu pandemics, climate change, peak oil, natural disasters, terrorism, overpopulation with a good look at ecological systems, system feedback, sources and sinks. The closing chapter \\"Making the Shift to Sustainability\\" illustrates how we've had years to act and particularly in the US, that opportunity has been passed by. But there is still time to change.In between these two chapters, Matthew covers emergency survival techniques and equipment, water treatment, food growing and storage, shelter construction - and we're talking about proper long-term accommodation suited for natural heating and cooling - first aid, clothing, energy production, metalworking, basic home chemistry and engineering.We could do without the chapter \\"When High-Tech Medicine Fails\\" which talks about colloidal silver, herbs, natural remedies, homeopathy and more. Some of these may work and if the rest work it'll be due to placebo. That may warrant inclusion in this book but I felt it tainted an otherwise good book."},{"Title":"When Technology Fails: A Manual for Self Reliance & Planetary Survival","review":"If you want to be prepared in case of disaster, longterm or short, whether it comes in the form of an earthquake, fire, or flood, or as a loss of electricity, fuel, and communications, this is a great book with something for everyone. I especially appreciate the fact that it covers so many different aspects of survival, is written in easy to understand laymen's terms, and includes such an extensive list of recommended reading at the end of each chapter so readers know where to go to learn more about the topics that interest them.In a world where we've become so dependent on technology and lost many of the old skills people used to use daily to fend for themselves, it's a reassuring addition to my bookshelf. It's all about being prepared, like they teach in the Scouts, and hoping for the best while preparing for the worst. Thanks, Mr Stein, for doing the research for us and summarizing it so concisely.

What would you do if a storm took out your power? How would you keep yourself warm and fed? What if you live in an area subject to floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, or other natural hazards? It is very empowering to have answers (many quite detailed) gathered together in one book in a very readable format.

It touches on everything and teaches a little. When technology fails I may use it as kindling. So much missing from a book on self reliance. It basically tells you to go read other books and misses out on the opportunity to actually use all those pages to teach you some skills."},{"Title":"When Technology Fails: A Manual for Self Reliance & Planetary Survival","review":"If you are looking for a one volume \\"how to\\" book on this topic you'll be disappointed. The author introduces a variety of useful topics for those interested in self reliance.

As an introduction to this mind set the book is fine."},{"Title":"When Technology Fails: A Manual for Self Reliance & Planetary Survival","review":"I'll say 90-95% of this book is filled with great information for someone who has no formal training in military/survival or tactics. There are parts of this book that you could rip the pages out of it to lighten it up some and have a great technical manual for standard survival skills. Some covered subjects in this book are not done as in depth or at all in other survival manuals. The medical and identification sections of plants and animals I particularly like as a more comprehensive source than other guides.The pages that could be torn out are pure trash and liberal garbage as an attempt to get people to think the \\"progressive\\" way (global warming, greenhouse, peak oil, the usual), even for someone that may have no real interest in those topics. I would love to give this book 5 stars for the wealth of practical information, but those few sections ruin it and drop a star. If the publisher would re-print this book with the same information in the practical and majority sections of this book, then call it the \\"comprehensive survival guide for the outdoor enthusiast,\\" it would be a 5 star best seller in the genre.Even if you aren't a liberal type and, like many survivalist type people, lean towards a conservative viewpoint, get this book for the wealth of content and just laugh at the other pages or use them for kindling."},{"Title":"When Technology Fails: A Manual for Self Reliance & Planetary Survival","review":"This book provides a broad overview of the skills and planning considerations for long-term preparedness. It is well referenced and allows the reader to find more detailed discussion of most topics easily. My biggest complaint is the pervasiveness of questionable science and flat out myth.

However, very few can match the breadth of information contained in \\"When Technology Fails\\". The material that Mat Stein covers goes WAY beyond the typical food storage, first aid, and bug-out bags to cover chemistry, metallurgy, energy systems, engineering, manufacturing and much more. All presented in accessible, easy to understand language that anybody can wrap their head around.If you took the time to consider all the things you would need to know in order to be truly self-reliant in the event of a collapse of our systems and infrastructure, you'll find that Stein has covered it. I don't go out of my way much to write online reviews, but I think anybody who takes preparedness and self-reliance seriously - whether in the wake of a disaster or collapse, or just to live a more independent life - should own this book! I literally keep my copy within arm's reach of my desk and recommend it to practically everyone I meet!Also, Stein's second book:When Disaster Strikes: A Comprehensive Guide for Emergency Planning and Crisis Survivalis equally comprehensive, and an essential companion to When Technology Fails.Ed Corcoran - Editor; Survivalist Magazine"},{"Title":"When Technology Fails: A Manual for Self Reliance & Planetary Survival","review":"You could probably chunk about 1/2 to 2/3's of this book and get a less than adequate book on what to do in an emergency and what to do and avoid before one happens. I previewed some of the book and the contents but once you get into the articles you discover the info is less than adequate, too wordy. He mentions biblcal disasters and I surely would not base my survival on what happend and what was done more than 2000 - 5000 years ago. He seems to contradict the title by offering technologically advanced suggestions in various areas. Forging for food and knowing what herbs to eat is advantageous but it there is volcanic ash, nuclear fallout or some chemical warfare residue all over the place what then? No advice there much aside from storing food. A first aid book would serve as much with the info offered here. Who is going to build a bamboo shelter when there are plenty of buildings whose material can be used to create new ones. Here you see the problem with no recycling. The book reminds me of info on TED about helping the third world countries advance, not a solid survival guide for an American in a disaster.Negative population - this scared the hell out of me. What does this have to do with surviving a disaster? One begins to feel one is being programmed in a very uncomfortable manner. It seems more a discourse on going green than about surviving a disaster. Like I said cut 2/3's of the book and lower the price and you have a little help.I am returning the book."},{"Title":"When Technology Fails: A Manual for Self Reliance & Planetary Survival","review":"There is no way I can read this entire book before writing a review. It is a big, thick bible. Everything as expected. Full of valuable information for the survivor. However, these things are for AFTER the culling is over. Missing, is the FIRST topic of concern. The great panic and desperation of population collapse. Growing your own food and building shelters is futile if there are hordes of people behaving badly. Combat and self defense is the FIRST test of survival. Not a mention of this is included. Great Book to have if you survive the Mad-Max scenario and find uninhabited land."},{"Title":"When Technology Fails: A Manual for Self Reliance & Planetary Survival","review":"Very informative I'm just starting it but I can't put it down. There's so much useful knowledge in this book. What other book/manual could teach you how to stitch up wounded, how to filter water, information on whats to come (i.e economic collapse, superstorms and bio threats) and self defense. Can't wait to finish it and read it again and again until I upload every paragraph, sentence and punctuation into my brain. I would recommend this book to any and all people who want to have the skills necessary to survive the impending apocalypse."},{"Title":"When Technology Fails: A Manual for Self Reliance & Planetary Survival","review":"I found this book to be amazing. A lot of the information is basic knowledge for anyone that knows anything about survival. This is going to be the case with every survival book though. This book is chock full of information that the average person wouldn't know or even think about if ever caught in an emergency situation. This should be in every household even if never read and just skimmed through for reference. BUY THE HARD COPY!!!! Kindle will do you no good when the power goes out and your battery dies."},{"Title":"When Technology Fails: A Manual for Self Reliance & Planetary Survival","review":"This is a very thorough book. If you believe in being prepared for any disaster, this is a must have. It will walk you through the needed supplies and preparations for every conceivable disaster - from earthquakes and volcanoes to terrorism and bio-threats - from short term glitches to long-term emergencies. It's a little overwhelming because of the amount of information it contains, but breaking it down by section should make it a little more manageable.It has a great section on growing, foraging, hunting, and storing food. The illustrations of wild edible plants are a great addition, as is the first aid section and the energy, heat, and power section. Some sections made me roll my eyes a little, such as the sections on the author's spirituality and his prophetic notions, but those are small sections, and other than that, I highly recommend the book."},{"Title":"When Technology Fails: A Manual for Self Reliance & Planetary Survival","review":"All of the skills necessary to survive any disaster whether at home or in the wild. This is a book you want to keep, read over and over and practice after you read it. Very well written with many drawings illustrating the needed skills.The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is that the book can get a bit preachy as to why technology will fail. One chapter would have sufficed as to what could happen. Instead the authors get into many theories in almost every chapter. While I agree with most of the theories, some are a bit out there, including things that haven't even been fully proven yet."},{"Title":"When Technology Fails: A Manual for Self Reliance & Planetary Survival","review":"I give 5 stars because the book is incredible. But making a book that is about Technology Failing only available on an electronic device is just too stupid not to comment on."},{"Title":"When Technology Fails: A Manual for Self Reliance & Planetary Survival","review":"I read this book a couple years ago, and then bought extra copies as gifts for friends and family, with my only request being they \\"pay it forward\\" by giving a copy to people they care about also.As someone who (like the author) has spent much time thinking and reading about sustainability (or lack thereof), this is the book I would have written too, except Matthew Stein reads more and writes better than I ever will. Engineers like us spend time thinking about how things can go wrong to hopefully avoid failures. Unfortunately we all know things often fail anyway, and there are a number of significant (potential) risks both locally and globally going forward; so I'm afraid those who believe nothing bad could ever happen just haven't been paying attention.The wise among us might learn some basic skills from previous generations that have largely been forgotten in our modern tech frenzied lifestyles. If you don't have time to learn now, putting this book on your shelf may be some of the cheapest insurance you can buy. If and when the time comes you need some of this info, it will be great to look up in one handy reference. Of course, the author can't cover every detail of so many subjects in one volume, but there is generally enough info to get a good idea on things you may be interested in, while all his sources are nicely discussed in context to help toward far more in-depth study on any subject desired. In fact, I was especially pleased and impressed to see a number of my favorite other books recommended in this one as well. Finally, I'd like to try the Kindle version (when I get my screen fixed) since 500 pages is hefty to carry on the go, but I'll keep my paper copy in a safe place too -- for obvious reasons."},{"Title":"When Technology Fails: A Manual for Self Reliance & Planetary Survival","review":"From how to rid yourself of parasites, to how to build a shelter ... this book has it all.

The other reviews tell the story more eloquently than I can. All I can say is that the book is excellent and I give it as a gift to those I care about."},{"Title":"When Technology Fails: A Manual for Self Reliance & Planetary Survival","review":"It's not exactly comforting to contemplate the devolution of civilization as we know it. But numerous trends are converging to make it likely that the not-too-distant future will look very different than the life of ease to which Americans have become accustomed.When Technology Fails actually helps me feel better about scary scenarios, because Matthew Stein not only sees clearly some possible futures, he provides detailed, practical instructions on how to survive and thrive in times of climate change, food insecurity, oil depletion, water crises, and more.Stein's book embodies a rare combination of clear-headed, heartful philosophy with nuts-and-bolts advice. The topics range from mental attitude to first aid, disaster preparedness to long-term skills for creating home, food, clothing, and health.I wouldn't want to be without this book, and I'm grateful to Matthew Stein for having written it."},{"Title":"When Technology Fails: A Manual for Self Reliance & Planetary Survival","review":"Much of this is good information for people concerned about real sustainable living - not just being prepared for some end-of-the-world scenario. Living a more responsible life is worthwhile.However there are a few drawbacks. In his First Aid information he talks of using the Heimlich Manoeuvre as a strategy dealing with people who are choking. This technique was abandoned by the American Red Cross in 2006. There are other more preferred strategies.Much of the information is specific for Americans - such as edible plants, and so forth. Buying pump-action guns is not an option for many countries. Further all measurements are given in American standards such as pounds, gallons, etc.Further he introduces a number of new age concepts in dealing with people's well-beings - with things such as your Chakras and so on.However each chapter is followed by a good selection for further materials, broken down by topic."},{"Title":"When Technology Fails: A Manual for Self Reliance & Planetary Survival","review":"I find this book to be invaluable. I keep it in a safe place next to my earthquake survival book. It even comes in handy for my back packing trips as I recall some of the survival technique that Mr. Stein has included. I'd recommend everyone to have a copy, whether you live in storm danger areas, earthquake areas, or just for when it all comes to a stop."},{"Title":"When Technology Fails: A Manual for Self Reliance & Planetary Survival","review":"This book was recommended by a friend and initially wouldn't have picked up a book in this catagory. It was eye opening. I live in earthquake country and found this be an invaluable guide for disaster preparedness. As global warming takes place we see unexpected weather events happening more and more and the affects these events have on the population. I don't want to be the one on the news who lived without suppies and in darkness waiting for help to arrive."},{"Title":"When Technology Fails: A Manual for Self Reliance & Planetary Survival","review":"I was initially concerned before I read the book that it would be solely for survivalists, but Stein really emphasizes the power of community in a crisis. Also the scope of the book is great--everything's here, but if you want more information, the author gives detailed, current citations."},{"Title":"When Technology Fails: A Manual for Self Reliance & Planetary Survival","review":"This book is EXCELLENT at teaching us to live a sustainable and green life style, and to survive a loss of our electronic gizmos if that were ever to occur. As someone deeply interested in greening my life, this book is excellent. The tips are wonderful. The resources great. In terms of this content, I would give the book 5 stars.Amish and Mennonite Americans have been living this sustainable life style for ever. I admire them greatly, and one of the strengths of this book is showing us how we can all \\"get off the grid\\" and make the world a better place.However, sadly, the author's ideology is deeply flawed in some respects, especially when it comes to population growth. In the introduction (which descends into fear mongering) the author talks about the so called proven problems with population. This is a falsehood as the bookPopulation Control: Real Costs, Illusory Benefitsclearly shows. Population growth will only be a danger if we refuse to treat the world with respect. An Amish family with 12 kids living on a farm off the grid using cloth diapers and sustainable farming practices actually would help green the planet, whereas a typical American family of four, with both parents off working and commuting in SUVs with annual vacations by plane and the children off in inefficient schools instead of home-schools will do serious harm to the planet. If one compares the two families, the modern family is the menace, not the children themselves. The family of 12 living sustainably is a gift, the family of 4 living in a rush to consume is the problem. Human existence, and human babies are NOT the problem (as much as the inconsisent ideologues on the eco-left would have us believe). Furthermore, as much as I am very interested in greening the planet (and am living my life accordingly increasingly year by year) much of this book's introduction is fear mongering. It reads like Malthus. He was wrong. So is this author. If we all take small steps, we can help change the world. There is no reason to go crazy moving to farms.While we are considering the population question, the author I am sure is a big fan of chemical contraceptives which are imperiling our water supply and our planet themselves. As women who take the pill use our water supply to flush their waste, an INCREDIBLE amount of estrogen is finding its way into our rivers. Fish are failing to reproduce and frogs are dying off in disturbing rates as a result. This proven fact is largely ignored simply because of politics, but the studies showing the problem are relatively clear. One could use Natural Family Planning and the effects on the environment are ZERO, even as the method is 99% effective. (SeeThe Art of Natural Family PlanningorTaking Charge of Your Fertility, 10th Anniversary Edition: The Definitive Guide to Natural Birth Control, Pregnancy Achievement, and Reproductive Health) Zero chemicals in the water, zero latex in the landfills, and our bodies are not marred by expensive surgeries.So, this book tends to be ideologically extreme and unbalanced. But that shouldn't stop you from reading the book and profiting from its strengths.These criticisms out the way (the ideology of this author was really off-putting), the ideas about off the grid living, green living, sustainable living, and electricity-free living are wonderful, if predictable. Just don't tell the Amish to stop having babies. It isn't necessary."},{"Title":"When Technology Fails: A Manual for Self Reliance & Planetary Survival","review":"This is an excellent book. I had checked it out at the local library several times and decided it was THAT good so I bought it! IT has a lot of information for anyone wishing to become a a little more self sufficient.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"When Technology Fails: A Manual for Self Reliance & Planetary Survival","review":"A really good book covers most areas and has lots of helpful information I also had a copy sent to my son I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"When Technology Fails: A Manual for Self Reliance & Planetary Survival","review":"This book is a waste of time and money. The first fifty pages had maybe two pages of worthwhile information. The rest is his lectures on religion, peak and every other possible situation that could cause a collapse. I am already convinced it is a waste of my time to read his opinions. I want information that will help me deal with preparedness. The rest of his book is very wordy and the material could be covered in half the space. If you want a long boring read this is the book for you."},{"Title":"When Technology Fails: A Manual for Self Reliance & Planetary Survival","review":"This book combines three different topics in one. (1) It tries to educate us about why we should be concerned about hiccups and failures in the elaborate system that keeps us fed, sheltered, and comfortable; (2) It is a manual on some knowledge and techniques that will be good to know in the event of a major failure in those systems; and (3) it is a \\"survival manual\\" in the classic sense, describing what to do if you are on your own in an unfamiliar situation (such as lost in the deep woods). A lot of information in one book! This is potentially helpful for getting many of us to think about these subjects together--Something we might not do if we had to search out three separate books and integrate the information ourselves.The book has the weakness you might expect from such comprehensiveness. It is a fairly large book (certainly not something you'd take along on a trip just in case) and each topic gets only generic coverage. On the other hand, one of the big strengths of the book is that after each chapter there is a list of resources--Books, websites, or other information sources--And a brief discussion of the worth of each resource. This provides a good start on getting more information.There are some definite weaknesses in the information. The book takes many New Age ideas such as alternative medicine, dowsing, and Killer Electromagnetic Fields very seriously. Some readers will be put off by this. Plus there are some problems with some of the information that is there. To the author's credit, he keeps the section on guns very very brief, but he commits some howlers in that brief section--Recommending a .44 magnum pistol for someone who has to get their gun information from such a brief read (that wouldn't be a happy thing), and suggesting that we should all be worried about protection from bears--Bears will be the least of our worries in the type of civilization disruption he is writing about! The completeness of some information, such as subsistence farming, in one book is suspect, as you'd suspect from such wide topical coverage. I definitely wanted to read more about wind power, which I felt he gave short shrift compared to other energy subjects covered.On the plus side, the book is a very complete introduction to these topics, and it is well-written and easy to read. Recommended for anyone wanting an introduction but also realizing there's much more to learn outside the covers of this book."},{"Title":"When Technology Fails: A Manual for Self Reliance & Planetary Survival","review":"Excellent book for a wide range of topics related to survival. If you have read other survival books this one is more geared to pre-preperation and survival on a homefront or fixed location rather than finding yourself in a survival situation while traveling. However much of the information is usuable in a variety of situations and it appears more up to date than others. It also has plenty of info for use in non emergency/survival situation such as gardening and alternative energy generation etc..."},{"Title":"When Technology Fails: A Manual for Self Reliance & Planetary Survival","review":"I'm the kind of guy that wants to understand how things work- I'm not an engineer or anything like that- I'm just a regular guy. One of the things about our modern society that concerns me the most, is as new technology makes our lives simpler, we (the people not involved in implimenting the new technology) lose track of how things really work. This book is a handbook that describes the systems and techniques that our grandparents once knew and we (as members of modern society) have never learned.There are a lot of books out there that focus on singular aspects of what this author undertakes. I have not ever seen a book as comprehensive as this on the subject. Although the author is an engineer, the book is written for the layperson- and he does a great job doing it. It shows; he has extensively researched all of his topics and offers a huge reference section at the end of each of his chapters.This author has a keen understanding of where the modern world is going- if something isn't quickly done to change its course; but rather than just complaining about the problems the world faces, he offers time proven solutions that every one of us can utilize, on our own.With the threat of higher utility bills on the horizon, the timing of this book is uncanny. I truely believe that this may be one of the best books to have in the reference section of your personal library!"},{"Title":"When Technology Fails: A Manual for Self Reliance & Planetary Survival","review":"I saw a copy at my local library, and, like the Whole Earth Catalog, it contained a whole lot of stuff not related to survival--unless you count SOUL survival. Isn't that what the bible was written for?As someone who married a Boy Scout, preparedness is always top priority around here. I found my brother's old 70's field manual to be more helpful than anything else available (I stress OLD because new ones rely on pre-manufactured things like tents, sleeping bags, dried foods, etc.). Just what is a 2007 Boy Scout supposed to do in a TRUE emergency without access to those things? An old manual would have the answers--how to build shelter, hunt/prepare/store food, leave signs and trails, and how to disappear when needed--and how to do these things FROM SCRATCH!I, for one, don't see the need to buy this book. Like new Boy Scout manuals, it relies too much on the purchase of commercial items to \\"prepare\\". It's a Sears catalog for hippies."},{"Title":"When Technology Fails: A Manual for Self Reliance & Planetary Survival","review":"As an avid camper I own a few survival books. This book tops the others as it talks about sustainability and the \\"long emergency\\" The only problem I have with this book is that in many cases it refers to another book. Thus I would have to carry the referenced books as well as the main Stein book. There are times where it puts so little information it becomes useless for some of the chapters. I suggest the Camping & Wilderness Survival: The Ultimate Outdoors Book for a complete reference although it too is large especially for backpacking."},{"Title":"When Technology Fails: A Manual for Self Reliance & Planetary Survival","review":"Let's start with the shortcomings, which become very obvious as soon as you pick up the book:- Book is huge and heavy, it is the size of a laptop PC, sort of coffee table sized. It is highly impractical to take something this big with you and use it as a reference. It is even a little too large to read comfortably at home. So it fails at being a \\"Manual\\" as the long title implies.- Inconsistent topical coverage: there are chapters and passages about high level geopolitics and analysis of oil deposits, etc. which are followed by minute details about building a fire or cleaning a wound. Basically, the books tries to be an A-Z encyclopedia of sustainability and survival, which proves hard to do.- Not a particularly good *survival* guide. Kind of follows from the points above, too bulky and too much volume devoted to other stuff. However, also the typical survival topics are not covered with enough detail, and at times it felt like some content was lifted from other books (e.g. survival kits, animal snares), or at least overlapped enough to make it more worth your time to read more compact dedicated survival guides.So what is good about this book?- Comprehensive, covers a lot of topics, with good overview and pointers to further reading. Quotes and summarizes a lot of other writing on \\"long emergency\\" and survival, so you can spare yourself reading a ton of other books and get the gist of many topics. If you are interested in the details, however, you will have to read those other books.- Discussion of \\"long emergency\\" and sustainable living topics is excellent. Basically, these are the non-how-to portions of the book. Things like analysis of global warming, oil deposits, alternative energy, energy efficient buildings, etc. More focused and more readable than many other books I have encountered on these topics.- Extensive bibliography about all the topics discussed. Each chapter has a list of books, magazines, and retail outlets, with the author's summary of what they are about and recommendations. This is a great starting point for exploring any topic in depth.- Intelligent, logical, calm writing style. Although the topic is emergency and survival, the author does not come across as paranoid or extreme in his opinions. It is clear that the author has done a lot of research and done a great job summarizing and presenting it. Overall, the book is a pleasure to read as a result of that.This is a great book to introduce you to the overall survival and sustainable living topics, after which you are better off getting other resources as your go-to manuals and references."},{"Title":"When Technology Fails: A Manual for Self Reliance & Planetary Survival","review":"This book looks appealing only to find it tries to do way too much. It tries to cover every subject from cooking to trapping to providing your own western medicine from herbs and chemicals you make yourself. Way too much is covered and little or none in any detail enough to use in the real world. It should have been several books with more details or never been written... Do yourself a favor and do not get this or you will be using it as a coaster the day after you get it..."},{"Title":"When Technology Fails: A Manual for Self Reliance & Planetary Survival","review":"This book is full of helpful ideas on how to live with less reliance on electricity and fossil fuels. It's a combination of what you need in case of dire and sudden emergency, as well as how to prepare yourself and your family for drastic, but perhaps not sudden, changes in lifestyle as supplies of fossil fuels dwindle. \\"When Technology Fails\\" is an entertaining read even though it's informative and a great reference. Stein's conversational tone makes the material approachable by those who might ordinarily not be interested in thinking about the unpleasant possibility that our lives may not continue to proceed, awash in plenty, as they have up to this point. It is unfortunate that knowing what is necessary for survival and actually preparing oneself are not one and the same, for now I'm in the unenviable position of having no one but myself to blame if I end up in a natural disaster without the basic necessities."},{"Title":"When Technology Fails: A Manual for Self Reliance & Planetary Survival","review":"This book has a few good things to recommend it: clear sketches illustrating various techniques/ objects, recommended reading lists at the end of each chapter, and a broad subject base.Unfortunately, I found too many distracting and detracting factors to be impressed by the overall package. The author's extremely liberal bias provides permeates the work, tainting all his points. He spends much more time than is reasonable trying to convince readers why they should be concerned, considering that people who aren't already concerned are highly unlikely to even pick up such a work.It's over-sized binding makes it inconvenient to carry around or easily store, both factors that count when considering reference material to take into bad situations. The examples and anecdotes are pointless and irrelevant; unverified stories about miraculous intuition saving someone's life hardly teach the reader anything applicable or useful to themselves. Instruction on hypnotism and chakras in the medical chapter are not exactly what I imagine most preparedness seekers are looking for.The only reason to pick up this book is to check out the reference materials suggested at the end of every chapter; many of those are classics that will actually do you some good!"},{"Title":"When Technology Fails: A Manual for Self Reliance & Planetary Survival","review":"As a globetrotting President of a non profit Foundation working in rural India and Thailand, I have found When Technology Fails the most comprehensive and useful reference manual of all.

I was impressed when I received it but figured it would be more of a reference than something I'd read from cover to cover. That changed after reading the first couple chapters - I was hooked and am almost tbrough the entire book. The material is presented in a very clear and concise format with enough detail to be informative without overloading the reader. Each topic is then followed by a comprehensive list of references for further education. The author is an engineer by education and has experience in many of the areas covered. This is evident in his approach to the topics. If there is a single theme that is most prevalent - it's sustainability - the need for both industry and individuals to prosper without depleting resources. This is not based on extreme environmentalism but rather the logic of limited natural resources being strained by (1) population growth, (2) the emergence of China, India and other countries as industrial / consummer nations and (3) the damage already done to our water / ecosystems.

While many paint vivid pictures of a bleak future, Stein, acknowledging such a trajectory, attempts to equip his readers with tools--not only practical survival ones--but also spiritual, communal, and intellectual perspectives on their application and does so in hope for adaptation and amelioration of the path mankind seems determined to follow. This book is chocked full of information, resources and pointers from shelter, food production and storage to medical care and safety. Few survival books make as thorough an attempt to cover both the immediate and the long term, the emergency and the steady state, as this one. Some other reviewers have been turned off by the occasional expression of his environmentalist perspectives and by the size of the book. Personally, I would prefer to know the agenda of an author than have it hidden, and if I were stranded on a deserted island, I would hope that my survival book would be large enough to contain all info I would likely need. This book is an excellent attempt to do just that. Stein draws on his experience as engineer, contractor, mountaineer and father to share the wealth of his experience and knowledge with his audience. Man has shown a propensity through the ages to \\"shoot the messengers\\" of \\"inconvenient truths.\\" Rather than deny the obvious and stick our heads in the sand, better to be given a shovel and directions on how to dig our way out. \\"When Technology Fails\\" is certainly one book you will want to have in your tool kit for the coming years."},{"Title":"When Technology Fails: A Manual for Self Reliance & Planetary Survival","review":"This book is a fascinating book.

I will keep looking for a book that has it laid out easier."},{"Title":"When Technology Fails: A Manual for Self Reliance & Planetary Survival","review":"Firstly I found the book just another \`survival' book and to be honest found it a waste of my money. I felt it was a case of yet another jumping on the band wagon to make a few pence. This stuff can be found on the Internet with a little work.Although what he says about having a hope \`that many millions of people will wake up to the realization that making the shift to sustainability is a matter of economic and ecological survival' is all well and good he misses the main thing that sustainability will be unsustainable without the massive reduction in world population that will be needed to support it.His list of top ten most crucial survival skills are just that, they are survival for the short term and not for sustainability. There is nothing for the longer term and as previously said it is just another \`survival' book.All the instances he mentions of people helping people are \`local', not national or global. Come a national or global collapse of the sort we consider and debate, and that we have no historic precedence to look back on it will be totally different. Even though the Romans could be considered national, or larger, they were an occupying army and not the nation.Such degeneration is likely to be accompanied by the break down and even obliteration of most of the mechanisms and social infra-structure for the relatively peaceful co-existence that we take for granted in our world of today. This includes civil structures such as the judicial system, the police and a wide range of general services provided by local and central government - all of which we take for granted until they are no longer there.When a civilization goes splat, the technologies that supported it tend to go with it. This is particularly true of systems that are based on highly interdependent technologies such as ours today.If it happens to enough people over a short enough period of time, the chaos will be phenomenal. In effect, the spiritual (and I use the term very loosely) foundation of civilization will have been largely destroyed. Many people would find this level of change uncomfortable to say the least. The massive level of discomfort will tend to do for the physical foundation as well, what with panic, riots, hoarding, and general brouhaha.Most people have never had to cope with sustained, substantial levels of fear, either in themselves or in others in close proximity. I will say I believe you should be prepared to see and deal with behaviour you would never have believed possible from civilized humans. The reason you should avoid crowds has to do with the fact that individual frustration is one thing, but the frustration of many people feeds individual frustration and fear, which, of course, feeds the frustration of the crowd.The cycle will feed itself until either the root source of frustration is relieved or there is a catastrophic event, such as a riot or even worse.He says \\"Making the Shift to Sustainability\\" will not be easy, but it is doable, and it is much better than the alternative. Shouldn't saving the planet be at the top of our world's priority list?Yes I would agree, it is doable, but only if the population level of the world is reduced, and that is the problem. This is the elephant in the corner.It is another thing to debate that question and as to how it may be achieved.From reading the comments attached to the post I also have the opinion that many do not really understand the problem, the cause or the remedy.I am beginning to feel that we are going to have to collapse and go through all the pain before we can even contemplate trying to rebuild. But then I have the thought, will we be able to rebuild and to what level. Certainly nowhere near to the level that we are now and not for many centuries. We will be lucky to hold a pre-industrial revolution, low technology, Victorian type technology.Nature feeds us and nature will have to rebuild."},{"Title":"When Technology Fails: A Manual for Self Reliance & Planetary Survival","review":"This is not the kind of book that I want to read.

Against this factual background Stang has created a fascinating tale about attempts to locate and rescue POW's left behind in Vietnam and how Soviet agents ruthlessly block those efforts. The efforts in America of patriots and the counter efforts of Red agents here are alternated with chapters set in Vietnam as the Soviets operating within the Vietnamese communists' framework manipulated, tortured and sometimes successfully conditioned some POW's to return and do their bidding. An astute reader will speculate on whether Stang modeled his fictional former POW who attains a high position in Congress on an actual political personage. Great reading with one bit of sweet fictional revenge by a Vietnam hero on those who sold us out will cheer the hearts of most patriots and cause them to say, &quot;Oh, that it could be!&quot;"},{"Title":"Perestroika Sunset","review":"The subject matter of Alan Stang's novel, Perestroika Sunset, addresses an issue that has always plagued me since the first time learned of this possible topic: did we leave POWs behind in Vietnam? And Korea? Did our government considered these brave heroes expendable to get out of the quagmire they had created?That is the bottom line of this novel. However, whoever wrote the book jacket cover didn't read the book. Labeled as &quot;A Daughter's Lifelong Search For Her MIA Father In Vietnam,&quot; only a portion of the book is devoted to this quest. The events surrounding her efforts are not credible and do not seem authentic, especially the revelation that she is a Marine at the end of the book it so surprising that it rings untrue. No hints are given throughout the book's 522 pages that this is a possible scenario.The inside book jacket also says that the novel is about four men: Jason Fawkes, a Marine POW left behind; Dave Cord, who had promised to come back and get him after Fawkes saved his life on &quot;The Day&quot;; a Russian intelligence agent, General B. E. Kariloff, who is intent on toppling the United States government; and the fourth, a dead ringer for Fawkes and Soviet agent who will try to take his place when the U.S. brings the long-lost POWs home. The press release I received with the review request listed all of the major players (a total of eight) in this work. It's too bad that Stang didn't put include them in the novel; it might have been easier to follow.The fact that the book addresses the issues of men left behind is the high point of the novel. Another is that readers get a good feel for life in Southeast Asia.The events in the novel's first seven chapters happen to quickly to be believable. Fawkes's and Cord's exploits are well done and believable, but only from an outsider's point of view. I don't feel that the author ever visited Vietnam nor, I felt, did he speak with any of the POW/MIA families or former POWs themselves.The ending of the novel is too &quot;told.&quot; The old rule of fiction---show, don't tell---is missing in the very last chapter. It feels that Stang got tired of writing and just conveniently rapped up all the loose ends, which disappointed this reader to no end.Perestroika Sunset makes readers wonder whether the possibility of soldiers still being held in captivity. However, most can wonder by themselves without having to wade through 522 pages."},{"Title":"Perestroika Sunset","review":"A book about prisoners of war is usually regarded as a man's book; however, this is a woman's book, too. For men, there is the grittiness of the Vietnam war - the dirt, heat, fear - I felt as if I were with those men in Vietnam before, during and after they were captured! For the women, there is the identification with the heroine, Gay, a college professor and Olymipic gold medalist, who searches untiringly for her father. We can also identify with the women who were the mothers, wives, daughters and sweethearts of those lost in Vietnam; their unrequited love, their years of frustration working with stonewalling government bureaucrats and politicians, and their feeling that they have been lied to all along.Alan Stang brilliantly weaves a story from threads of duty, honor, country, love, and history with those of political deception, treachery, and villianry. Perestroika Sunset brings out many of the reasons why America became involved in the Vietnam War and why it was never resolved.I never mark a book while reading it; however, my copy of Perestroika Sunset is heavily marked in the margins with notes, key phrases, and Alan's clever turns of phrases.Perestroika Sunset alternately made me cry, laugh and be outraged over the government's lack of regard for our servicemen and their families. I was on the edge of my seat and cheered when the villians received their just reward.Perestroika Sunset will stay on my list of all-time favorites. In fact, I have purchased several copies already and given them to friends.For those who liked Mel Gibson in &quot;Braveheart&quot; and &quot;The Patriot&quot;, you will agree with me that &quot;Perestroika Sunset&quot; should be his next movie."},{"Title":"Perestroika Sunset","review":"Alan Stang delivers a scathing denouncement of the United States Government and its part in the MIA/POW cover-up and related issues during the Vietnam war and the Communist plot to block efforts to search for these men. We have already heard rumors that such a plot existed, and at least one politician in this story has to be based on a real person. Read the book, you'll recognize him. I came away with a whole new perspective of our involvement in Vietnam.This was a very difficult book to read because of the subject matter and the psychological issues, but I couldn't put it down. Alan Stang takes us relentlessly to the surprising conclusion. The story is about the men who were missing in action, but also about the women who waited at home and their years of frustration, and knowing that they have been the victims of lies. Gay Fawkes is the daughter of the main character, Jason Fawkes. She's a college professor and Olympic gold medalist who lost her father at the age of eleven. This is the story of her heroic search for the father who was a prisoner of the VietCong for twenty-two years.The battle scenes are realistic and bloody. The revenge scenes will have you cheering out loud. Stang's craftsmanship and storytelling is awsome. The characters are well developed; you'll feel their disappointments and pain. Stang has written ten books, mostly non-fiction dealing with scams and cover-ups. He's an author to watch for."},{"Title":"Perestroika Sunset","review":"&quot;Perestroika Sunset&quot; is a godsend for our beloved Country. This book will reinvigorate the patriotic devotion Americans hold for our soldiers and especially those who were left behind as Prisoners Of War or those listed as Missing In Action. Alan Stang presents a facinating drama of a woman's unrelenting and life long quest to free her Marine father from his North Vietnamese captors. Intertwined in the story line are powerful history lessons that I pray my countrymen will learn. When learning how cruelly our fighting men are treated and how the &quot;leaders&quot; of America betray and abandon them, one becomes flush with anger and shame and wonders what has become of the land of the free and the home of the brave. The book is so realistic that I wanted to go and help liberate these courageous soldiers. There are a lot of exciting twists and turns and the reader remains enthralled with the action in this book. The probability that some of our men are still being held and are undergoing torture is gut wrenching.

Leaves rustle in a gentle summer breeze. Eveningtraffic murmurs. Nocturnal creatures serenade the oppressivehumidity. Humans make dinner. But this is a Perestroika sunset,because a deep-cover Soviet GRU agent tries to kill the daughter of aUS Marine Captain Missing In Action in Vietnam. Gay Fawkes is theleader of a POW/MIA group, and she's beginning to uncover informationcertain politicians want to hide from the American people.(By thetime I got past Perestroika Sunset's third chapter, I was so intenselyinvolved in the story my hands kept doubling into fists, I could tastestomach acid, and I couldn't take a deep breath.)In the nextseveral chapters you'll hump through the boonies of Vietnam, carry anAK-47 or a shotgun, pull leeches out of your crotch, and, if yourespond as I did, be physically and emotionally exhausted after yourmeetings with \\"Charley,\\" the Vietcong.Then you'llparticipate in a critically important, dangerous and illegal missionin North Vietnam, where NVA regulars wipe out most of your team andcapture your leader, U.S. Marine Captain Jason Fawkes. His Sovietinterrogator tortures him unspeakably, but he endures, beating histormentors in a deadly, mental game. By now, he has lived incaptivity, abandoned, for 22 years.But Perestroika Sunset is notjust another novel about combat. At home, Fawkes's wife, valiantlytrying to keep her truncated family together, is driven to despair,alcohol and worse. Their daughter, Gay, savagely abused, strugglesagainst government corruption, Soviet cunning, public apathy andignorance, compounded by the dominant media's vulgar treatment of thePOW/MIA issue.All this is merely the start of probably the mostexciting, ingenious, and realistic novel ever written about one ofAmerica's most heartrending issues: the men we left behind in Vietnam.Later, a Soviet-trained seductress sets her sights on a memorablysleazy Member of Congress, a literary character you will not soonforget. Then the Soviets shoot down a commercial 747. It ditchessafely in the Sea of Japan, they capture its crew and passengers,including a U.S. Congressman - and claim that there were nosurvivors.And a former Conscientious Objector becomes a savage,calculating combat operative dedicated to solving a mystery thatthreatens the Free World. First you join this ex-CO in anassassination assignment in Laos and North Vietnam. Then you join himand Gay Fawkes in high intrigue in Hanoi, and in the hills of westernVietnam and Cambodia, in firefights with Pathet Lao and Spetsnazforces. Your travels then take you through a Hmong village, nextthrough Bangkok, and finally back to Washington, D.C.I thinkthis book's savvy - street, technical, especially political -tops Tom Clancy. The author's understanding of international affairs,world history, and geography is immense. The subject is complicated.It is easy to see why it took so long to write. His knowledge of KGB,GRU and Politburo tactics is truly encyclopedic. (Caution: Because hedescribes these things in detail, this book should be consideredunsuitable for children.)But those things defer to the fact thatAlan Stang is a masterful storyteller. Perestroika's dialogue is adelight, the humor subtle and irreverent. It builds to a totallysurprising climax unlike anything I have ever read.

Winch's monograph argues precisely this position with style and verve, holding that social concerns are properly related more to philosophy than the Natural Sciences.

I got this book because I am interested in developing probabilistic approaches to predicting failure rates for our components, particularly when used in heretofore unexplored environments. I was aware that the marine industry had a long history of attempting just that. I have been working through the book and have found a number of typographical errors (the answers for example 16.1 on 325-326 are incorrect) and the author assumes that you know where some equations come from. I've read several editions of Roark & Young (2nd - 6th) and have no idea where the equations in example 17.1 came from. Perhaps stress analysts who design welds in ships will recognize them but I couldn't find anyone who did. (Is W the section modulus as defined in Bryars, Snyder and Plants? I don't know because W is not defined and subsequent equations don't look familiar either.)Evan so, the parts of the book that stand alone do an adequate job of explaining and illustrating the concepts and I suspect my goal of learning and developing probabilistic thinking will be reached.

Mother's pass along factual books and try to bravely discuss it with their daughters, who approach it with mixed feelings. \\"It\\" has been called many things in American culture, but in Navajo culture, it is celebrated at a Kinaalda.A young woman's Kinaalda is celebrated around the time of her first menstrual cycle. She celebrates the time when she is being shaped into a woman in a ceremony that lasts two to four days. Photographer and writer, Monty Roessel, allows us to be privledged viewers of 13 year old Celinda McKelvey's Kinaalda. During the ceremony, Celinda wears a traditional blanket dress, takes on the adult role of grinding corn to make a huge corn cake, is literally molded into a woman by the hands of others, and runs a race for blessings of health and longevity. It is a trial of endurance, as growing up often is.This book presents a view of menstruation that can be difficult to convey to the newly initiated and to those who are still waiting. This book tells us that it is a time to celebrate. It is a time to acknowledge becoming a woman. Celinda is both honored and validated in her new status. She finds support and positive attention during her Kinaalda. Even though many young women outside of the Navajo culture may not want a ceremony for their special time, this book is an asset to own. It is a wonderful way to see this experience across cultural beliefs."},{"Title":"Kinaalda: A Navajo Girl Grows Up (We Are Still Here)","review":"Cultures celebrate children's coming-of-age in many different ways, but one of the nicest (at least for girls) is the Navajo Kinaalda ceremony, celebrating the girl's maturing into womanhood.In this real-life story, readers watch as Celinda McKelvey, at age 13, celebrates her maturity over several days at the family's traditional Hogan, used mostly for ceremonies.In a Navajo blanket dress and buckskin moccasins, specially made for her celebration, and decorated with turquoise and silver necklaces, Celinda grinds corn for a cake large enough to feed the entire family, and she is \\"molded\\" into the woman she is becoming, after which she runs into the sun---first at daybreak (since for Navajos, all things begin in the east) and sunset---a way of asking for long life and good health.The book also explains the resurgence of Navajo tradition after long decades during which the U.S. government forcibly removed Navajo children from the reservation and tried to teach them Western culture, language and job skills.Learning Western culture and English are of course critically important for success, but not at the expense of children's family lives and destruction of centuries' of tradition.Growing up is difficult, particularly for girls reaching puberty. The Kinaalda is a beautiful native American way to celebrate the hopes and successes along with the future opportunities too often expressed by fear."},{"Title":"Kinaalda: A Navajo Girl Grows Up (We Are Still Here)","review":"My wife and I recently made friends with a Navajo woman with a thirteen year old daughter preparing for this major event in her life. I, like most, had never even heard of this ceremony. I was fascinated and wanted to find out more. This book, even though designed for young, preteen readers, was fun to read and very informative. After reading, I gave it to our friend to give to her daughter. They both enjoyed it as well. There are numerous pictures that follow along with the character in the book as she goes through different parts of the ceremony. Bottom line: a great book, just as described and fast shipment. Very happy with my purchase."},{"Title":"Kinaalda: A Navajo Girl Grows Up (We Are Still Here)","review":"I bought several books dealing with Navajo culture; wanted to introduce my 11-yr old step-daughter to the Navajo's \\"healthier\\" point of view celebrating female puberty.

I recommend this book for similar education/similar age levels."},{"Title":"Statistical decision theory and Bayesian analysis (Springer series in statistics)","review":"This book (which is becoming somewhat of a classic) is simply outstanding. The author's philosophical and mathematical reasoning is impeccable. This book is very deep and will not just teach you theory and techniques but will teach you how to think and how to approach and formulate problems, as well as how to interpret the results obtained by various methods and use them in a practical setting. This book is very practically oriented. The best thing about this book, however, is that it is so clearly written. Berger is an outstanding writer with the ability to communicate difficult concepts without watering them down.This book covers decision theory and Bayesian statistics in much depth. While it is a high-level text oriented towards researchers and people with strong backgrounds, it is clear enough that someone learning this material for the first time would have little trouble with it. It provides ample review and clear exposition of key mathematical and statistical concepts such as sufficiency, convexity. Its exposition of invariance (with respect to groups of transformations) is both the clearest and most rigorous I have found in any statistics text. In my opinion, there are no weak or unclear sections in the book, and the difficulty level does not rise disproportionately in later chapters the way it does in many books on similar subjects.This book is rich with examples, and the examples are mostly of a practical nature, in contrast to the \\"toy\\" mathematical examples that dominate many books written at this advanced level. The exercises are diverse and extensive, and have a good gradient of difficult level for building both technical skill and depth of understanding. The exercises are more carefully worded and constructed than is typical for books at this level. Most of the typos have been caught and corrected in the revised edition.This is an old book. The author, in his philosophy, was arguably well ahead of his time. The ideas contained in this book are highly modern. However, the use of computers in statistics has changed since this book was written. This book is a book on theory and will teach you how to do things by hand. I do not see this as a weakness at all, but one should be aware of it when considering this book. But, as the other author noted, it will not teach you algorithms, numerical techniques, or how to use a statistical computing package.I think this book would make an outstanding textbook for a course in statistical decision theory or Bayesian statistics. It would also be useful as a supplement for a course in statistical inference. Perhaps more importantly, it is very useful for self-study. I think this book would make an excellent addition to any statistician's collection--and it would certainly be useful to people working in more practical settings, such as business, science, or social science. If you are going to buy any one advanced, theoretical book on statistics, this would be the one to buy."},{"Title":"Statistical decision theory and Bayesian analysis (Springer series in statistics)","review":"[1] It is a classical book written by an excellent mathematician, not a worker of statistics![2] Its mathematics is precise and fascinating.[3] The philosophy of Bayesian statistics is well discussed.[4] It's worthy to read it many times.[5] At the time of its publication, the revolutionary computational statistics was still in gestation.

Max Lucado weaves contemporary stories together with Biblical events to bring a fresh and multi-faceted view of how people were affected by what Jesus did. There's the prodigal son, the woman caught in adultery, the widow of Nain, Lazarus, the thief at the cross among others. All saw new meaning to life, experienced forgiveness from God, and the promise of resurrection and eternal life when they came to the Saviour. The last chapter was the most touching and described the final glance as Max's dad lay dying, paralleling it with the final look by the centurion as Jesus died on the cross.This book is inspiring and explains the anchor points that you should hold onto when life's hurricanes hit. That basically Jesus has done it all for you on the cross, and that your life is not futile, your failures are not fatal, and your death is not final. Jesus has purchased you with His Blood, and promises you forgiveness of sins if you come to him, and not only that, but eternal life. Therefore anchor your soul to the Rock of Salvation and He will hold onto you throughout life's storms."},{"Title":"Six Hours One Friday: Anchoring to the Power of the Cross","review":"I have several of Max Lucado's books, and have never been disappointed.

Two of the three original editors have selected, organized and restructered the content into a more practical and handy volume with the chapters updated and re-written with a practical focus in mind. The OTM is now in its fourth edition, three volumes and therefore not the first choice of book for the medical student or the young physician in training with a busy schedule. That has been the rationales behind this condensed version.The book is in twenty sections: Starting out with pain management (for some unknown reason), cardiology, hematology, respiratory disease, gastroenterology, metabolic disorders, endocrine disease, nutrition, disorders of the skeleton, rheumatology, diseases of the skin, nephrology, neurology, psychiatry, palliative medicine, infectious disease, sexually transmited disease, chemical and physical injuries and environmental factors and disease, geratology and finally forensic medicine. Each section will usually have many chapters with specific subjects.Looking in depths at the first and last chapters we found a good review with practical applications to every day clinical life. Looking at other chapters with questions in our daily clinical activities, during this review period, we found an international approach, readable, informative chapters and a good practical index. We think the editors have done a hard, but wonderful job, which will benefit many students and young phycicians in general medicine and practice. The Concise Oxford textbook of medicine should be a good choice for the medical student, the busy hospital physician or the general practitioner in family medicine.Profesor Joav Merrick, MD, DMScDirector, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Schneider Children&#8217;s Medical Center of Israel, Sackler Schol of Medicine, Tel Aviv University and Medical Director, Division for Mental Retardation, Box 1260, IL-91012 Jerusalem, Israel.Mohammed Morad, MDFamily Physician, Department of Family Medicine, Ben Gurion University,Box 653, IL-84105 Beer-Sheva, Israel.

Maxwell owns his own company and knows how important it is to socialize, but he is tired of everyone trying to set him up. Max offers Jane Elliot a practical marriage. He spells out in detail what he is offering and that it is not love or children. Jane accepts this 100%. Only on their wedding night they make love and the result is a baby. The morning after Max regrets making love to Jane because of the feelings that she stirs in him. Jane is confused by his sudden withdrawl from her, but she is okay to go on with the marriage until she finds out she is pregnant. While Max is on a business trip she sneaks off and never has any intention of looking back or telling Max about the baby.This is where I have a big problem with the story. Althought the idea of a 'practical marriage' sounded crazy--both Jane and Max agreed. The both made love that night and created a baby. Yes, Max said he did not want children, but that does not give Jane the right to run off and not tell him that she is pregnant. I am probably in the minority, but I hate any and all stories that involve a woman not telling a man that she is pregnant. To me, it is selfish and I found myself getting angry with Jane and being unable to sympathize with her. Granted, Max never told Jane why he never wanted kids, but she never asked, and never gave him a chance to explain. I felt sorry for Max and the child that was going to be deprived of a father if Max did not 'accidentally' discover that Jane was pregnant. My strong opinion colored my view of the story and I was unable to feel anything but annoyed at Jane.Max is not perfect, but he at least tries to make his marriage work. A person can only take so much pain and rejection and I believe Jane pushes hers to the limit, but you read and decide for yourself. A person that does not share my strong opinions about men having the right to know thay are going to be fathers might enjoy this book, but if you share my opinions be prepared to not like this story or how it plays out.I made myself read this book because I read the next book about Emma in The Major and the Librarian by Nikki Benjamin.

Classic sword and sorcery written by the man who practically invented it. If all you've read are Conan pastiches by recent authors, you owe it to yourself to experience the original."},{"Title":"The People of the Black Circle","review":"One of the better Robert E. Howard tales of Conan, this novella has Conan in amorous pursuit of the adventuress and former pirate, Valeria of the Red Brotherhood. Valeria remains stand-offish and wary of Conan's advances, but action is precipitated in the form of a dinosaur that flushes them out of the jungle across a dry plain to the traditional lost city. There they meet two factions of a dying race, locked in a death struggle to exterminate each other. Blood, death, degeneracy, lust, and ancient magic mix in equal parts from there.The distinctiveness of this volume is that this is the first form where the story stands alone, published without being part of a collection or pulp magazine serialization. My copy has held up well physically over 35 years, as all my Donald M. Grant publications have. Fantasy illustrator George Barr has four color plates (attached to colored pages rather than bound in), four full-page line illustrations, and seven half-page chapter page illustrations, with some odds and ends thrown in. Barr is an interesting choice for Conan, since he is less of the blood and guts type (Frazetta). The color illustrations, which are his usual softer colorizations dependent more on design than action (though he does throw in one scene of frenzied mayhem) are very different in execution from his ink work, which depend on heavily contoured lines.This remains my favorite of all the Conan novels that Donald M. Grant published, both for the story and the illustrations."},{"Title":"The People of the Black Circle","review":"I read the classics--Conrad, Bronte', London and Homer, but Howard has nailed a classic story here. The sheer visual force of the images of palaces, monsters, and strange people make you feel like you're actually there.

It's fun and exciting and represents the franchise well. And the price is unbeatable!"},{"Title":"The People of the Black Circle","review":"I read the comic adaptation of Red Nails long before I read this book, and I must say the book is a great deal more enjoyable than the comic. However, with Robert E. Howard, \\"enjoyable\\" is a relative term. I honestly don't think he intended for his stories to be enjoyed. They are far too dark, depressing, and hopeless for terms like \\"enjoyable\\" to apply. What Howard does in Red Nails, just as he did in The Shadow of the Vulture, is paint a picture of the absolute worst in human nature. The city of Xuchotl is basically a look at human nature under a magnifying glass, devolved to its lowest possible state, until mere existence itself becomes a hellish nightmare that can only be endured by saying goodbye to one's sanity. On the surface, Howard's stories seem to be simple action/adventure fare, but a closer look reveals the stuff that we find in our worst nightmares, the visions and feelings that we have in our darkest moments. I can settle the debates about Howard's mental state right now: he was a disturbed individual. He had to have been touched to write such cynical, dark and hopeless stories. Even his main character, Conan, doesn't fill the role of the \\"good\\" triumphing over evil, for in Howard's world there is no real good. Rather Conan is a representation of the raw, primal urge to survive, no matter what the odds. It's not that Conan is any more virtuous than the creatures and men he fights--it's that he simply knows what it takes to remain standing in the end. And that seems to be one of the questions Howard asks in his stories: is it better to be one of the slain, or one of the few left alive at the story's end? Is it really worth it for the ones still standing, given how random, cruel, and merciless the universe is? What exactly do we fight for, if to be locked in combat is mankind's most basic state? This is not a tale that I'll be revisiting, although it was an entertaining read."},{"Title":"The People of the Black Circle","review":"I have to say I was disappointed with this book. I am a fan of Conan, but I found Red Nails to be dark (literally and figuratively), hard to follow, and a little confusing. Not much 'swashbuckle' for a Conan work. I would definitely not recommend this one."},{"Title":"The People of the Black Circle","review":"Take a trip into our barbaric past, when the white race did not question the necessity of manifest destiny or the need to subdue non- whites by violence, and women existed as chattel and threat to male dominance. This collection of stories is not politically correct, and hopefully readers' enjoyment will contend with their discomfort at Howard's obvious racism and sexism. Readers should know that Howard was destroyed by the very system he so faithfully represents in his stories; he committed suicide during the Great Depression due to his distressed economic situation. For a blunt representation of the mind set that led to the internment camps, the Tuskegee medical experiments, and Hiroshima/ Nagasaki, this anthology is unsurpassed.

It offers unique insight into the lessor-known weapons of feudal Japan, including kobuki (small/minor weapons), hibuki (secret weapons), and kakushibuki (hidden weapons).Weapons addressed in detail include stuff like jitte, marohoshi, chidorigane, shuriken, and kusari-gama. Content includes bladed weapons (e.g., wakizashi, tanto, kubizashi, kama, jitte, marohoshi), small hand-held weapons (e.g., shutogane, tessho, dokko, suntetsu, tekken), truncheons (e.g., kabutowari, tetto, nashi, tetsuniyoi, hanbo, tanbo), miscellaneous hand weapons (e.g., kanamuchi, tamazue, hogu, kakute, kaginawa), chain weapons (e.g., konpi, kusariryuta, mijin, kusarigama, kursaibo, kusarijutte), shuriken (e.g., yarihogata, tanogata, kuji, senban, shiken, kamagata, tetsumari), deceptive weapons (e.g., yatate, shikomibue, tessen, jutte).

Incredibly detailed and thoroughly researched, it is the Magnum Opus on the subject of non-sword weaponry in ancient Japan. Swords have been covered extensively in many books, so it is very worthwhile to give the rest of the arsenal their due.A history lesson as well as a weapons guide, \\"Classical Weaponry of Japan\\" compiles the secret scrolls of the various fighting schools of old Japan, along with the collections of noted weapons-scholar Fumon Tanaka and the authors personal collection of ancient weapons. From these, Serge Mol not only describes the weapons, their fighting styles, their lineage, but also the historical genesis behind the creations.The sword being the legal property of the Samurai class, and its wearing and use highly proscribed, the non-Samurai citizens of Japan were incredibly creative in their adaptation of daily implements into lethal weapons. Also, each fighting school, in order to attract students, created a unique and secret arsenal of weapons available only to their high-ranking adherents. In this way, a warrior could unveil a weapon that his opponent had never seen, and thus would be unsure as to how to defend against.The book is divided into seven categories of weapons, such as bladed weapons, small hand-held weapons, truncheon-like weapons, shuriken and shurikenjutsu, and deceptive weapons. Each category then contains sub-categories, with several weapons described. Altogether, more than 100 different weapons are showcased, along with their histories and uses. Most weapons are accompanied by photographs, and several are shown in use. Some favorites include the spectacular Kusarigama (Sickle and Chain), which I have seen used in several films due to its visual flair, and the beautifully decorated Omamorito (Protection Knife) which high-ranking women carried in order to kill themselves should they be \\"dishonoured\\" during a castle raid.A necessary book for weapons and martial arts enthusiasts, it is also a perfect reference book for writers and readers of ancient Japan, including those interested in Samurai films and comics."},{"Title":"Classical Weaponry of Japan","review":"I just finished reading \\"Classical Weaponry of Japan: Special Weapons and Tactics of the Martial Arts by Serge Mol\\", But I know this book wont get covered by dust.

Whereas the '70s book listed all the iconic films of the 1970s, Movies of the 90s excludes some of the most definitive - such as Reservoir Dogs - and opts for stuff that wasn't even very good. (Such as Crash.)If this was a list of the iconic films of the '90s such as \\"Films of the 70s\\" was, then perhaps including Dumb and Dumber also would have been a smart move.

No Moses? No Egyptian enslavement? No Abraham? No Exodus? It's all allegory? Once the theory is explained, it becomes painfully evident: the beautiful purposes of the writers of the Torah were to form the hearts and minds of the Jewish people into a community that believed in itself, believed in its God, and took on a mission to become &quot;a light to the Gentiles&quot; as well as a spiritually empowered nation. The Torah seems to have been just an invention, but an inspired one at that: a god who spoke up for the oppressed, a god who would never abandon you (provided you never lose faith), and a religion with promise of blessings for all the world. This is what the author has convincingly given us, and the effect of widespread discovery of this information will make us all more authentically religious but released from the boxes of belief that is Judaism and Christianity. We can at last join the rest of the world in its awe-filled and necessarily mysterious life, living in the only kind of spirituality that is possible now: an open-minded, open-hearted acceptance of the way things are, ready with Job to cover our mouths with our hands, ready with Jesus to hope for an eternal life somehow or other."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland/Coloring Book (NanaBanana Classics)","review":"When I first read this as a child I didn't understand it and I didn't really like it.

Marcus's home life isn't much better -- his depressed mother has just attempted suicide. Despite Will's commitment to noncommitment, he finds himself slipping into the role of father and friend for Marcus.Single moms, precocious kids, immature lads -- none of these things are terribly original. It's Hornby's way of handling them that is really original. And the way he wrote \\"About A Boy\\" gives unusual life to what could have been a TV-movie-of-the-week/lame-sitcom plot, with cliched characters.Instead, Hornby has created a surprisingly mature book, by showing a realistic portrayal of an immature man growing up whether he likes it or not. But Hornby's quietly insightful prose is a little less self-consciously cool than in \\"High Fidelity,\\" and it's also more focused on human experiences. And no, not just Will picking up single mums.Will is a pretty accurate portrayal of men who work hard at being immature -- believe me, he's accurate. And that makes it even more satisfying to see him graduating into adulthood. Marcus's chapters are deeper, however, and it's this pensive kid who grounds the book.

As an avid reader I strongly prefer to read the material prior to seeing the movie. But my interest in the movie and the exceptional writing, directing and acting compelled me to study whether this was an abortion of the book (Semi-tough) or massive improvement (Less than Zero). To my surprise, the movie followed the book including dialog 90% of the time. Yes, the ending is somewhat different but nothing that destroys the central story line.

As usual, Nick Hornby's prose is straightforward, yet funny, full of sharp observations. The characters of Will and Marcus are pretty well fleshed-out and distinct; it's easy to believe the characters would realistically develop the way that they do and think they way they think, etc. The only criticism I have is that the sentimentality is a bit heavy-handed at times, but it definitely didn't interfere with my enjoyment of the book as a whole."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Finished this book up last night just around midnight, and I would have to say it was a delight.

Hornby's detached, uncompromised style is a relief. The reading is very light and entertaining. The question that remains is: who is the \\"boy\\" in the title?Marcus is a son of separated parents. His father is a far-away jerk. His mother is a suicuidal, depressed hippie (!). He just moved to London, and he is not doing very well in school, and in fact he's not doing very well in life. He has the wrong clothes, the wrong hair, he's a vegetarian, and has no friends. On the other hand, Will Freeman (a little too obvious name) is a 36-year-old who has no job because he is rich enough to afford a pacate life. He has no family, no children, and only shallow friends. His non-life objective is to meet women so he can take them to bed. Marcus and Will meet and they help each other to achieve a better living to both of them, taking their lives and using what's best in them.The portuguese title of this book is \\"Um grande garoto\\", which, when put in english, has two meanings: \\"A great boy\\" and \\"A big boy\\". The portuguese title is the summary of the book. \\"About a boy\\" is about two boys: one, a grown-up living the life every kid would want, but he's getting tired of it; the other, a kid living his life with the seriousness and responsibilities of a grown-up, and he's alreay tired of it.Hornby's universe is very pontual, small, but his characters and the relationships between them are very complex, and that's what makes his books so unforgettable. Hornby has re-defined pop-culture, adding to it a new meaning and the face of the nineties.Grade 8.9/10"},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Will Freeman (his name is ironic, as he tries to free himself for responsibility for anyone but himself) is 36, single, no kids, hip, living in London on royalties from his father's one hit. Marcus is 12, solitary, teased, worried about his suicidal single mom, and \\"doesn't get\\" a lot of things. When Will comes up with a scheme to meet emotionally needy single moms by pretending to be a single father--he figures they will have affairs with him, then realize he is not right for their kids and dump him, so no commitments--the result is that he meets Marcus, who soon figures out that Will has no kid. What starts as blackmail on Marcus's part quickly evolves into a relationship somewhere between friend and uncle, a relationship opposed by Marcus's mother, who fears the obvious. The relationship is frayed, until Will decides to resurrect the \\"single parent\\" scheme, with Marcus in the role of the kid . . .A delightful and suddenly humorous journey to maturity for both Will and Marcus. Far better than the movie, and avoids the movie's soppy resolution.

I picked up Fever Pitch several years ago in London and was entralled with his life defining relationship with a football team. Arsenal none-the-less and I have been a fan ever since. . .of both.About a Boy is simply a marvelous book. There is a heartwarming and joyous nature that will cause everyone to find a way to relate to this book. It is simply a fascinating development of characters and Marcus and Will are nothing short of hilarious as they wander through their lives, both understanding the other's life more than there own.I spent many a day on the bus or eating lunch in downtown Cincinnati laughing outloud and only then briefly looking around to see if anyone had noticed. In the end it made no difference because Marcus is well worth any sort of public scene.Regardless of wether you have read Hornby, read this book. He is a master of his characters and brillantly (and simultaneously) describes the trials and tribulations of being the youth that everyone picks on and the 30-something man that still has yet to figure out how to be anything but a kid."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"The truth abut this book, of course, is that it's about two boys -- 12-year-old Marcus, and 36-year-old Will. Both are lacking something they need in order to get along properly in the world; fortunately for them (and us) they stumble across each other and fill in the missing bits.Alternating between mortifyingly painful and strangely funny, this is the story of Marcus, whose single mom Fiona has already attempted suicide once and, fears Marcus, may try again any day now. Marcus is a strange boy, due to his precocious intelligence combined with the insular life he leads with his nonconformist mother, who doesn't approve of the accoutrements of everyday teenage life, including TV, rock music, and video games.Through a chain of events too quirky and complicated to get into here, Marcus meets Will, a cool bloke who has no attachments, no problems, no plans, and has never worked, thanks to a one-hit-wonder songwriter father, whose royalties keep him in comfort, if not luxury. Will seems to enjoy floating through life -- no big highs, but no big lows, either. His days consist of TV, music, shopping, movies, and the occasional short-term relationship with someone who inevitably tells him he ought to grow up and settle down.However, Marcus' recognition that Will can provide something he desperately needs (the ability to be cool and fit in) sparks a deeper, unconscious desire in the both of them for the kind of relationship they both have lacked -- Marcus for a father (or really, anyone besides his emotionally unstable mother), and Will for a son (or really, anyone who might depend on him and matter to him more than that night's TV lineup).The growth of the two over the course of the novel is sweet and satisfying, and Hornby's characteristic inner dialogue is delightful in its confusion and honesty."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"I seldom review books on Amazon, but this book was absolutely brilliant.

Perhaps he needs to be locked in a hotel room and made to write books while room service is administered.ALL the caustic wit of HIGH FIDELITY, and he's added a few new flourishes, in the way that Porsche does every so often.Hornby, he's just dead great and makes it look easy."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"ABOUT A BOY by Nick HornbyAugust 5, 2008Amazon Rating: 4.5/5 starsI have read a Nick Hornby book before and enjoyed it, and this book did not disappoint me either. The main character is Will Freeman, a man that has never had to work a day in his life, and he loves it. His father made money off of a Xmas song he had penned decades ago, and now Will was living off the royalties, both of his parents now deceased. It wasn't the life of a millionaire, but he was comfortable and that was all that mattered. He can't imagine life being any other way, and cannot fathom having to work for a living.In the mean time, all of his friends are getting married and having children, and they feel sorry for Will because he's not married or having children like they are. But Will knows he doesn't want to settle down, doesn't want to have kids at all. In fact, he's having fun trying to find easier ways to pick up women, but not having to commit to them. It's when he's learned a sure fire way to find women that won't commit that makes his life more interesting, and they are single mothers who are not quite ready to have another relationship, because it's either too soon or their kids are in the way. So, Will joins a single parents group, hits on the women and finds he's hit a gold mine!At some point, Will gets involved with a young boy whose mother is one of those single parents. The boy's mother is having a lot of emotional issues, and the boy himself is not quite normal. In fact, he's quite the nerd, and it's because his mother is teaching him how to be a non-conformist. Before Will knows it, this young boy is visiting him at his apartment on a daily basis, watching TV together and hanging out. Will had already been telling his potential dates that he was a single parent with a young son, but things really get weird when the boy starts to pose as Will's son, so that Will can impress a woman he really likes...Great story, funny and witty, ABOUT A BOY is one of those books that I am sure is on the top of many reader's lists. It'll definitely be on my list of top books read in 2008."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"About A Boy is a touching and funny story about Marcus (12) and Will (36), two British males who act each other's ages. When they meet each other amid a drama that is both serious and humorous at once, they help each other to learn to act their own ages. The story is woven well by Hornby, who comes up with the goods again, creating characters that you care about and interesting, humorous sub-plots that push his general theme along it's way."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"While I agree with those who pointed out that this book tends to be a bit repetitive, this is still a very enjoyable book. I adored Marcus' dimwittedness (although it seemed to me completely out of character for him to have thrown the bread at the duck in the first place) and felt genuine sympathy for him when his &quot;friends&quot; gave him the brush-off because he's too big of a geek to hang out with even the other geeks.Though it is, obviously, central to the plot, I was a bit confused by Will's logic in joining a single-parent support group in the first place. Based on the fact that one single mother has dated (and dumped) him he decides he's hit upon the ultimate way to meet women? Kind of a weak premise, there, but easily overlooked once the story gets rolling.One of the most enjoyable aspects of this book is Hornby's ability to give the reader glimpses into both main characters' lives. He doesn't focus on just one and we are able to glean an even clearer picture of the events as they unfold. I was pleased to note that Horny didn't take the easy path and introduce a romance between Will and Marcus' mother (which would have been completely impossible to believe), though I would have liked to have seen a bit more character development in the mother and at least a rudimentary introduction into the life of Marcus' father (more than what we're shown, at least).Actually, I would give this book 3 1/2 stars rather than three. I gave it the lower rating because, while I genuinely enjoyed this book, it didn't leave me wanting more. In other words, I don't feel in that big of a hurry to read it again (I've read Hornby's &quot;High Fidelity&quot; repeatedly and it hasn't been that long since I bought it) and I didn't feel at the end of the book as though I was saying goodbye to good friends. Overall, though, a recommended read."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Nick Hornby's About a Boy reminded me a lot of Seinfeld. One of the main characters, Will, is thrirty-something, univolved and univolveable with anything that could disturb the routine of his well-arranged life. He resorts to hilarious exteremes to remain detatched from everything and everyone. Until he meets a lonely and scared 12 year old kid. After Marcus almost loses his mom, he decides taht two is a risky number for a family and tries to recruit Will to be a father figure. The plan does not succeed but gradually and unwillingly, Will becomes an only friend to the boy.The book has the dangerous potential to be a cheesy tear-jerker, but Hornby manages to be funny and nonchalant yet sensitive and convincing."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"In this truly moving book about life, Nick Hornby introduces the reader to many lovable characters and their stories.Meet Will. 36, single and terrified of anything in diapers.Meet Fiona. Never married with a 12 year old son. Depressed and ready to top herself.Meet Marcus. Fiona's son. On an island of his own, not by choice, but because of his mother.Meet Ellie. 15 and rebellious.Nick Hornby ties them all together, they would never meet any other way. The novel revolves mostly around the lives of Will and Marcus, and the &quot;friendship&quot; they forge.Though the characters are all different and neurotic, they are (in my mind) all the characteristics of an everyday person, trying to get along in life. The book is a marvellous glimpse at the effects of parents on their children, and the effects of those children on the outside world.Hornby pulls the reader through the story with believeable dialogue and moving scenes. The ending leaves the reader open to the number of possibilities that awaits the world inside the book."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"This is a great guys book, full of hilarious plot devices that bring out rich characters who experience compelling growth but who give up some of themselves in the process. I laughed and laughed, but at least once in each chapter I'd get stopped by some surprising profundity expressing some universal truth. Will is a thirty-something single white male who has blithely figured out a life's path that will lead him &quot;effortlessly to the grave,&quot; until Marcus, a 12-year-old social outcast, clobbers a duck with a loaf of bread, thereafter known as &quot;Dead Duck Day.&quot; From there on, things get crazier and crazier until both Will and Marcus actually start to grow up."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Devotees of Nick Hornby can see his craft develop through his early works, from a memoir (Fever Pitch) through High Fidelity to this excellent novel. In Fever Pitch Hornby wrote about himself, and in High Fidelity created memorable characters, many of whom were two-dimensional. But in that book he also created a complex, if rather extreme, protagonist, and his now-acclaimed skill at dialogue was revealed. About A Boy takes High Fidelity's promise to the next level. Here, Hornby shows a man-child learning how to be an adult -- but, more importantly, why that's worth doing, and why a life of sloth is not as fun as it sounds. He also manages the difficult task of creating a realistic child character, with all the awkwardness and uncertainty that a preteen geek would reveal. If you just want a sample of Hornby, read About A Boy first."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"The novel is about a twelve-year old boy and a 36-year old man, who have both problems.

I know how he felt growing up - being different and awkward - being made fun of and not quite fitting in. Coming from a home life that was less than ideal. There is a path from Marcus to Holden Caulfield to William Miller to Benjamin Braddock to Rob Gordon that defines my life.That being said, About a Boy is a touching funny sentimental story about the changes we all must go through in order to grow up. For those of us that thought we would have all the answers when we grew up, About a Boy shows us that we may never have all the answers. But having friends, colleagues and those that care about us is more important than anything. Without a support network, it is very hard to get through life.Anyone reading this book will find himself (or herself) or friends and family to relate to. That is what makes the book so wonderful - its honesty. Nothing sugar coated here - no magic answers no pat formulaic happy endings - just people trying to find themselves in a very confusing world.I thought that High Fidelity was the best book I have ever read. Then I picked up About a Boy. You should do the same."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"As in \\"High Fidelity\\" like the best comedian's Hornby brings the characters and situations out with such ease that you recognise yourself in the book. The only book that made me laugh out load so much that I had to continuously put it down with embarrassment, as other passengers on the 19:30 to Edinburgh did not understand."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Like he did in his previous novel, &quot;High Fidelity&quot; Hornby has written a hysterical novel that is hysterical because of how much truth and insight is in it. What I like so much about Hornby's books is that he writes about real people. His characters are basically likable while still being human, which is to say, extremely flawed. The plot of &quot;About A Boy&quot; is somewhat contrived in the sense that you pretty much have a general idea early on about how it will end. But the strength of this book lies in Hornby's ability to create characters that we care deeply about because they seem like real people we know (in fact the character of Marcus reminded me of several people I went to jr. high with) and not just made up characters who are there to put the plot in motion. There were numerous time when reading this novel that I had to stop because A) I found myself laughing uncontrollably and/or B) found myself in awe at Hornby's insight into human behavior."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"picked up this book by chance and bought it after reading the first few lines of it. i enjoyed this book so,so much. about a boy who had to grow up too fast and a man who was happy never having grown up and how in their encounter, the man teaches the boy how to be a kid again and in the process, grows up a little himself and finds its not so bad after all.the characters were believable and the comedic timing was great. i found myself laughing out loud at times and moved to tears at others.got high fidelity after this book and while i enjoyed that too, it didnt compare to about a boy for me."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Simply put: a fantastic work by one of the best working writers. I especially enjoyed the varying perspectives from chapter to chapter, but what made this work so successful was its ability to draw the reader into the plot, humor, and ultimately make the reader *care* about the characters. Somewhat rare nowadays."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Being a music obsessed geek, &quot;High Fidelity&quot; is, naturally, one of my favorite books of all time and while &quot;About a Boy&quot; couldn't have possibly been as powerful, I enjoyed it nearly as much. A funny and charming story to begin with but I thought that the incorporation of the Nirvana stuff was a stroke of genius. I'm sure that critics will eventually begin griping about how *all* of Hornby's books are about immature, pop music and/or sports obsessed men in their 30's but Hornby is to the immature, pop music and/or sports obsessed men in their 30's genre (if you can call it that) what John Grisham is to earnest legal thrillers or Danielle Steele is to trashy soap operas."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"he writes things you can relate to. he writes about regular type people, and makes them special. these people make perfect sense, because you know them, or you ARE them. now, i think the trouble that some people had with this book is that they couldn't relate quite as much as they could to high fidelity. i had the opposite problem, because i am not a guy. high fidelity is a GUY book, about a guy, how he thinks, not that a woman can't get into it because he's an excellent writer but they can't relate in the same way. this one is also about a guy, but it's also about other things that i can relate to better. i can always relate to the music thing, but the bits about being young and motherhood and all that will make me nod in the same way that you guys were nodding over high fidelity. his prose and wit is as good as ever if not better, as everyone seems to agree. give this one a try."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"I really liked this book-it didn't try to be too dramatic or emotional, but it was touching anyway. It was a different plot with original characters, and it was one of the VERY FEW books that actually made me laugh out loud-Hornby really has a way with words, and as an american, i found the british expressions invigoratingly fresh!! A great, lighthearted yet touching book."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Thoroughly enjoyed this book by Hornby. Picked it up luckily, and was glad I did. Hornby understands what it's like for kids to grow up, and it's an amazing story and poignant of two kids (one kid at heart, and one kid) and the valuable lessons they can teach each other."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"I agree with other reviewers, it's not as good as High Infidelity. But it's a funny, enjoyable, light read about a London man's journey to emotional maturity."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Nick Hornby does it again--that free flowing stream of conciousness writing he does so well works beautifully in this comical novel of two men--one twelve year old going on forty and one forty year old, going on twelve. They are infectious characters with blunt and painful answers to life's most uncomfortable moments but ultimately break your heart with their sincerity. It's heartfelt and funny--a great follow up to &quot;High Fidelty&quot;."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"If you've never read Fever Pitch or High Fidelity than you should enjoy About a Boy. Enjoy, not rave, I suspect. It's definitely not his best effort. I'd wait for it to come out in paperback or borrow it from some hardcore Nick Hornby fan that probably rushed out and bought it the first second it was available (like me). Try the Rachel Papers, by Martin Amis if you liked High Fidelity, or Alain de Botton's work. And as an aside, I think the cover is pedophilic and weird."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"If High Fidelity burst on the scene like a great first album - say the first Clash record, then About a Boy is the more developed later effort - 'London Calling' maybe. Both books are terrific in their own right and deserve all the praise they are receiving.It will be difficult to cast a young actor to play 12 year old Marcus in the movie version of About a Boy. The kid's character is fascinating and complex in the book, but I'm afraid Hollywood will just go for some Macaulay Culkin type and miss the whole point.Reading About a Boy is time well spent. It makes one eager for Hornby's next book and to see how his literary style continues to evolve."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Hornby is spot on about men and their relationships with women. Whenever I've read books about love and contemporary life I almost always end up hating the characters and the author for having created them and a world that bears no resemblance to my own. Life in Hornby's London is not so different from mine in San Francisco. Hornby is witty without being cynical, amiable without becoming smarmy. I loved &quot;High Fidelity&quot; and I visited Amazon a million times checking on &quot;About a Boy&quot;. Its out, its great, its too short, do I really have to wait two more years for the next one?"},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Nick Hornby's novels have been accused of being shallow... of not &quot;haunting&quot; the reader. Now I am equal parts fan of &quot;haunting&quot; authors such as Michael Ondaatje and Flannery O'Connor, and fan of authors like Hornby, Irvine Welsh, and David Sedaris. Sometimes I don't want to be haunted by a book, but rather to have fun, to laugh, and to really relate to a character on a human level as opposed to on a ghostly, enigmatic one. Hornby's new novel is not shallow; it is real and heartfelt. You don't need an Oxford companion or a Phd in Lit Crit to &quot;get&quot; this book. And it is precisely those critics and readers who are suspicious of such a book that haunt me the most."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"I was a huge fan of Hornby's first outing, &quot;High Fidelity,&quot; and for the past couple of years have kept my eyes open for the follow-up. &quot;Fidelity&quot; was absolutely hysterical, and Hornby's observations of modern single life rang astonishingly true. It was like a good pop song, fast and a joy to experience. But like even a good pop song, &quot;Fidelity&quot; was somewhat shallow.Hornby explores real depths in &quot;About a Boy,&quot; and does so quite well. Part of the fun of &quot;Fidelity&quot; was the overwhelming sense of comfort the reader felt from recognition -- I've been there, I've seen that, someone's done that to me, too. &quot;About a Boy&quot; is remarkable for the discomfort Hornby makes the reader feel. When 12-year-old Marcus sits down to watch &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; with his suicidally depressed mother, I want the video to cheer her as much as he does, and I really feel his doubt that things will really improve. When the main character in the film begins his repeated attempts to off himself, I squirm in my seat and want it to stop, too.Hornby's humor continues to shine through, and his observations of interpersonal relationships are as keen as ever. There's just so much more going on here. Hornby hits on interesting questions (What is childhood? What is responsibility, and where does it come from?) without hitting the reader over the head with them. Telling the story from the perspectives of Marcus and 36-year-old Will (and sometimes retelling the same episode from both viewpoints) immediately has us wonder, &quot;Who is the boy from the title?&quot; The development is absolutely satisfying.I guess I'll spend the next few years on the lookout for Hornby's third."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"&quot;About a Boy&quot; is a moving story about a single man who plays a father figure to a young boy who previously had no male role model in his life. If you liked High Fidelity you will recognize the warmth of Hornby in this one. More mature, but still the same sense of humour."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"I read this book after reading High Fidelity and now I'm completely hooked on this author, can't wait to see what unusual beginning he'll come up with for his next book. The main character is someone that is so easy to dislike, yet there's something about him that makes you incredibly interested in what he has to say. I found the boy, Malcolm, to be hilarious and everyone in the story reminded me of people I know. Unusual, interesting and hilarious - overall a great read."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"I am going to compare the book to the movie. I know I shouldn't, but I simply couldn't separate the book from the movie. This is one of the rare instances where I liked the movie more than the book. I will say that I saw the movie before I read the book and that totally distracted me as I read it. Hugh Grant was cast so spot on to play Will that there's no way you could imagine him NOT being Will. The movie stayed true to the book until about halfway, then some of the minor characters in the film take on bigger roles in the book and the book becomes a lot more complex than the movie. I liked the movie because it was one of those \\"feel good\\" types that provide a little escapism and ties up all the loose ends in 90 mins. The novel doesn't do that. In the novel the relationships between the characters are more intricate and just don't seem to work themselves out so simply, just like in real life. Unfortunately, because I already had an idea of how this novel was supposed to go from the movie(maybe blame it on excellent casting/acting? or blame it on the fact that the movie was more entertaining than the novel itself?), it prevented me from really getting into it. Of course, I'd highly recommend the movie, and on top of that, I'd recommend the soundtrack as this was the reason I went and saw the movie in the first place."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"\\"About A Boy\\" - Dead Duck DayThe Novel \\"About A Boy\\" by Nick Hornby is about two boys who are different from each other. These boys are the protagonists of the novel. One of them is Will Freeman thirty-six-year old single from London, England. His life is carefree and he loves to live without any responsibility and any commitments. He is very trendy and his main hobbies are listening to music, watching TV, going shopping. He always wants to be cool but he is not satisfied with his style of life so he decides to meet more women. So he joins a single Parent Group named SPAT where he meets Marcus the second protagonist.Marcus is a twelve-year-old boy who is bullied at school and has no real friends. Furthermore he lives with his mum alone in London in a small flat. His Parents got divorced several years ago and his father lives in Cambridge. Marcus wears untrendy clothes, has got an unusual haircut and behaves strangely.One day they met and from this day on Marcus comes to Will's flat and they watch TV together. So they get into an intensive contact more and more and learn from each other how to manage their lives.All in all the book is about growing up and finding one's place in society.We think the book is very interesting because you can notice a change in the two main characters. The Book is full of love, fun, friendship, Rock'n Roll and Sex.BUY IT OR DIE!!!made byFurby / Ranzmann / KaSpA"},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Having been made into a movie that proves Hugh Grant is still a box office draw, Nick Higham's second novel, About A Boy, involves the transformation of a self-centered confirmed bachelor into letter other people into his life, and a boy who struggles to find his own identity, away from his mother's influence, and fit in more in order to survive at a school full of bullies.The book is told from the POVs of two people. One is Will Freeman, a thirty-six year old confirmed bachelor, an island to himself, who lives off royalties from a song his father made long ago, a novelty Christmas song called \\"Santa's Super Sleigh.\\" He's hip, and he has his day organized into either shopping trips, hanging out with his few friends, watching TV, and trying to score with women but not to commit on a long-term basis. He finds a goldmine of opportunity in dating Angie, a single mother who resembles Julie Christie, and when she breaks it off, he decides there must be more attractive women of that sort. To that end, he joins SPAT (Single Parents-Alone Together), an encounter group of moral support, and even invents a 2-year old son Ned, and ex-wife Paula.Then there's Marcus, a 12-year old boy who doesn't have it so good. He's in London, where students are more trendier. His mother's a vegetarian/health food, hippy-type into Joni Mitchell, and who is totally against mindless conformity. The result is that he's picked on in school, especially as he has the tendency to sing out loud from out of the blue when nervous. He doesn't have any real friends to speak of. His father's in Cambridge with a girlfriend. But worse still, he notices his mother suffering from depression.Will and Marcus meet when Suzie, a SPAT member whom Will has taken a shine to, takes Marcus on an outing in the park. That day becomes a day forever etched in Marcus's mind, as his accidental killing of a duck with a French loaf is overshadowed by his coming home and seeing his mother overdosed on pills. The two bond slowly, and Marcus learns how to become invisible, outwardly wearing trendy clothes, listening to hip music and all, but to be himself inside, i.e. to be in disguise.The nature programme and Groundhog Day video Fiona and Marcus watch, on the fish that doesn't come out of its cave, and how Bill Murray lives the same day over and over, are clever and subtle parallels to Will's life.The book here has Kurt Cobain and Nirvana as the thing that unites Marcus and Ellie, the rebellious and brooding 15-year old who slowly warms up to him, and the book takes place from 1993 to 1994, so one can figure out what bearing an event that took place nearly ten years ago tomorrow (5 April) will have.But the one thing that stood out was a conversation involving the difficult search to find a life partner so \\"less different\\" from one. Ellie's mother replies, \\"Why do you think we're all single?\\" The conclusion seems to be, as Marcus later decides, that it's safer if everyone were simply just friends, pairing off being a bit of an emotional hazard.With writing that's pointed and witty, Higham makes convincing characters of Will and Marcus, but he does so with Fiona, Marcus's mother, and Ellie, described as Siouxsie Sioux with a Roadrunner hairdo; he also weaves threads of single parents, the difficulty of fitting in at school, and why the concept of marriage and or sig. others may be declining in the late 20th century onwards, and for Will, being able to care about someone and still maintain his own island."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Edad no es lo mismo que experiencia.

At the beginning Will is a children hating man who plays with the women and lives on his own. Marcus, a 12 year old boy, is an outsider and lives together with his mum. He is influenced by his mum.Usually people know Hugh Grant as a great actor, for example the acting in Notting Hill, but in his role in \\"About a Boy\\" he plays horribely. And that is the same as far as the other actors are concerned.On the one hand the costums agree with the character traits. But on the other hand the music is too exaggerated for the scenes. Moreover, the production is not right for the 21th century, e.g. Stanley Kubrick was able to produce great films in the 60' s like \\"Shining\\", \\"Clockwork Orange\\" or \\" Space Odysse\\". The sense of the film is a comedian film, but there' s only one funny scene in it. For example the film \\"Life of Brian\\" by Monty Pythons is much more funny. It' s a film of the 70' s.The film got some awards, e.g. for directors (Paul Weitz, Chris Weitz) and actors, but I don' t understand why.Finally, I can say \\"About a Boy\\" is one of the most terrible films I' ve ever seen, but the novel is okay.Stephanie Gronau"},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Nick Hornby clearly can't write. You can't 'feel' the characters of this book. They seem to have a very contradictory personality, and you have the impression that Hornby himself doesn't seem to know whom he is describing. At times the hero is a bored middle age man, and the next paragraph he is a dynamic young man with an exciting personality.A shame, because the story could be interesting. A fascinating subject ruined by lack of talent."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"I do think Hornby wrote this with a movie in mind. If I found out that a man in my single parent's group had fabricated a son simply to meet some desperate yet beautiful women, I'd call the cops. Certainly not say basically nothing, which most of the women in this book did. I am reminded of The Onion article, \\"Area Man Jailed for Romantic Comedy Behavior.\\"After suspending disbelief, I found the first half of the book amusing enough to read while in the jacuzzi. :) Then I soon realized all of the characters were unlikable -- I almost wished Fiona would kill herself, Marcus was just a sullen brat, and nobody treated anyone else with decency. Even Rachel stood Will up on the date with Fiona when she was supposed to talk her out of killing herself. And how does Will react when finding out Rachel had no intention of coming? \\"Oh. Thank you.\\" Thank you? Well perhaps that's a \\"normal\\" reaction when you, like everyone around you, is accustomed to being treated like dirt.I don't understand all the hype and hoopla about this book.

But when I read the book by myself, I found out that there where some unexpected depths. But those depths were not numerous and they were too fast settled. I disliked the ending of the story it abolished the big differences between the characters. This made it very uninteresting for me because I think it is very flat to just adapt the characters to each other. I learned nothing from the book and it gave me nothing very emotional so it is no book I would feel reading again. The language of the book is not very poetic or even demanding so there was nothing I wanted to read twice just to enjoy it.But all in all I think the book is okay if you have to read it (in class). At least, it could have been much worse."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"The novel \\" About a boy \\" written by Nick Hornby deals with Marcus, a twelve-year-old boy and Will, a thirty-six-year-old man, who change in the course of the events.Marcus is very shy and he doesn\`t have any friends, because he is uncool.

The novel shows how people can change if something special happens. It tells the reader about important matters such as the way how people deal with problems or how to make friends."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Buy this book for your five year old, or don't buy it at all."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Review of the book \\"About a Boy\\" by Nick Hornby:I had to read the book \\"About a Boy\\" in school. I'm sorry to say that, but if I had not to read the book I would have thrown it away after reading the first chapters. The book has really bad quality and doesn't get better throughout the whole book.My reasons for this opinion are that the book is very boring and I couldn't notice any tension, It was almost like a torment to read through the book (Normally maximum reading time is one week for a book with 250 pages in this write-size but for this book I needed nearly one month).Surely the book has a lot of irony and a few nice jokes, but it was hard for me to understand them(I'm German) in some important chapters, that's mostly because of the many unknown words und the colloquial speech (although some words are explained with other words in the annotations of the book- still that didn't help a lot).In addition to that, the book didn't interest me at all in any case, I asked myself: \\"Who the hell wants to know something about a crazy boy, an ignorant, stupid mother and a man who seems to be very underdeveloped and their relationships to each other?\\".All in all, the book can certainly be interesting and good for people, who like such a topic, but for all the people, who aren't interested in this topic, I can only give the advice: Don't buy the book."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"In the novel &quot;About a boy&quot; Nick Hornby succeeds in fascinating the reader on each of the 320 pages. It's easy to understand and therefore adapted to my linguistic proficiency as a German.I enjoyed reading the book and I can recommend the book to everyone who also likes stories without too much action and excitement."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"I've loved the movies based on his books for so long that it seems completely stupid that I've never picked up the books.The basic story is about Marcus, a 12-year-old newly moved to London with his off-kilter, depressed mother, Fiona, and his strange friendship with childless, aimless Will. To say anymore of their relationship is to reveal too much plot; suffice it to say, the road of this mismatched friendship is lacking in neither hardships nor amusements.This was a fantastic, funny book that tells a better story than the Hugh Grant movie of the same name.Perhaps my favorite part of this whole read was the way that Hornby captured 12-year-old Marcus's voice so completely; he can explain his quirks in such a way that you can't quite laugh with him, but you feel a little bad laughing at him (though that's what the chapters told in Will's voice enable you to do).In the end, you get to laugh a little at everyone - \\"I can't believe my parents are such crap!\\" is perhaps my favorite line.Fabulous book for a rainy weekend."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Nick Hornby writes reasonably well, and the premise of About a Boy is, in theory, promising. However, the characters come across as flat and fairly unconvincing, and the effect of the novel does not do justice to the potentially great themes contained therein. It seems fitting that Hornby's books become popular movies; they are quick and dirty entertainment, which is fine, but I would not call this a powerful, or even very interesting, work."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Very enjoyable book. Written very well. Dark at times, but overall a great story with a lot of heart. Very likeable main characters. Fun dialogue."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Die-hard Hornby fans would probably argue over which of his first two books is the best - High Fidelity or About A Boy. Despite my love for High Fidelity, I honestly believe that About A Boy is a stronger, better book.In his first three novels, Hornby focuses on relationships in various stages. In High Fidelity, his focus was on dating and the fear of commitment while How To Be Good found Hornby exploring the end of a relationship (among other things). About A Boy finds a single 30-something exploring a pseudo-parental relationship with 12-year-old Marcus. The end-product is both emotionally satisfying and absolutely hilarious - especially the duck incident).If you're not yet a Hornby fan, check out About A Boy. If you are, what are you waiting for?"},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Is it just me, or does Nick Hornby have a hard time resolvinghis books? I really enjoyed the majority of this book. There are several hilarious and touching scenes, like the disfunctional christmas party. However, the end struck a bad note with me--I do not think one should settle for mediocracy but that seemed to be the conclusion. So 4 stars for the entertainment, 2 for the philosophical difference, thus I give it a 3."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"I love Nick Hornby. He's one of the best and funniest authors of our time. 'High Fidelity' will remain his masterpiece for now, but 'About a Boy' comes quite close.It's really different with two main characters now. Hornby is brilliant in developing characters, especially these two really unsual ones. At first a little boy who is so un-hip, he doesn't even now Kurt Cobain. And then a young man, who doesn't need to work, because he lives from his father's money. This are not quite stereotypes.Hornby's style is hilariously funny, but on the other hand it's very intelligent. He comes to conclusions, you wouldn't have thought of. And he is always surprising. You never know how his books end, and it's not different here.This is an absolutely wonderful book!"},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Having read &quot;High Fidelity&quot; in about 3-4 days (a record for me), I found this book enjoyable in the end, but with nowhere near the pageturning excitement of Hornby's earlier work. I really had to force myself to get to page 100. Overall, if you're already a Hornby fan, I would recommend the book, just so that you could get a sense of his real versatility as a writer."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"A simply astonishing book, how Nick Hornby managed to write the two main characters together is proof of a great writing-talent and an excellent imagination. The way he showed us Marcus and Will's everyday life and how they managed to develop themselves trough each other is simply breath-taking. I also caught up with an inch of moral sense in this story, and I think it was a bit too soft for my liking. No sharp turns or surprising revelations before the end, and that, I think, is a bit too late. There are so many changes made in the last couple of pages, but it gives the book the edge I was talking about earlier, though you might find it hard to cope with it. Humour is a big part of this book, Nick Hornby's humour is what I would call; typically English, and it appears to me that \\"About a boy\\" could very well be a manuscript for an English sit-com (situation comedy). His humour doesn't appeal to me, though I found the book a bit amusing, but I wouldn't say I laughed my head off. Maybe if you have reached that special age, when you start looking back on your life, this book would appeal more to you and you might recognize yourself in some of the many embarrassing situations, delievered to us in an excellent package including suicidal parents, divorces and an outcut of many poor boys' everyday life in the English school system. Brilliant Nick! We want more of this."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"I found a hardcover of About A Boy in a remaindered bin, and bought it hoping I would soon discover what all the hype was about re. High Fidelity. I hope that High Fidelity is much better than About A Boy, because this novel was utterly lacking in positive qualities. The best that I can say about it was that it was occasionally amusing. On the whole, it was a disappointment. I was not interested in any of the characters. The writing style was high schoolish, with an even lower vocabulary level. The brushes with suicide were poorly done, and at the end of the novel I was so fed up I just skimmed through the last forty odd pages to see if there was anything worth reading. There wasn't."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"This is one of the best books I ever read. On the 307 pages, Nick Horny deals with several themes - relationship, problems and growing up. It is written in such a way, that you can witness the live through two characters. So Nick Hornby gets change and humour into one of his best works ever.The themes or issues are showed in a very illustrated and humorous way. Relationship is reflected best with the friendship between Marcus and Will. It also treats with the life in the early 90's. Every single theme is worked out very well.But for me it was not always very interesting or exciting to read. Sometimes you can predict what happens next, especially with the issue relations.At last, I short want to refer to the title of my review. Nick Hornby illustrates well how you can act like a teenager - how to make the step from a \\"small\\" boy to a teenager.To sum this up: I only can recommend this book for all those, who want to read an interesting and with big and important themes treating book. So for me it's easy to give this book four stars."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"This book is amazing. I recommend it to everyone because it is such a heartfelt book.Enjoy this book!-cxbar"},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Nick Hornby's \\"About a Boy\\" is populated by weird and winning characters, and with clear and confident, engaging and beautiful prose Hornby both entertains and illuminates. A lot of the material that Hornby tackles -- school bullying, marginalization, dysfunctional families, depression, suicide -- is dark, but his writing is so funny and engaging we become engrossed in the sad and sorry lives of Hornby's characters, who in the end by coming together and by knowing each other live less sad and sorry lives."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Assigned summer reading so my son automatically hated it.It helped to read the story and watch the movie although my son didn't really like either.I thought the book was merely OK."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Once again, Nick Hornby does not disappoint. \\"About A Boy\\" deals with some very weighty and thought-provoking issues (teen bullying, single parenthood, suicide, relationships, vulnerability, etc.) in a manner that makes them--if this is possible--lighthearted and entertaining without lessening their impact or making them seem trivial. It doesn't have a neatly tied-up fairy tale ending, but it is satisfying and (dare I say it) feel good. I recommend this if you want something light, but certainly not empty and syrupy."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"I sit here wondering how many stars to give this book. I've been through the one star and two star reviews and agreed with what they had to say. Thing is, this is my first Hornby book, and it has been recommended to me by some very trustworthy people. I really expected to like it. In fact I was so excited about starting it, and imagined I'd breeze right through it - that is not to say I didn't finish it quite quickly, because I did, but that isn't due to the fact that the storyline was gripping, but rather that the book is fast-paced with short chapters.I started the book and despised Will. What a waste of space, and a despicable human being at that. Marcus was a little more interesting, but also very irritating. Slowly, as the book progressed, I got used to both Will and Marcus, and I did see the charm in this odd pairing. However, sadly, it wasn't enough to make me love this book. I'm a little surprised at the rave reviews, and even more surprised at my friends' rave reviews of it.To put it in completely blunt terms, it bored me. I was bored a lot of the time, and had to force myself to push through the chapters until the end. When it ended, I felt nothing. The whole story just fell flat. The characters weren't very likeable, and although there were some very important themes discussed in the book, I didn't find that I cared much for any of it.I admit to laughing out loud maybe one or two times though, and I did enjoy seeing Marcus's development throughout the book. The whole situation with Will and Rachel however...that was BS as far as I'm concerned. But that's just me.I'm still not sure how many stars to give it. I've never had such trouble rating a book before, but I think I'm going to go with my first instinct and give it the 2."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"This book came in as I had expected it too be as well as on time! Very happy with this purchase!!"},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"The book \\"About a boy\\" is written by the British writer Nick Hornby, who was born in 1957. The story is about the twelve year old Marcus. He doesn't have any friends and don't gets along well with his class mates, because he is kind of weird. His different character is mainly affected by his mother Fiona. She is depressive and often cries for no reason. Markus wants to help her, but he doesn't know how. One solution for him is to find a man for her. Here appears the other main character, Will. He is very rich, because his father wrote a famous Christmas song and that's why he doesn't have to go to work. Will just do things, which makes him happy. Eventually Will decides to take part in a single parent group, which is called SPAT. He wants to meet single mothers there. That's why he pretends to have a child. In this group he meets Suzie. Suzie is a friend of Fiona and that's why Will meets Markus. At one day they go together to the park. When they carry Markus home, Fiona had tried to commit suicide. They send her to a hospital. After this tragic event Markus wants to take care of his mother. He wants her to meet Will, because he thinks a man would stop her of being so sad, but it didn't work out. Markus anyway goes to Will, because then he doesn't have to come home and see whether his mother is depressed. When he visits Will, he discusses his problems with him. Markus thought Will is the first person in his live, who understand him. Will doesn't like Markus at the beginning, because he doesn't want to let somebody in his live. However, Markus told Will about a girl at school, named Ellie. Markus likes her very much. Will is able to find a way to help Markus, because he knows how normal children has to look and behave. At New Year's Eve Will meets Rachel. She is the first women in his life, he falls in love with.So both main characters love women. Markus is also always scared, whether his mother is trying to kill herself again. For Will and Markus it's not easy to manage their situation and to get what they want. If you want to find out if there's a happy end for all involved people, you have to read the, on the one hand very nice and at the other hand very deep going book on your own.Rebecca Herkommer"},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"After I saw the movie, I decided to read the book. The movie closely follows the plot of the book, until the end, which is completely different. As you would expect, the characters are more fleshed out and some of the scenes which were good in the movie, were vastly better and hysterically funny in the book. It's a quick read, with a lot of great, quirky humor in a touching story of an unusual friendship between a lonely, outcast boy and a lonely but hip older man."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"The story is sweet and simple but has \\"hidden depths\\" on every page. Hornby captures both the angst of adolescence and the angst of Generation X in the 1990s. The way he intertwines the lives of Will, a perpetual man-child, and Marcus, an actual boy, is amusing, thoughtful, and sets the stage for a clever and engaging read. The way in which Hornby also weaves the life and times of Kurt Cobain into his characters' lives is poignant without being cheesy and makes the story even more skillfully bittersweet. For fans of the movie, the book is as great as the movie and vice versa. Overall, this is a simple but honest and sympathetic study of family, friendship, and ultimately, the meaning of life or lack thereof."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Every book of his you read you will love. THey are all great reads and this is no different. He always used unique writing techniques and in this one he has each chapter rotating naration between the two characters. It is a great story."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Nick Hornby has a way of making self-centered characters likeable and sympathetic. Maybe that is because his characters' flaws are venial ones, rarely worse than any of our own (or if so, not by much). Or because they possess so many qualities we recognize in ourselves, yet without embodying stereotypes or reaching the level of parody. Main character Will, a shiftless, self-centered 36-year-old who can afford not to work due to his father's Christmas song royalties, somehow manages to have a reasonable-sized ego and a scintilla of caring for others. Marcus, the twelve-year-old side-project Will unwittingly adopts, is a bundle of pre-teen cluelessness and obliviousness to his surroundings, yet without any of the insecurity that usually goes with it. Moreover, he has no present-day cultural awareness whatsoever, and instead is a Joni Mitchell-loving, off-key-singing chip off the block of his hippie mom, Fiona. Fiona, for her part, is at the same time new-agey and a depressive; is quixotically nave, yet has a practical side and is vigilant with Marcus.The three interact when Will poses as a single dad to meet single moms. The support group was the latest in a string of schemes of Will's to meet women at a time when others in his age group are legitimately having kids of their own. Will's exploits somehow are more adventurous and clever than sleazy, and seem to stem more from trying to escape boredom than they do an effort to deceive anyone. In fact, the single-mom escapade came about after meeting and getting dumped by a single mom he'd met under more conventional circumstances.About a Boy is charming and witty, and Will and Marcus' relationship is cute in an odd way. Will uses Marcus as a charity project, to feel good about himself while bringing the awkward kid into the twentieth century. Marcus seems to have upper hand, though, and is perceptive enough to recognize Will's usefulness to him, and persistent enough not to let him get away. Fiona is lost in her own world of recovery from a suicide attempt, yet has enough wherewithal to question why a man in his mid-thirties is hanging around with a pre-teen boy. Eventually, all parties learn to coexist and to procure what they need from one another, yet still get on with their own lives.A cute story that is unpredictable, even once you have caught on to its sharp dialog and unconventional story line. All the characters have something to learn from one another, and the reader is better for the knowledge."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"I really enjoyed this book, becuase it was quite humorous and had a wonderful storyline to it. This book kept me wanting to read more and didn't allow me to put it down. It was also laugh out loud funny. I remeber sitting at school reading the book and almost cracking up in the middle of class. The reason for it &quot;four star&quot; review is that at the end i sort of didn't feel full from the book i had this hollow feel to it, but other than that i really enjoyed the book and hope that other readers take the oppurtunity to read it."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Hornby masters the art of balancing intelligent, richly layered writing with a fast pace and a light touch. As usual, the novel beats the film by a long shot. Really worth a look. The subtle emotional impact of this one sneaks up on you."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Nick Hornby has not only crafted a book with a great comic touch, but also a novel that at the same time, looks into sadness and depression. As I am sure many have already synposized this novel, there is no real point in relaying the events of the book again.Suffice it to say that this is an enjoyable read. Hornby has a very sharp writing style that is humorous without being smug. He genuinely likes his characters, and that comes through. The book is unpredictable, hilarious and poignant. Definitely worth a second and/or third read."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"It was an incredibly intelligent British novel but simple in its &quot;philosophy&quot; and flawless in its snarky, comedic execution. The kid versus the adult dynamic was a fun contrast. I think some authors underestimate the intelligence of children and this book proves that sometimes, kids are smarter than their older counterparts. Aside from the trials and tribulations, there was a lot of heart in their observations. It wasn't a conventional storyline by any means but completely believable and interesting in the way that it followed through. In other words, I loved it."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"What a great and fun book to read. I have not watched the movie, but this is just excellent. The way the writer describes the different situations, and the different characters is just outstanding.What a relationship between Marcus (the boy) and Will, they both needed each other, and they were so cool about it. They got to a point that they had to face reality, and that by itself just created one of the best win-win situations around.Never a dull moment in the book, and you get so attached to every story, and can't wait to see what goes on next...as I said just outstanding, and so much fun"},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"If your looking for something filled with deep meaning perhaps this isn't for you, but if you want a book written with wit, humour and a simple message About A Boy is for you.The story line is predictable at time, and I only read the book after seeing the movie to see what changes had been made, but I won't go into them as they are fairly minor.Hornby offers an interesting tale of two unlikely soles who cross paths, and find themselves entwined, despite the efforts of one to get rid of the other, and in the end they challenge each others perseptions about life.A fun fast entertaing read that is sure to please."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"I wasn't expecting this to be an analytical and introspective book, but it was. Some parts of that kinda slowed the story down sometimes, but for the most part, this was an enjoyable read. There were quite a few amusing parts, which I enjoyed.

I recommend it and i just believe that it's a great book. I also enjoyed that fact that Kurt Cobain was part of this book. Marcus is hilarious, Fiona is sad, the SPAT ladies are crazy, Rachel is a cool chick and Will - well &quot;how cool is Will! Sub - zero!

It didn't live up to my expectations. The book is written with Hornby's enjoyable fresh prose, but Will (the adult protaganist in \\"About a Boy\\") lacks all of Rob's (the protaganist in \\"High Fidelity\\") complexity. I just didn't care what happened to Will, and found myself reading just to finish the book, rather than because I was invested in the story.I did enjoy Marcus (the child protaganist), but I think that Hornby did him a disservice. I don't know much about Hornby, but he seems very invested in the idea that families and marriages are unimportant, or even archaic, in modern life. While I wouldn't really care about his politics one way or the other, he pushes the idea too hard by making Marcus -- an adolescent whose parents have recently broken up -- far too well adjusted to the idea. Instead of being hurt or angry about his parents split, Marcus just hums along, happy that his parent's new boyfriends/girlfriends bring additional people into his life, and how jolly it is to have more people around. Its just not a normal -- or realistic -- reaction for a kid in his situation to have.With that said, I loved \\"High Fidelity,\\" and liked \\"About a Boy\\" enough to read Hornby's latest book.

It's not a children's book nor is it for adults. It can be read by or read to anybody. It is written in a simple language so it won't be difficult to understand, not even for children.The book is about Marcus, who is a grown up 12 years old and Will, who is a childish 36 years old. Marcus just moved to London with his mother and Will lives in London. They have one thing in common; they both feel lost in life.The story takes place in London, some of it in Cambridge and Royston but mostly in London. It is the beginning of the 1990's. Like I said earlier, they both feel lost and it is easier to get lost in London than it is in some of the other cities in England. Maybe that affects our understanding of their looseness.The book is about a lot of things, but most important of all it is about relationships and friendship. Like Will who ends up having strange relatationships to the \\"strange\\" people. Marcus has a friend who is 36 years old. I must admit, it is a bit strange.There are two main characters in this story, Will and Marcus. They are totally opposite of each other. Marcus is 12 years old but behaves like a grown up man. He looks after his mother and is concerned. He is a thinker, unlike Will who takes things as it comes. Will is more childish and doesn't really care for anybody else but himself. Will haven't in life lifted a finger to do something, he don't work because he get money from the song his father once wrote. Will is more like how Marcus should be.We see the story from both, Marcus' and Will's side. We get to know how they experienced certain things and what they think. Since they are a part of the story it's exciting to know the opinion of both of them.The message, in my opinion, is that sometimes we can meet people in strange situations. At the moment we may not think that this person will hav anything to say in my life, however that person could be the most important person in your life from then on. Even strange relationships can develop to become good friendships, like they do in \\"About a boy\\".The book is hilarious, I can't remember the last time I laughed so much while reading a book. It is recommended on the strongest to everybody who likes a good book about life, because that's what it is. A book about life, and two boys who changes each others lives."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Centred around a deadpan twelve year old and a dilettante thirty-eight year old who somehow gets involved. Well written, often funny, Hornby manages to get away with the (only) occasionally impossibly mature and articulate child's dialogue by perceptively recounting alternate perspectives. There's a skilled balance between realistic characters without all the answers, and some sense of hope, growth and satisfactory conclusion (without the standard brutal moralising). I read it in one sitting."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"This was a wonderful story of a boy teaching a man to act like a grown up, and the man teaching a child how to act like a kid. The book was great and I loved it all, but I must hand it to Hollywood. The movie blew the book out of the water with wonderful casting, cinematography, and music. The movie changed some things about the book, but I think it was much better."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"If it werent for the movie, I definitely wouldn't have purchased About A Boy. It was extremely well written and funny. Throughout it I laughed and cried. HOWEVER, when i got to the last few pages, I was very disapointed. I thought the ending was awful.Will is a self-centered independent 30 something year old. He does everything possible to get a girl and have his needs met. This includes creating a fictional child named Ned and joining a single parents group called \\"Single Parents Alone Together\\". There he mets a girl. One day, they go out to the park. Now we meet Marcus. Marcus is a very eccentric, odd, smart yet surprisingly likeable and funny 12 year old boy. Marcus's mom (mum) is one of Susie's friends who is feeling down that day. So, Marcus goes out with Susie & Will. Not to give anymore away, Marcus and Will are extremely different yet they both enlighten each other throughout the book. Their personalities seem to fit together. All in all, this book has a little bit of everything. I recommend it, even though I found the ending very disappointing."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"A book review of \\"About a Boy\\"The novel \\"About a boy\\" is written by Nick Hornby. The story takes place in London and it reads about the relationship between a 36-year-old man called Will Freeman and a 12-year-old boy called Marcus. Will is a single and behaves still like a teenager. He goes to night clubs and knows which trainers to wear. In contrast to Will, Marcus is a bit to strange. He listens to Joni Mitchel and Mozart. He has no knowledge about fashionable clothes and he looks after his mum. The turning point in the novel can be seen in the changing characters of Will and Marcus. First they have no interest in each other, but after a while, they start to spend more time with each other.In my opinion it is an interesting book. I like that there are vocabular notes to explain difficult words. The book is not difficult to understand in any case. It is exciting, too, because when you read a chapter you want to read more in order to get to know what will happen next. In some chapters there are funny things to read. I do not like that some chapters are so long, but that does not really matter much. I would recommend this book to another person, because it is very interesting and it is easy to understand."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"I haven't seen the movie, and I'm not sure it would be possible to *make* a good film from this terrific book, since so much of it is third-person-omniscient. In fact, Hornby's dry and droll style is almost the epitome of English humorous fiction. Will Lightman, whose father wrote a classic pop Christmas tune and set up his son for life, is devoted to a life of idleness, coolness, and the pursuit of women. Will's not really an unlikable person -- merely a shallow one. He decides that single mothers are a target group he hasn't tried yet and invents a son so he can join a support group. This leads him to an acquaintance with Marcus, a rather nerdish twelve-year-old whose mother has made him a vegetarian and Joni Mitchell fan, and who has no idea who Kurt Cobain is (the story is set in 1990). Marcus adopts Will as a role model who can teach him all the things his depressive mother cannot. And Will eventually falls in love -- but not (surprisingly) with Will's mother -- and finds it necessary to change his life in important ways. This is a delightfully witty, sweet, and insightful book about the London middle class, the teenage world of the early '90s, and the relationships between men and women of all ages."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"this 3rd hornby production is also unfortunately his weakest. as others have commented, the book allows one to flick cheerfully from one setting to the next, perfect accompanyment to your favourite cds and not the other way around. if this is your first hornby, give the guy a second chance and try the much cleverer 'high fidelity'."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"The story had potential, but Hornby never delivered.I even went back and re-read &quot;High Fidelity&quot; to make sure I still found that book an intelligent and wry look at twentysomething culture. Yep...it was as good as I'd remembered, which only disappointed me more with the follow-up &quot;About A Boy.&quot;"},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Like most of the people who have read &quot;About A Boy&quot; so soon after its release, I am a huge fan of &quot;High Fidelity.&quot; What made HF such a great book, in addition to its dead-on-target depiction of guys like Rob and his friends, was the fact that the ending wasn't a foregone conclusion from page one. Sure, you knew that everything was heading for a happy ending in HF, but it was great fun getting there. While reading &quot;About a Boy,&quot; I was engaged until the point where Will and Marcus link up. Uh-oh, I thought, Will and Marcus are going to teach each other some Lessons about Life. And while I was wrong about the particulars, my general conclusion was painfully correct. The rest of the book was as predictable and almost as banal as a &quot;very special episode of Growing Pains.&quot;After reading &quot;High Fidelity,&quot; &quot;About a Boy&quot; was a real disappointment. Had I read AAB first, I would not have been inclined to pick up HF. Having said that, I still look forward to Mr. Hornby's next novel. AAB could have just been a sophomore slump."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"This story is quite entertaining if simple. A young boy, who is a complete misfit, befriends a cool, thirty-something male who can't seem to grow up. The young boy persuades the older male to help him \\"fit\\" in. Both learn stuff along the way.Nick Hornby has 2 talents. 1) He really knows how the male mind thinks and injects a lot of truth and humor into the story. 2) He has a great ear for dialogue--Seinfeld-esque.If you want to check out Nick Hornby's best book--read \\"High Fidelity,\\" it's one of the funniest and most honest novels I've ever read.This novel was later made into a pretty good movie starring Hugh Grant."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"This is a great story about a divorced, suicidal single mother trying to raise a shy, but gifted pre-teenage boy, who's looking for male role models wherever he can get them.We hear so much about girls and their problems, that it's nice to focus on boys for a change. This book has a lot of English/British sayings and phrases that Americans might not be familiar with, but that doesn't detract from the story. The characters are richly drawn. You get to know them very well. Nick Hornby's gift as a writer is the intimacy with which the reader develops with the characters. Plus, a great plot. The book is really short and not difficult to finish at all.This novel is very similar to \\"You Remind Me Of Me\\"---although that one is a lot longer. Novels about gifted boys, unfortunately, being raised in dysfunctional homes. It's sad that boys with so much promise are being destroyed by their home environment----that's my overwhelming thought when reading books like this.Hornby is excellent with language, prose, dialogue and vocabulary. The actual prose is somewhat challenging if you are an American who's not well-versed with how literary English authors (Ian McEwan) put together sentences. An English sentence structure can be a little more complicated than the straightforward way American authors write. But, it's never incomprehensible. I like the challenges of twisty, complex sentences. Author Hornby comes off as more clever, than gimmicky----the way any other author would, when other, lesser authors, attempt these sorts of plays on words and variety in sentence structure.And, because this is a short novel, with short chapters.....there always being a break----bottom line: it's an easy read, full of deep meaning about the nature and tragedy of dysfunctional families."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"About a Boy is set in Northern London with chapters alternating between the points of view of Will Lightman and Marcus Freeman.Will lives in his own world, where sex, substance abuse, and magazine questionnaires fill his day and relationships are squeezed in between. He owns a nice apartment, fast car, videos, CD's and his only source of income are the royalties he gets from his father's novelty Christmas song. The last thing he wants is a serious relationship which can only lead to children, making him sacrifice the lifestyle he cherishes so.So, it comes as a bit of a surprise when Will finds himself attracted to a single mother. After a brief relationship with this woman, he comes to the conclusion that other single mothers might be equally as exciting. He invents an imaginary two-year old named \\"Ned\\" and shows up at SPAT: Single Parents-Alone Together.Enter Marcus.Marcus lives with a vegetarian single mother who's sorely behind the times and has had one too many bad relationships. The most extreme pop culture icons he's ever known about are Joni Mitchel and Bob Marely. His shoes and haircut are all wrong and he has a tenancy to belt out songs when nervous. All of this makes him a target of bullies, rejected by his peers and humiliated by teachers. To top that off, his mother is also suffering from depression, which makes his life miserable on both fronts.The two characters meet when Marcus' mother sends him to a SPAT picnic with her friend, where Will is also in attendance.At first, Will and Marcus are clear polar opposites. Marcus is a bit wierd and geeky for Will's tastes, and his mother has more emotional baggage than he's willing to carry.But then Marcus, sensing a potential father figure, invades Will's life and doesn't go away easily. Will is annoyed, as any man who lives comfortably in his own world would be, but doesn't reject the boy quickly.Over time, Will conscientiously takes the boy under his wing. From buying Marcus the cool shoes and introducing him to Nirvanna, even bestowing a bit of birds and the bees wisdom with regards to a girlfriend, Will and Marcus gradually become different people.The first thing a reader might think, is that Will must be some kind of sick pervert. And I'll admit, pretending to be a single parent just to get single mothers in bed is a depth to which most unmanned submarines have rarely sank.But over the course of the story, Will comes off less as a pervert and more of an immature child who believes in all honesty that he can fly if he flaps his wings hard enough. Dealing with the feelings of others can be difficult, especially when you're used to the single life and Will is simply a tourist in a land he's never been to before. And on a personal note, Will's lifestyle is the kind of thing that makes my mouth water everytime I hear about it. But I digress.Just about anyone of us whose ever had to move to a new city, start at a new school, and had the whole experience suck the center right out of the Tootsie Pop can readily identify with Marcus. Especially those of us with clueless parents, who either don't realize or refuse to understand just how nasty schools have gotten lately. You're on your own with no one who knows you, in a new building so complex it puts most secret government facilities to shame. Bullies are relenetless and even they're only as bad as the teachers who tell you to \\"ignore it\\" or \\"just stay out of their way\\". (It disturbs me even now how apathetic teachers can be, especially in the wake of tragedies like Columbine)Lets face it. School in any nation sucks, especially if you're the new kid. Marcus gets my total sympathy from page one.Will is the guy I wanted to be. Marcus was the kid I grew up as until I finally hit puberty and started telling my mother where to get off and how to get there. (They called it Oppositional Defiant Disorder at one point)Another high point that makes you instantly respect Nick Hornby as a writer is his ability to connect one of the more crucial events of that time to the characters, and in doing so further the plot along. I refer namely, to the death of Kurt Cobain. Since a part of Marcus' social awakening comes from discovering Kurt Cobain, it's no big surprise when the event causes so much trouble in his life. Especially when the girl he's been falling for turns out to be an obsessed fan who believed (like about eighty million other people) that he was singing to her.There are some other truly touching scenes without being overly sappy. The humor was both intelligent and compelling, making me an unofficial fan of Nick Hornby."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"This is a shady book. Hornby is capable of being funny, and his insights into the thoughts of various characters as they butt heads in conversation are enjoyable. This is a sitcom plot, however, with a dubious moral tale. A 13-year-old boy lives alone with his suicidal mother, who is suicidal, it seems, because she is a manless, aging hippy who listens to Joni Mitchell. All single, over-thirty female hippies who listen to Joni Mitchell want to off themselves, though, right? No development there whatsoever. The suicide topic is nothing more than a clever author vehicle for gratuitous Kurt Cobain references (the time of the story is actually set a bit before and after his real suicide). If there is some connection between the mother's grief and cobain's (or a statement about suicide in these devices), I missed it. You will too. More alarming is the relationship b/w Will, an aging layabout, and Marcus, who is the misfit-at-school son of the suicidal Joni Mitchell fan. Will teaches Marcus to fit in at school through conformity so that he can overcome the long historical odds against a boy being raised by a suicidal mom with a crystal necklace, a barren love life, and a kick-ass collection of vinyl Joni Mitchell. As the author, Hornby weighs in with judgement on Will teaching Marcus to conform (Hornby is pleased that Marcus'uniqueness has been stamped out so that years 13 through 17 of his life go well), and all ends well, which means that Will sends Marcus back to school with hep clothes and thick skin, a triumph of humanity. Not surprisingly, the movie rights to this book were scarfed up for an obscene amount. Writing books like this beats working."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"ABOUT A BOY is a story about Will Freeman, a proudly self-absorbed 38-year-old Londoner. Living lavishly off the royalties from a hit Christmas song penned by his father, Will excels at nothing except doing nothing, which, in his case, includes shopping for CDs and having his hair \\"professionally disheveled.\\" When Will makes a guilt-free exit from a brief fling with a single mom, he decides to crash a meeting of S.P.A.T. (Single Parents, Alone Together) in pursuit of more single mothers. This scheme leads to meeting Suzie and Marcus, the socially awkward 12-year-old son of her flaky best friend, Fiona. A series of odd situations leads to Will and Marcus becoming unlikely friends, and gradually both of their lives start to change for the better. However, when Will falls for the lovely Rachel and attempts to pass Marcus off as his son, things go awry. In order to win the heart of Rachel and make amends with Marcus, Will must finally grow up--and completely embarrass himself in front of hundreds of people."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"I love everything by Nick Hornby. - his books as well as the movies they create.About a Boy is my favorite work by hornby.Read it before you watch the movie.

They all have their particular weaknesses and are both so totally unperfect that you have to love them. Will never manages to get a relationship going over some time and Marcus is bullied at school but then they meet in a drastic event (Marcus kills a duck, by accidentally hitting it with a hard bread he threw away) and start to like each other and learn from each other.I can only recommend to anyone who likes to read about stories that might be true as they're written, that deal with (almost) everyday topics and are written in such a queer way that you just have to read the book in one go."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"This is one of the best english books I ever read.

He likes listening to Mozart or Bob Marley instead of Snoop Doggy Dogg or Nirvana is not interested in fashion or other kind of lifestyle. His mother is suicide endangered, so she cannot help him with his social problems.Will is the total opposite of Marcus, although he's more than twenty years older than him. He reads teenage magazines, goes to the right clubs and knows about fashion and is mostly interested in sex.

The book shows very good the different kinds of people and how they behave. The main aspects concerning the novel: friendship, problems and music are shown clearly and the reader gets involved.Based on all the reviews posted here, I realized that the book was probably a fuller version of the charecters in the Hugh Grant movie.But as I already said,in my opinion Nick Hornbey created a very absorbing novel. It is worth to read it and I can advise it to everybody, succeeds in fascinating the reader on each of the 320 pages."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Will Freeman is a 36-year-old single that lives alone in London, England. He lives a carefree life without responsibility and friends. He follows the latest trends and knows what is cool and what is not. However, he likes his style of life but he is not satisfied with that and that is why he decide to sleep with more women. Will decides to search women that are attractive and that do not want a close friendship with him. Days later he finds the group names SPAT ( Single Parent - Alone Together) where he finds a lot of women that are waiting for Mr. Nice guy. Will recognizes that there are the women he was searching for and decides to change his philosophy of life.On the other side is Marcus a twelve-year-old boy that is bullied at school and does not have many friends. Furthermore he has many problems at home with his mother. Marcus is a young boy that is not trendy at all and does not really know how is a life of a teenager because he has to care about his suicidal mother and has not time to enjoy himself.One day Marcus comes in contact with Will and Marcus starts to visit him when he has problems or does not want to go home. With every visiting Marcus trusts more and more Will and sees in him a close friend. Nevertheless both starts to learn from each other how to act their own age.All in all it can be said that the book is about growing up and two boys and their development during the story. Furthermore it is about dissatisfaction about the different situations of the life of the two boys and the new experience to fall in love with somebody.I like the book very much because Nick Hornby describe the character Will in a very ironic and satiric way and Marcus very realistic and grown up. Admittedly it is also important to say that Hornby uses here a role changing between the two characters and if you like the book then watch the movie with Hugh Grant because it is the perfect transposing of the book."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Will Lightman is a 36-year-old, unemployed, but well-off man living in London. He spends his days finding trivial ways to fill his endless amounts of time. He's always fashionable. He always knows what's in. In other words, Will is always on top of the game.Will is also a womanizer, and soon finds the joy of the single mother. When he joins a single parents support group and befriends one of the mothers, he meets Marcus, a 12-year-old who acts much older than his 12 years -- Will's opposite. A friendship is forged, and this, of course, means that changes are made, even if they're not wanted.This was a really cute book. Will is cheeky and sarcastic. Marcus is solemn and serious. And they teach each other about life and how things are, and they have many misadventures along the way. Even when Will tries to get the reader to believe that he doesn't care about Marcus or his messed-up life, it's obvious that the boy holds a soft spot in his heart. And though they are opposites in many aspects, there are a few things that are shared between Will and his young companion, such as their ability to sort of forget that reality exists until the reality of a situation hits them.I saw the movie first, but the book was definitely better than a movie, as they usually are. A lot of questions I had regarding the movie were answered in the book, as they usually are. This was like the male-version of chick-lit. What would that be called? Guy-lit or something? Great reading, enjoyable, will definitely be on the lookout for more Hornby."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"This book is one of my favorites. Its funny, smart, and heartfelt. Even thought Will is a charater hated in his life by others you still love him. The movie is really good too. I saw the movie before I read the book and the directers Paul and Chis Weitz did a good job being true to the book. Reading Marcus in the book I could just see Nicholas Hoult in my head playing Marcus. He was the perfect acter for Marcus and so was Hugh Grant for Will. I loved the movie and the book and I cant wait for Nick Hornby next great work."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"I loved About a Boy!!! Even though the book was incredibly funny, it had a heart and a message, which is rare to find in it's category of what I term, throw-away novels. Novels that will take you a weekend at the beach to read and are as easily forgettable. But in the end, this book was a carefully crafted plot about how two boys grow into men. This is gradually developed, but one finally realizes the growth at the end when Marcus tells his mother he hates Joni Mitchell, who was his favorite singer. It really is a delightful novel and I highly recommend it!!!"},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"This was a wonderful story of a boy teaching a man to act like a grown up, and the man teaching a child how to act like a kid.

The movie changed some things about the book, but I think it was much better."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"From 8:15 yesterday morning my eyes had been glued to this novel. I loved it. Conversations between personas, especially Will and Marcus, are so quirky and make you laugh out loud. Nick Hornby's characters are vivid and alive. The events throughout the reading can be so horrifying, pleasing and hilarious. During the last twenty four hours my parents had to suffer my reading the best parts of the book to them. I was scared that maybe towards the end of the book I would get tired of everything, but unlike most books read in a short period of time, I didn't. It all went quickly and easily like the breeze. I recommend this book to anyone!"},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"\\"ABOUT A BOY\\" BY NICK HORNBYWe didn't choose this novel by our selves, our English teacher picked it out. That was why I was a little bit sceptic in the beginning, but after a while I enjoyed the book. The start of the book was difficult to understand, but after a couple of chapters I found the book very interesting and hugely entertaining. It's a good book. I think Hornby\`s comedic instinct makes this a smart, relaxed and funny book. This story is not only funny , but it's also a serious piece of writing. He writes about problems such as suicide, school, family and the fear of being alone. The plot is superb, in the beginning there is no connection between the main characters. In the first few chapters, we hear about Will and the next we hear about Marcus. After a couple of chapters , Will and Marcus get in touch. This made the story even more clever, because the two of them are so different.Will Lightman is a thirty-six year old man from London. He is single and tries to be cool, and in the beginning Will seems to be a guy without any feelings. Will doesn't work, he lives of the money he earns from selling the rights of his father\`s well-known song. I think he is a man who tries to be much younger than he could be. Beacause of this, Will meets a lot of problems during the story. Something I find funny. Marcus is only a third of Will\`s age. He has just moved to London from Cambridge,(with his mother). Marcus seems to act like he was much older. He is afraid of his mother, who is wery sad all the time. Marcus is in many ways Will\`s polar opposite. He listens to Joni Mitchell and he has no idea of what his hair cut should be like, or what kind of clothes he should be wearing. One day Will meets a nice woman and he wants to be with her. He meets her at SPAT (Single Parents-Alone Together). To become a part of this group, he has to say that he has a kid and that he is a single parent. (Poor Will if the other members find out). This woman is a friend of Marcu\`s mother. And one day Marcus goes to the park with Will and the woman. ( This day he calls the dead duck day, a day I think Marcus will remember for the rest of his life). When they come home, they found Marcus mother on the floor, she had tried to kill herself. After this episode, Marcus and Will get a closer relationship. Marcus has problems at school, and Will understands his troubles. He almost becomes an uncle or a father for Marcus, who change a lot and starts making friends. I think their friendship was good for both of them. Will became more open, he became more like an adult and not the hip guy he wanted to be in the beginning but still he is looking for a woman. I'm a great fan of Nirvana and Curt Cobain, so I was thrilled by the things Hornby wrote about the band. Maybe Hornby tries to make a connection, between the suicide of Cobain and the attempt of Marcu\`smother. They were both sad people, they were both searching for the meaning of their lives. I hope and think you will enjoy the book. It is funny and serious at the same time. The book is written by a person, who in a way live inside the people he writes about. The lives of Marcus and Will turn around in this book. When you are finished with the story, you're left with the impression that this could have happened to anyone you know, including yourself. It is much better than \\"Fever Pitch\\", Nick Hornby has done it again. Another superb book from the man behind \\"High Fidelity\\". This book from the late 90\`s is one of the books, I actually finished and my tip to you would be, \\" read it today\\"."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Nick Hornby's novel, About a Boy, is in fact about two boys. If they can be called boys, there is really not a good and adequate word for them. Will is a 36-year-old who acts more childishly than most parents would allow their children to act. All he cares about is being cool and trendy, or at least being cool and trendy according to the latest men's magazine. He is really arrogant and difficult to like. Marcus is a 12-year-old who is everything but cool. He has strange hair, dresses like a twenty-five-year-old chartered accountant on his day off, hums Joni Mitchell songs to himself and is the son of a depressed, divorced, vegetarian mother who does not understand that baggy, hairy jumpers are out-of-date. He acts so grown up that it makes him such an extreme outsider that I have great difficulties picturing him before me.These characters are so out of this world and weird. Even though they are so different from each other, somehow the author makes them come in contact with each other and they develop a somewhat strange relationship. The two characters first meet when Will decides that single mothers make the best lovers. Will joins a SPAT (Single Parents Alone Together) group pretending to be a single father. He goes on a SPAT picnic with Suzie, a single mother, her baby and Marcus. Apart from Marcus's contribution to a duck's death by throwing a baguette at its head, nothing really brings the two together. When Suzie and Will return Marcus to his mother's flat, they find her half on and half off the sofa nearly dead from an overdose. This is more than Will has ever asked for, all he wanted was some great sex. He tries to get out, but it is too late. The relationship between Will, Marcus, Marcus's mother, her ex-husband, his girlfriend and so on becomes exactly the kind of emotional mess that Will has worked so hard to avoid, but there is no way out. I feel as though this mess is so unrealistic that it is almost impossible for me to picture it before me. In some enigmatic way, Will and Marcus become friends. Will helps Marcus behave like a twelve-year-old, and Marcus shows Will how to commit to people and life in a more serious way. Although some paragraphs were funny, the tediousness of the rest of the book was too overwhelming. Not a great deal happens, page after page without any noticeable developement in the plot. I found that this affected the book in a negative way. The plot was boring and the characters were off this world. Due to this I could relate neither to the characters nor the plot and that was probably why I didn't like the book."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"A good book, will have you laughing in recognition and embarassment as did &quot;High Fidelity&quot;. Thoroughly enjoyable. And to the person who claims it's derivative of &quot;This Boy's Life&quot; by Tobias Wolff - I suggest you actually _read_ &quot;This Boy's Life&quot;. The only similarity between the two stories is that they are both narratives represented by ink glyphs on oblong pieces of wood pulp."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"A highly enjoyable contemporary work, but I don't think it was side-splittingly as funny as Hornby's previous work, High Fidelity. Perhaps it's because a main theme of the book is depression/suicide, which makes funny lines not quite as funny. Though one wants to laugh at the utter impossibility of a frech baguette killing a duck, moments later, another main character is overdosing on a couch with vomit all over herself.The best character is obviously the innocent, precocious, yet often naive, Marcus (the boy). His making lists of candy bars reminds readers of Hornby's lists from High Fidelity, and of course his inability to grasp sarcasm is hilarious.The book has a happy ending, though not the typical one where everyone falls in love and lives happily ever after. Perhaps the not-so-unique anymore situation of a, divorced, single mother, makes that too unbelievable, and Hornby makes for a more judicious ending.A good book for Generation X'ers on their way to maturity and real life issues."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"&quot;About A Boy&quot; is a unique tale of a 36-year-old man, Will Freeman, who makes his money off royalties from a Christmas song written by his dad, and therefore sits around and does nothing all day, and a painfully uncool 12-year-old named Marcus. When they meet at a get-together for a single parents' group (Will joined by making up a son, thinking he would meet women) Marcus soon insists on a friendship with Will. While at first Will finds him annoying, throughout the novel a sweet relationship between them grows.This book is hilarious. The first time I read it, I liked it, but I didn't quite get all of the jokes. I firmly believe this is because I wasn't very familiar with the band Nirvana at the time (I was only 6 when Kurt Cobain killed himself, after all). However, over a year or so I became a big Nirvana fan and learned a lot about Cobain and the band, and so when I reread the parts where Marcus believes there is a Manchester United player named Kirk O'Bane, I laughed out loud. After that, I seemed to notice the jokes more and overall enjoyed the novel more.The only reason I didn't give the book 5 stars is because it's obviously not a great literature classic, and that's what I like to give 5 stars to. Otherwise, it's a great, fast read, and if you like it enough, see the movie as well. Hugh Grant is pitch-perfect as Will, and the rest of cast is very good as well."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Since Nick Hornby is the author of one of my favorite novels (High Fidelity) it should come as no surprise that I very much liked this, his second book, as well. True, it doesn't rock my world in quite the same way as High Fidelity, but it is stylistically and temperamentally similar. The story follows Will, a young (mid 30s) idle Londoner who drifts through life thanks to his inheritance, never really getting deeply involved in anything or anyone. Overconcerned with maintaining his hipness in the face of impending middle-age, Will is rapidly approaching a point where he is alienated from all his married, &quot;adult&quot; friends. Unwilling to engage in more than fleeting relationships, Will insinuates himself into a single-parents support group in order to meet beautiful needy women.While wacky hijinks ensure, his life also becomes entwined with that of Marcus, a 12-year old boy desperately in need of a father figure. While Will is a cad in terms of the women, he's more or less a decent fellow, with some deficiencies recognizable in a lot of men, the most significant being his inability to grow up. Both he and Marcus are naive and wise In their own ways, and through their odd relationship they become better adjusted. Funny and sometimes bittersweet, many young men will recognize parts of themselves in Will, and while his method of coming to terms with the world and aging isn't particularly useful as a guide, the book may lead to moments of introspection on one's own life."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"If you were a fan of the movie version like me, you will love the novel that came first. Let me start by saying that the movie adaptation was remarkably faithful. Not only did they keep the plot, but the rhythm of the novel was maintained as well.Which just goes to show, when something isn't broken, don't fix it. About a Boy was simply perfect the way that it was, no need to mess with that sort of brilliance.For those that didn't see the movie (which you should), it follows a man who hasn't grown up whose life collides with a teenage boy whose life is too hard. They both learn something, and in the end everything falls into place. The ending is in no way trite though. Yes, people fall in love and things end a bit happily-ever-after, but the novel at no time feels inauthentic. It reads like real life.The satire was brilliantly executed, the characters believable and sharp, and the plot was oddly endearing. About a Boy is a rather quirky little novel, but I loved it for that exact reason. It was strange and sweet and crazy. It may also be one of my new favourite novels. How can you blame me though?So, needless to say, I loved this book. I cannot recommend it highly enough!!!"},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"About a Boy is yet another book I read after seeing the movie. I don't actually remember much of the movie and I'm afraid the book may be just as forgettable. About a Boy was about a strange and thankfully innocent relationship between a bizarre twelve-year-old boy and an unambitious man-child. I just couldn't connect with the characters or the story. There was lots of whiny drama that amounted to nothing. The characters change and grow throughout the story, but in average predictable ways that you see in most \\"growing up is hard\\" novels. Don't get me wrong, this wasn't a bad book. The writing was good. The story flowed smoothly and quickly. About a Boy just lacked that certain something to make it stand out from other novels of its kind."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"With his usual doses of wit and wisdom Nick Hornby once again uses a sort of good-for-nothing guy as an example of how live a good life. Will Freeman spends his days doing 30-minute increments of nothing and trying to hide the fact that he comes up as a blank every time he meets an attractive woman. As much to his surprise as anyone else's there is actually something there. Beyond his carefully sculpted persona of cool Will Freeman may actually be a human being. Remembering the days when being cool was in end in itself, I wonder if there was any substance to it..."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Having recently seen the marvelous movie \\"About a Boy,\\" I decided to pick up the novel that inspired the film. I was not disappointed. Nick Hornby's clever, original and touching book goes to heart of how important it is to connect with other people.Will Freeman, the anti-hero of \\"About a Boy\\" is not an admirable individual. Will does not work for a living. He lives in a beautiful house in London and his expensive lifestyle is paid for by the royalties that Will receives from an ever-popular song, \\"Santa's Super Sleigh.\\" Will's father wrote this ditty many years ago, and he never had another hit in his life. Although Will is thoroughly sick of the song, it pays the bills, since countless individuals and musical groups have recorded it over the years. Since Will has nothing meaningful to do, he spends his time shopping, watching television, listening to music, taking recreational drugs, and chasing beautiful women.Through a convoluted series of events, Will meets Marcus, a nerdy twelve-year-old with a depressive and smothering mother, named Fiona. In spite of Will's determination to stay aloof from long-term commitments, he begins to care about Marcus and he tries to teach the boy how to be accepted by his peers. Marcus, in turn, teaches Will how to care about someone other than himself.Hornby's smooth writing style, his deft characterizations, and his subtle humor make \\"About a Boy\\" a smart and entertaining novel on several levels. Hornby's book is not only a poignant story about lonely people connecting with one another. It is also a social commentary about the shallowness of some aspects of modern society. To some people, one must have the right CD's, wear the right clothes, and know the right people in order to be accepted. Merely being a kind and loving individual is just not enough. Without being in the least cloying or heavy-handed, Nick Hornby shows that meaningful relationships are what life is all about."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"I'm writing this review two days after seeing the screen adaptation of \\"About a Boy\\" on its opening night. As a huge Nick Hornby fan, I was enthralled with the final product of the filmmakers. No \\"let's move the script to Chicago\\" debasing of the script, a la the Cusack-centric version of \\"High Fidelity.\\" As good as the book is, \\"About a Boy\\" the movie is even better. It didn't seem possible.But even if you've seen the movie, and are thinking about the book, I suggest you give it a try. Especially if you've never read Hornby before. In fact, if you're 'new to Nick,' here's one man's take on a course of action...1. [Assumes you've just seen 'About a Boy.']2. Read the book.3. Rent 'Fever Pitch' from Blockbuster. [The book is rather a tough read - unless you're a European football (aka 'soccer') fanatic. It deals with Hornby's lifelong obsession with Arsenal & his struggles to become a writer. But the movie is a sweet little vignette drawn from the book. It makes for a nice viewing by a couple looking for a good Staurday night rental. Just ignore the odd cover box, which has nothing to do with the movie.]4. Read 'High Fidelity.' [Only see the movie if you've read the book first. Don't let the movie ruin the book for you.]5. Read 'How to Be Good.'---------Here are two neat little differences between 'About a Boy,' the movie and book, that I don't think will ruin the book for you:'Social Suicide' Song---------------------Movie: 'Killing Me Softly'Book: 'Both Sides Now'An inspired choice by the moviemakers. The only downside being that you'll feel like an idiot when you get caught by your co-workers singing 'Killing Me Softly' later in the week.Marcus' Musical Awakening-------------------------Movie: MystikalBook: NirvanaThe scriptwriter really demonstrated a good pop-culture relevancy touch here with this change."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"OK, if I were grading this against Kafka or Dostoevsky, it probably wouldn't get that good of a grade. But it is light fiction, and as such, it is a delightful and fun book. I had previously read HIGH FIDELITY, which I like a great deal more, but I enjoyed this one enough to guarantee that I will read other Hornby books in the future.The plot was surprising. From reading the cover, one might expect a comedy of misadventures among single mothers, and while in a way that does indeed transpire, that is definitely not the focus of the book. The book is, literally, about a boy, and his interesting and moving friendship with a previously superficial adult male. Much of the interest in the book lies in the fact that it ends up being about friendship and relationships, and not especially about sexual relationships. Although the adult of the book does indeed engage in sexual relationships, the most interesting ones in the book are those that are decidedly not.I definitely recommend this book. It is not great literature. But it is a fun read.By the way, I noticed on IMDB that there is a forthcoming movie version of the book. Hugh Grant will play the adult lead. Rachel Weisz is in the cast, though I suspect she will play Will's love interest near the end of the book, and not Marcus's mother. Grant is a tad too old for the part (early forties, while Will is 36), but he should bring the right touch to the role."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"One thing I look for in a book is the writing style of the author. Nick Hornby does a masterful job of depicting Will in this book- in the words of many writing professors I have come across, he doesn't &quot;tell,&quot; he &quot;shows.&quot;I loved this book, and the way it told a simple story, not just about a boy but about the man who came to love him in an odd sort of way. Though there is a &quot;love interest&quot; in the story, Hornby doesn't drop the relationship between Marcus and Will just to shift over to Rachel, as many authors would have done.Beyond being poignant, the book is extremely funny. Some authors, especially British ones, have the ability to show how life is funny . . . not in one-liners like Chandler on Friends, but through actual experiences that hit close to home. Hornby is one such author.I recommend this book, not because the story is so overwhelmingly original, but because it is so originally written. This novel is for people who like words; don't expect to come away from it with a brilliant insight on life, but expect to be pleasantly surprised and delighted by how an author can truly show."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Nick Hornby is perhaps the premier writer of lad-lit, the male counterpart of chick-lit. And \\"About A Boy\\" is one of his best novels, with its sensitive looks not only at male fears, but at how they relate to women and children. It's a far smarter, wittier book than you'd think.Will is a single thirtysomething, self-absorbed and consumed with his own coolness, unattachedness and ability to live off his dad's song royalties. After dating single mom Angie, he realizes how to instantly give his sex life and image a boost: date single mothers, beautiful and desperate. So he invents a nasty ex-wife and a toddler son, and begins going to SPAT (Single Parents, Alone Together).But when he meets attractive Suzie, he also meets the boy she's babysitting -- Marcus, a troubled, intelligent preteen who is picked on at school. Marcus's home life isn't much better -- his depressed mother has just attempted suicide. Despite Will's commitment to noncommitment, he finds himself slipping into the role of father and friend for Marcus.Single moms, precocious kids, immature lads -- none of these things are terribly original. It's Hornby's way of handling them that is really original. And the way he wrote \\"About A Boy\\" gives unusual life to what could have been a TV-movie-of-the-week/lame-sitcom plot, with cliched characters.Instead, Hornby has created a surprisingly mature book, by showing a realistic portrayal of an immature man growing up whether he likes it or not. But Hornby's quietly insightful prose is a little less self-consciously cool than in \\"High Fidelity,\\" and it's also more focused on human experiences. And no, not just Will picking up single mums.Will is a pretty accurate portrayal of men who work hard at being immature -- believe me, he's accurate. And that makes it even more satisfying to see him graduating into adulthood. Marcus's chapters are deeper, however, and it's this pensive kid who grounds the book. He may be young, but thanks to his saddening life, his mind is a lot more mature than Will's.Postmodern Peter Pans and precocious preteens are at the heart of \\"About A Boy,\\" Nick Hornby's sensitive look at the sexes and their children."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Will Freeman , a 36 - year - old single , is in all a cool guy : he earns money without having to work hard for it , his sexual life is fine , he goes clubbing as often as he wants , . .etc. But Will controls his life so much that it becomes monotonous . But then he gets to know Marcus , a 12- year -old parent child who disturbs his whole boring life ! Because of the strange kid Will discovers new aspects in life which he never knew before and which make him feel more useful and above all more content with himself .In my point of view &quot;About a Boy&quot; is a mirror of the modern society . The plot is very realistic and the connection between many different characters is very well done .I recommand you to read this book because I think that Nick Hornby has managed it to write about an extraordinary friendship between a kid and an adult in a very ironic and realistic way that made me often laugh but it also made me reflect on my own life ."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"God bless Nick Hornby. Author of the excellent novel High Fidelity and the equally worthwhile soccer-memoir Fever Pitch (both soon-to-be movies), Londoner Hornby always manages to mix humor with a very keen sense of observation. More to the point, he is very contemporary - something that is becoming a challenge for many authors to accomplish.However, looking at the premise of Hornby's newest novel About A Boy, I cringed. The book jacket talks about fatherhood, single mothers, children - precisely the sort of subjects a young male wants to ignore while immersed in a novel. Fortunately, Hornby has let me down - this is a brilliant read.&quot;About a Boy&quot; stars Will, who has drifted through life on a nifty little trust fund that keeps him comfortable. Never having cared for anything except for what he surrounds himself with (clothes, drugs, music, girls, soccer) he suddenly is depressed by his friends - who now are all becoming parents and/or responsible. Will, through a series of pathetically hilarious circumstances, finds himself becoming a father figure to a young boy. Hornby has clearly modeled his protagonist Will Freeman on himself, resulting in a work that resonates with honesty.Will the U.S. finally get wise to Hornby? Who knows. Still, &quot;About a Boy&quot; is a good way to spend a weekend, but only a weekend.(This review was originally printed in the June 1998 issue of Bikini Magazine in a slightly edited form.)"},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Nick Hornby is perhaps the premier writer of lad-lit, the male counterpart of chick-lit.

On the surface it seems like a &quot;coming of age&quot; story concerning a 36-year-old man and a 12-year-old boy, but deep down there seems to be a undercurrent of someone struggling to understand what it means to feel and to live with people in community and to lvoe them through their messy moments and their bright spots as well. It's a well-written and funny book worth the time and joy."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"This was a terrific book from beginning to end and rates a very rare 10 from me. Equally funny and sad but never dreary despite the very serious overtones of the book. Marcus was a peculiar, wonderful boy with a huge burden on his shoulders and I really enjoyed watching him become a stronger, confident person. Will was also great ~ I loved the fact that he was a such a self-centered jerk and completely content to remain that way. No guilt, no remorse, no commitments. Until he meets Marcus, that is. Their relationship was laugh out loud funny and so very believable. I had a very difficult time putting this book down (to do things like go to work and care for the kids)."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"This is the story of how two boys, one 12 the other 36, help each other to grow up. I found Hornby's characterizations to be very real and interesting. I never really wanted to put the book down because I was curious to see how the characters would develop. Hornby's great wit also made for many a good laugh. The only shortcoming was that I felt like I was getting hit over the head with sentimentality at the end. All in all, a fine book."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"I am a newcomer to the work of Nick Hornby, but admire his skill as a storyteller. This book is the perfect summer read. It is a breezy volume that is filled with wit and heart. It delivers its message without heavy syrup or overt sarcasm. I loved watching Marcus and Will grow!"},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Hornby's style is breezy and irreverent without being slick or self-indulgent. Will Freeman is a self-styled &quot;cool&quot; 36 year-old bachelor who doesn't have to work. Marcus is a twelve year old only child living with his single parent mom in London. School is NOT fun, friends are few and mom is depressed. Hornby brings Marcus and Will together unexpectedly. His characterizations are funny and poignant and very believable. You don't know what to expect, but Hornby makes you a willing passenger on his tour of bachelorhood, single parenthood and adolesence. Marcus is a very bright and endearing, if awkward and confused, 12 year-old. Will, is, in some ways, going through the same confusion at age 36. I am now a Hornby fan. This book was a delight!!"},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"About A Boy mines the same comic territory as High Fidelity, yet adds an even deeper level of humanity. It's quirky, weird, funny and very touching. Not many books can claim all of that!"},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"&quot;About A Boy&quot; is a very good read. The humor and easy writing style make for entertaining reading. Hornby's characters are more recognizable than any other authors I've been reading. I even see a bit of myself in some of them. I look forward to the next one, as I did after reading &quot;High Fidelity&quot;"},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"&quot;About a Boy&quot; was my introduction to the fiction of Nick Hornby. Without having any preconceptions as to what to expect from this author, I found myself smiling and chuckling all the way through this novel.Hornby obviously has a sympathetic sense for his characters, so the humor comes across in a good, kindhearted way. It was nice to feel that his characters, flawed as they are, can still be liked and likeable. It was heartening to realize that we don't have to be perfect in order to be able to learn important lessons in life.At the end of &quot;About a Boy,&quot; it's hard not to grasp the humanness of each of the characters as they go through their trials and tribulations, such as they are. The reader also gets a sense that the characters' lives are the better for it--and so are we."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"While this sophomore effort isn't quite as funny as his first novel, the story is more engrossing, and its characters more charming. I actually preferred this to High Fidelity."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Loved this book from beginning to end. every single word in this book fit the story, and there was not a single wrong note throughout. Although the book is about the young lad, Marcus, Hornby draws a stunning portrait of the ultimate slacker: Will, a guy who is not too rich, but entirely comfortable with taking things as they come. Just when I thought that he couldn't top High Fidelity, he comes up with this.The ending is superb as well: nothing too neat and tidy, but definitely a fitting wrap-up to the chaotic world that we have entered for 280 pages."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"I was disappointed by this effort. Though there are some clever moments, the book lacked the heart or soul I expected."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"To begin, I must state that I stumbled accross Hornby during my stay in Nottingham, England last year. I read the hilarious tale: Fever Pitch. I was hooked. Hornby writes in a fashion that is easy-going, entertaining, and introspective. This mode transfers to his second novel: About a Boy. I think the life of Will is the bachelor in every man, and the life of Marcus is the boy in every man. This statement does not segregate women - it simply expresses an emotional and reflective view of manhood and the pursuit of maturity! The development of Hornby's characters in all of his books to date, reveals the simply complex nature of life. And as Will would say, &quot;It is just life, don't take it too seriously.&quot; Bravo Mr. Hornby on another success."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Using cutting-edge humor and driving plot, Hornby's book will certainly make you laugh, might make you cry, and may even make you a better man. Says a lot about the modern non-nuclear family, maturity, and machismo. Although Hornby's latest, _How To Be Good_ is not bad, this one is much better. I just hope the movie and Hugh Grant do justice to the book."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Will Freeman is a 36 year old boy in a man's body, unformed, immature and working hard to stay that way. He has no desire to search his soul, let alone get involved in a serious relationship leading to marriage, children and what he sees as a cluttered, complicated life. He doesn't even have to hold down a job, living on the royalties of a hit song his father wrote years ago, a song that has continued to remain popular.Will does, however, enjoy brief liasons with women and the one-night stands that come his way. With skewed logic, he decides that his best prospects are single women with children, women who may not want more than a brief fling. So Will attends meetings of SPAT (Single Parents Alone Together), pretending to be the father of a 2 year old child, a child he creates from his imagination.And that's when complications ensure (but not the type you might expect) as Will befriends a 12 year old boy, Marcus,an adolescent desperatedly in need of a guy who understands what it is like to be a 12 year old boy. Since Will is not much older than that emotionally, he is the perfect companion for Marcus,Nick Hornsby has never been more on target in his despiction of what it means to be a guy who just wants to stay a boy forever (if a boy could drive a cool car and charm women into bed). But Hornsby also shows what hard work it can be to shut life out, to skim along the surface of things and avoid love, connection and attachment. And he does it with a huge dose of humor, making ths book irresistable."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"A thoroughly un-likeable character has an opportunity to redeem himself, unbeknownst to him, in this novel by Nick Hornby. I love writers who can make me laugh out loud, especially while reading on a crowded bus in midtown Manhattan during rush hour, and Hornby is no exception. Read it fast before the movie is released and you will forever be equating Will with Hugh."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"This book again is a prime example of Nick Hornby's ability to render a realistic character and write with insight. Through out this book, the character grew in engaging ways. Nick Hornby writes with sensitivity and insight into the human condition."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"I'm not an avid reader, but I thought this book sounded interesting, and it really was. The characters are very likeable and intriguing, especially the two leading roles, Marcus and Will. Its a very funny book, yet at the same time it addresses some serious issues without becoming depressing. I got really into it and read it in a couple of days. They're making a film about it now starring Hugh Grant.. I'm a bit apprehensive but I'm going to have to go see it because I'm sure they can ruin it too much and I'm interested to see how they interpret everything. So read it quick before the film comes out!"},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"This totally surprised me. As good as Hi Fidelity. Once again Hornby managed to produce a storyline that was very personal and thought provoking. His characterisation was brilliant and he managed to make an extremely humurous story from a somewhat tragic and depressing subject. A good film director could produce a classic comedy from this story."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"&quot; About a Boy &quot; is really about two boys. One, Marcus, is the twleve year old son of a single mother. The other, Will, is a 32 year old single man who has never had to grow up. Marcus is the school misfit who wears the wrong clothes, has the wrong haircut and listens to the wrong music. Will, on the other hand, has it all and he has it all down. He has the right car, the right music, and the right clothes.One fine day, Will decides that the pool of young single mothers is probably a fine place to look for women. To fit into the single parent crowd, he needs a cover story. He invents a wife, actually an ex wife, and a son. Thus begins a story of the two boys, how they become compadres, and how they both, eventually, grow up.The story is an easy and enjoyable read. Like the porridge in Golidlocks and The Three Bears, the temperature of the story is just right. It has drama, but not too much. There is humor, but it's not a farce. The characters are warm without being corny. The plot ends with an upbeat note, but it is not an implausibly happy fairy tale ending. All in all, an enjoyable story that you will be glad that you read."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"What a delightful exploration of how a thirty-something (can't remember exactly how old) boy turns into a man.

The story is outrageous, very creative and funny yet with a tinge of seriousness and goodness about it. It was captivating and without a dull moment in the book. Although it was tinged with humor throughout, there were quality points being addressed...the troubled adolescent, dysfunctional families, &quot;lost souls&quot; (rain dogs) and how people are always seem to be looking for something and often need help along the way in one way or another, yet these issues were delt with in a humerous and lighthearted manner.

That is the strength of Mr. Hornby's novels- the insight in our behaviors.Some of the scenarios were slightly predictable, but that isn't all that bad, because you find youself turning the pages anyway to see the spin on them.The book wrapped up a bit too quickly for me and there were one or two questions I would have likes addressed, but they are not critical in enjoying thsi novel.Looking forward to the next one."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Hornby is living proof that witty, sensitive writers can be found out there in the vast sea of mediocrity that passes itself off as contemporary literature. I seriously doubted that About a Boy could surpass High Fidelity, but it did. (Although I recommend both novels.)

I was absolutely charmed by the main character, Will (and loved how he couldn't identify with being called Bill); how absolutely real and honest the author kept him; his character stayed true throughout the book, which I find most refreshing. Actually, all of the characters were written with a thoughtful eye; they honestly expressed the frailty of the human condition and didn't completely reform or become heroes by the end - they just became a little wiser, a little more aware, and certainly happier.I found the author to be a modern male version of Anne Tyler in the way he depicted ordinary people falling into peculiar circumstances and then what happens in their life as a result..Bravo, Nick!

Will Freeman is a single guy in his late thirties who just go through day to day without a job (the royalties from the Christmas song his dad wrote supports him financially), without a steady relationship, and really without a life. Will, in order to meet some women, join a single parents group. Here she meets a woman who has a twelve year old boy called Marcus. Marcus, unlike Will carries a huge emotional load on his shoulders. His mother is suffering with depression, actually tries to comit suicide, and he himself is what we Americans call a dork.... :) That maybe a bit harsh, but he is basically a boy who always gets picked on at school. Will, unwillingly at first, get's stuck taking Marcus under his wing. Now this is a big deal for Will who never wants to commit to anything or anyone (real woman's nightmare). The two starts forming a very strong bond, as Will teaches Marcus how to be 'cool' twelve year old kid and provide a sanctuary for him to escape from troubles at home and school. Will on the other hand learns how to 'grow up' and take charge of his life, actually commit to something, and through Marcus' help, is able to fall in love with a woman, who sees a different Will (more likable Will) through his interactions with Marcus.The writing is really light and humorous. You feel a tremendous amount of compassion for Marcus without being really mushy. It's more emotional than the first impression the book gives. It's told in a way that's very light and not too serious, lots of good humor. I didn't really like Will at first, and I don't think we are meant to. But it kept me from putting the book down simply because the story about Marcus was interesting. As both Will and Marcus' lives started to merge, I think the story got much more interesting and then I REALLY couldn't put the book down."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"I have to admit that I didn't read \`High Fidelity,' but I did enjoy this book. Ok the end was a bit Hollywood, however the story does have some substance.In a perfect world children are able to enjoy their childhood, and adults are responsible people in touch with the society that surrounds them. Well, the world is not perfect, and fortunately for us Hornby explores [if only lightly] these relationships through some imaginative and humorous storytelling.A good read."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"This book is not only laugh out loud funny, it also has a point to it. Both characters are unable to relate to their peers.For me the great thing about this book was not just that what works for us at 12 may not work so well at 36, but also that there is a reason we develop such seemingly stupid defenses. Will may have to shed his &quot;coolness&quot; to get a life, but Marcus will need to get some of Will's hipness to make through adolescence without getting beaten on every day. The ending wasrealistic, not sentimental. Hope the movie does it justice."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"For about the first 200 pages, I felt like I was in the company of true genius. Mr. Hornby is that rare creative talent who keeps the reader turning pages and wanting to know more. But the last third of this novel -- to borrow a phrase from Nirvana -- is \\"Neverending.\\" Will's initial deception to Rachel (who just magically appears without warning)about the true nature of his relationship to Marcus is totally implausible and the narrative shifts away from the relationship between Marcus and Will to Marcus and Ellie and the death of Kurt Cobain. It just goes on and on and on. Great writing, bad plotting. Historically, the book is always better than the movie. Let's pray it's not the case this time."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Will Lightman is a professional lightweight-and he's proud of it. This hip, eccentric 30ish London single drifts through life without really engaging in it. Free to do whatever he wants thanks to a family inheritance he specializes in ephemeral relationships high in sensual satisfaction and bereft of emotional attachment. Unfortunately, Will's having difficulties maintaining his life style as all his mates are growing up-getting married, having kids, taking some sort of stab at responsibility.Will alights on the notion of participating in a single-parent's get together as a means of meeting new romantic possibilities-and has some success. Unfortunately for Will, these single parents all seem to have children that become part of the equation-particularly Marcus, a fatherless lad in need of some guidance, who attaches himself to Will like a leech.This is when the fun really begins.No contemporary author has as firm-and comical-an insight into the idiosyncrasies and absurdities of the male psyche. The great fun in Hornby's novels is how much of yourself (and your friends) you see in them. Are we all really this weird? Yes, we are. And Hornby has the knack for hitting the nail on the head in the manner most likely to to get the most humor out of the situation possible.This book isn't quite in the same league as High Fidelity, the author's previous work, but it is darn close.An excellent and amusing read."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"I've read several books by Hornby, and this one strikes me as his best so far. He combines humor with poignant reality and the pains and joys of everyday life. At times the conversations between the characters have echoes of the hollow dialogue between Hemingway characters in how they fail to connect with each other -- which is, to me, refreshing and realistic. Unlike Hemingway, however, this hits me as funny and tragic. One of the things I like the most about this novel, and other novels by Hornby, is his use of place (set in London). The characters in &quot;About a Boy&quot; frequent the same locations as people from &quot;High Fidelity&quot; and &quot;How to Be Good&quot; which lends a three-dimensionality to all his books. As well, the dichotomy between the way Will perceives himself and the way he is represented through his interactions with others, what he does and says, becomes a commentary on what we are and what we believe we are as individuals. In all, this is an excellent book which deals with reality, and the reality we create for ourselves. I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone interested in British literature (who doesn't mind the infamous 'f-word' used often and somewhat carelessly)."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"I love everything that Nick Hornby creates (so far), but this book is exceptional. It is extremely funny, sometimes darkly so, well-written, and engaging. I actually read it twice in one week - it is rare for me to read ANY book twice, much less in the same week. It is that wonderful. Hornby's treatment of the quirky relationship between a 36-year old man and a rather lost boy is both humourous and heart-wrenching at turns, and deserves to be read by all. I cannot reccommend this book enough."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"It gets under your skin, this book. It starts out deceptively one dimensional. But there is so much wealth of detail and much to ponder in its pages. One of my most indelible criteria is that I must care about the characters in a book, want to know more about them after the story is over. When I began this, the hero was someone I wasn't prepared to like as much as I did at the end. Wish I knew him and what had become of him."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"I'm not certain if all men can relate to the characters in this book, but I certainly can. Their feelings hit home, and while this story deals with people in trying circumstances, it never delves into melodrama. In fact, the situations in this book are laugh-out-loud funny. I've yet to read High Fidelity, but according to reviews this is a trend amongst Hornby's novels.It would be too easy to make characters like girl punk Ellie into stereotypes, but never once did I think they were contrived. Also, a good deal of the plot involves the fate of Nirvana and its effects upon the kids in 1993-1994, and that again would be easy to generalize. The changes in the characters' personalities weren't portrayed as abrupt, they were once again realistic.The main point that I guess I should make is that the book seems familiar. We've all been in Marcus's or Will's situations, and it's nice to find something that reminds you of your own trials and still cracks you up in the process. The ending is very true and very satisfying, and that being said this is probably the best book I have read in a long time."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"As several reviews have commented, &quot;About A Boy&quot; is not another &quot;High Fidelity,&quot; which is a good thing in my opinion since I don't subscribe to the school of thought that says a writer should reproduce the same book as many times as he can get away with it. This novel does have much in common with &quot;High Fidelity,&quot; however, beyond Hornby's hilarious command of voice and his brilliance at constructing scenes that are both awkward for the characters and riveting for the reader. His new main character, Will Lightman, suffers from an unusual problem: living off royalties from his father's Christmas song, he has nothing to do with his time but enjoy himself. Now in his mid-thirties, he is concerned that he has not slept with enough women or listened to enough cool music. He stumbled upon the absurd but wonderful idea of passing himself off as a single father to single mothers so that he can win their sympathies and gain access to their panties. This scheme intersects with an unfortunate boy named Marcus, who is such a loser at his new school that even the other losers won't have anything to do with him. He gets enlisted by Will to pass himself off as his son, and much misadventure ensues.&quot;About A Boy&quot; is partly a coming-of-age story and partly a never-growing-up story, and the two tales intertwine wonderfully. I couldn't quite sign on with Hornby's desire to make the death of Kurt Cobain as a major cultural landmark, on the order of the Kennedy assassination perhaps; nor did I ever buy for a second that hapless Marcus would find himself befriended by the coolest and most belligerent Nirvana fan at their school, but those are a few minor points. No one slings out more entertaining prose than Nick Hornby. I just wish the guy would write more books."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Marcus, the 12-year-old protagonist of \\"About A Boy\\", arrives at a realization late in the book that sums up Nick Hornby's message of enlightened humanism, a theme running through his books: Connecting with new people is one of the only real good things life offers.\\"You could create little patterns of people that wouldn't have been possible if his mum and dad hadn't split up and the three of them had stayed in Cambridge,\\" Hornby writes. \\"It didn't work for everyone. It didn't work for mad people and people who didn't know anybody, or for people who were sick, or drank too much. But it was going to work for him...\\"Marcus's journey begins when he discovers Will Freeman, a thirty-something living off his father's songwriting legacy (one song, a Christmas number he hates) who gives himself points for such things as using the right prophylactic and lives his life of comfortable unemployment in thirty-minute increments. Will's foray into picking up single mothers by pretending to be a single dad brings him into Marcus's world. Marcus sniffs out Will's fakery but promises silence in exchange for some company and ideas on life.Hornby was still a humor writer when he published this in 1998. \\"About A Boy\\" uses humor extremely well if rather darkly in laying out the quiet desperation of both Will and Marcus's lives. Will \\"was one of life's visitors; he didn't want to be visited\\". Marcus wins his company with amusingly dogged persistence, ringing the doorbell of Will's flat in time with the music Will is listening to. Yet he's no operator; in fact Marcus is painfully obtuse and needs all the help he can get.Hornby constructs the book in a clever way, with alternating chapters written from Marcus's and Will's perspectives. He keeps you on your toes by breaking off with sudden plot twists and unexpected dramatic arcs. All this makes for a fun read, but also buttresses Hornby's point about people needing people in order to survive: You never know when someone will come in handy, or how badly.The book was made into a very solid but quite different 2002 movie with Hugh Grant, which preserves Hornby's voice but injects a lighter tone. Readers coming to this book from the movie may be caught off-guard by the differences (Where's Roberta? Where's Will's \\"island living\\" soliloquy?) One early scene in the book and movie has Will turning down an offer to be an infant girl's godfather; in the film he tells the parents casually what could well happen when the girl turns 18. In the book, Will isn't so rudely out there. The jokes in \\"About A Boy\\" the novel are less obvious, more observational.The book's ending is far more challenging than the movie's. You can almost imagine Hornby laying down his comedy-writer's pen in the last fifth of the book, perhaps more than needed; he delivers a mildly upbeat ending that nevertheless speaks to the pain of everyday living as something never overcome, only delayed.I'm in awe of Hornby's writing and his way of constructing a plot, and his cold view of life commands respect. \\"About A Boy\\" brings all this out, and his caustic wit was never on finer display. It's definitely one that sticks with you."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Synopsis: Will Lightman is 36-years old, but lacks goals and ambitions, and is a self-proclaimed 'playboy. He finds that the perfect girl for him would be... who else, but a single mother? After dating one before, he has developed an idea that single moms fear commitment, and would not rush into marriage any time soon. With this 'knowledge,' he makes up an idea of being a single parent, and joins an organization called SPAT: Single Parents Alone Together.There, he meets one of the sons of a group member; a boy named Marcus-- a 12-year-old new kid and an outsider at school. For some strange reason (or possibly a twist of fate), these two form an innocent bond as friends. Eventually, through each other, the other learns to grow up and the other to act his age.Review: I have read other works of Nick Hornby, such as High Fidelity, etc. As expected from any Nick Hornby novel, the usual dose of good writing is there -- with a touch of wit, wisdom, and sarcasm. These three things combined might not work for others, but for Hornby, clearly, they do.I have to admit though, I was just a little disappointed with the book. I have seen the movie adaptation long before, and though I am not the type to compare moviestobooks, for this one, I think I have to make an exception. This is one of those rare instances that the movie was portrayed a lot better. I'm sorry for the lack of explanation, but sometimes, you just feel the way you do, just because. That is exactly the case with this.Don't get me wrong, as I thought there were many funny moments in the book. The story is generally entertaining, and the characters are likable. I thought the development -- plot and character -- were believable. Overall, About A Boy was a quick and 'good' read. If you're going to read this, expect to be entertained, but don't expect too much. It's one of those 'take it or leave it' kind of book. It's a good read, yes, but the truth is, it's nothing spectacular."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"I really enjoyed About A Boy; a fantastic character study of the lives of two very different people. Will, a mid-thirties single man with only himself to think or care about with his compartmentalised but ultimately empty life. Marcus, as twelve year old boy coping with a depressive, suicidal mother while trying to navigate his way through school.Bringing these characters together, along with all their baggage and letting them interact made for an excellent story that is both very funny and hauntingly accurate in terms of bringing the players to life."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"EWGog (Croton NY)Don\`t be misled by all the wankers incapable of finding their way out the front door of Champion Vinyl. &#34;There\`s a wider world out there you squitty sh...y wallies, and a nice bit of it is treated with grace and humor in About a Boy. A good solid read well worth both the time and money."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"I had read this book when it first came out, shortly after discovering Nick Hornby and \\"High Fidelity\\". I loved the writing, the characters and the story. I could easily picture myself in both the protagonist roles, the boy and the man. The only thing that I'd change about the novel would be the climax. While reading it, it seemed fine, but when the movie was released I greatly preferred the way it was done on film."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"3.75 StarsI saw the movie a couple of years ago, so the characters' images have been sort of set for me. Everytime Will's name comes up on the page, Hugh Grant's face pops up in my mind. I quite liked the movie, and didn't mind the cheesy ending. But I've also enjoyed the book. This is one of the rare cases where the movie didn't ruin the book for me.So there's Will Lightman, a 36 year old who apparently has no goals or ambitions. He lives comfortably enough with a steady source of income from his late father's song royalities. He indulges the kid in him, and is still up to date with all that's cool and in, unlike his friends who are gradually getting married, and settled. And actually asking him to be a god father to their kids, the horror.After dating a single mum, he finds that they're exactly what he's looking for. Single mums don't harp on about getting married and they usually break things of with the commitment fearing Will because they aren't ready for a new relationship. With this new found information, he makes up a 2 year old son name Ned (sometimes, Ted) and joins SPAT: Single Parents Alone Together.Through SPAT he meets 12 year old Marcus. A kid who had recently moved to London with his mum and who was having trouble at school. While Will carefully makes sure he's still within the 'cool' status, Marcus is anything but. Marcus wears all the kind of wrong clothes, sports the wrong hair cut and is clueless about most things his peers enjoy (music, video games, movies, etc). And somehow, Marcus attaches himself to Will and forces a friendship that helps one of them to grow up and the other to act his age.This was an enjoyable read. Humor and sarcasm galore that lighten your mood, but it also tackles some serious issues like suicide, single parents, and bullying.I had no problem with Will's character whilst I was reading the book, the portrayal seemed believable. But after finishing the book, I just can't help it..how can a person not be bored from living that kind of life? If my memory serves me right, the movie didn't portray him as aimless as this."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"i thought this book was the original---i must have not understood the description, but it is the 3rd grade interpretation of the original book---not a copy of nick hornby's original book...for what it is , it's great, i gave it to a classroom teacher for their school library"},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Have to admit that at first I thought this book would be another of the typical \\"overly mature child teaches childish adult how to be a grown up. At the same time the adult teaches the child how to be a kid.\\" Because I've heard that story...a couple of times. But I have to say that I really enjoyed this story. This isn't just a case of the kid that got ignored or abandoned and had to be the grown up for a while. If anything this is a tale of what happens when life events force you to realize that things in your life are actually NOT ok, and what steps you take to try and correct it. If you pick up this book and read it all the way through I doubt you'll be disappointed."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"I must confess,I am not the usual everyday reader, but Hornby's novel About A Boy was fantastic.I have watched the movie as well as read the book, and while watching a movie may be more entertaining to some, I would highly suggest reading the book first.Will Freeman is a man living off the royalties from his father's one hit wonder, free from problems and responsibilities. His life consists of long days watching his favortie shows, going to movies, and listening to his favortie musicians in his flat. With all his spare time, he decides to attend single parent meetings by making up an imaginary son to decieve single mothers into going out with him thinking he is a nice, sensitive, family guy.This problem free life was all about to change when a twelve-year-old boy Marcus and his single mom came into Will's life unintentionally. As a result, Will found himself as a father figure for Marcus even though he didn't know why. Marcus is a complex individual who finally opens Will's eyes. Will finds a meaning to his life, other than his previous job, which was nothing.Not being much of a reader at all, I was amazed how much I enjoyed this novel. The author Nick Hornby grabbed my attention from page one with his constant humor and sarcasm. Pick a weekend and start reading. Get ready to join in the life of About A Boy!"},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Nick Hornby's About a Boy is a witty & quirky tale of two \\"boys\\" coming of age at the same time. The catch is that they are completely different ages. Will, one of the main character's, is 36yrs old while Marcus, the other main character, is only 12yrs. Even with the huge age difference these characters manage to grow together & separately as they find who they are and how they have changed because of each other.Will Freeman is a metro-sexual's metro-sexual. He immerses himself in pop culture; he shops at the trendiest places, eats the trendiest foods, gets his hair cut at a salon, and generally takes the time to be cool. He does not work or do anything meaningful with his life. He lives off the royalties of a Christmas song his father wrote in the 50s; a song which Will detests more than anything. He becomes bored with the mundane women he keeps dating who always want commitment in the end which is something he is never willing to appease. He decides that he would instead date single mothers because he thinks they are already tied to previous relationships and to their children to become too serious in a new relationship with him. This is actually a trap Will unknowingly sets for himself and also the driving force of the entire plot. After making up a kid to get in good with a single mother, he meets Marcus; a shy, socially awkward tween who is the exact opposite of Will.Marcus is responsible, generous, thoughtful, honest, and caring. He sincerely wants to understand things that are happening in the world around him. Marcus is not cool or trendy and gets picked on everyday. His parents are divorced and his mother is depressed. The world is turned upside down for Marcus the day he meets Will which is the same day his mother unsuccessfully attempts suicide. Marcus attaches himself to Will for some reason and Will hates it. It starts innocently at first but then Marcus tries to set his mom & Will up but it fails miserably. He pries into Will's life in everyway because he thinks that Will can teach him a few things on how to be cool. What he learns is that not everyone has the answers no matter how old or experienced you are. There is a particularly funny part of the book when Marcus finds out about Kurt Cobain who is Ellie's, a girl Marcus fancy's, favorite singer.I saw the movie starring Hugh Grant and Nicholas Hoult before I ever read this novel and loved it when I saw it. This is the first book I've read by Hornby but so far it is one of my favorite books. The cast of quirky characters drives the novel with a wit and sarcasm that can appeal to anyone. It's commentary on the line between mature and immature, right vs. wrong, and what's best and what's better is a theme that is easily relatable to man or woman...adult or adolescent...parent or child. It had laugh out loud moments as well as moments that melted the heart and then jump started it right back up. An easy read and a refreshing take on the coming of age story told often. I definitely recommend this!"},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Summary of &quot;About a Boy&quot;The book &quot;About a boy&quot; written by Nick Hornby and published in 1998 deals with Marcus (12) and Will Freeman (36) ,who change in the course of the book.

But one day Marcus meets Will .Will is a very &quot;cool&quot; person because he knows what you must wear for being cool and he knows modern music bands.After some time become Marcus and Will become friends.With a sense of humour the author explores the connections people make when the so-called ideal family model does not apply.Because of the snotty writing style everything seems realistic,the dialogs are very expressive.It's a great book,but I think you have to read it at least twice to notice every little detail."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Book review - \\"About a Boy\\"Well. That back-cover blurb is complete twaddle and, had I not read Nick Hornby's previous work, I doubt I would particularly want to give this book a shot! One day, perhaps, book covers will simply tell us what the book is about and leave us to make our own minds up. Perhaps...However, yes - I HAVE read Hornby's previous novel 'High Fidelity' and rate it amongst my top ten of all time. I suspect many other people will purchase About A Boy for the same reason. They will be in for a small shock, though, because the two are quite different.About A Boy follows Will, a single thirty-six year old man who is financially comfortable with little or no effort thanks to the recording royalties of a relative. Deciding that single mothers are the easiest way for this quite shallow man to flit from one relationship to the next, he joins up with SPAT (Single Parents - Alone Together) and here is where the fun begins. Will creates a fictional child for himself and meets dysfunctional 'family' Fiona and her twelve year old son Marcus. The deep but insecure Marcus and the shallow but secure Will do not immediately hit it off but become good friends and somewhat reliant on each other for quite different reasons.Yes, very different to Hornby's previous work but equally impressive. Many side-splitting moments - watch out for the baguette at duck feeding time! About A Boy has the right balance of humour, reflection on life and has something of a serious side when the time is right. Another cracker for the author."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Hi, i think that the film based on the book about a boy is terrible bad.I read the book, then I watched film and and after that I was very disappointed.The film is another example for bad movies based on good books."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"I am ashamed to say that I did not read \\"About a Boy\\" until I heard about the movie.

Few writers I can think of have his ability to write witty, hilariously funny prose whilst managing not to be irreverent or disrespectful of the serious themes he explores. In 'About a Boy' he manages this trick again, very succesfully. Depression, suicide and loneliness are all experienced by the two main protagonists, Marcus and Will. Yet the over-riding irony of the book, the fact that 12-year old Marcus teaches 36-year old Will how to be an adult, whilst learning how to be a child from Will, manages to show us the humerous side of what could be a tragic situation. There are some truly hilarious scenes in the book, most often stemming from Marcus' earnestness and Will's desire to be painfully hip. The transformation of both Will and Marcus, through the shared experience of Marcus' mother's attempted suicide, bullying at school and Will falling in love, is a real treat to read and satisfyingly plausible.I would recommend 'About a Boy' ahead of 'How to be Good', which was less convincing with Hornby writing from a female perspective. I'd also read this before watching the film, as it has considerably more depth, although the film is good itself."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"the guy is amazing. laugh-out-loud funny, poignant. he trades and trespasses on your innermost feelings and thoughts. i saw and enjoyed the film, which i'd probably rate a 3 out of 5. the book is as good as they come."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":". . . in spite of the author's obvious desire to avoid being sweet. Hornby does a good job imagining the inner workings of a boy on the cusp of adolescence. Growing up, one of my friends was a female version of Marcus and I often wondered about her what I imagine Marcus' contemporaries wondered about him: &quot;What planet is this person from?&quot; This work, like _High Fidelity_ before it, also provides an enjoyable glimpse into contemporary everyday life in England from a middle-class perspective.I don't believe I'll lie awake at night thinking about this book as I would something by Fowles or Helprin, or even _High Fidelity_, but I don't regret the time I spent reading it. It was pleasant, amusing and well-written. I'll certainly pick up another work of fiction by Hornby.By the way, even though I haven't seen the movie, I can't help but think what a good choice Hugh Grant must have been for Will. More often than not I caught myself thinking of him as the character while I read the book."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Really enjoyed this book....Hornby has a style that is unique, insightful, funny and surprising.

It made reading fun. Nick Hornby has written a funny yet endearing novel, that kept me reading from the moment i began reading the novel. The book it about an immature 36-year-old, named Will, and a muture 12-year-old,Marcus. Marcus is Will\`s &quot;pretend son&quot;, and he lives with his suicidal mother. Marcus doesn\`t care much about anything, not shcool,home or friends. Will is a person who likes to be alone. He doesn\`t want people to get close to him. Will and Marcus did everything together. I really loved the relationship between Will and Marcus. It made me think that these two actually exist in real life. Nick Hornby writes in such a way that the book has a soul and comes to life. It\`s very much like real life. There is an absurd plot made absolutley beliveable through clear and funny writing. &quot;About a Boy&quot; is smart and witty. It\`s exellent reading on many levels. What more can you ask from a writer? Iloved it to the very end. Suicide was mentioned several times, i think this is and friendship are the main themes in Nick Hornbys novel. This made funny reading, serious. Many laughs came out when reading about duck-killing, smashing windows becouse of Kurt Cobain and so on. Ithink this book suits all age groups. Through 280 pages we get o look into two peoples lives, while the friendship between them growes. And after a while you really feel as if you get to know them. Read it, you\`ll love it!"},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"The book \\"About a Boy\\", written by Nick Hornby \\"Fever Pitch\\" \\"High Fidelity\\", is not a book everybody should be desperate to know. It is like Hollywood - interesting but somehow blank.A 12-years-old schoolboy named Marcus, an outsider at his new school meets the 36-years-old un-married selfish, arrogant Will, who is having fun all day, living on the money his dad earned. Marcus has more traits of an adult when Will and the other way around Will is more a teenager then Marcus. Will helps Marcus to become normal, to get in contact with other pupils and to deal his problems with his suicide-endangered mother. On the other side, Marcus helps Will to become an adult. In the end Will cares for other persons, thinks about the others and him and Marcus is a normal teenager.Of course, the book is nice to read (some parts are), but as said in the first lines, it is entertainment. After you had read the book you will forget it.Sorry for mistakes - i'm from Germany. :-)"},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. I have not seen the movie yet and now I am tempted not to. It follows the life of young 12-year old Marcus and the friends that he makes along the way to coming of age. All of the adults surrounding Marcus are very messed up with very abscure ideas about reality especially the main character Will. None of the adults see anything wrong with large amounts or swearing in front of children or if Marcus decides that swearing is the best way to express himself. Only one couple on the very side lines of the book are married and that is protrayed in a very negative light. Several of the adults smoke pot or talk about it and see nothing wrong with indulging this habit in front of Marcus. By the end of the novel Marcus has &quot;come of age&quot; and firmly believes that it is best if couples do not every marry since they will never stay together and that in order to be a grown-up he must disdain and disrespect what previously his mother had taught him was enjoyable."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"About a BoyAbout a boy by Nick Hornby Cornelsen, 1999, 256 pages.Nick Hornby was born in 1957 and \`'About a Boy'' is his favourite novel. They are all very good that they have all been filmed. Besides writing he also works as the pop music critic for the New Yorker. Today he lives with his family in Highbury, in North London.The main characters of the story are Will and Marcus. Will is a 36-years-old carefree single man.

He get feelings for Ellie but one day he reads in the newspaper that...Nick Hornby's About a Boy has some develop sense of humour in it and sometimes one is interesting how the story will go on .In the first chapters it looks as if you are reading two books because of the structure, but this becomes clearer later. In my opinion the characters are well devised . The end isn't as good as it could be because it is an open ending.So all in all I think that About a Boy is a well-written book which is havily understandable and with 256 pages not too long for such a story. The main characters aren't boring and you don't know how the story will end after you have read 10 pages. So in my opinion it is a good but not a perfect book. I'd like to read better books with more drama and more humour."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"\\"About a Boy\\" entertains you very well.

He is very interested in pop music, films and beautiful, blond women, especially in those who are single mothers.In contrast to this character Marcus, the second protagonist in the story is a caring,old-fashioned and sensitive boy, whose mother is close to suicide. Because of that Marcus was forced to behave like a grown-up. Beside the problems with his depressive mother he is laughed at and ridiculed by his schoolmates who think that Marcus is weird and bully him.Although first it seems that the two main characters don't fit together, a deep friendship between the both develops which changes Marcus as well as Will in a positive way. While Will to be concerned about other people and to get responsible for his action, Marcus becomes a more modern teenager, who is now accepted by his schoolmates and even has a girl-friend.Hornby's language is simple to understand and his style of writing is fluent and fresh. He creates his novel more vividly by using a lot of dialogues and inner monologues.The author uses many stylistic devices like words with double meaning, for example SPAT (=single parents alone together) &lt;-> to spit,(spat). Furthermore you can find ironic elements, especially in the communication between Marcus and Will: \\"England, the world, the universe.\\" (p.76) andexaggerations like \\"You know Michael Jackson, right? He makes million pounds a minute.\\" (p.47).All in all the book is more recommendable than the film, because although there is no real suspense and not much action, Hornby understands to compensate the plot in an interesting way of writing which makes you read on. The writer doesn't describe his characters superficially but he also deals with psychological aspects."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"The story is not everyone's taste. It's quite emotiaonal and there is hardly any action at all. It's a story about relationships and friendships, about very special ones. But during the whole reading I had the feeling the story hadn't begun yet, and when it was over I still had this feeling. The progress of the relationship between the main personalities, Marcus and Will, is not at an end, not at a point where it could stay. The tension is not solved. And exactly that is what I expect of a story. I want to have a completed story.Well, not all was bad naturally. The author created interesting personalities, really particular ones, but not altogether unreal ones. The reactions of the people in the story are always convincing. Sometimes it even seems to be a psychological study of a group of rather odd people on the fringe of society.For who is interested in personalities and not in action or great stories this book is worth reading. A hint: Don't watch the film, it's much more boring than the book and even more uncompleted. First read the book!"},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"First of all I want to say, that I never really wanted to read this book at first! But the within the scope of English lessons I had to do so. Unwilling I started to read and after a few pages I was really enthusiastic about it. This book is written with such looseness and I often had to smile. Even for people who do not have a big experience with the English language it should be easy for them to read this book.But this fact is not the only thing which pleases me. The topics, and especially the development of the two main characters, Will and Marcus, are interesting to follow. Will develops from an adult who wants to be eighteen once more to a grown-up person. The parties and one-night-stands are not still the centre of his daily life. He begins to believe in long-term values like a fixed relationship or real friendships. But he never loses his own identity.On the other hand there is Marcus, \\"the oldest twelve-year-old in the world\\". This boy had to live through a lot of disasters in his live. Just to name a few of them, there is the divorce of his parents and the subsequent move to London, where he is not able to make new friends, and the suicide attempt of his mother. He meets Will and the two become friends. This dissimilar couple is able to help each other managing their own lives.But I do not want to tell too much!

During the course of the book they get to know each other better, they experience a lot together and became friends.I am of the opinion that the main characters are the opposite of the normal clich&eacute;.Marcus is a young teenager who isn't very trendy and Will is a cool and trendy, 36 old, single man.I thing especially this point and the meeting of the different characters make the story very humorous and interesting.This book is with this very advisable."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"The book About a boy\\" written by Nick Hornby has 256 sites. Nick Hornby was born in 1957 and one of his most famous books is \\"High Fidelity\\", but he also works as a pop criticer for the \\"New Yorker\\". He is married and he also got a son.We read the book in our English lessons and it is quite interesting. It deals with the characters of Will and Marcus. Will is a 36 years old woman-user. He does not need to work because he lives of the royalties of successful Christmas song(Santa-super-sleigh), his father wrote. After he has recognized that single-mothers are easy victims for him, he pretends to have a son and goes to Single Parents Alone Together (S.P.A.T.) meetings where he gets to know Suzie and her friends son Marcus. Marcus is the other main character of the story, who is bullied at school because of his clothes and his adult behaviour. When returning from a S.P.A.T. picnic to bring Marcus home, they find Fiona, Marcus\` mother, who has tried to commit suicide. After this event Marcus and Will begin to get to know each other. They learn to behave to their own age.To my mind, the story makes the reader laugh but on the other hand it makes the reader thinking about the difficult situation single parents find in. Nick Hornby does not describe heroes who always win, but real life with its ups and downs. He shows the serious and comical sites of life. So all in all I think the book is quite good because everybody can identifies with the characters in the book because every kind of character is mentioned.KissesAndrea and jana"},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Nick Hornby's books are laugh out loud in a coffee shop funny. He captures the current pop culture like no other author I have read. He is a must read and a good read to get high schoolers reading.

Let me suggest that for someone who doesn't often read fiction, I find Hornby a really relevant and contemporary author, who actually is entertaining and has something to say.In this book we meet two teenagers, Will Freeman a 35 year old man, who lives off the royalities of a song his father wrote, and Marcus, a misfit teenager who is misunderstood at school, and is mothered by a suicidal hippie - Fiona. Will lives the kind of life all teenagers wish they could have, but at Will's actual age realize that his life is empty and devoid of meaning.Marcus is just clueless and his move to a new school has brought many unhappy things to his life, except for Will.Basically the story is about how the two 'boys' interact and mutually force each other to grow up. Will becomes a human being, and Marcus becomes a teenager. The story is hilarious, touching and worth reading even if you watch the movie. Further, after reading the book,I was able to appreciate the adaptation of the novel to the screen.Hornby is very good at putting together chrarecters who are real people - perhaps people we may not want to meet ot actually get to know, but nonetheless, Hornby makes them breath. I could see that all the charecters in the book could actually exist.In short, the book is very worth reading, even if you have seen the movie (the book does takes some surprising turns apart from the movie version), and these are people worth getting to know."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"This is the story of a boy and a man (sometimes I'm not sure which is which) who are trying to find their place in the world. I've not laughed out loud this much while reading a book in quite some time. Mr. Hornby has done remarkable job of getting the right voice for each of his characters. I work with kids Marcus' age and he is right on. This is the first of Hornby's works I've read but it won't be the last!"},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"About a Boy is in some ways the male version of Bridget Jones Diary, exposing the shallow aspect of our nature. The hero Will stumbles on single mothers as the ideal no strings, not ready for a relationship woman for him to prey on. To this end he attends a single parent group meeting and invents a two year old son with hilarious results. Will despite his cynical &quot;I am an island&quot; attitude, becomes ensnared and outsmarted by Marcus a 12 year old role model of uncool, that he meets through this sad little group. Naturally as we have come to expect in such tales, underneath the public facade Will is found to our and his surprise to be much more than first we were led to believe. Love, the non narcissic variety as in all classic cases of redemption, proves to be the catalyst in unearthing the real Will. Nothing new in the storyline, but there is in the insight Hornby brings to the story. Very funny novels rarely explore serious subjects such as suicide, loneliness, social rejection and the effects of parenting without understanding. Hornby does dive into real world issues blending the comedy and the tragedy we all experience in a way few can. The result is a subtle presentation of real life, funny and sad, each facet dependant on the others rather than standing alone. An amusing but thought provoking package, an extremely well written package at that, a cut above the famous Diary for my money."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"The novel \\"About a Boy\\" is written by Nick Hornby. The story takes place in London and there are two main characters who do not know each other at the beginning.Their names are Marcus Brewer and Will Freeman. Marcus is a twelve-year-old boy, but he behaves like an adult. Will is thirty-six old and behaves like a teenager.These two different characters meet in the course of the story. At first they do not like each other, but after a while they become friends.In my opinion the book is entertaining. It delivers inside of the lives of two characters who have to change their behaviour! I thing it is realistic, because Will reminds me of a person in real life.Most the time it is interesting to read, but sometimes it is boring, because you know what will happen...Furthermore I think that it is no wonder that this book became a film, because for me it is a typical Hollywood-story. I do not like that very much as I said above you get to know most at the beginning and everything else is predictable.People who like comedy / love stuff has to read this book, the others: do not, you will find it quite dreary!At the beginning I wanted to lay it aside, but in the end it was good. It started to get interesting when Marcus starts to change...But I do not want to reveal too much.It is a book you will not read again, but you do want to watch the movie, because it is arouses interest of more."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"The book &quot;About a boy&quot; written by Nick Hornby tells the story of two different characters with two completely different ideas of what life should be. Will Freeman, a 36-year-old single, who does not want to keep any real relationship a long time and Marcus, a boy aged 12, who is supposed to be an outsider and has to cope with the suicide attempt of his mother Fiona. Both lives clash into each other when Will invents a son, named Ned and meets with a single parent group to get to know women, who waited for a long time for Mr. Nice Guy. In the park he meets with the single mother Suzie, who is looking after Marcus at this time. The humorous effect of the book is created by Will's sarcastical quotations and the difference between his thinking and acting. During the story, Will and Marcus can help each other to live their age. While Marcus learns to leave a bit of the responsibility he feels for his mother, Will starts to care about more than himself and his pleasure. This development is described by Nick Hornby in a very close way to reality, it's credible and touching. The book's message to look for more in life than your own pleasure or your outward appearance does not prevent the story from being funny and interesting to read."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Nick Hornby's \\"About a Boy\\" is one of my favorite books of all time. Although I couldn't handle Hornby's other works (\\"How To Be Good\\" was uninteresting for me, and \\"High Fidelity\\" had an interesting concept, but I could never read it for a longer time), \\"About a Boy\\" worked for me in more ways than one.The book depicts the miserable life of Marcus, a 13-year old lonely boy who cannot seem to get along with his schoolmates and make friends. He is very smart, a good observer and it is a joy to look at life through his eyes. His mother is divorced and depressed (\\"Usually\\", Marcus says, \\"things are fine until she starts crying over breakfast\\"). On the other side of London lives Will, a wealthy 30-something bachelor who has barely worked a day in his life. Will divides life into 30-minute sections, so he doesn't feel his loneliness and often indulges in women. His latest preys are single mothers, because he finds their emotional instability a perfect match for his shallow ways. It is not long before Marcus and Will meet and by a series of random events become unlikely friends and teach each other the ways of the world.Nick Hornby has published an incredibly insightful book that digs deep into relationships, emotions and the eternal quest for the Truth. He has created memorable characters, who are made of flesh and blood and are easy to relate too. \\"About a Boy\\" is an essential book in your collection of contemporary prose."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"I love the premise: a 30-something with the soul of a kid meets a kid with an old soul. Will is a charming character, and his interaction with Marcus throughout the book is hilarious.The end of the book feels a little disappointing, though. Both Will and Marcus have changed, and the author makes it seem like that change is supposed to be good. I don't know about other people, but I don't love the later Will and Marcus as much as I love the beginning Will and Marcus. The change in Marcus seems especially drastic--in an unflattering way.Having read all of Hornby's books, I think this is about the only one in which he tries to \\"solve\\" a \\"problem.\\" It doesn't really work; I'd much prefer that he lets the story go more naturally without any real \\"solution\\" found in the end. If you know what I mean."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"It took me about 60 pages to get into this book, but at that point, this book really took hold of me. The book's strength is that the characters and the writing is pretty straightforward and accessible, yet says more about the human experience than most other books aspiring to be deep and profound literature.Hornby has a great knack for finding the details that make us unique and human and there's a lot of great dialog between the characters. It's a lot about relationships, and the connections between people that make life meaningful. But done in such a breezy manner through accessible characters we can all relate to. I can't overstate how rare and impressive this is. The characters could easily come across as literary constructs, or the dialog become heavy handed. But Hornby gives this a light touch, creating very real characters in a very real story, expressing very real ideas."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"This is another example of how a good movie cannot compare to a great book. The ending of the movie was fun and so Hollywood. The ending of the book is complex and provocative. I loved all of Hornby's characters and that great English slang. Complex situations with imperfect people all trying to make a go of it."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Following bestsellers as &#8220;High Fidelity&#8221; and &#8220;Fever Pitch&#8221; Nick Hornby&#8217;s novel &#8220;About A Boy&#8221; had best chances to become one of the most popular books of the nineties. Based on one of the favourite themes of the author &#8220;About A Boy&#8221; tells the story of two people: Will and Marcus.The characters:Marcus is a twelve year old boy and lives together with his depressive and suicidal mother in London. As his mother is the vegetarian hippy-type, Marcus clothes and haircut differ a lot from his classmates style. That is one of the reasons why he gets bullied everyday at school. Will, 36, is the antithesis of Marcus: a TV-junkie who spends most of his time by blowing his money. He is living on the royalties of a christmas song his father wrote once and therefore does not need to work at all. He strongly dislikes commitmens of any kind, especially long-term relationships with women.The plot:Will invents a younger son to get onto single mothers. He joins SPAT (&#8220;Single Parents Alone Together&#8221;) where he hopes to meet nice women. When he goes for picnic with one of the SPAT-mothers, they go together with Marcus, who is the son of the woman&#8217;s friend Fiona. On the same day Fiona tries to kill herself and from then on Marcus shows up almost everyday at Will&#8217;s. After a while they get friends and Will shows Marcus how to improve his style and develop his own taste. His situation in school also gets better when he meets Ellie, a grungy and rebellious girl who admires Nirvana&#8217;s singer Kurt Cobain. Starting off as a kind of &#8220;pet-and-owner&#8221;-relationship they later on get closer. But when Ellie smashes a shop window on the day of Kurt Cobains death, he realizes that Ellie can&#8217;t be his girlfriend any longer. In the end of the book both main characters have completely changed: Marcus has become a self-confident teenager, while Will got much more mature, self-conscious and aware of his relations to other people.The message and my personal comment:The message of the book might be that nobody should live in a world of his or her own. That everyone needs people to trust, friends that can take care whenever help is needed. The second message of this novel could be that it&#8217;s not necessarily good to raise kids too individualistic. Because this often means that parents want their children to become like themselves. It might be better to teach them instead how to cope with the sorrounding world by adaption. The book is definitely worth reading. It is well written, the characters are well described and their thoughts, actions and especially their dialogues are very realistic. Most I probably liked the inside-thoughts of Will, the way he looks at the other characters and comments on them."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"I found Nick Hornby and came to love him while reading High Fidelity. After reading \\"How to be Good\\" and thinking it was only ok, I decided to try my luck at this one.I will give Nick this, he is always funny. This book went by very quickly.Will is in his mid-thirties and lives off of his dad's one hit wonder song called, \\"Santa's Super Sleigh.\\" What else does he do? Not much. He basically does all of the things that we do in our down time (those that have jobs) read, sleep, watch tv, visit with friends, work out, go out to eat, and so on. He didn't find anything wrong with it really, and he understands that women may not always be that attracted to him because of the lack of ambition he carries, whether or not he is a good looking man.He stumbles upon a single mom who feels that she does not have enough to offer him, and realizes that he has struck gold. They (single moms) are this hidden resource that he never knew existed! He doesn't have to spend every waking moment with them (because they have less time) great sex, and he looks like this good guy because he thinks it's hard for them to find men to date that will put up with the fact that they have children!He starts going to these single parent meetings S-P-A-T (Single Parents Alone Together) and tries to gain access to all of the single moms only to find out that it's not all it's cracked up to be. But, what he ends up getting out of it, is something that he never knew existed---a life. He meets Marcus, who is the son of a depressed single mom who cries almost every day. He strikes up a frienship with Marcus, who shows him that maybe it's better to give and receive, instead of just receive. He finds meaning in life when he never knew there was any.A touching book, and at times, laugh out loud funny. I'm looking forward to Hornby's next effort!"},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Nick HornbyAbout a boyLondon: Penguin Books, 1998&amp;#8356; 6, 990 141 00733 8\\"...if Will can teach Marcus how to be a kid,Marcus can help Will grow up...\\"The title of the novel by Nick Hornby might make the reader think, that the story is about a little boy, but indeed the reader learns about two of them - Marcus, behaving very strangely and seriously at the age of twelve, and Will, who acts very chaotically and immaturely, although he is a man of 36 years.It turns into a very crazy situation when both meet, but after a while the two come to see, that their acquaintance is very useful as well as for Will as for Marcus. While Will suddenly feels responsible for Marcus\` life as a teenager and learns what it means to feel real love for a woman, Marcus learns how to behave and to look like a boy at his age how to argue with his alternative mum without always losing arguments.It is a pretty interesting and funny plot in the novel \\"About a boy\\". Furthermore with Will and Marcus Hornby created two sometimes very unnerving but also fascinating and lovely characters. Reading the book the reader even might learn to love them: Will\`s clumsy and sometimes insensitive behaviour as Marcus hard-headed way to speak out what he thinks.On the whole Nick Hornby did a really brilliant job and wrote a novel with a plot which hasn't been there before. It is Hornby's ironic and sometimes sarcastic style he often practises in his novel - as for example in \\"How to be good\\" - that makes his books so special. The reader might find himself in a situation in which he doesn't know whether to laugh, whether to cry or whether to do both.To give my own personal impressions of the novel I can say I liked it very much, indeed I liked even best compared to all the other books I had to read for English lessons. I like Hornby's humorous style of writing novels and I'm glad that I read the book before watching the film. Now I'm very interested in the movie with Hugh Grant and hope, he will make Will's character into what I always imagined him to be."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Picked up because nothing else to read on vacation - shocked at how good it was - well written and true, lighthanded while insightful, absorbing.

The movie changed some things about the book, but I think it was much better."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"This book is really funny and Nick Hornby found the right words to describe the characters of the book. Will and Marcus are hilarious. I laughed so many times when I read the book! I love Will's sarcasm.I watched the movie two years ago and thought it was a good one. Hugh Grant is the perfect casting for Will. Now I've read the book and I've never read a more entertaining story at school! But there is also a serious and touching side to it. The relationship between Marcus and Ellie is really cute and that's one thing that is missing in the movie. And when I thought about Will sitting in the SPAT group I almost cracked up.The ending is a little disappointing. I expected something greater than that. Still I highly recommend the book! It is not &quot;About a boy&quot; it's &quot;About life&quot;."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"After High Fidelity, I imagined this might be an ultimate male-bonding/growing up novel. An antidote to selfish 30-something serial dating creature of habit lifestyles, learning to become a human being? Not really. Actually the characterizations are slightly too thin early on for me to take Hornby's motives seriously, and it eventually makes it impossible for him to make his point because he's too interested in appearing funny and setting up the farce side of the equation to completely nail the bonding/growing up side of things. A shame, because he had all the trappings available, and certainly has the talent."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"The novel \\"About a boy\\" is about Marcus and Will. Marcus is a weird and intelligent boy and Will is a cool man. Both come together in the novel and they get a close relationship. The story is very funny and realistic but Will's behavior is not satisfactory. He could be more emotional and enthusiastic. I do not think that most people will be able to identify with Will and Marcus. Both characters are rare but on the other hand that makes the book interesting. So in my opinion everyone could enjoy the book. There is not a certain target group for the book. The narrator in the book tells us the story from to different point of views. So you know the thoughts of both main characters in the book. The book is very easy to read because the language is not very demanding. The language is mostly colloquial. The development of the story is slow but it is exciting. The book has a happy ending where all the problems are solved. But in the end I was a little bit disappointed because I had expected more from the book. The atmosphere in the book changes from funny to dramatic and sad. One chapter is very dramatic but the atmosphere is mostly sad and there are many problems. The special thing about this book is that you can laugh out very laud in one part of the book and in the other part you get very sad because of some problems of the characters. That makes the story very realistic and good.I would recommend the book. You should have read this book. The book is not perfect but it is worth reading. You will laugh a lot."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"This book probably offers better insight into the workings of the male mind than many a pop-psyche guide.Will, somewhat typical of the detached male, is caught between an attraction to the opposite sex and an inability to make any sort of commitment. In a creative attempt to meet women, and to achieve some sort of heroic status as a 'good guy', he poses as a single parent with an absent small child,and turns up to a meeting of the local group SPAT - Single Parents Alone Together.The tangled web of deceit generates not only many tensely amusing situations but also leads him to some sort of redemption. A marvelous read with some really perceptive observations of the contemporary dating scene, and the lives of single parents and children. I rate it better than High Fidelity, which possibly appeals more to male readers."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"I read Hornby's other novel. It was ok. This one is a wonderful book. Hornby knew Marcus and Will, the two main characters. They were real. I've met them on a daily basis before. Now I'll know them better. Frankly, I didn't expect to read one of the best novels I've read when I bought it, and I sure didn't expect to write this. After reading ABOUT A BOY I went to Amazon.com to see what else might be available. If you liked his other work, you'll love this."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Having read About a Boy shortly after finishing Hornby's first novel High Fidelity, I have to say that while I liked this book, it didn't live up to the lofty standards of Hornby's brilliant debut. Hornby again provides a mid-30's male slacker as a protagonist, who feels empty when between relationships but who remains in tune with contemporary pop culture. He even has the protagonist, Will, meet a date in Rob's imaginary record store from High Fidelity, Championship Vinyl, as a playful reference to his earlier book. In High Fidelity, Will stoops to attending single parent support groups to meet &quot;Julie Christie-like&quot; women who, if they didn't have kids, would not otherwise give him the time of day. It is a little reminiscent of Fight Club, but Will doesn't go there to share in their suffering in order to get out of a malaise - he is simply scamming for chicks.Through a complicated series of events which I will not give away, Will becomes entangled in the lives of 12 year old outcast Marcus, and his depressed single mother Fiona, despite the warning signs ringing in his head telling him to stay away. The book is slightly more predictable and less laugh out loud funny than High Fidelity, but Hornby's numerous wry observations about dating (ie Will's sense of when &quot;sex is in the air&quot;) and his dead on dialogue make this a fun, quick read.Nirvana fans will also appreciate the numerous references to the band and to Kurt Cobain - his tragic suicide played a role in the plot indirectly. Even the name of the novel, About a Boy, I think is a play on the song &quot;About a Girl&quot; by Nirvana which was on their first studio album, as well as the first track on the famous Nirvana Unplugged CD. Will teaches Marcus, his student of pop culture, all about Nirvana as well as lessons on the right shoes to wear (Adidas), the proper haircut (definitely not a cut by mom), etc.I thought some of the characters in the book were fairly unremarkable - other than Marcus and Will none of them are explored well enough to really get a sense of them as people. We know Marcus' mother Fiona is depressed, but Hornby glosses over why. Marcus meets an outcast older kid at school and befriends her, but we never really know why the older girl takes an interest in Marcus and why she is always so angry with everyone else. Unlike High Fidelity, where the supporting characters (like Barry and Dick) were half the fun, here the bit players are just kind of along for the ride.In any event, Hornby on his off days is better than most contemporary fiction written by anybody else, and oftentimes in this funny yet serious novel he touches on real emotions and issues like alienation, parental responsibility, and the nature of freindship that elevate this book to a 4 star level. For fans of High Fidelity there is much here you will like."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"First of all, Julian Rhind-Tutt who narrated the story was brilliant! I really enjoyed his efforts to bring the characters to life.This is a touching story of a 'no strings attached' cool dude of a man named Will, who finds himself beginning to care about the people around him. There's Marcus, a 12 year old geek who is being bullied at school and his mother Fiona, who in a fit of depression attempts suicide.Poor awkward Marcus needs Will's help to become 'cool' which Will excels at. Infact, that seems to be all that he's good at. He's so shallow that he thinks it's a good idea to invent a child as a reason to go to Single Parent meetings to pick up women.Fortunately as the story speeds along Will takes a good hard look at himself and realises that he needn't be as empty as his image projects, and Marcus' finds unlikely friends and allies to support him through the tough and awkward times as puberty sets in. This was quite an enjoyable story to listen to while driving to and from work."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"I have just finished reading an excellent realistic fiction book called &quot;About A Boy&quot; by Nick Hornby . I found this book very interesting and well writen as well . The author is obviously very talented as he manages to have a well developed charactor with a completely shallow personality.I thought this book is funny in a sarcastic kind of way . I would recommend this book to any one who enjoys humorous books."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"I'm a big fan of Hornby's after ripping through High Fidelity in 2 days, but was not turned on by About A Boy. Hornby's style of writing is still quite entertaining and the story idea is brilliant...but the author chose to work too hard on the form of the chapters over the function of the book. There are dual main characters, making for a fresh & different read...but the story moves achingly slowly and never once surprised me. And not once did I laugh out like when reading High Fidelity!Thankfully, they did the story GREAT justice in making the movie."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"This book makes you cry one minute and laugh the next. The character development is amazing. I fell in love with Marcus and Will so much that I want to be friends with them. Nick Hornby writes beautifully and is able to put into words feelings that I never knew I had."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"&quot;About a Boy&quot; by Nick Hornby was an allright boook by my opinion, but it could be boring sometimes. I like it when there are not so many persons to look after all the time. The book was easy to ead most of the time, but when the author changed between Marcus in one chapter and Will in the other, because then there was a kind of connection between them. Then it was easier to understand...I think Marcus was the most interesting in the book, both mentally and phsically. He changed the way he dressed (the Kurt Cobain - T-shirt and Adidas basketball boots) and the way he thought of other people (Ellie). I also think he maybe was the wisest one in the book.He always had a reason for everything.Will is the one I dislike most in the book. He is always after women and he lies a lot. How can you lie about having a kid? Just to get the hang of a woman? I did not think that was possible. But Will has his moments too. I think the things he did for Marcus was nice; he took care of him when Marcus's mother was ill. But in a way Marcus took care of Will, too. Will needed care sometimes and that was what Marcus gave him.I think the book was almost boring, but at the end it got more interesting. But then... it was over. I want to know more about what happens with Marcus and Will and how they turn up to be. But I guess I will have to leave that to my imagination."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"This was an excellent book. The characters were real and I think that most readers could relate to Will, Marcus or Fiona. Will's struggle to keep his emotional distance from any real relationships is handled well. Will's and the other characters thought process throughout the book also seem very human. Even though he deals with some serious subjects he does it in an humorous manner and at all times I could picture his characters as real. As soon as I was done with this book I picked up one of his other books Hi-Fidelity."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Nick Hornby tells a perceptive story about a man's 'emotional journey' and a boy's growing up and they seem to almost meet in the middle. Fascinating and funny"},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"I liked this just as much as High Fidelity -- the concept is hilarious, and the story is very funny and satisfying. I'm an American, and I would readily recommend this to my more open-minded compatriots."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"a Brilliant book, a bit embarrasing on the 17:25 out of London Bridge when you start pissing yourself laughing and the rest of the train look at you like you are some kind of basket case. I loved the humour, the brilliant observation, and the way the relationship between Marcus and Will developed. Please read it and don't pay attention to Americans who give it 2 stars !!"},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"While I loved High Fidelity, I was pleased to see that Hornby is not going to stick to his joker-persona; one cannot really build a career on that. About a Boy shows us that Hornby can handle human relationships with care and intelligence that is sadly rare in modern literature. His new style demands some polishing as yet, but I believe if he goes on walking this road, he will write several masterpieces in the future. This book also would have been quite perfect without his slightly over-simplified characters."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"I loved this book as much as High Fidelity, if not more. The book is not only untertaining. NH's view of the parent-child relationship is profound. It shows that even loving parents - the single mother - can be abusive at times. The message of hope lies in Marcus' self preservation instinct, his ability to seek and find help in Will, and teach him one things or two in the process."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"About a boy starts out with a wonderfully funny, wry yet warm-hearted style with interesting, real-feeling characters. Unfortunately, the quality of the humor, story and style slowly but consistently dwindles until there is a faint feeling of relief at having finished the book."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"This was my favorite of Hornby's books - although I enjoyed both High Fidelity and Fever Pitch. It was interesting to see how the characters changed and developed due to their interaction with one another."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Fantstic - from the first page to the last. Hornby fits the lifestyle of the nineties perfectly. The book shows the importance of friendship und personal contacts."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"A powerful insight into several subjects, especially the futility of self-serving lifestyles, mental illness and adolescent alienation. The suicide note is one of the most powerful pieces of prose in contemporary literature - should not be read when feeling depressed! The end is slightly disappointing, but otherwise a &quot;can't put down&quot; book"},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Having watched the movie around seven months ago, I decided that reading the book upon which About a Boy is based would be a good idea. After all, the movie was good and the books are usually better than the movies, so what could go wrong. Happily, not much.This novel is about two characters: Will and Marcus. Will is a shallow man who knows he is shallow and enjoys it immensely; thanks to an inheritance, he is financially independent, so he spends his days having fun and avoiding commitments. Marcus, on the other hand, is a twelve-year-old plaugued with a depressed mother and a school where he does not fit in. Will needs more depth in his life, and in ways, Marcus needs more shallowness. It is left to the reader to determine who is the boy in the title.This is a funny book but it also has real heart. Done incorrectly, Will could come off unpleasant, but Hornby succeeds in making him likeable. Marcus could come off as pathetic, but he is definitely better than that. Since this story is character-driven (what plot there is exists only to further character development), it is essential to have interesting, multi-dimensional characters and this book has plenty of them. Even Will, who strives to be one dimensional, has more to himself than he would like to admit.For those who have seen the movie, the first two-thirds of the book is very similar to the film; on the other hand, the last portion goes in a different but successful direction. Thus, whether you've seen the movie or not, this is a great read, fun from start to finish."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"I wish I read this book BEFORE the movie came out. Although I hadn't seen the movie yet, and I'm glad of this, I still had the image of Hugh Grant as Will throughout this story, which isn't fair. I like having my own ideas of what the characters look like when I read a story. Oh well...Despite the Hugh Grant image, I enjoyed this novel very much. I think that Nick Hornby has a gift of taking very typical problems and solving them in a very unusual way. Just like in his other novel, \\"How To Be Good,\\" one expects things to turn out a certain way, and they don't. Hornby refuses to cater our want for cliche endings, I can see that now. He's very realistic in his resolutions, but fortunately, just because they're realistic outcomes doesn't mean that they're depressing!Immediately I was attracted to the setting of this story. Taking place in the early 90s, drawing largely on popular music and culture at that time, I could totally relate, as a young twenty-something (sniff, sniff...those were the days) in that decade. Anyway there was a nice parallel between the lives of the main characters, Will, Fiona, twelve-year-old Marcus, his school friend, Ellie, and Kurt Cobain of Nirvana. To me, that parallel was how much life in general just traumatizes people and how each person deals with it, each in a very unique way. Some people cry, some hide away, some may choose to turn to stone emotionally, some lash out at the world, some kill themselves.The two big relationships here that most interested me were the one of course, between Will and Marcus, and the one between Marcus and his mom.I just chuckled at the fact that Will, a shallow and totally insensitive guy, decided to pretend to have a son so he could meet single moms, who, according to his theory, were so grateful to have a man in their lives, were extremely generous in all aspects of romantic relationships. Then he met Marcus by accident and formed a bond which forced Will to care about people besides himself. This opened him up to all sorts of feelings for which he wasn't prepared. However, one can clearly see that his life became much richer in the process of opening himself up to more risky situations.I like the development of Marcus, especially in terms of his relationship with his mom, Fiona. It never occurred to me that Marcus' vegetarian diet, his preoccupation for 70s music, and his lack of thought about his appearance, etc., were his mother's issues, forced upon him, without his even realizing it. So at what point would he become independent? At what point would he make his own decisions? Not only that, but because his mom made a point of not letting him fall prey to mainstream trends, she inadvertantly made him an outcast at school...which was even worse for a kid his age! Top that with the fact that they?d just moved to a new school, and his father was no longer in the picture. Basically, this illustration made me think about the kid's view a lot more closely. Whereas my own less significant beliefs are so important to me, how do they apply to my own child? I took many of these little things for granted and reading this story made me really sit and think about this! That's great!Nick Hornby's novels are very perceptive, very funny (I laughed out loud several times), and these days, very universal. Anyone can appreciate the characters he creates. Anyone can relate to the situations in which the characters find themselves."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Hornby has a knack for drawing empathy for his characters. Both Will and Marcus have their odd behaviors which are hilarious. Great book!"},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Nick Hornby's About a Boy portrays the story of two people helping each other to grow up, fit in with others and face the challenges of living. Will is a thirty-six-year old Londoner who proudly acts like a teenager. He lives on his father's wealth and spends all his time browsing around for CDs, watching TV, and dating women. Marcus is a strange twelve-year-old who has trouble fitting in at school and dealing with his even stranger, depressed mother at home. Things are changed on the day Will and Marcus meet. Will is just chasing after a girl on a weekend picnic, when Marcus, with all his troubles, enters into his life. Reluctantly, Will becomes Marcus' friend, and Will's place becomes Marcus' escape from his school and his suicidal mother. As Will helps Marcus deal with his problems, Marcus brings Will back to face reality, and he helps fill the empty part of Will's life.The best thing about this novel is the way it was written. The voice of the characters truly illustrates their ages, and the readers feel as if they are listening to real people in a real situation. In spite of the darkness and seriousness of the events, Hornby's style is not depressive. While providing a sense of irony or humor, he turns simple everyday-life events into a drama.Will and Marcus are unique characters, who will make the story unforgettable. Hornby keeps the audience curious and wanting to continue. Marcus' good intentions and naive behavior are clearly evident in how he always cares about other people's feelings and tries to protect them from their misery. Also readers will enjoy Will's coolness, fashion and convenient lifestyle. They will see how Will's life is changed when he meets Marcus, \\"He'd had his whole life set up so that nobody's problem was his problem, and now everybody's problem was his problem, and he had no solutions for any of them.\\"About a Boy is enjoyable from the first to the last page. It is funny, meaningful and worthwhile, and is suitable for adults as well as teenagers. Readers will enjoy the sarcasm and the humorous style. However, since the book often mentions serious issues about the meaning of life, a young audience might not understand or find it interesting. People who read this novel will, along with Will and Marcus, gain a better understanding about their position in the world, and they will become better survivors, while seeing the rewards of cherishing friends and family."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"This is the third Hornby novel, and with each he gets better and better. An amusing and intelligent style, crisp and delightful characterizations, and sharp insight into human nature and our times. He is able to combine(typically British) comic sense with warmth, compassion, and a tough tenderness for his characters. This is the best book I have read in some time."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"How many of us have felt like Marcus - alone, a misfit, being laughed at? And how many of us have been Will - seemingly having it all but on the inside, just as confused as everyone else. This book takes two seemingly disparate characters and weaves them into a single story - both learning from one another and realizing that they are not so different after all. The story is about being yourself and how you can learn from yourself as well as your friends how to make it in a confusing world that seems devoid of common sense.Marcus is a decendent of Holden Caulfield, Studs Lonigan, Benjamin Braddock and Rob Gordon - all young men confused with life and how to deal with it and not necesarily understanding it. Most of us can see an autobiography in here. The point the book made to me is that sometimes you need to find your own happiness inside you. It's great to have friends and those you love but ulitmately, the responsiblity is on you for your happiness. And sometimes the answers are not as clear as they should be.About a Boy is in the class with Catcher in the Rye and The Graduate. As always, Nick Hornby's work is always heartfelt and sincere. I would put this book into my top 5 favorite books of all time."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"A wonderful story about two very different people -- one, a 12-year-old sheltered boy, the other, a 30-something avoider of life -- who come together and somehow learn enough from each other to improve themselves. By the end, one has lowered his walls and become engaged in life, the other hardens himself and becomes more respected by those around him. As with all of Hornby's writing, there is a great deal to laugh about in this book. But it is a more self-revelatory laugh, one in which you may not be laughing so much at the book's characters, as you are in recognizing one's own failings."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Set in London in the early 90's, \`About a Boy' tells a unique story about two people -- a lonely, ostracized boy (Marcus) and a wealthy, easygoing 36-year-old (Will) living off his late father's royalty checks and out to date single mothers. You'd think at first you wouldn't be able to relate to their unusual circumstances. The experiences that transform them don't happen to most people -- it's a success in itself that Hornby can merge such diverse (some just plain weird) events into one coherent story line. Through all this, both characters try to find a balance between independence (for a sense of completeness) and vulnerability (just enough to forge meaningful relationships but not too much that one would be incurably lonely) -- each character starting from opposite extremes. It's a theme that is both inspiring and universal.My only complaint about this novel is that some scenes could have been written more concisely. It is good writing overall, but some points are overstated. Told in the 3rd person, Hornby frequently writes both what the character says and what he/she feels. Sometimes needlessly, and it feels tedious. When Marcus hears a sarcastic remark (he doesn't understand sarcasm), it becomes exasperating to read about his confusion, then Will's reaction, their conversation including an obvious joke explained. Unfortunately, a time line of several months accommodates quite a number of sarcastic jokes.As a whole, \`About a Boy' is a great read. The story line is highly original, the characters are interesting, and their British slang expressions are cute. The novel is both inspiring and entertaining."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"I still have trouble figuring out which of Nick Hornby's books I like better. He is so honest in his writing and his characters are so real that it is impossible to not relate to them immediately. Great book for anyone, entertaining, funny at all times, intelligent humour and reflective on the human condition, whatever that means. (sorry, I can't find a better word to describe the spirit of a man that lives in this world and has no idea what to do with his life - which is what we all question ourselves, isn't it?)"},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Even though About a Boy sometimes moves in circles, and the ending seems like a beginning and therefore I WANT MORE (so goes life), I loved it! Since Will doesn't work and can afford anything he wants, all of the feelings he finds himself surprised to be feeling are shockingly intimate and purely interpersonal (I visited a lecture on the English novel at Columbia, and the professor was saying that the characters are often upper-crust people so that the steamy emotional problems they get mixed up in are unadulterated by more elementary worries, and Hornby seems to adopt this framework for his novel so that he can delve more deeply into Will than, say, the main character in High Fidelity). Marcus is a graceful character, and Hornby has the writer's imagination required to tell a story from a child's purer point of view. Will and Marcus balance each other perfectly, and About a Boy was a refreshing read, surprisingly optimistic."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"I must admit, if it wasn't for the movie version of this book, I may never have read About a Boy. I knew the book existed, but was never compelled to read it. Then I saw the movie and realized what I was missing. And while the book and movie endings are different, About a Boy (the book) is nothing short of spectacular.Will Freeman, quite possibly the world's most useless man, is jobless and responsibility-free -- and he likes it that way. Living off the royalties of his father's one hit song, Will finds his days full of lounging around, going to movies, and sitting in front of the TV watching Countdown. And while all this free time is at his disposal, Will has plenty of time to discover that single moms seem to be the most grateful for a date with him. Thus, Will puts a fool-proof plan into motion -- make up an imaginary son and join one of those single-parent support groups in an effort to meet women.However, About a Boy is not all about Will meeting single mothers. It's... about a boy, Marcus, the 12-year-old son of one of the single mothers who comes into Will's life and turns it upside down. Suddenly Will finds himself, unwillingly, as some sort of mentor or father figure for Marcus, which totally distracts Will from his true purpose of being free from problems and responsibilities.I loved About a Boy. The writing is authetic Nick Hornby, full of humor and sarcasm, but also there is a lively perceptiveness at work here that goes to show you one spontaneous decision can sometimes add meaning to your life. Prepare to laugh out loud with this one!"},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"&quot;About A Boy&quot; shows Nick Hornby's maturity in his writing. This novel is about the sweet relationship between a 12-year-old outcast and a 36-year-old playboy, both of whom narrate the story. Marcus, the boy, is tragically unhip and is horribly teased at his school. Will, the man, is living easily on royalties of his father's work without a care in the world. When their paths meet, the story is a rich coming-of-age for both, with its share of humorous and heartbreaking moments.Will joins a single parents group in hopes of meeting a sector of women he didn't knew existed. Through a racked chain of events, he meets Marcus (and Marcus's mother). Marcus comes to enjoy Will's company, and when he discovers Will's little secret, he blackmails Will into helping him. Will can teach him how to be cool and tell him important stuff like who Kurt Cobain is. But when Marcus is confronted by his mother about the mysterious trips he takes after school, it looks like the jig is up--for both Marcus and Will.Hornby wrote this book in the third person, and I believe that gave him a little more &quot;room to breathe&quot;. He cane look at situations from more than one point of view and write with a more objective frame of mind. This makes &quot;About A Boy&quot; highly enjoyable and accessible to all audiences."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Having enjoyed Hornby's more recent novels, HOW TO BE GOOD and A LONG WAY DOWN, I thought I'd start reading his earlier novels. Hornby has a gift for taking on big existential themes like despair and suicide and presenting them with a gentle but incisive humor that doesn't trivialize them. And he peoples his stories with a heterogenous mix of characters who seem determined to misunderstand one another but who eventually make their compromises with life without too much loss of dignity and who discover something greater than romantic love or sex--a deep sense of community, a profound and inclusive sense of rootedness in a shaky and transient world.ABOUT A BOY centers on the relationship between a young boy, Marcus, and an unattached, cool bachelor, Will, who has joined the boy's mother's support group SPAT (Single Parents-Alone Together) as a way to meet grateful but unclingy women. It is clear from the start that Hornby could have named this novel ABOUT TWO BOYS and the novel has much to say about what it means for boys and perennial bachelors to grow up. It has much to do with taking risks, opening oneself up to other people (even to those you want nothing from), honoring real losses, and taking life on life's terms. As the wise child Marcus observes, two is not enough. He believes in \\"human pyramids.\\" \\"I feel better and safer than before,\\" he tells his late-to-the-game real father, \\"I was really scared because I didn't think two was enough, and now there aren't two anymore. There are loads. And you're better off that way.\\"A word to those who saw the movie: The book is really worth reading, so don't dismiss it if you didn't like the movie. Although I can't imagine anyone but Hugh Grant delivering Will's lines (and all of the casting was excellent), the book does NOT end with a corny middle-school talent show. Hornby uses another event to bring the story to a head and resolve its many little plot lines, one more germane to the themes of the book. All in all, a more thoughtful and satisfying ending."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"About a Boy really gets to the heart of what it means to be a boy, and as we all know, boys come in all ages. The two main characters are Will and Marcus. Will is a professional at keeping disconnected. He lives off of the royalties from a song his father wrote. This has allowed him to live a carefree life of unemployment. However, there is a dark side to this. The song ruined his father's career, and slowly it's eating away at Will's soul as well, even though Will likes to pretend that he is happy with his life.Enter Marcus. Marcus a 12 year old product of a broken home, changes Will's life forever. In the end, both boys find their own way of growing up.If you're a woman and you have trouble understanding what men are thinking, this will show you the inner workings of a man's mind better than a thousand books on relationships. Be careful though, the truth might be a little scary for you. As for guys, you might realize some things about yourself that you have never thought about before.For those who have seen the movie and are wondering if they should read the book or not, you should know that the ending of the book is completely different from the movie. You really should give it a read."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"The novel \\"About a boy\\", written by Nick Hornby, is a funny and entertaining book but it also focuses on some serious problems. It is about the 12-year-old boy Marcus, the 36-year-old Will and the problems they are facing in their lives, which are not developing exactly as expected. When I started to read the book I was a little sceptical. I do not really like reading books, especially not books that are forced on me at school. But this book was both funny and interesting. I really had a hard time putting it down. It describes the lives of a 12-year-old and a 36-year-old, who is not exactly behaving the way people their age would . Marcus is an over-mature, left out loser, and Will is a childish man with no interest in starting a family or in any way get grown up. Nick Hornby\`s way of writing can sometimes get a little difficult to read. He writes his sentences in such a way that they become very long, and sometimes difficult to understand. He puts so much information into some sentences that you has to read them both two and three times before you get the meaning. This made me a little confused, but it is also the only fault I found with the novel. Besides being a humorous book, with ducks which is dying in strange ways and lots of weird people, this is also in one way a serious book. It shows us how complicated and confusing life can be for a 12-year-old, who has no friends, do not behave like everyone else and who do not have any parents who are capable of helping him. This book surprised me in a very positive way. And I would definitely not think twice about recommending it to all kinds of people, young and old. I think \\"About a Boy\\" is a very good novel!"},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"In this book, an unattached, disengaged 36 year old man and a strange, troubled 12 year old boy teach each other how to grow up. The theme of the book seems to be that, in order to participate fully in life, we must make choices concerning how to be, but we also must make compromises. Nothing is gained without a price. And we must weight carefully the worth of what we are willing to sacrifice for what we hope to exchange. After all, what is at stake is more than just fitting in or engaging with people, it's our identity.In the course of the novel, and through his relationship with Marcus, Will comes to trade security, comfort, detachment, disengagement, and a kind of anti-hero sense of rugged egocentrism for participation with others. It's not a struggle easily won. But, we are gratified when it is, because, until it is, Will is barely alive. He has money, security, and spends days entertaining himself for himself alone; in many ways he has an ideal life. But Hornby takes pains to demonstrate the vacuity of this kind of life. One of the points of the book is that isolation is a kind of curse. Will is a kind of laboratory with which to explore this idea because he is unlike the other characters. His isolation is carefully chosen and nurtured, while the other characters are desperate for contact.Marcus serves as a kind of laboratory, too. He is genuinely nice and has special qualities that distance him from his classmates. But, as we all know, making one's way in school demands conformity. Because he is kind of weird, Marcus is perhaps justifiably teased. And because he lives alone with a suicidal mother, Marcus decides that having more people around him is better than living with all one's eggs in one basket - safety from isolation in numbers as it were. Yet, at the end Marcus, too, grows up and learns to conform. He gains more people in his life, but perhaps there's a hint that the price he pays for this conformity may be soul-crushing. After all, he learns to be more like the former Will.And, it's hard to know what to think about this. But, if anything, this beautiful book teaches us not to be so cavalier with the choices we make. Because everything is a trade-off."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"I had read many reviews of Hornby books before I bought this book - and I had a feeling that I would like it b/c of the movie High Fidelity. But, I had no idea how much I would like it - Hornby is truly the master of the male confessional. He understands how guys (and women) think - and not normal, generic guys, but smart, complicated men. The entire book is full of wit and emotion and honesty - but a 3-page passage beginning around page 245 is one that I will never forget. It starts out with a discussion of suicide and depression, and the reasons for living (but in a coloquial manner, not highly philosophical) - and then it turns to the best description of how a man (Will) loves a woman that I've ever seen/heard/read. I even typed up the passage to save and send to my girlfriend. I can't wait to read his other books, knowing that every part of his novels allows the reader to connect with himself. Other reviewers have described the plot well, so I'll leave that out, I just wanted to focus on the poignancy, wit, humor, and honesty of the novel. And I will always remember the characters in the novel, and when I see someone like them in real life, I'll say &quot;he's just like Marcus/Will/Fiona&quot; -- You must read it!"},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"In this follow-up to his smash hit HIGH FIDELITY Nick Hornby gives us another hip Londoner in his mid-thirties to sink our contemporary teeth into. Will Freeman's name alone should indicate sufficiently where his character is coming from--he's jazzy, he's today, he's independently wealthy--heck, he's almost archetypal \\"men's-magazine cool.\\" Sub-zero Will may be, but ah, that's about as far as his life's ambition impels, so don't ask him to be godfather to your child. That independent wealth thing, as many of us could stand to risk finding out, cuts both ways. Will's not rich, mind you, it's just that his breezy middle class lifestyle simply doesn't require that he work--he lives off the royalties of a Christmas song his late father wrote. It stands to reason that he cringes at hearing \\"Santa's Super Sleigh\\" and would just as soon give the holidays a miss.But Will is not the \\"boy\\" of the title--not really, anyway. The boy is Marcus--twelve-year-old son of an overly sincere, political-vegetarian, Joni Mitchell fan of a depressed single mom that won't let him be a kid. The book is the story of Marcus and Will's friendship and the two are actually dual protagonists--Hornby does a fine job balancing their perspectives with a third person narrator limited in omniscience to the two of them. Marcus is a strange kid who is done no favors by his strange mother. He is also a lonely and tormented pre-teen, but still has the wherewithal to blackmail Will into a friendship. This after he finds out that Will pretended to have a child just to meet single moms. As you can see, theses two don't have your typical Big Brother program relationship.Hornby masterfully--and without seeming to exert himself--conveys the world that both Marcus and Will have to grow up in. His secondary characters aren't as fleshed out as some might desire, but nor are they the stereotypes you might find strolling the sidewalks in any given city. ABOUT A BOY is a sharply written, fun-to-read tale about the inevitability of engaging with life. It doesn't surpass HIGH FIDELITY, but this book sure does live up to it admirably. Give us more, Mr Hornby!"},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Nick Hornby's About A Boy is a novel that is set up like a romantic comedy, complete with the single mom, the cute kid and a love/hate relationship. That is how he involves us into his story, but he's on to much more. Will Freeman is a man with no job, and no plans to get one anytime soon. And yes according to formula he starts out as a sworn bachalor, cynical and wary of the idea of steady relationships and children. And according to formula we've learned from countless other novels and movies this will be the story of his redemption and retraction from that position. But it is in his highly original characters and acute observations that Hornby makes this novel so much more then it looks.One character observes about Will Freeman that the very fact that he can survive without a purpose, without a hanger to hang his life on is in fact quite an achievement. &quot;THERE IS NOTHING STANDING BETWEEN YOU AND DESPAIR&quot;. Ofcourse as his detachment and cynical attitude towards romance fades, his dispair grows. I'm reminded of that great line from Springsteen &quot;YOU CAN'T SHUT OUT THE RISK AND THE PAIN WITHOUT LOSING THE LOVE THAT REMAINS.&quot;The other side of the story involves a twelve year old and his mother, who is a woman who &quot;SHUTS HER EYES WHILE PLAYING THE PIANO&quot;, who in her passion and romantic dreams exposes herself to the pain so often inflicted when these dreams crash and burn. She is linked to Will through her son and what develops is not your average sugary sweet romance at all. I don't think I'm giving anything away by saying that the romance in this book is not between her and Will.Readers who buy this book, will undoubtly do so for the slice of life London setting, for the music, for the romance and for Hornby's honest and funny writing, yet as if these things weren't enough, the book will pleasantly surprise all its readers with it unexpected insight.I actually believe this to be superior to High Fidelity, because as good and honest as that book was, it suffered from its singular prespective, the narrator's one, who just slightly wears out his welcome towards the end. About A Boy has more points of view, more scenes and the same unflinching honesty. Do yourself a favorand read this one, because in its own way it will reach and surpass your expectations more then any Booker prize winner ever could."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Although \\"About A Boy\\" deals with some serious problems, it is a book which is easily read and which makes the reader laugh. The mix of bizarre characters and dialogues in funny situations and various serious problems is very well balanced, so that none of the aspects is neglected. The book provides a deeper view into different characters that change in the course of the story without losing their strange individuality until the end, which is better and more realistic than the typical \\"complete metamorphosis\\" stories. It proves that Hornby is a keen observer of human nature and that he is able to find the right way to express it. The direct, sarcastic tone of the novel and the authentic way of writing enable the reader to laugh and to think about the protagonists.The book is worth reading because it is fun. Introducing all kinds of flawed characters, the book appears to be something like a \\"freak show\\" and the reader feels comfortable to take a look at it. But then, the people are closer to reality than expected. We start to sympathize.The novel also reveals that maturity does not depend on a person's age. There is a 36-year-old man who acts like a teenager and a 12-year-old boy who had to grow up prematurely. It teaches us that there is no point at which a person is an \\"adult\\" and that maturity is not equal to adulthood. This is a lesson that especially older people should learn.To sum up, the novel \\"About A Boy\\" can be recommmended for its entertaining and at the same time instructive story."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"&quot;About a Boy&quot; is a book that I just gobbled up. Weighing in at around 80% dialog, the book was consumed over the course a few meager train rides. This is an ultimate popcorn book. Page after page flows through your hands, never really engaging your thinking brain but fully engaging your wit.The characters were smooth and the dialog was dry and clever. There is a rough plot, just barely enough to string together a cast of characters and to give them something to quip about. Alot of the drama, is seemingly heavy, but seen through the eyes of the characters it soon descends into just another bit of life about which to make smart remarks. The teen angst has all the power of any teen angst, and remains just that.This is my first Nick Hornsby book, although there will be others. Lots of fun all around. A nice break between more weighty books, and there is nothing wrong with that at all."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It was a very fast, easy, enjoyable read with interesting characters. I liked it more than High Fidelity, which was somewhat depressing..."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Nick Hornby's &quot;About a Boy&quot; was a sheer pleasure to read. It is the story of Will Freeman, a 36-year-old aimless womanizer and aging hipster. Freeman unexpectedly falls into a friendship with 12-year-old Marcus, a hopelessly uncool little boy with a remarkable lack of cynicism. The ways in which they enrich each others lives are witty, memorable, and heartbreakingly real. Hornby has always been a very funny, ironic writer (see his earlier novel, &quot;High Fidelity&quot;, for proof of that) but here he displays a talent for creating rounded, lovable yet flawed characters. I couldn't put this book down once I'd begun and you'll do the same."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"This book was hilarious. The characters were amazing. Most importantly, it was a fast read. I went on vacation and needed something for the plane and this was perfect. I read it practically from start to finish, and I loved every minute of it."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"A very well written book projecting the evolving relationship between a boyish man and a manish boy in modern England and the way they help each other realize their own selves.Will, leading a (what many men would think) perfect life, not having to work but still being able to enjoy it, with his fancy car and yappie ways encounters a boy way beyond his (and his own) years.They both find new things about life and about themselves and they build this amazing and unbelievable at first friendship.A light, pleasant read, recommendable to spend the warm/hot days of the summer with...."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"I'm going out on a limb here, and actually proclaiming a movie is better than a book. If you've seen the movie, you might be disappointed by the book a bit. The funniest parts are all intact in the movie, so you're not really missing much by not reading this. The endings are very very different, but I think that the movie's ending comes to a much more natural conclusion. If you haven't seen the movie, definitely read this first...it's a great read, and then proceed to the theater or rental shop and be floored by how good the movie adaption is."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"I read this book after seeing the film, and so I don't know how much one has been affected by the other. (Hugh Grant was perfect casting for Will, in my opinion.) But overall, I felt that this book was humorous and enjoyable, making me laugh out loud at times. Marcus is written believably and I really enjoyed the chapters from his viewpoint.My only gripe is that the end of the book is a little laboured, especially the conversation between Marcus and his dad. Also Marcus and Ellie's friendship was cute, but didn't always come across as believable. But these flaws didn't seriously detract from the book and I recommend it as a comfortable and gently humorous read."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"I need not summarize the plot, I am sure. There are two boys involved here -- one is thirty-something and the other is twelve. The story revolves around their relationship and the ways in which the relationship helps each of them to grow up. The novel is charming, but not fast-paced. It is more of a character study than an adventure. It's literate, well-written and humorous at times.Incidentally, I bought the book and read it because of the several movie reviews that I read about the Hugh Grant movie based on the novel. I have not seen the movie, believing that the novel is ALWAYS better than the cinematic version. Perhaps I will see the movie on DVD when released and write a review of it."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"If I had a Will Freeman in my close cirlce of friends I do not know that I would look upon him with the fond bemusement I bestowed upon Will throughout this very readable book. I suspect I would wonder if he was ever going to grow up and become substantial enough to throw a shadow...even worse, I would be suspicious of Will's absolute enjoyment of his feckless ways, and have to mutter with friends (sensibly ensconsed in jobs, relationships and debt) about the certain ruin it was bound to bring. Will Freeman, and all the various people in \\"About a Boy\\" are deftly drawn and manage not to become cartoon characters. Once I picked it up, I had a hard time putting it down......I wanted to see how Marcus, the boy, would manage with all the adults in his life, the newest being Will. Will, did not ever ask for Marcus. Marcus just kept showing up and Will just got used to him until an unlikely friendship takes hold. This friendship, no matter how strange will get them through some pretty bizzare and some pretty tough times. What remains is what remains with the reader when the book is over, a sense of community, no matter how odd that we all can piece together. And there are plenty of laugh out loud moments. Especially when my daughter mentioned that SPAT (Single Parents Alone Together) sounded better and more descriptive if it were SPLAT ...(add Loser). A weak laugh from newly divorced mom!"},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"As a late twenty something male and as an outsider during Junior High, I found it impossible not to laugh at nearly everything in this book.Hornby has an unbelievable way of creating situations that allow his characters to fully shape themselves. He gives them a name and rough personality, but then the situation shapes them (like real life,) unlike many writers who have a character in mind and have to create a story around them, therefore making a choppy, unrealistic read.The book also ends different than I thought it would when I was half way through. It is refreshing to be tricked or surprised by a book these days.Highly Recommended"},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"When I first started to read this book I didn\`t think much of it, but as I read on, I started to come into Nick Hornby\`s narrative structure. By that I mean that he has a special way of writing his books. I found this way confusing in the start, but as I got further in the book, I realised that his way of dividing chapters was very smart. Will and Marcus are the two main character in About a Boy, and they appear in every two chapters. &quot;About a Boy&quot; is a moving story about a single man (Will) who acts as father figure to a young boy (Marcus.) We are brought into Marcus\`s and Will\`s world. Both of them live in London. Marcus used to live in Cambridge, but when his mother decided to move avay from his father, they went to London. Marcus is 12 years old. He is a \\"lost child\\" The children at school are giving him a hard time, and he has no friends. He is not up-to-date to put things that way! He is having a hard time adjusting to his new enviroment. Will is a single male. He is 36 years of age. I think he is a little bit desperate and has to make up a lot of lies to get the women he wants. He is pretty into Nirvana. He has all of their records. As I said earlier, these two characters are brought together and spend some time together. Nirvana and Kurt Cobain play an important rollfigure in About a Boy. There is a lot going on at the same time, and we can\`t avoid some conflicts and complications. For example when Marcus finally gets himself a friend he becomes more like the other children. His new friend happens to be a girl. A girl that loves troubble, and can\`t avoid ending up in some. Will has done a great job with Marcus. He told him stuff he didn\`t know. I would have mentioned more about these things if this wasn\`t a review. All I can say is that Nick Hornby\`s sense of humor is great! He uses Will to express his humor. He has a fresh vocabulary. He uses a lot of swearing to prove a point. That is mainly why I say that Nick Hornby has a fresh vocabulary. If you choose to read this book, it will be worth your while.By Espen Navjord."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"This book is one of the most enjoyable books I have ever read! I picked it up at a bookstore and after reading the first sentence I was hooked.It is about Marcus a 12 year old who really doesn't fit in anywhere,and Will a 36 year old who can't seem to grow up and get a job. The converstaions are witty, and funny, and are very real like.Anybody who likes a good read about life should read this book."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"This book is one of the most enjoyable books I have ever read!I picked it up at a bookstore and after reading the first sentence I was hooked.It is about Marcus a 12 year old who really doesn't fit in anywhere,and Will a 36 year old who can't seem to grow up and get a job.

I recognize so much of myself in Hornby's leading men and, whether I like it or not, it makes me laugh and think about just what it is that I value. The story's premise is solid, the writing tight and it's execution is solid. The story does become a little predictable and the ending kind of fizzles for me, but the book is still highly worth reading. Hornby plays up the suicide angle, but seems to miss some opportunities for deeper thought on the subject and that's the only thing keeping this book in the three star category for me. If you liked High Fidelity, you should read this book. If you liked this book, you should really be excitied about High Fidelity."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Nick Hornby writes a funny yet endearing novel, that kept me reading from the moment I opened the book.

There were no serious social issues addressed and there were no thought-provoking ideas. It was just an escapist novel, and I enjoyed it being that way. I had fun reading it."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"A quibble first: the editor of this book seems to have over looked that fact that the protagonist is called Will Freeman most of the time and seems to have the surname Lightman once in a while. Odd.Both surnames are apt, however. Ironically, of course, since this is a Nick Hornby novel. &quot;Freeman&quot; is apt because Will has never had a job and doesn't need one because he lives off the royalties of much anthologized Christmas song written by his now-dead father. &quot;Lightman&quot; is apt because Will is a true lightweight, having cultivated an existence that seals him off from adult relationships and even strong emotions. His first name is also ironic because one of the many lessons that he learns in this story is that he does have the will to go on with his life. Although he does very little with his life, it is meaningful to him, which is more than most of the other adult characters in this book can say.Will is a full-grown man who acts like a boy and Marcus is a 12-year-old boy who has the emotional responsibilities of an adult thrust upon him by his emotional unstable and dogmatically &quot;progressive&quot; mother. Hornby switches the narrative perspective between Will and Marcus in alternating chapters and manages to believably emulate the point of view of both a 12-year-old and a 36-year-old. This is especially affecting when you read their separate interpretations of the same events; the similarities and differences are both hilarious and touching.The music of Nirvana and the last months in the life of Kurt Cobain as viewed from afar through the media figure in the second half of the novel and serve as a sort of star that all the characters follow toward their future and enlightenment. I'm not sure anyone will understand this part of the book 10 years from now, but so be it."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Awesome book, it was a pleasure to read it all along. Every word and every thought in the right place. I felt so identified with and connected to the situations and characters of this book I almost thought someone had been monitoring my life! Not that anyone cares about my life anyway but what I mean is, it's is such an honest picture of what goes on within relationships and between people. Life looked at and lived from different angles, all of them equally true and real but still different and even sometimes in straight opposition. And there are so many hilarious details that no other author takes the time to write about and few people in real life pay attention to. The book is an amazing trip to discovering new highlights of human relationships not in a theory-like but rather a practical, wit, sharp and sometimes cynical version of life. A comic book featuring ourselves trying to survive our own selves in this world. Congratulations to the author."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"I read High Fidelity and liked it a lot. About A Boy was even better. Nick Hornby is a riot."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"I was anxious to read this book, after thoroughly enjoying High Fidelity. Although About a Boy starts out strong, it quickly loses steam (both in terms of humor and subject matter). Compared to High Fidelity, About a Boy was sophomoric in its observations of single parenthood and of a child growing up without a father -- a true disappointment."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Nick Hornby has excelled with this novel. About A boy certainly justifies Hornbys inclusion in the five best authors of the nineties. Few books are of the type that you cannot go to sleep as you need to get, just to the end of the chapter.

Read it and obtain an insight into the nineties man."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"i enjoyed this book, but i think it ccould have been ten times better had it kept to the humor of posing as a single father. my complaint is that it wandered from that to marcus and while i found it all interesting i wanted more wacky slapstick how did he get himself into this and how is he going to get out without blowing his cover action..."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"it deals with the very real issue of single motherhood. As a single mom to a teen aged son I got a lot out of this. I actually dated &quot;nice&quot; guys like Will . The attitude surrounding Parenthood also smacks true. Nick Hornbys second novel might be a far reach for some but I highly reccomend it for single Moms &amp; other parental types .... The right sneakers ARE important. My only crticism is that Hornby needs to stretch his perspective on women a bit. I only found one female character realistic &amp; well drawn ...Ellies Mom... This woman is more typical of the woman I know &amp; so I guess I am prejudiced... More Like her!!"},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"About a Boy is a solid if not spectacular third effort from Hornby. While it lacks the urgency of &quot;High Fidelity&quot; and the subtletly of &quot;Fever Pitch,&quot; the story of Marcus is well-written. The other primary character, Will, is a bit of a drip and frequently gives in to the urges that we all have but are too guilt-ridden to act upon. Still, I enjoyed it immensely and anxiously await the &quot;High Fidelity&quot; movie with John Cusack."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Hi Fidelity' was hilarious, 'About a Boy' (about two boys, actually) was funny but also a little tragic and not quite as good. It makes fine reading, though. Mr. Hornby is definitely a gifted writer.

In many ways &quot;High Fidelity&quot; chronicled my own life; connecting with my own passions for music, books, and women. And while I did enjoy &quot;About A Boy&quot; on the merits of the story alone, I didn't relate as well to Will as I did with Rob in &quot;High Fidelity&quot; or Nick, himself, in &quot;Fever Pitch.&quot;At any rate, he's one of my favorites and you'll find me first in line at the bookseller's when his next book arrives."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"A refreshing look at the business of growing up, for a twelve year old, and a thirty something.

About A boy is still filled with touching sensitivity and brightness. Reading this book, one gets a view of the complexity of life through a simple and almost naive perspective, and Nick Hornby's humorous style makes the journey into his character's lives as much fun as the ending. A wonderful book to takeaway on vacation."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"You can read the synopsis of the book elsewhere. I won't waste my time re-telling and condensing the plot because the synopsis doesn't really do the the story justice. Suffice it to say, that this is a hilarious, touching, and just plain sweet story of Marcus,a 12 year old boy, and Will, a 36 year old boy, who find personal growth with each other and for themselves. If you've read High Fidelity, you'll enjoy this. But even if you haven't, you'll enjoy this.

It even made a dead duck seem funny without being in bad taste. It also had a real feeling of London city life. All in all,an entertaining book about a man's(finally) growing up helped in part by his unlikely friendship with an eccentric 12 year old boy."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Hilarious in the way that only English men can be, and very touching.

He never minded being different until he moved to a new school where \\"different\\" is unacceptable and every day proves to be a challenge to his survival. Fiona, Marcus's mother, is different, also. She hasn't a clue what Marcus is being put through, and Marcus isn't sure how to tell her. It seems Fiona is winning all the arguments, too, until Marcus comes up with a nuclear weapon in his argument arsenal - 36-year-old Will. Marcus meets Will through an unlikely string of events (you've got to read the details yourself) and Marcus isn't even sure if he likes Will or not...in the beginning, anyway.Will Freeman is carefree, dislikes kids and commitments, scoffs at the notion of falling in love, and schemes for sex. He's detached himself from anything that could possible present a problem - he believes he's slammed the door on life and as long as he refuses to answer the door, he's safe (I wonder why he answers the door when Marcus comes to call???)... Will doesn't know that there is even a point to life. Which doesn't help when he decides to try and help Fiona believe she has a reason to live.Marcus initially attaches himself to Will in order to build his acrobatic display - you know, like the pyramids that the cheerleaders make. Marcus wants some support, he needs more people in his life. He's afraid his mother will kill herself and then he would be alone. What's the result of Marcus's reaching out to Will? It's like Marcus planted a seed which yields a garden - read the book and watch everything blossom and grow!"},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"When I first read the book description, I didn't think it sounded that interesting. A guy trying to con women? Er...right. But I gave it a shot, mainly because I had heard about the movie with Hugh Grant and wanted to see what it was about. And good thing, too, because I ended up being pleasantly surprised!About a Boy is about Marcus, a twelve-year-old kid, and Will, an adult (the chapters alternate between the two's viewpoints). Marcus is, to put it bluntly and perhaps a bit cruelly, a \\"loser.\\" His two so-called friends ditch him; he is easy prey for bullies; his clothes and hairstyle don't exactly help his cause. Things at home aren't so hot, either--he is being raised by a single mom, who is becoming more and more depressed. Forced to grow up too soon when he stumbles across his mother's suicide attempt early in the book, Marcus' childhood is effectively over. What's a boy to do?Will is the antithesis of Marcus. Cool, hip, and trendy, he actually PRIDES himself on not having perma-attachments and being, so to speak, an \\"island.\\" The very thought of having children (oh, the awful commitment!) repulses him; he is also somewhat of a lady killer, who loves 'em and leaves 'em.About a Boy deals with the gradual intertwining of these two very different lives, as Marcus learns to be a kid and grow into his own, while Will learns that maybe, just maybe, being attached to people and actually caring about somebody other than himself might not be so bad after all. Nick Hornby has a way with dialogue, as can be seen by the offbeat conversations between Marcus and Will. Their loopy, eccentric thoughts (as I said, the chapters alternate between the two's views and so we get an insight and peek into the mind of each) also make for some delightful reading. All in all, I highly recommend this book (and if you have time, watch the movie adaptation, too--in some ways, it's even better)."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"I am a huge fan of the single 20 something books...I picked this one up for a little change and am very happy with it.

I finished the book in a couple days. It was indeed a fast, enjoyable read. BUT, it didn't offer the same kind of humour High Fidelity did, possibly because of it's 3rd person narrative. Either way, I gave it three stars because I expected more laughs. And, in the end, looking back on the novel, I came to the conclusion that nothing really happened. BUT, that's my opinion, and I think if you've read other things by Hornby and enjoyed them, then you should read this simply because. Now I'm off to see it in the theatres!"},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Looking for a good read for an overseas flight, I came upon the recently released on film book, About a boy. Nick Hornby blends the devlisshly dark side of Martin Amis in portraying a likeable cad. Hugh Grant as Will is on the cover of the paperback and he is clearly in your mind's eye as you read the book. He does a wonderful job of conveying the shallow man who becomes engaged by a struggling boy. Starting out as a self-centered, drifting, almost wasted adult, Will comes around if only by accident, to emerge as a caring, thoughtful adult. I wish the book had not eneded where it did; I wanted to know more.Hornby has a great sense of humor. Some of it is selfish, dark and sexist. But he is funny, very funny, in portraying the rescue of a young boy (Marcus) by an older but also much younger Will.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"This book, from the pen of the same author who wrote \\"High Fidelity\\" is a must read \\"male-bonding\\" book that, is at once irreverant and endearing. Hornby, once again writes from the perspective of the \\"jaded\\" yet eventually lovable central figure. I recommend this book to anyone who has ever had self-doubts about relationships, about the opposite sex, about committing yourself to someone else, to a cause greater than yourself. Ultimately, that is what this book is about: the fear that we are so self-centered that we do not need other people to help us thru this life & the realization that we are (thankfully) tied to each other thru our humanity and decency. Hornby shows with razor-sharp humor how ridiculous it is to think we can go through life alone & he makes wonderful, and at times, tearful events which can't help but endear you to his sometimes pathetic central figure. read the book, see the movie afterwards. Either way, drink in this novel of self-searching and personal growth. It spoke to me, I hope it can do thesame to you."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"I truly enjoyed About A Boy. I purchased the book prior to the movie and was glad I did so.Will is a thirty-something in search of some sort of daily activity to use up his daily units of time (1/2 hour = 1 unit). So after bathing, eating and shopping what is Will to do? Date. But who, he does not work, or attend a religous service, he does not have many friends so where is he to meet a women? How about at a Single Parents organization.But as Will tries to find someone to fill his lonliness the reader is also learning about Marcus, the twelve year old mifit. Marcus has a home with problems, a school with problems and really no one to share them with.An unlikely attachment through a step of strange circumstances allows Marcus and Will to meet. Their adventures in learning about life together is what makes the book so enjoyable."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"About a Boy By Nick HornbyIf you've ever wondered what it's like to just be a guy, Hornby is the man you need to read. Light enough to read on the beach, but brilliant enough that your brain won't atrophy. Hornby's hero starts out as nothing but an aging slacker on the make, and inadvertently becomes a good guy. A great gift for guys of all kinds, single mothers, and anyone who wants a romping good read."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Feel free to believe the Nick Hornby hype--well, some of it anyway. High marks for crafting a well-paced, entertaining character study here, despite the absence of any real plot. This is a skilled author who definitely knows what he's doing. I'm certain he had the screenplay in mind on every page, as well as the house in the country the royalties would bring him. Although a cut above American mass market novelists, it might only be the British angle that sets Hornby apart from his colonial counterparts. Luckily the author keeps his characters progressing by continually telling the reader of the exact personality changes taking place. I find it far too challenging to simply observe character development through words and actions.It will definitely help you forget about the uncomfortable seats on your next 2-hour plane ride, but so would a box of Twinkies and a couple beers. You choose your own poison."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"I picked up About a Boy after having read Horby's popular High Fidelity and didn't put it down until I had finished.

This book is fabulous!"},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"I couldn't wait to pass this one on to my book buddies. It's full of wit and plenty of character development - two things I treasure in a good book.What I really enjoy about Hornby's writing is the unexpected details he brings to his characters. For example, his description of Marcus' mother, Fiona, as being a woman who sings songs with her eyes closed, is like a mini-biography. I found this same distinction to his writing in High Fidelity as well, and it really added to the characterizations."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"I went into this book with definite preconceptions--Nick Hornby's previous books (which I hadn't read) have created quite a buzz about him. And while I was quite entertained, as I finished it one question kept creeping into my head: is that all?This is a very nice coming-of-age story, unique in that two characters, 24 years apart in age, are both beginning to get a sense of themselves. An interesting juxtaposition, well-written, likeable characters and plenty of absurd situations, mixed with Hornby's breezy style make this eminently readable, and quite enjoyable.But that's also the problem. I won't dare compare Mr. Hornby with Umberto Eco, but with a buzz like his I'd expect to expend a little more brain power on his books. No go. I felt like I'd just eaten fast food--enjoyable, yes, but not something that will stay with me forever."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"An extremely interesting book, not because of the content itself, but because of the way it is told. Nick Hornby, in his descriptions, uses a great and unusual sense of humour, with a kind of sarcasm that makes the ordinary facts hold the reader's attention during the whole novel's development. The story is about two main characters, Marcus and Will, two different people who get acquainted coincidentally and at the end realise that they have done nothing but helped each other with their major problems. Marcus is a twelve-year-old boy, who lives with his depressed hippie mother in London. They moved from Cambridge, where they lived before, and it terrified him because he would have to go to school and try to deal with his classmates. For any other kid at his age, it would be normal, but Marcus was widely anti-social. Will is thirty-six, but acts like he was twenty-five, he lives alone and doesn't work, gets money from a song that his father has written. His life is simple: shopping, clubbing, women and cars. It doesn't matter if his friends have started a family and he is still single, he likes that kind of life, it's easy and pleasant. His futility makes him act very strangely sometimes, like pretending to have a little son just to take part in a single-parents group, and meet single-mothers. It was at one of the SPAT (Single Parents All Together) meetings that Will met Marcus, and afterwards Marcus started to go round to Will's flat after school, which didn't make him very happy. What would he want with a twelve-year-old weird boy, who didn't even know who Kurt Cobain was? After a while, Will realised that Marcus needed someone to introduce him to the real world, where he would be able to discuss with the boys at school what was going on in the music world and what was the score of the football match the night before. It probably made him feel useful, which was right. After some time Marcus would hate Joni Mitchell and get dressed as a normal 90's kid. There is a lot more in \\"About a Boy\\". Besides these two characters, there are their families, friends and relationships, each one with their particular point, not less interesting, but less important, concerning the novel itself. It's an extraordinary book, weird at the beginning, but after we get used to Nick Hornby's style, it will be almost impossible to put it down."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"About a Boy is smart and bouyant-- relaxed and funny. Excellent reading on many levels. Hornby touches on both primal fear and unremitting joy, genuine curiosity and bold perception. What else could you possibly ask for from a writer?

Hornby includes wit, charm, and you get to know the characters as if they were your neighbors."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Very similar to High Fidelity, ABOUT A BOY manages to take the insightfulness of the first novel and fuse it with a more Seinfeldian plot-line. The result is not quite as satisfying, but well worth purchasing."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"About a Boy was extremely anticipated after reading Hornby's first novel, High Fidelity. I had picked up High Fidelity on a hunch an was amazed. Never before had I identified myself so much with a literary character. This book made me think, laugh, and even cry a little. I was amazed at Hornby's ability to absolutely nail the male psyche in such a clear manner. High Fidelity actually helped me come to terms with some of my &quot;issues.&quot; With that in mind, I rushed to the store to purchase &quot;About a Boy&quot;. What I discovered left me sadly disappointed. Where was the wit, and insight that fueled me through High Fidelity? Although this book was clearly written, it failed to inspire thought or concern. The plot didn't flow and try as I might, I absolutely didn't care about any of the characters. They wear dull, lifeless, and uninspiring. What happened Hornby? Please, please try again.

I didn't expect to like it to such an extent, coz it is about a boy, well, actually \\"two\\" boys (including one Peter Pan) and I didn't think I would relate to it as I did with BJ Diary. But Nick Hornby's writing style turns out to be one of my fav styles: seemingly light and even flippant yet conveying a much heavier message, satiric yet tender, comic yet true to the bone in terms of depicting the characters. How could anyone not love Marcus? Will is, as the other male protagonists in NH's novels, a flawed hero. It is never intended and will never be a larger than life hero, and it is not even a better than average human being if you measure him with the usual moral standards. However, such a character is more endearing than the \\"heroes\\", and touches people's heart to a greater degree, when it strives for the better. I am sure people can find more or less a reflection in themselves or people around them. To be honest, I at first thought that Will's lifestyle is the one I eventually want: having enough money to do nothing and can do whatever I want in the world. However, as I read the story, I realized that it is not that easy as it sounds. As Rachel tells Will: \\"About how you have to be fairly tough in your head to do what you do... most of us think that the point is something to do with work, or kids, or family, or whatever. But you don't have any of that. There's nothing between you and despair, and you don't seem a very desperate person...The point is you keep going. You want to. So all the things that make you want to are the point... but on the quiet you don't think life's too bad.\\" People need a point to go on living, and most of us define ourselves with objects, or things around us, such as work, family, friends or lovers, or even abstract things like ambition, aspirations, dreams, etc. However, for someone like Will to live happily (or at least not painfully), he has to love life itself, instead of the things that attach us to life. However, even Will finds out, eventually, that life is not just another NYPD Blue to look forward to, or another Nirvana record to expect, but about actually living, and caring, and being attached to people and things around them. So this is a paradox: you can live relatively well without the \\"attachments\\", and yet, you need these attachments to actually \\"live\\", because eventually you will find out that music and Telly is not enough, and you need these attachments to define yourself, to a certain degree. So \\"to do whatever I want in the world\\" will still involve something, some intellectual, physical or emotional output, and this output engages you to life. It is not enough to be a mere audience to life. To live is to participate.I have watched the movie version (starring Hugh Grant) and I must say I prefer the ending of the movie. The ending of the movie creates a real climax, the point where audience may cry, and feel happy that things end this way. I don't know if this is the hollywoodization of a British story (but it is directed by British directors), but I actually prefer this ending to the relatively bland (but probably more realistic) one of the book. Will is a man that goes with the trend, not against it or away from it. He wants to blend in, and actually blends in, most of time anyway. He teaches Marcus to be invisible so that he won't be singled out by the kids at school. Therefore, it is no small feat for him to go up the stage and literally \\"rescue\\" Marcus from lifelong \\"psychological trauma\\" (well, maybe just embarrassment). I know that I genuinely love this character at that point. In the book, on the other hand, he is pushed by Rachel to talk to Fiona, and pushed all the way to realization by external events. It might be more believable, but it is much more touching in the movie, and it gives people a sense of completion, and a starting point of another journey on a new level."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"The book is about two boys named Will(36) who is an unemployed, unmarried, prosperous, in-London-living insider and Marcus(12) an a bit mad uncool outsieder who lives with his weird mum who earns not too much money and is dangered by thougts of committing suicide.

A good example of flawed characters that are still likable and funny. This book compelled me to read others of his. I liked them all but this was my favorite. I loved the movie as well. Different than the book but still a good story."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"High Fidelity is one of my favorite novels of all times and it's hard to open a Hornby novel and not hope for something great. I think the best advice for a reader of this novel is to forget that High Fidelity exists and appreciate this novel in its own right. About a Boy is a wonderful story about two people and their rather unique friendship. Will Lightman is a thirty-six-year-old man whose passions don't go beyond getting the latest gadgets, his CD collection, and having noncommittal sex with single mothers. But when he stumbles upon eleven-year-old Marcus, his life isn't the same. Marcus has a difficult time fitting in school and is terrified of losing his depressed mother to suicide. The strange bond he develops with Will is refreshing, and an unlikely friendship ensues between them. There are some amusing moments throughout the novel.One of the most interesting things about the novel is how effectively Hornby navigates the inner workings of Marcus's rationalizations, how he is able to see Will in a light that even Will himself does not see. Their bond has a \\"boys will be boys\\" feel to it in that Will's reluctance to commit to anything or anyone has a lot to do with his unwillingness to grow up. The novel is very funny. I loved the scenes of Will trying to get a woman at SPAT meetings (Single Parents Alone Together). Marcus's point of view is more poignant. I loved this offering from Hornby. I had started reading this a few years ago and never finished it until now. I have not seen the movie, but I've been told that it is quite good. I know Hugh Grant plays Will in the movie, which cheated me out of imagining the aforementioned character in my mind. Anyway, I recommend About a Boy. I expected a great Hornby read and was not disappointed."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"I really liked HIGH FIDELITY. Hornby's characters are endearingly flawed. They'll go to believable extremes, sometimes devious but usually relatable. And I liked the premise this book starts off with. But it dipped into sappiness and drug on a little too long for me. Still, I like Hornby's writing a lot so I give it some props for that."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Nick HornbyAbout a boyLondon: Penguin Books, 1998&amp;#8356; 6, 990 141 00733 8\\"...if Will can teach Marcus how to be a kid,Marcus can help Will grow up...\\"The title of the novel by Nick Hornby might make the reader think, that the story is about a little boy, but indeed the reader learns about two of them - Marcus, behaving very strangely and seriously at the age of twelve, and Will, who acts very chaotically and immaturely, although he is a man of 36 years.It turns into a very crazy situation when both meet, but after a while the two come to see, that their acquaintance is very useful as well as for Will as for Marcus. While Will suddenly feels responsible for Marcus\` life as a teenager and learns what it means to feel real love for a woman, Marcus learns how to behave and to look like a boy at his age how to argue with his alternative mum without always losing arguments.It is a pretty interesting and funny plot in the novel \\"About a boy\\". Furthermore with Will and Marcus Hornby created two sometimes very unnerving but also fascinating and lovely characters. Reading the book the reader even might learn to love them: Will\`s clumsy and sometimes insensitive behaviour as Marcus hard-headed way to speak out what he thinks.On the whole Nick Hornby did a really brilliant job and wrote a novel with a plot which hasn't been there before. It is Hornby's ironic and sometimes sarcastic style he often practises in his novel - as for example in \\"How to be good\\" - that makes his books so special. The reader might find himself in a situation in which he doesn't know whether to laugh, whether to cry or whether to do both.To give my own personal impressions of the novel I can say I liked it very much, indeed I liked even best compared to all the other books I had to read for English lessons. I like Hornby's humorous style of writing novels and I'm glad that I read the book before watching the film. Now I'm very interested in the movie with Hugh Grant and hope, he will make Will's character into what I always imagined him to be.By Julia Kersten and Sarah Die&szlig;ner"},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"Another hysterical, fresh perspective from one of my favorite authors. I definitely suggest reading this before you see the movie...and I definitely suggest reading it."},{"Title":"About a Boy","review":"My wife is not as much of a reader as I am. So when I found her cutting out her sleep and TV time to devour Nick Hornsby's ABOUT A BOY, I thought I should take a look.I was pleasantly surprised to find a clever, tightly written story about Will Freeman, a 36-year old adolescent who has discovered the pleasures of dating single mothers, and Marcus, a socially awkward 12-year old boy of a depressed hippy. Fabricating a fictional child, Will meets Marcus at a picnic for a support group for single parents. Upon taking Marcus home with another single mother, Will and Marcus find Marcus's mother, Fiona, passed out from a suicide attempt.This incident launches Marcus on attempt to expand his social circle to insulate himself from tragic events. So Marcus inserts himself into Will Freeman's life. Marcus soon discovers that Will Freeman, a jobless man obsessed with coolness and style and supported by the royalties of his late father's Christmas song, is the perfect guide to usher Marcus into the social world of adolescents.Chapter by chapter, Hornsby alternates viewpoints between Marcus and Will, mirroring their parallel journeys: Marcus, the outcast, social incompent's journey from childhood to adolesence, and Will, whose own journey from adolescence to adulthood stalled out some time ago. The catalyst breaking both Marcus]s and Will's inertia is, of course, love.ABOUT A BOY paints vivid portraits of its two main characters. Both Will and Marcus are written quite authentically. (I was reminded quite vividly of Judith Rich Harris's book, THE NURTURE ASSUMPTION when reading about Marcus's desire to be accepted by his peers and Will's understanding that to be accepted is to be similar to your peers.) The interaction between these two characters is poignantly detailed.Unfortunately, the book begins to lose steam when the love interests, Rachel for Will and Ellie for Marcus, are introduced. Though the plot point seems necessary to move the book along, Hornsby doesn't provide the same level of detail or motivation for Rachel or Ellie, and, as a result, the book slows down.This doesn't keep the book from being a good read or from provoking good thoughts. One of the most interesting thoughts that Hornsby brings up is the idea of \\"The Point\\" (as in \\"What's the point of it all?\\") When Will plans to confront Marcus's mother about the possibiltiy of another attempt at suicide, he worries that \\"the Point\\" will come up, and Will doesn't have a good idea and what &quot;the Point&quot; is. In detailing the daily workings Will's life, Hornsby examines the existential angst and boredom that comes by default to most modern human beings, and when Will finds no one point, but rather, a multitude of daily small points (a daily quiz show, the daily crossword puzzle, and, most importantly, meaningful relationships with other people.), Hornsby proposes a way of coping with the lack of some overarching purpose to human existence that I could relate to.Sometimes, looking forward to finishing a good book is all you need to get through a tough day.Dav's Rating System:5 stars - Loved it, and kept it on my bookshelf.4 stars - Liked it, and gave it to a friend.3 stars - OK, finished it and gave it to the library.2 stars - Not good, finished it, but felt guilty and/or cheated by it.1 star - I want my hour back!

I must agree with another reviewer who stated that the character of Marcus seemed remarkably placid and content considering that he had such hopeless parents, both of whom appeared incrediably self absorbed and self-centered. Marcus finds what he is lacking in parental direction in Will, an unlikely candidate considering he is a 36 year old man who appears quite content in a life with no career, no real interests (except finding women ), and no real thoughts for his future. The two form an odd but mutually beneficial friendship, that brings them both closer to maturity and what it takes to really be a man.

(Even with the undercurrents of divorce and suicide inhabiting the book). A novel does not have to be filled with some heavy duty message in order for me to enjoy it, I suppose what it is about the book that reads funny, is the scary subjects within it, they feel out of place next to Hornby's witty tone.

In my opinion, &quot;About A Boy&quot; is a very good reading,because it is exciting, interesting and very approach to life,which means it is rather realistically written.Especially the development of the two main characters is an important aspect of the book and very interesting.

Robb mixed in the right amount of futuristic gadgetry, plot twist and sensual sauce to ensure her murder mystery held the reader's attention from beginning to end. This was my first read by J.D. Robb (Pen Name) and I'm already selecting my next title."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Had the pleasure of meeting this writer a long time ago...What A Rush!All of J.D. Robb's books are works of art...pure pleasure to read!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I'm a big audiobook fan.So many people told me that the J.D. Robb's series in death was \\"so good\\", I really should give it a try.So without warning I plunged right in...I liked the futuristic police mystery of the story - thus the 2 stars.HOWEVER...every other word seemed to be a variation of the Lord's name in vain...It grated on my spine.And it wasn't just occasionally, it was peppered throughout the whole book.I don't talk like that.And I don't have friends that talk like that.If this bothers you, you will not like the series.If this does not bother you, I'm just giving my opinion and you may like the series.And the sex scenes...whatever...I can fast forward through those. But I wonder if the people who really like this series, like it because of that.I prefer a good mystery, suspense, thriller.I appreciate Thomas Perry and Lee Child for providing a good series with action and suspense with no profanityI understand that the Lord's name in vain and other profanity does not offend everyone...I've read other reviews where they want to argue about it...If it doesn't bother you, fine.It is just a warning for those of you who do not want to hear it."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"All in all I liked the storyline and 2 main characters. I am not sure I like the futuristic part nor I like the constant cursing and insuations that Conservatives are bad. If all of her books in this series are going to be tilted against Conservatives then forget it! Stick to mystery, suspense thriller with a little romance mixed in. I might check out book #2 and if there is still all the crudeness and political tilting then I will pass from now on."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I hardly read contemporary, a co-worker of mine gave me the whole collection. I liked it so much that I am glad I don't have to pay for them. But Naked in Death is greatly recommended."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"With so much going for it, I wanted to believe this book was better then it was. The writing is competent, the characterizations sharp, the future world rang true and the mystery was involved. Yet, after the first couple of chapters, I had to force myself to turn the pages. This is a gritty &quot;real-life&quot; kind of mystery with lots of gorey descriptions and profanity. The romance is very background to the story and has almost no development. The characters actually only meet a handful of times during the story and most of their time together involves sex. The mystery wansn't bad, but I found it hard to get past the unbelievableness of Roarke as a suspect. I mean this guy is the richest man in the Universe which should have made him untouchable, plus he has no real connection to the murders. To make matters worse, we find out at the very beginning of the book that he is not the murder, so the edge that should have been their is missing and our brillant heroine comes off as a giant dope for suspecting him. I guess, I was expecting more tension, with all kinds of subtle clues being dropped that it is him, while the heorine is torn by her attraction to him and her fear that she will be his next victim. Hey that sounds like a good plot, maybe I'll go write it. This is a good book to pick up from the local book trader."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Robb kicks this book off with a bang, and finishes with a flourish. If you are looking for a great mystery, detective thriller, or even a surprising romance, look no further. You will find all of that an more in the story of Eve, a police dectective, who is asked to solve the mystery surrounding the deaths of professional companions (or prostitutes). The book is set in the future, but you will not be distracted by a lot of descriptive prose that adds nothing to the story. Instead, the plot moves steadily forward, uncovering details and suspects along the way.I found Eve's character very believable. She is a hard worker and is devoted to solving her case. She doesn't let her personal feelings get in the way, usually, which is why she is so suprised when she begins to fall for one of the primary suspects. Her conflict is very real and adds a lot of suspense to the storyline. As the plot and characters unfold, you will begin to draw your own conclusions as to who the real murderer is, but you will need to wait until the very end for he or she to be revealed.Not a long or tedious book. Easy to read and a lot of fun. You will want to have the next one ready to go when you finish. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I first picked up a J.D. Robb book because I was bored and it looked interesting. Within the month I owned the entire series, and both my mother and I were eagerly waiting for the newest title. The characters are interesting, the stories are full of twists and turns, yet believable (for example, there are no surprise characters that pop up in the last chapter to become the killer) and the books are refreshingly different from other series and even from each other. Ms. Robb writes a different type of story in each book, which is great for avid mystery fans."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"In New York there's a lieutenant name Eve Dallas that's unique in her line of work with years of experience and she's paired up with a former partner name Feeney.

The discover of who, what, when and how it happen shocks her off her feet and lands her a billionaire."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I've known about this series for quite a while, and I'm a big Nora Roberts fan, but I hadn't really wanted to pick this series up. There's about a billion books out in the series. What if I ended up loving it? Then I have to commit myself to buying those billion books just to catch up! But after hearing such glowing things about this series from most of my Goodreads friends--especially about Roarke--I had to finally bight the bullet and get the first book.Now that I've finished it I don't know whether to cheer or comfort my wallet. I think I'm going to have to run to the bookstore and swoop up a bunch of the next books in the series so I can get my glom on.I didn't connect with Roarke the way that most readers seem to, but I expect it comes with time. The relationship and attraction in this book develops pretty quickly--faster than I expected or wanted--but I can't say I expected any different seeing as this isn't actually a Romance series. Most of the focus was on the case with the romance as the side story. Luckily, I know there's plenty of time in this series for the author to develop their relationship.It's no hardship for me to watch their relationship develop over the course of the books since I know that they are together and the author didn't throw any retarded love triangles in there. So I'm willing to be patient and won't complain about the lack of a lot of depth to the relationship and characters yet.It was odd for me to read a book so similar, yet different, from Nora Roberts's usual style. The characterization, interactions, feel to the developing relationship, and writing felt the same, but the focus wasn't on the romance. I liked it. It's nice to find a new series by this author that I can glut myself on. I was a little nervous that her style would be completely different under the pseudonym, but it wasn't where it counted.The details about all the little futuristic gizmos weren't really explained in depth. Everything was mentioned matter-of-factly like talking to someone already familiar with the technology and world. I think some will dislike that, but I honestly preferred it. I don't mind if authors want to explain, but a detailed explanation about how the spray that seals in oils and fingerprints works is not something I personally need to know. The way it was all presented worked for me.The case (and Eve's background) really tugged at my heartstrings. I thought it was handled well by the author, but I still feel helplessly enraged to know stuff like that happens constantly.I really enjoyed seeing our timeframe discussed and researched for the case. It was fun to see the differences between that time and this one and it provided a nice opportunity for me to see where their culture differed without huge infodumps.Now to go get my hands on Glory in Death..."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I see that a lot of readers have fallen head over heels for this book, which is a part of my reason for writing.While this book is a fine way of spending a few hours of your time if you have nothing better to do, I was desperately hoping for more depth to the characters. The story is ok and I like the idea behind this series, but I end up feeling somewhat cheated as there are so much potential in this book that has not been explored.At the moment this leaves me with the question whether I should go for one more or just let the series rest."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"this book started off slow, but as I got past the middle of the book I started getting into it a lot more.

The characters were stereotypical and the plot predictable, but then again I wasn't looking for a challenging read. The one thing I don't understand is why the book is set in a 'science fiction' future that isn't really that much of science fiction? There was not any new technology introduced to solve the case, really, and the science fiction part felt gimmicky, as if the author isn't aware of what the genre really should offer. Instead of contributing to the plot, characters or storytelling, the clumsy attempts to incorporate the science fiction distracted from the writing."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I have read a few of the death books out of order and am now trying to read them in order.

It's a great read. very suspenseful and easy to follow along.

My first In Death book was given to me in 2011 and started in the middle of the series. I was intrigued enough in the how and why of Dallas and Roarke's meeting to go back and start at the beginning. And because with all of the interaction between so many of the main characters it's fun to find out how the relationships began and why they continue to evolve. I've already picked up the next several books in the series and am certain I will find them as enjoyable as the first. Great job of writing J. D.

The In Death series has been great and I haven't been disappointed yet. I love the characters. Eve and Roarke are great together."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I'm starting to read th J.D.Robb series and they are wonderful. Finally a series that lets you grow with the characters. Sometimes when you finish a book you ask your self I wonder what they are doing now? Eve and Roarke are such an special couple, Eve working through the emotional mine field of marriage and a loving relationship with her demanding career Roarke being supportive and loving her just the way she is. Though J.D Robbs has made Roarke a man of means through the books that the greatest wealth Eve receives from him is the emotional and loving understanding he gives her. The other charaters i.e like Peabody ,Maris just adds the story lines that you can't wait for the next book to come along and see how they are doing and hope that Eve finally gets over her nightmares of her childhood. I have always enjoyed Nora Roberts Books and as J.D Robbs she is now on my list of books that are to keep and to read over and over again. If you in to a romance with a good who done it this is the author for you. I promise if you read one of these books you'll look around for the next one!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Naked in Death is a fun, sexy and thrilling beginning to a great series that combines the romance, witty dialogue, strong characters, and neo-futuristic whodunit into one book.

I love mystery novels but there are always parts of them I get bored with; to technical or repetitive. But, this series is not only attention-getting it keeps it till the last page.

Its a buy you won't regreat."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Nora Roberts has done it again, this futuristic series is so fun! All you huge Nora Roberts fans out there, JD Robb is just as good! Would recommend reading the series in order, as it helps you to understand the characters better, but not necessary. There's an introduction that gives you some background on the book before it! Great buy!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I've read many of Nora Roberts other books but had never gotten around to starting the &quot;in Death&quot; series. As soon as I picked it up I was hooked. I love the switch on focus from romance to mystery. Besides the great story line the details of how the future has a lot of the same problems we have today were great. The point where Eve Dallas' Autochef burnt her toast was a high point for me. I really enjoyed the chracter of Eve Dallas because it's not often you read of female cops and her constant professional attitude was great. Would recomend this series to any Nora Roberts fans."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Why I Read this Book: The In Death series is the #1 series that gets recommended to me the most. I had not read anything by Nora Roberts so I wasn't exactly sure what to expect. But all this talk about the infamous Roarke and his relationship with Eve got me curious. Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy Naked in Death as much as I had hoped.What I Liked: The futuristic elements were interesting. The book is set in 2058 (the book was first written in 1995 so it was originally a 60+ years look into the future). Most people drink fake coffee since the real stuff is hard to come by and is quite expensive. Same goes with flowers. Guns are outlawed and prostitution is legal.I love crime solving reads and TV shows and I enjoyed it in Naked in Death. I don't know what it is about forensics but it fascinates me. The suspect in this book wasn't the obvious choice and I liked that it wasn't predictable; it was a bit complex of a case. There was a personal, yet sad, connection for Eve with this case. It made sense why she was so affected by this particular case.What I Didn't Like: I wasn't buying the Eve/Roarke relationship. It was a big disappointment for me. Roarke came on really strong and Eve was so resistant. I wasn't feeling the connection or the attraction, especially from Eve's POV. The relationship felt extremely one sided. Roarke seems to be more of a guy with connections than a lover. And Roarke was a little too carefree about things. Hopefully in the next book I'll feel more of a connection between them. I don't know how it going to work out for Eve and Roarke. Actually, I know the end result because I inadvertently saw a spoiler when I was reading about the author on Wikipedia but I don't know how it gets to that point.I wasn't expecting such a dark read with grim subject matter. Naked in Death for those with a weak stomach. There was rape, child abuse, and incest. *shivers*Overall Impression: With all the recommendations I got for this series, I had set the bar kind of high and unfortunately Naked in Death didn't quite meet my expectations. Now don't get me wrong, I liked the book. I enjoyed reading it. But I didn't LOVE it. I know I'm in the minority by saying that; this seems to be a favorite series among readers. I had heard about the infamous and sexy Roarke but I just didn't see it. I'm still undecided in regards to this series. I'll give it one, maybe 2 more books, before deciding to continue on or throw in the towel. I have to admit that I find long series, especially one 30+ books deep, a bit daunting."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"So, I finally broke down and read the first \\"In Death\\" book by Nora Roberts. Seems like every romance site on the web just LOVES these books (and Nora Roberts in general) so I thought I'd give it a try when I saw a used copy at my local (and FABULOUS) bookstore. Especially since I'm now committed to the Summer of SFR.I'd tried one Nora Roberts book before (Carnal Innocence) and I watched 3 out of the 4 TV movies that were adaptations of her work last year on Lifetime. And I must say I have noticed a pervasive trend towards incest and rape in her work. Really graphic, really horrifying. More often than not, it's more than I would want to sign up for. I knew the In Death books continued this theme (like a LOT), but I figured if I totally loved the characters I might want to put up with it.So, what was my final verdict you ask? Well, Naked in Death was actually pretty good. I enjoyed it more than Carnal Innocence for sure.Fair warning: the In Death books are so famous and have been out for so long, that I'm not really worrying about spoilers as far as the romantic relationship goes.Naked in Death is the first in the massive In Death series starring Eve Dallas and her (eventual) husband Roarke (you know, like Madonna). Eve is a police lieutenant with a dark and mysterious past, and an almost religious devotion to serving the Law. The series is set in a near-future world where prostitutes are legal, real coffee is extremely rare, and all firearms have been banned.So, when a dead prostitute is found brutally gunned down in her own apartment, Eve goes looking for a man rich enough to own such an expensive and prized antique as a handgun-- and ruthless enough to use it on an unarmed naked woman. Someone like the multi-millionaire Roarke. As Eve pursues leads in the case, she finds herself drawn against all her good sense to the searingly handsome and preternaturally charming Roarke-- even though he's still a suspect.I liked the hero, Rourke, a lot. He had great banter with Eve. He really is a prototypical, Alpha-male sex-bomb. I loved that he keeps Eve's button as a souvenir. That was adorable, and it was a lovely character touch when he sent Eve coffee instead of flowers. I totally wouldn't mind a tumble on that big floating bed of his.He makes for a VERY attractive and charming hero. He's obviously one of the reasons this series is so popular.Oddly enough, his all-around awesomeness was actually a bit of a problem for me at times. It was one of those cases where he was so rich, so handsome (almost ridiculously so in both cases), he could have any woman he wanted, so why was he with the police detective who's not that pretty and kept pushing him away?I guess I'm not a fan of the 'She's the only woman who's ever said no to him, which makes him fall for her' trope. That wasn't exactly the case here, but it was close enough to bother me a little. It just felt like they were Roarke's feelings for Eve moved at warp-speed, and I didn't necessarily see the justification for that in their interactions.Also, there was a bit too much police procedural for me at times, which made the plot lag. The humor was great, though. Really funny at parts. I did like the banter between Rourke and the heroine, Eve, and the secondary characters were fairly well-drawn and interesting-- especially Eve's boss and her partner. The writing itself was really smooth too.One aspect of the book that really shone for me was the near future world-building. It was excellent, subtle, with some clever touches like the handgun ban and the value of real coffee. I also thought the logistics of widespread legalized prostitution were well-thought out and convincing. I also liked how the concept of space stations and space travel was so subtly alluded to, it was as commonplace as the coffee.I knew going into this that it would be a fairly violent book and, as expected, there was lots of the disturbing stuff here. Incest. LOTS of rape. Children being killed horribly. And I know from reviews the rest of the series has more of the same. So, ultimately, although this book really was very good, I don't think I want to sign up for thirty more books of that.Overall, Naked in Death is a really solid book. Great characters, engaging plot, well-written with great world-building. I can totally see why Nora Roberts sells so many books. And yet, unfortunately, the violence is such I just can't see myself becoming a big fan of hers or reading any of the other In Death books (or even re-reading NID).But, if you think you can handle the levels of violence and gore in this series I do highly recommend it for the writing and the characters.Grade: B+"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"After reading the glowing reviews for this book, I was eager to read it. Unfortunately, from the beginning I realized that it was not, for me, going to live up to the hype at all. I kept thinking something drastic would happen to make it worthy of its 4.5 star rating, but it never did.I found the \\"cop with the tough exterior and painful past, who just needs someone to break through her shell\\" to be very cliche.I felt that it was incredibly cheesy in parts and on more than one occassion, I found myself rolling my eyes and saying \\"oh, please.\\"Not only that, but I found some glaring typos. Bad editor!Lastly, the sometimes graphic pedophilia and incest, added for shock value, did not make the book better. It works great for a writer like Stephen King, but not as well for Robb.I give it three stars because it did sort of keep my interest, but I still found it mediocre. Sorry!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"\\"Naked in death\\" is the 1st book in J.D.Robb's \\"In death series\\". The action takes place in N. York (USA), in the year 2058. Obviously, many things are different (more technology, some weapons are outlawed, prostitution is legal), but others are not. One of the things that doesn't change is that even in the future there are murderers, and policemen to take them to jail.Our main character is Lt. Eve Dallas, a homicide detective in Manhattan very good at her job of \\"standing for the dead\\", and who dedicates herself totally to her job in order to avoid her past. She is also averse to having a meaningful relationship with anybody, because she doesn't want to be vulnerable again.However, one of her criminal investigations (the gruesome murder of a licenced companion, who happens to be related to a very powerful senator) leads her to a suspect that she cannot help but being attracted to. That is Roarke, a stunningly handsome billionaire with a shady past, who is the main suspect in her criminal case. The victim knew him, was murdered in one of his buildings, with a weapon he could have had access to (he has a collection of antique guns). She tries to maintain objectivity, but Roarke won't allow her to do that, as he is also incredibly attracted to this stubborn detective with one weakness: real coffe.What will happen? Will Eve be able to stop the murderer, who has promised to kill 5 more licenced companions? And is Roarke innocent? The answers to this and a lot more can be found in this book. I'm rather sure you will love it, because it has both mystery and romance, an intelligent plot and characters you end up delighting in.

The series is about a police officer named Eve Dallas. She is a homicide detective, she takes her work very seriously. She has a tragic past.This book concerns a case of three women who were murdered and Eve's work to find the killer and bring them to justice. As in every good mystery there are twists, turns and surprises along the way. She is romanced during this investigation by 'Roarke' a mysterious wealthy man who may or may not have something to do with her case.I was engrossed with this book while reading it.

The futuristic style throws you off at first but once you let your imagination go with the story it is very realistic as to how the future could be. Romance and suspense, these books have it all. Learning of Eve's childhood and her secrets pull you in even farther. Remember to read the books in order, I love the story never ends like most books. Book one is a must as it introduces future characters."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Read from March 02 to 06, 2012Read for FunChallenges: Audiobook, Read for Fun, Mystery/SuspenseOverall Rating: 4.00Story Rating: 4.25Character Rating: 3.75Audio Rating: 4.50 (Not part of the overall Rating)First Thought When Finished: I really enjoyed the mystery part of this book!What I Loved: I really loved Eve's detective skills and problem solving ability. She is such a fantastic detective and her partner Fenney (don't know about the spelling) brings a lot to the table also. I really enjoyed watching them figuring out this case step by step. There were tons of moments where the action played out in my head. I know exactly who I would have playing Eve if it was a movie or TV Series!What I Liked: I liked that Eve had a back story that made her a better detective and made her a bit fragile. It was refreshing to see that she had faults, a quick to pull trigger with her anger, but was very solid!What made me go huh?: I am not buying Eve's and Roarke's relationship right now. It just seemed forced and all the sudden. Plus, it just didn't fit with how careful Eve seems to be. Though I am sure over the series it will work out.Audio Review: I thought Susan Ericksen did a FANTASTIC job. She was very good at bringing edginess to Eve and sexiness to Roarke! I really had fun listening to her read the book.Final Thought: I am glad that I was \\"pushed\\" into reading this series. Thank you my friends for telling me to read it!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Naked In Death By J. D. RobbEve Dallas has to find out who the murderer is and tosolve the problem of the missing items. Many murders that areprobably connected. The romance is hot and very steamy.Very gory and violent content-more than what I normallyread but the story line is very good and exciting and verydescriptive. Love the computer technology conversations, reallyin depth hacking."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Just finished reading Naked in Death and now that I have, I'm not sure why I waited so long to start this series. I won't recap the plot etc., as I'm reviewer #199, but the characters of Eve and Roarke are well fleshed out in the introductory book and you can tell that there is a lot of room for character development and growth.The book takes place about fifty or sixty years in the future, but Robb does not go overboard with the science fiction aspects. The futuristic aspects are so well integrated into the story that you accept them easily without the jar of strangeness that sometimes permeates books that try to seem sci-fi or paranormal and are not well written.If you've been curious about the In Death series, I'd start right here at the beginning."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I've seen these books in the stores and had no idea what they were about. I've read some Nora Roberts, but i didn't follow her. I think that will change now under J.D. Robb. Eve is cool, and i've read characters like her but i see that this book was first published in 1995 when i was 7 or 8. I didn't realize right away that the story takes place in the mid 21st century. And how cool it is i can see a great imagination from the author. Weird that prostitution is legal lol. There are disturbing elements with the characters especially Eve when she has that nightmare near the end sad. And finding the real killer in the end. Roakre is sexy and mysterious, but filthy rich. I guess rich guys with the somewhat poor girl like Eve are interesting. I got alot of catching up to do i can't believe how many books are in this series."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I have to admit that I wasn't really all that interested in reading these books... until I had read some recent reviews of several titles in the series. When I happened to see the omnibus edition of the first two In Death books I figured, why not give them a shot?Somehow, in reading those reviews I didn't realize these books were set in the future, which gives them an interesting twist. Actually, at times I wished that there was more emphasis on the fact that these books are set in the future--Robb could have supplied more detail in that respect. The story is certainly not for the faint of heart, and I should have realized that there would be more than enough sex, as well, given who we're dealing with (Robb a.k.a Nora Roberts). I skimmed over that and dealt with the foul language--I suppose it made sense for the story, regardless of whether or not I actually liked it. The storyline was interesting, if a bit predictable. But at the same time there were enough twists that I didn't have it totally figured out by the end. Robb does a pretty good job with the characters--Eve and Roarke are fairly well-developed (Eve more so than Roarke), and the antagonistic characters are definitely not likable in the slightest.I plan to read the next book, Glory In Death, sometime soon, though I don't know that I'll continue the series beyond those two books. My reading tastes don't really include a lot of sex and foul language. All the same, Robb writes a good, suspenseful mystery and I could appreciate the story for that in itself."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Honestly, I was really surprised that I liked this book so much. So much so, that I went to the library as soon as I was done with the book to search for the next one. I've never read any of Nora Robert's books and wrongly assumed that I wouldn't like her books because she is a well known mainstream romance author. I enjoyed the gritty feel of the novel and the slow, burn of the romance between Eve and Roarke. The plot didn't feel contrived at all. The only thing I'd say is that the futuristic feel of the book is just not that strong - not that it's really a bad thing. I guess I'm just use to reading more paranormal/urban fantasy books where things are so different than the real world.I love Eve and Roarke's characters. While many authors write stories with a strong female character, the strength often crumbles at the drop of a difficult situation. This is not so with Eve. She was consistent in her actions and thoughts. Roarke was a great balance of the strong, powerful, alpha male that was also sensitive and vulnerable. A slow build up to the romance is what I prefer and exactly what I got.It's exciting to see that there are so many books in this series and that the ratings have been consistently high because I suspect these books will keep me interested and entertained for a long time to come."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I am pleased to have a new, good detective series to read. This one kept me up until 3:00 am and even then I forced myself to put it down. The futuristic picture of New York is interesting, and the murder mystery is well constructed. Eve is another emotionally damaged but lovable detective as is Harry Bosch in Michael Connelly's books. Keep these coming!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"As a long time Nora Roberts fan, I was eager to start on this series written under the pseudonym J.D Robb. Fortunately I was not disappointed.The Plot:Eve Dallas in a Lieutenant of the New York Police Department in the year 2058. She is currently investigating the brutal murder of a prostitute. On her long list of suspects is Roarke, a multi-billionaire charmer. As Eve finds herself emotionally involved with Roarke, even to the point of trusting him, the pressure is on for her to find the real killer.What Makes It a Five Star Read:The suspense and mystery are unquestionably entertaining. The romance is hot and sweet. The balance between the two is flawless, a tribute to Robb's impeccable writing style. The tone of the whole book makes it flow easily and quickly.To me the series looks very promising. I would recommend this book to fans of mystery, suspense, and romance."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"You won't be disappointed in starting this \\"...in Death\\" series with this first book \\"Naked in Death\\" by JD Robb (Nora Roberts). I have had listened to the whole series in audio books format, and I'm delighted that all installments are read by the same narrative, Susan Erickson. Robb puts strength in her lead character, Lt. Eve Dallas. I have turned many friends on to this series. It's fun, captivating, romantic, suspenseful, and thoroughly entertaining. Robb/Roberts' strength in writing is only enhanced by Erickson voice. Susan's voice inflections and her voice differentiation of characters, the Irish in Roarke's voice are truly captivating and makes for great listening! Kudos to a job well done!! A dynamite combination!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"If you love mysteries with a big dose of steamy romance on the side, buy this book. This is the first of many \\"InDeath\\" books, all of them starring Lieutenant Eve Dallas of NYPSD, circa 2058. InDeath fans are legion and global; there are websites devoted to discussing the books and the characters. There are short fan-produced videos on YouTube, most of them junk but a handful of surprisingly good quality and content. Character \\"Kate Beckett\\" of tv show \\"Castle\\" was very obviously modeled on Eve Dallas, at least for the first season (Rank, expertise & dedication to the job, physical appearance and coffee addiction are straight out of InDeath). Start with this book, and if you like it, read the rest of them in sequence by publication date. While each book stands on its own, you'll get caught up in the continuing saga of various recurring characters, most especially the leading man in the series. Oh, and if you didn't already know - J.D. Robb is Nora Roberts. If you like Nora, you'll love InDeath books.

As someone who hasn't really read any futuristic/sci-fi books, I didn't quite know what to expect.After reading the first couple of chapters I was hooked, and the futuristic tones of the books just seemed to flow with the book, and did not become a distraction at all. I actually found the new technology parts very intriguing.This is an excellent first book in the series that had me rapidly turning the pages to find out what would happen next. I can't wait to continue this series. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"An avid Nora Roberts fan, I decided to read an ebook version of Creation in Death and loved the characters. So I purchased this book to start from the top. What a read! I love the characters, the gritty writing and the futuristic view of the city. Hard to put down, and hating it to be over, it just cemented that I have a lot more reading to do! So many books, so little time!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Nora Roberts has done it again, weaving a fantastic story, with endearing characters.This is one of two series that I consistently re-read because there will never be another series quite like this one.Roberts creates a world 50 years in the future. One futuristic enough for those who like to travel forward, but still grounded in the \\"real\\" world. Roberts is a word painter, her words create a such incredible characters and descriptions that while reading I am I feel like I am standing in New York with airbusses flying overhead.Each book in this series delves deeper and deeper into the lives of the characters, where when a reader like me picks up a new book, I feel like I am catching up with old friends, not just reading a story. Their lives and how they love is a beautiful story and I'm sorry for the reviewer who said that Eve was weak, because Eve is one of the strongest characters I've read in a long time, and just because she leans on the man in her life doesn't make her weak, in my opinion that makes her stronger. Knowing that she can't handle everything on her own. It takes a stronger person to admit that than it does to try and do it all on your own, and I praise Roberts for enough foresight to know her characters before even beginning writing a book. This will always be a #1 recommendation for me. I've gotten 3 friends addicted to this series, because as I said at the beginning there will never be another."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Naked in Death is such a good book! I haven't read all of the ... In Death books yet, but I most definently intend to. The suspense, plot, romance, and over all storyline were amazing. I give J.D Robb a heartfelt thank you for writing the books in this series."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Nakes in Death is gutsy, tough, gritty and brilliant. Seldom is the mixture of suspense and romance as wonderfully done as in this book. We also get to see the &quot;toys&quot; we might use in sixty years. I bought this and devoured it in one day. Eve and Roarke are engaging characters, and thankfully, there are just more and more books about them."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"This is the 1st book in a long running series. You will be hooked!In this book we meet Lt. Eve Dallas of the New York Police and Security Department. The year is 2058. I am a huge Nora Roberts fan and I have to admit I put off reading this book for a long time because the futuristic theme frightened me off. I am not a fan of futuristic or Sci-Fi. I have to say I was more than pleasantly surprised with this story. Lt. Dallas is trying to find a serial killer when the name Roarke keeps coming up in her investigation. Roarke is a handsome multi billionaire from Ireland with what appears to be virtually no past. While all the clues keep leading back to him something just doesn't fit. Eve's gut says he is not the killer.This is a fast past suspense book with a red hot romance. You will not want to put it down and you will want to read more about all the characters created in this book."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Eve Dallas was a New York police lieutenant who was very good at her job - sometimes too good. She never told anyone how she had nightmares about all of the victims that she was too late to save and she refused to open up to the psychiatrists at the office. Her last case, where a father hacked up his young daughter into little pieces, continued to haunt her, but, before she had a chance to go in for testing, she was called to work on a priority case with political ramifications. Turns out an expensive, high-class prostitute was murdered, shot three times with an old gun. The catch was that the prostitute was the granddaughter of a US senator who wanted the killer caught and the case filed away so that he could concentrate on his political agenda. Lucky for the victim, Eve doesn't give into political pressure...Eve starts will the prostitute's clients, of which there are many, and find herself questioning Roarke, a mysterious Irish billionaire who had dinner with the victim the night before she died. Its true that Eve feels an instant physical attraction to Roarke, but she refuses to act on it - she is a professional and she doesn't get involved with suspects. Pushing her gut instincts about Roarke aside, Eve tries to be objective in her investigation, but the evidence keeps piling up against Roarke. When two more prostitutes are killed in rapid succession, Eve is under pressure to bring the killer in. With her career on the line, political pressure from the senator and her superiors, Eve cannot afford to get involved with someone like Roarke. But how can she ignore the man who makes her feel for the first time in years...?Naked in Death is the first in J.D. Robb/Nora Robert's new In Death series starring Eve Dallas as a police detective. The mystery was made fresh and new by the author's futuristic setting, where prostitution is legalized and pleasure workers are licensed professionals, guns are obsolete and food is reproduced in a machine, but still familiar and bearing many of the traits that we see in our world today. I was entertained by the author's attention to detail, such as Eve's problems with her car's heater and addiction to real coffee (which is hideously expensive). I also really liked the characters - Eve was really tough, but she had lots of weaknesses to keep her human and likeable. I am interested in learning more about her past and seeing where her relationship goes with Roarke. Roarke was also a great character with a mysterious past, which I assume will be illuminated throughout the series. He is rich, knows exactly what he wants and isn't afraid to go out and get it, but he is still insecure. The mystery was also well written and thought out with plenty of little subplots and red herrings thrown in to keep the reader guessing, however, if you are paying close attention, there are enough clues for you to figure out who killed the women. Well written, detailed with a solid plot and well-drawn characters, Naked in Death is definitely worth your time to read!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"This book, the first in J. D. Robb's &quot;In Death&quot; series, is a futuristic mystery set in New York and featuring police lieutenant Eve Dallas. &quot;Naked in Death&quot; grabbed my attention from the first page and didn't let go until the last. This series is addictive.Our detective, Eve, is tough, focused, and just too cool for words. She's a fascinating character; she has some real human weaknesses and vulnerabilities, but she also has an awesome amount of will and determination. She made the book for me.This book is action-packed and inventive -- and sexy! The main suspect/love interest, Roarke, is a wonderful foil to Eve, with his sensuality, charm, and equally strong will; he's also very, very hot. The sexual tension between these two just sizzles off the page.My only gripe about the writing: I didn't like the way the author keeps switching pov's in the same scene. One minute we're seeing through the eyes of one character, a few sentences later through another. I found it slightly disorienting.But that's a minor complaint. It certainly didn't stop me from reading -- and loving -- the entire series!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I heard so much about the In Death series by J.D Robb, so i figured I should read the first to see what it is all about. I have to say...the whole future thing really threw me off. I like Eve as a character, her backround was so sad, and the book was slightly disturbing but all in all I liked it.Roarke is a very sexy hero, or suspect...however you want to say, as he is one of the main suspects in the murder investigation. I liked the slow building relationship between Eve and Roarke, I might even read the next one just to see where it might go."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Hate that I'm 16 years late finally jumping on the band wagon, but I'm on board nonetheless :)This was a wonderful roller coaster ride of mystery, sensuality, and insight.Loved it.On to the next one....(followers of this series are also on indeath.net)"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Saturated with sexual child abuse and somewhat graphic crime scenes, this story was hard to take at times but was still well-written and contained enjoyable characters. The villain was obvious early on and the Jetsons-like setting took a while to get used to. Audible narrator was quite good. All-in-all, don't know if I would want to experience it again."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"What can I say about NAKED IN DEATH that hasn't been said already? Well obviously I don't need to go into the plot because that's been done to DEATH (ha) I will say though that because so many people recommended this book to me and because my friend eventually gave me a copy I did feel somewhat obligated to read it. Robb's Death series is 30 books long (and counting) which is somewhat daunting when starting a new series, so a part of me really didn't want to get hooked on this and for the first hundred pages or so I can honestly say that I didn't.But then something happened, or I should say someone happened. Someone in the form of a charming, mysterious and utterly addictive Irish billionaire and murder suspect named Roarke. Yes, damn his sweet button carrying self but my new literary boyfriend saved this book because quite frankly detective Eve Dallas on her own isn't very likable and I'm also not really a fan of the police procedurals. It's the sweetness, romance, patience and delicious mystery of Roarke that will keep me coming back.I also had a hard time understanding why Robb chose to set this in the future (sort of) I say sort of because she never went all the way with her future aspect. Sure she mentions in passing a few cool gadgets (an autochef would really come in handy) and theres flying cars, robot servants, off world business meetings and plenty of clever new cop toys but except for the legalized prostitution and gun prohibition it's still the New York we know of today. I just feel that if Robb was going to go for the whole future angle then she should have gone all the way or just not bothered because her BladeRunneresque vision was gimmicky and rather pointless to the story. But that's just my opinion.Of course theres a lot to like here too; obviously Robb's (Nora Roberts) writing is top notch and she spins a well planned, easy to read, dark mystery here. Her characters have also been completely fleshed out, in particular Eve. Who although crass, hands off and by the book has enough flaws and skeletons in the closet that you can't help but sympathize with her and hope she loosens up a bit and lets a certain someone in. Which brings me back to Roarke. Maybe this quote describes him best, Cheers!\\"You got a button fetish Roarke?\\"\\"I've been carrying this around like a schoolboy carries a lock of his sweetheart's hair.\\" Her eyes came back to his, and something sweet moved through her. Sweeter yet as she could see he was embarrassed.\\"That's weird.\\"\\"I thought so, myself.\\" But he slipped the button back in his pocket.\\"Do you know what else I think, Eve?\\"\\"I don't have a clue.\\"\\"I think I'm in love with you.\\"*Sigh* Yeah so I'm starting book 2 GLORY IN DEATH as we speak"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I enjoyed this book from start to finish. Robb/Roberts offers great characters, a credible vision of the future and law enforcement, a tightly woven mystery--and a murderer I didn't suspect. You can't ask for more than that in a good novel. I'm very glad there are many more books in this series."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I'm making my way through the In Death series by J.D. Robb (aka Nora Roberts) and figured I should start writing reviews for each one as I finish. I want to start off saying it's so refreshing to see a series with a strong feminine lead. I've been a loyal fan to the Janet Evanovich Stephanie Plum series, and after being disappointed over and over by the stories and characters I knew I needed a new, strong series with a kick a** female. Eve Dallas is that female. She's a NYPD cop in the year 2058. While I'm not usually into sci-fi/futuristic novels, I found this totally believable and fascinating. She's independent, smart, and has very little tolerance for B.S. While working a murder case, she meets Roarke, the male lead. He's smart, rich, sexy, a little dangerous, and had an Irish accent (basically the perfect man). Their romance is incredible. I'm currently reading Rapture in Death (4th book in the series), and love how the characters are developing, and growing together (which is something sadly lacking from Evanovich's Plum series). Naked In Death is thrilling, sexy, and exciting. It touches on mature topics, so I'd keep this from the younger age groups, but is a great read."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I resisted reading this series because it's futuristic. That genre simply never appealed to me. However, people kept talking about the awesome J.D. Robb so I caved. It was suggested to me that I read this series in order, so I have. I've read Naked in Death three times now.The characters are interesting--conflicted and compelling. Eve and Roarke are well thought out and draw a reader into their world. A world that's not so different from our present existence. Kudos to Ms. Robb for creating an interesting environment that's fascinating but still believable. The crime is hideous and seems impossible to solve, even though the suspect list is short.Naked in Death is a good, solid read. As this series progresses, however, the characters deepen and many more noteworthy and loveable characters emerge.If you haven't read the 'in Death' series, you're denying yourself hours of entertainment and enjoyment. Take the advice I was given, though, and read them in order.Shelley Dawn, author ofSweet, Sweet JessieandDark Nights"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Review courtesy of Sizzling Hot BooksI was feeling slightly down the other day, and I needed a book to pick me up. One of my comfort series, is the In Death series by J.D. Robb, so I reread Naked In Death . Naked In Death is the first book in the series and is where Roarke and Eve first meet. I love the relationship between Roarke and Eve.Before this series I was not a fan of futuristic novels, but J.D. Robb does a wonderful job creating a believable future world with a romantic twist. I love how she creates a future world, and how different things will be. J.D. put so much thought and planning into creating a different world.Lt. Eve Dallas is tough as nails, but Roarke is her soft spot. The relationship is steamy, which the perfect match to her steel personality. Before meeting Roarke, Eve was by the book and wouldn't risk her job for anyone. She believed that if she wasn't a cop then she was nothing. In Naked in Death Eve risks her badge when it comes to Roarke, she knows he is innocent and has to prove it.Multi-billionaire Roarke is tasty. He is a top specimen of a man, that will have you panting. I loved how Roarke was with Eve. Before they met each other they both thought their lives were complete. Eve didn't believe cops should marry, and Roarke had relationships with women but never let one as close as Eve.Both to Eve's dismay and delight the murder investigation throws her and Roarke together almost daily. As Eve eliminates him as a suspect, she is drawn to Roarke, and their relationship really starts to heat up. The murderer is somewhat surprising and the first time I read it I didn't catch on until close to the end.No matter how many times I read Naked in Death , I am always rapped up in the story. Naked in Death is an instantly likable, full of action novel that has enough for both mystery and romance lovers. Naked in Death will keep you guessing right until the very end."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Just love all of JD Robb/Nora Roberts in death series. I highly recommend to all readers. Once I started reading Naked in Death, which is the first in death series, I cannot stop. Had to purchase all 30+ books including mini series/short stories related to in death series. You will not get tired of reading books. I started reading series when I got my Kindle in April and I have read every single series at least 4 times. Just can't get enough of Eve and Rourke and don't get tired or re-reading.JD Robb is very good. Series has all, romance, mystery and comedy. Just hope that JD Robb will consider giving Eve and Rourke child/ren of thier own. Make character deal with issues working parents deal with nowadays. I can just imagine how funny series with be with trying to deal with a child. As it is now, whenever Rourke mentions children, Eve panics."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"It took me years to begin reading this series after being asked to do so by others. I couldn't have been more surprised!!! Couldn't put the book down and promptly ordered the rest in ebook format. It was so addictive that I finished the series in two months. However, I keep coming back to the first. This is a sexy, mysterious and interesting read. You cannot help but love the main characters, Lt. Eve Dallas and Roarke. You'll also appreciate the secondary characters that are added throughout the series. Love this series and it was well worth the wait."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Nora Roberts writing as J.D Robb? I've always been curious considering I'm a huge fan of her romance novels...and let me say YES, YES, YES! I was a little hesitant considering I do like a little \\"love\\" in my books; I didn't want to read just an ordinary mystery...blah, blah, blah, and I wasn't let down. \\"Naked in Death\\" is smokin' hot! Nora always takes you to where she wants you to be. Whether it's to the middle of the ocean, or in this case to the year 2058. Everything feels so real and different yet so very believable...almost as if she's lived in that time.There's no lack in characters either. Lieutenant Eve Dallas is a spicy, cold and brilliant detective that must find the seriel killer that's knocking off prostitutes (LoL! No pun intended...well okay, just a little), and Roarke is a multi-billionaire busineess man that's on the short list of suspects....Sparks literally fly off the pages the instant these two meet...and with all of Nora's known for moments you aren't let down.If you're like me and are a little hesitant on starting this 38 *still choking* book series, let me just say...if every book is anything like this first one then these books are worth their weight in gold."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"This, the first book of the futuristic \\"In Death\\" series, finds Eve Dallas trying to track down a possible serial killer that targets prostitutes. In her search for the killer, Eve meets the intriguing, sexy, rich Roarke, who also happens to be a suspect. Roarke stirs feelings in Eve that she didn't even realize was possible. Will Eve be able to act on her feelings without compromising her case?Oh no. I think I've found a new \\"guilty pleasure\\" series. This book roped me in right away and didn't let go until I finished. Even though I felt the story was rather predictable, I couldn't stop reading. I was worried going in that the futuristic setting would make the book too sci-fi for me to enjoy, but it didn't. I actually found that aspect of the book to be rather interesting. I've read other books by Nora Roberts in the past, but I think this one is her best of all the ones I've read. I'm looking forward to the second installment in the series."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Nora Roberts (writing as J.D. Robb) never fails to amaze & deliver. These are captivating and exciting romance/mystery/suspense stories. However, the best part of these books is the relationship between Eve and Roarke.

I've gone through half of the series after being introduced to them last year and can't wait to finish the rest of them."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I can't remember who recommended this series to me, but I'm thankful they did. This is different from what I'm used to - a series that follows the same two characters forever just didn't sound that exciting to me. But throw in a perpetually hot romance, a strong relationship in spite of (and because of) obstacles, a cast of wonderfully quirky secondary characters, and how can a girl resist? It was absolutely worth my time to get to know these characters (they've become my friends!), and to keep visiting them with each book in the series (working my way through it). A word of advice to newcomers - start the series with this one (Naked in Death). If you jump in the middle of the series, you very likely won't enjoy it and will wonder what all the hype is. Just start at the beginning, and get carried away like the rest of us. :) Oh, and the audiobooks are great, too! The same reader is used throughout (so far)."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I have found this series quite entertaining. The character of Eve Dallas is becoming one of my heros, as she is not only strong, but quick witted and a force of her own.

Eve Dallas is a homicide cop with a personal dark secret for which the gradual exploration and discovery adds an interesting layer to the current mystery. The first seven books are all fast paced action, including an ongoing hot romance with an ultra rich good looking ex criminal who can't get her out of his thoughts. Although I normally only read \\"serious\\" SciFi, needless to say I enjoyed this first story so much, I downloaded the next and the next and am now on book 20. Highly recommended for a Kindle read during travel or breaks, or sitting quietly engrossed after a hard day's work."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I usually like murder mysteries and thrillers, and I often like romances, but I thought this book was not very satisfying in either category. The mystery didn't have enough thrill and plot-twist. The romance was too abstract."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I've never been to big on mysteries. But this was such a page turner that I'm now working my way through the whole seres. I just got a Kindle and this was bought for me as a gift. I love it."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Loved the slightly over-the-top characters, the blend of mystery and romance with a touch of futuristic sci-fi. I also enjoyed the occasional shifts in perspective. Unfortunately, I don't see much of that newer books (and maybe why I seem to have a preference for older ones). The author handled the shifts in perspective beautifully; I never had any doubt whose perspective I was getting and the insight made me feel like an insider. It wasn't overused, either, just slipped in here and there where it was helpful.Eve was a great heroine, tough enough and vulnerable enough, just like her love interest. The violence was a little graphic for me, but certainly within the expected bounds of the police procedural genre. I'll definitely be picking up the next one in the series."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Just discovered this series and can't read them fast enough.

It is nice to 'get to know' the characters and all their interactions. Makes for a more interesting book if you are already aware of the players."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"It took a while but I finally backtracked and read the first \\"In Death\\" book, \\"Naked in Death\\". J.D. Robb aka Nora Roberts is such a gifted writer that each book can stand alone. That said, I'm glad I finally read the first book which introduced all the main characters and how they became connected to Eve Dallas, especially Roarke....The first time I read about Eve Dallas was in \\"Remember When\\" which I didn't find particularly interesting. It was too way out there for my liking after reading so many Nora Roberts books. But I slowly started reading the \\"In Death\\" series and now I feel I know Dallas and I appreciate the fact that she has problems stemming from her scarred childhood and applies her psyche to the murder victims she cares so deeply about. She and Roarke are both abuse survivors and truly complete each other filling the void both endure. That special connection binds them together and their love is pure joy to the reader. Of course, it doesn't hurt that he's incredibly easy on the eyes, rich beyond comprehension and just a little left of center legally.All in all, I've come to appreciate the \\"In Death\\" series and I find the plots and twists in the stories very enjoyable."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Really, I can't believe I waited so long to try out this series. It was a great book and I love that it takes place in the near future. The characters felt real and I really connected with Eve. She is a tough, don't-mess-with-me-or-I-will-zap-you-good detective whose deep belief in the justice she seeks for all of evil's victims has given her a likeable vulnerability. Not to mention the mysterious and elusive Roarke who is dead sexy with a bit of a bad boy attitude.The only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars was because I found the plot easy to figure out. I won't say it was predicable, because it wasn't completely obvious. I think I have just spent too much time reading mystery novels that I can recognize the patterns the author has hidden through out the story.I really liked this book and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys the mystery thiller genre. Did I mention this was a true page turner? I look forward to reading the rest of the books in this series."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I felt some closure upon reading \\"the beginning\\" of the Eve Dallas saga! I am a big fan of the audio book as I spend a great deal of time on the road in 1/2 hour to hour spurts. I started with the print versions but really enjoy the audio. This cd did not have the characters/voices developed as the future ones did but that could be expected. I always felt something missing by not knowing where Nora Roberts/JD Robb initiated the lives of her characters. I am comfortable with that now and will continue to listen to all the cds as they continue!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I really love this series, but I was stupid and started at like book 20. I had never heard of the In Death Series, so I just picked up one that looked really good. I was hooked and always meant to go back to the beginning. I was thrilled when I finally got a library card and they had the entire series. Being the first in the series doesn't make any less than the rest. It was great to finally understand how somethings come into play later on. Although, I did miss some of the characters that appear later. I love Eve and Roarke. They are such an interesting couple even from the beginning. I will continue reading them in order now just to catch all the stuff I missed!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Delighted to have this book!! Great read for J.D. Robb fans.

Hope to purchase # 6 thru 10 of this series. Aline Jones/Alabama"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"After much debate and just diggin my heels in to NOT commit to such a long series, I lost. Big time. And happily so, darnnit. I had heard of this great love story between Eve & Roarke and have been piqued ever since, but a long series did NOT excite me and 30+ books is definitely a commitment! But a friend had the series to borrow so, I thought that was better. And halfway through reading I was looking for the books to the best of my frugal ability, because I Knew I was hooked! Eve is not a typical heroine; Her story is gut-wrenching but without pity as the woman can take care of herself just fine. Meeting a man like Roarke was definitely not in the agenda, and she has to cope with her steely rules as an officer against pure, raw passion. This first book in the series definitely set the tone for the ones that follow- not for the weak as the heroine is a top homicide detective. If there wasn't any romance, it'd be hard for me to swallow. But OH, there is so no worries there! I can't wait to go through the series to see how their relationship develops, as well as read the intriguing mysteries that Eve Dallas will have to solve along the way. I bow in defeat to JD Robb; it was a good fight while it lasted! ;)"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I love the futuristic world she's created here.

Let me just say that the reader is THE BEST reader I have ever heard on audio. Roarke's Irish voice is amazing and she brings life to all the characters.

From the very first page, this book held my interest and I could not put it down. It kept me up way past midnight and I enjoyed every second.The story is set in 2058 New York City. Guns are relics of the past and so it is a surprise when a high class prostitute and grand daughter of a senator is found shot to death by a .38. Det. Eve Dallas is assigned as lead investigator and soon the body count starts to rise. There are many suspects, and Eve takes a particular interest in Roarke, a tall, dark and handsome millionaire. As the mystery grows, so does their romance and Eve must battle with her desire for Roarke and her duty to solve the case.This was my first introduction to Nora Roberts (aka JD Robb) and now I'm asking myself what took me so long! The writing is superb and she's a master at mixing HOT, steamy romance with mystery and suspense. Eve is a tough, complex, vulnerable and respectable heroine, and I found her to be a layered and deep character, unlike some of the perfunctory, one-dimensional heroines in other novels. And I can already tell that there's more to Roarke as well. This is the first book in the series and if it is any indication of what's to come, I can't wait to read more. Great read!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Just got acquainted with JD Robb books and her great character, Eve Dallas. They are terrific! Then, had to get the first one.

He came off as a smug, smothering, creep. As the saying goes, money doesn't buy manners.Eve and her universe felt very real, making her a compassionate character. I'll probably check out other entries in this series, just to see what she's up to. Overall, this was a fairly enjoyable read. It was a bit slow in a few spots, but other than that, flowed well.

This is the first book where Eve meets Roarke.. GREAT !"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Naked in death starts out a really great series! Nora Roberts writes these under the name of JD ROBB. I did just start this series as I read everything I can get my hands on from Nora. If you are a new reader, you do need to start with this book and work your way through. I didn't start here first and she really builds the characters through each story that if you don't start from the beginning you miss a lot. I went back and am now starting from the beginning. This series is not Nora's romance format. Of course there is romance in there! This series is a mystery style. It takes place in NYC in the year 2058. When people do travel &quot; off planet&quot; and prostitution is legal. Your car drives you and you have &quot; auto chefs &quot; in house, car , even your office. The way ROBB writes about the future this is truly believable. Lt. Eve Dallas is a tough woman. She is strong, independent, and she truly fights and believes in her job as homicide detective. In this book she finds her main suspect a billionaire name Roarke. He is very charming, Irish, has lived a little on the edge, rich, and good-looking! Eve has now found her match. Roarke didn't have the ideal childhood either and they make the most wonderful couple. This is an excellent series, and keeps you entertained and you don't want to put the book down. Robb does a great job in making the who done it a total surprise! I highly recommend this entire series you will truly be delighted It is awesome!!!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"The \\"...in Death\\" series starts with Naked in Death a futuristic series set in New York City in the year 2058. The star of the series is Lt.

He's Irish, gorgeous, and very charming.This series is written by Nora Roberts under the name J.D. Robb. Don't confuse the romance novels usually written by Ms. Roberts with this series.

Eve and Roarke are the hottest couple in print today. I love the mystery but I love the romance even more. These two are so hot I'm surprised the book doesn't go up into flames in my hands. I have reread Naked In Death at least three times and it never gets old. The whole series is great but start with Naked and go in order because it's better that way. Roarke is the ideal lover. Rich, powerful, dangerous, sexy and totally in love with Eve Dallas. Now that is one lucky woman! Eve is a great heroine. She is smart, brave, independent and loyal. At the same time she has a past that makes her vulnerable, too. She is a real person not some flat character. I can not wait for Loyalty In Death to come out. The only bad thing is I finish them so fast. Keep writing about Eve and Roarke, Nora Roberts. Your fans will be forever grateful."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"\\"Naked In Death\\" is the first book in J. D. Robb's Eve Dallas mystery series. I have been hearing positive things about these books for a long time, and now, after reading this terrific novel, I understand why.New York City, 2058 CE, are the time and setting of \\"Naked in Death.\\" Robot drones and voice activated machines do menial work, i.e., clean house, serve meals; there is a total ban on guns, (the police use lasers); major improvements have been made in medicine and technology, with advancements in genetics (and strong genetic control); airbuses for public transportation have replaced subways; tele-links replace telephones - it's not a \\"brave new world,\\" yet...but there are definite pluses midway into the 21st century. Minor armed skirmishes have taken place between China and the US, and France had another revolution which lasted for a few years. The overpopulated world has more limited resources - real coffee is rare and way too expensive, as is beef and other fresh meat. Robb has not written a sci-fi series, however. Far enough into the future to make the storyline more interesting, 2058's world is still easily recognizable.Lieutenant Eve Dallas of the NYPSD is called to a murder scene where a young licensed companion, (a legalized prostitute ), has been brutally murdered with an antique handgun from the 20th century. The victim, Sharon DeBlass, is from a very prominent family - her grandfather is a US senator. An angry man who preaches morality and leads an ultra conservative branch of his party, the senator would like to totally suppress the case, and perhaps even run the investigation himself. According to friends and relatives, Ms. DeBlass apparently chose her career not only because she liked sex, she did not need the money, but because she was rebelling against her family and strict upbringing. A note was found under her body with the printed words, \\"ONE OF SIX.\\" So, was the perpetrator a serial killer warning that there were to be five more murders? One of the prime suspects is a sexy Irish billionaire named Roarke. We never learn whether this is his first or last name. Perhaps if one is a billionaire, especially a tall, dark and handsome, with an Irish brogue, billionaire, it doesn't matter. He is quickly cleared of suspicion, and he and Eve embark on a stormy, intense romance - but not before murder #2 occurs.Eve, although a tough cop who made Lieutenant before the age of 30, is also very vulnerable. She doesn't remember the early years of her life, but knows that she was sexually, physically and emotionally abused by her father, then abandoned at age eight and left to the mercies of Children's Services. She has made her work her life, and letting Roarke get close to her is a first.Happiness is discovering another excellent series - and from what I have read, this looks like a winner! The writing is tight, as is the plot - an excellent and complex mystery. I really like the characters, Eve, definitely, Roarke - who lives up to his description, Feeney, Eve's partner, and Eve's chanteuse friend Mavis. I can't wait to pick-up book two, \\"Glory In Death.\\"JANA"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I went through the novel fairly quickly, and as long as you're looking for a fairly quick and easy read, you'll be fine. The characters are entertaining enough, the author has a knack for visual descriptions and the plot's not bad. Most of the new technology in the book is pretty appropriate - it gives us a bit of a sci-fi feel without giving Eve too much of an edge over what any cop would have now. (eg. They have a ridiculously responsive voice-recognition system yet Eve's car is a wheezing wreck.)As for Roarke, the incredibly rich love interest, it felt as if the author was forcing his sex appeal at times. I found myself trying to find out Eve's powerful attraction to him, besides the physical. He forces himself into her life multiple times, going so far as to break into her appartment. His excuse *every* time is his concern over Eve, which gets a little thin after a while - as another reviewer mentioned, for someone as prickly as she's written she takes it fairly placidly. It's hard to beleive Eve wouldn't be fed up with it after a while. Roarke's just not as interesting as the author wants us to find him.But all in all, it's a decent book. The murder culprit didn't really surprise me but it was still fun reading up to the mystery's revelation. I'm going to try a few more books in the series just to see where it goes.If you're in an airport surrounded by Tom Clancy and Anne Rice and thinking they just aren't your thing, you could do a lot worse than Naked in Death."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Naked in Death is the first of several titles in this terrific series and I highly recommend you read the books in order. (If not, it can get confusing trying to understand progressive storylines and relationships.) Set in the not too distant future, the main character Eve Dallas is a tough NY city cop investigating the murder of a female licensed companion (prostitution is now legalized). Complicating her investigation, is her growing attraction to the prime murder suspect - the enigmatic, handsome billionaire Roarke.The book has something for everyone: murder mystery and action, romance and a healthy dose of comedy thrown in to keep things from getting too heavy. Robb's fleshing out of vivid and likeable secondary characters adds to the book's appeal. Makes for great beach reading and you'll want to continue the series to learn more about what happens next to Ms. Dallas and company."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"For the sake of variety, I needed something to read in between David Baldacci novels, and this promised mystery, suspense, action, and the like. Needless to say, it delivered none of this, but instead bore me to death for 160-some pages before I gave up, threw the book against the wall and went back to reading worthy authors.Let's go over the many problems here, starting with the main character, I think her name is Eve but honestly I don't remember. She's this by-the-book, uptight, unkempt cop who cares nothing for the standards or modern society or beauty, and yet somehow manages to be beautiful enough that EVERY male character introduced first tries to hit on her. This is so cliche and doesn't make any sense. Second, we have Roarke or whatever his name is. He's a multi-millionaire with everything he could ever want, and every women in the world wants him, yet somehow he finds Eve to be the one that he can't live without.The mystery is really just a sub-plot to a horrible romance novel, but even it isn't very good. Some guy decides it'd be fun to go off popping 6 hookers, which apparently is legal in the future, which brings me to my next point. This is supposed to be futuristic, and to compensate JD Robb invented some lame new stuff to make it seem so, like laser-guns and finger print supressing spray. However, it just so happens that our killer is an \\"old schooler\\" who uses guns instead of lasers, so in reality, it's not REALLY a futuristic mystery.Even so, the investigation doesn't take long to deteriorate into a bunch of faux romance and unneeded sex scenes. After the third one, literally back to back to back, followed by the cheesy dialogue \\"Stopping a police officer from leaving is a crime, I could arrest you,\\" and then \\"You weren't wearing you badge when it happened, or anything else for what matter.\\"Seriously??? Skip over this book, it's garbage. 2 stars for whatever the ending might have been."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"The book Naked In Death, by J.D. Robb is the first book of a futuristic series, taking place in New York City in the year 2058. Lt. Eve Dallas, a cop for 10 years, has dedicated all of her energy and most of her time toward bringing justice to those who are murdered and finding their ruthless killers. Eve has been put on a code five-murder investigation. One of the murder suspects is a suductive Irish billionaire, Roarke. Eve finds herself in a situation that she has never been in before. She has fallen in love. This causes a great deal of confusion and mixed feelings. Dallas is constantly jumping through hoops trying to get one step closer to cracking the case. She has to meet with the senator, interview suspects, go through testing, and deal with personal problems. Naked In Death is one of the best books that I have ever read. It fascinated me to learn that a female played the role of a very well respected homicide dective. The book is full of mystery and romance, which makes it a definite page-turner. It moves at a fast pace leaving no space for boredom. I strongly advise everyone who loves romance entwined in suspence to read this inviting novel."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I love this book so much! Ever since I discovered this series I have been rereading them over and over again. From Naked in Death to Loyalty in Death, I have enjoyed all 9 of these books (plus one short story), but Naked in Death is by far my favorite. Eve Dallas is such a strong, capable woman, and Roarke is sexy, rich, and so sweet. This murder-mystery/romance is steamy, surprising, and a keeper."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"The &quot;..in Death&quot; series was one of the best series I've ever read. Kudos to Nora Roberts, aka J.D. Robb. The first book in this series &quot;Naked in Death&quot; is about a serial killer who had offed three prostitutes with no apparent connections, except for a drop-dead gorgeous billionare named Roarke. When Eve Dallas (the female protagonist of the story) went to investigate this connection she finds herself in a situation she has never faced before and is terrified of, she finds herself falling in love. What I most enjoyed about this book was the fact that it portrayed relationships soo acurately. It was filled with fear of being overly-dependant on each other, and many other emotions that other authors just never get to. It's always the protagonist meeting his/her &quot;soulmate&quot; and fighting evil together. Not with Eve Dallas and Roarke, these were two very down to earth characters, thats what kept me reading. I plan to read all nine books in the series, you should too. I promise, this series will not disappoint."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"It doesn't matter how many times I've read it (going on half a dozen or more now), I just can't put it down! Every time a new one comes out, it seems to feed that Eve/Roarke fix for a little while but it's comforting to know I can always go back to the beginning to re-live how it it all started."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"The futuristic setting of J.D. Robb's (Nora Roberts') \\"In Death\\" books kept me from starting this series, despite being an avid Roberts reader for years (lots of years). I've never been a fan of novels set in the future. As it turns out, I was remarkably short-sighted.With the proven ability to write taut romantic thrillers, Roberts (Robb) adds an intriguing layer to her storytelling and peppers this solid police procedural with glimpses of the advancements in society and technology in the year Eve Dallas and Roarke live in (2053)...and even more intriguing, the things that haven't changed - most importantly, human nature in all its horror and glory. It's a strong book with very interesting characters, and while you find out more about Eve than you do about Roarke, who remains a bit of an enigma at this point, there's a solid start to an enticing, heartwarming relationship.All in all, I'm glad I finally got around to starting the much touted In Death series and while the futuristic aspects will never be my favorite thing, I truly enjoyed the start of the series and am looking forward to more. 4.5 Stars."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"For years I have avoided this series like it was the plague. I am not a Nora Roberts fan. I've never really found anything enjoyable about her books and feared that these books would leave me feeling the same way. However, when I became involved with an online bookclub, everyone was raving about this series so I figured to take the chance and ordered Naked in Death. I am so glad that I did. I absolutely adored this book and have already gotten the next three in the series. I cannot believe I waited so long to try this series.Naked in Death tells the story of Lieutenant Eve Dallas in the year 2058 (something that was at first a little difficult to get used to). Eve is investigating a high profile murder of the granddaughter of a US Senator. The book is full of a number of twists and turns that will leave you guessing until the very end. However, one of the best parts of the book is the introduction of Roarke. He is so strong and sexy. He'd definitely be one of those book characters I'd like to meet in real life (I'm sure hubby would love to hear that...lol)."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Call me bi-curious. No, not in that way. I'm talking in the way of romance books.I'm a red-blooded American male. I write mysteries, I read mysteries, SF, thrillers, history, food tomes, almost everything but romance books. Up until now, I've always thought of romance books as trite throwaways that contain a couple of good sex scenes. Read those and forget about the rest of the book.But something happened about a month ago: I actually noticed, really, for the first time, how many romance books there actually are in a bookstore. Hundreds. Thousands? And, for the first time, my countenance faltered. I realized that I might actually be up to read a romance. But which one? I asked a fellow writer who she liked and, among the names was Nora Roberts. I know Nora Roberts just like people who don't read horror stories knows Stephen King. I went the local library, picked up a few Nora Roberts books, but none of them really caught my attention.Then I remembered J.D. Robb. I knew that Roberts wrote stories as Robb so I checked them out. And I found my beachhead in the field of romance books. Lead character is a police detective. I'm writing a book about a female lead detective. Stories take place in 2059. Hmm, that sounds like SF. I like SF. The books are characterized as romantic suspense. I like suspense. My first novel was a suspense novel. And I'm a romantic. What's not to like? I verified which book was the first in the series, Naked in Death, checked out the audiobook from the library, and inserted the CD.The first disc was not even halfway through before I was hooked. And not just mild interest but hook, line, and sinker. I was all in. The book has a nice pace, not slow at all. Since the book was written in 1995, it is interesting to note some of the futuristic discrepancies but just as cool to note the stuff Roberts got right. Eve Dallas, the lead character, carries around a device that will surely be what the iPhone is going to be: the all-in-one gadget that basically does everything. I also appreciated the more mundane aspects of 2059 NYC: cars that don't fly. Sure, I want my flying car. Who doesn't? But we're probably not going to get there in 50 years.Back to the story: Eve Dallas must investigate the murders of a licensed companion, a prostitute, who just happens to be the granddaughter of a prominent US Senator. It was pretty interesting to read this book, with legalized prostitution, during the week NY governor Eliot Spitzer resigned for being with one. Roberts really let us readers get into Eve's head and thoughts. I found myself being mad when she was and happy when she was. I'll admit the POV shifts that frequent this book is not the style in which I write. It was annoying at first but then I got used to it.The story was great. But what about the romance? This was a romance book after all. Rourke, the all-everything Irish guy who starts as a suspect and becomes Eve's lover, is the kind of guy, I'll admit, seems to inhabit romance books. Now, I'm saying this purely from a stereotypical standpoint. But, hey, the first romance book I read has one of \\"those\\" guys in it. How's a regular guy supposed to compete with that? Anyway, the romantic aspects of the novel seemed even, believable. Even the sex scene--there's one main one, with intimate details--was good and hot. I give a hat tip to Ms. Roberts in the many ways to describe sexual intercourse without using actual physical words.The final testament to reading Naked in Death is this: I have already checked out the second book, Glory in Death, on audio. I can't wait to start.(taken from [..])"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"After 20+ books over 10+ years, I decided it was high time to go back to where it all began -- NAKED IN DEATH.Here, author J.D. Robb (aka best-selling author Nora Roberts) introduces us to NYPSD Lieutenant Eve Dallas, a force in her own right, and one of the trickiest cases yet. The granddaughter of a Senator has been brutally murdered, and the perpetrator promises that five more bodies are to follow. As Eve races against the clock to save more women from dying, she also must contend with her own feelings for Roarke, a self-made billionaire who early on is a suspect in the murders.If you haven't read any of the \\"...IN DEATH\\" books, I highly recommend them to anyone who enjoys romantic suspense. The mystery and the romance are evenly balanced, Eve and Roarke are definitely intriguing characters, and the story just never gets old.Going back to this first story in the series after having been a fan so long, I was grateful to be reminded of the meaning behind the gray button, how Galahad came into the picture, and how Somerset's attitude has been the same from the beginning.NAKED IN DEATH is a winner, and you'll be happy to know that when you finish reading it, there are 24 more stories already published in the series. Happy Reading!!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I have read several of the books in the \\"In Death\\" series, specifically the later installments and for a while, have intended to read the beginning to see how the series evolved. \\"Naked in Death\\" was a wonderful building block for a series that I have grown to love. This books starts the evolution of the passionate relationship between Eve and Roarke. We see their acceptance of each other and their desire to find in each other something that they desire. They are willing to risk their hearts for love.We are introduced to other characters that appear frequently in later installments, but who I had no idea of how they joined the cast of a well developed series. It also explains that when we first meet Eve, she has hidden her secret in her subconscious and has no idea the impact that it would have on her future. We meet Mavis (Eve's best friend who is not yet the hip \\"Vid\\" star yet, but whose career is on the rise); Dr. Mira, who is pushing Eve to remember a past that she has chosen not to remember; Charles Monroe, a licensed companion (i.e., high class prostitute) who is later the love of Louise's life (Louise being one of her dearest friends). Sideline...I never would have known that Charles hit on Eve first, in a million years, called her Lieutenant \\"Sugar Pants\\" and even offered to give her a \\"freebie\\". [For those who follow the series, you will find that extremely surprising.] And finally, we meet the ever present Feenie, Eve's mentor and father figure (He even treats Roarke like a father who is dating his daughter. It is cute and they eventually come to an understanding). We see Summerset and how his relationship with Eve evolved, and find out how she comes into possession of Galahad, the peculiar cat, that is throughout every novel in the series. And most of all, we see Eve evolve into the woman that she becomes in \\"Innocent in Death\\".I guess I should mention the whole murder angle in the story. Eve is out to determine who is killing licensed LCs with antiquated weapons. The first victim is the granddaughter of a well connected Senator. On top of that, the man that Eve finds irresistable is a suspect. However, following her heart and believing in someone for the first time, is not easy. Unprepared for love, Eve navigates unchartered waters.I do intend to read a few of the others because I know that Peabody and McNab have to make their appearances in the next book or two because I see her in Immitation in Death. This will be the summer of fun reads."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Nora Roberts (writing as J. D. Robb) has written a great series with the In Death books. This is the first of the series and is absolutely wonderful. I have alrady listened to or read all of this series that has been published but am purchasing them on CD now so I can listen to them again. You will love the characters that are in all of these books. Eve Dallas is a police office who is very dedicated to her job, her love interest is Roarke, a multi-millionare you will fall in love with; then there is Peabody, her assistant who wants to be a detective, and Summerset, Roarke's butler. This issue covers murders due to illegal substances. You won't find a single issue of this series that you will not enjoy and try to help Eve solve the murder."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"The book was great and i'm not usually a fan of mysteries but i loved the book so much, i'm getting the entire set. i continually reread them and i can still enjoy them."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"This was the best book by J.D. Robb yet..I had not read the beginning of this series and picked up and read some of her older books, but this book was excellent and I can wait to read more of the original books in order! Highly recommend!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"In order to fully understand the series, you must start at the beginning. Learn how Eve and Roarke meet, and how he wins his reluctant cop. She does not make it easy for him and he is not used to having to pursue, (although he is very good at it.) Eve must trust her judgement and puts her carreer on the line to find a murderer, while tring to clear Roarke who has been set up. This book introduces us to several charactors that we will see later in the series. (Charles Monroe, Crack, and Dr. Mira)"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"In this, the first book of the &quot;In Death&quot; series set in the 2050s, you are introduced to Eve Dallas. Eve is a cop of ten years, and is dedicated to her job. All of her energy goes into hleping people who are murdered, and finding their killers. Eve is driven to do the best that she can by a past that she cannot remeber.While investigating the murder of several licensed companions she is introduced to Roarke who, though a suspect, intreges and intrests her. As Eve fights these new fealing the murderer continues to kill his chosen victims. Can she solve the case before even more loose their lives, or handle the memories of her past that the case awakens in her?"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"The 'future' idea was a distraction. No real coffee unless you were rich because our generation [give or take a decade] destroyed all the rain forests? No guns for Americans? Figures. This book not only proves that theory wrong - criminals don't follow laws & they will ALWAYS have guns - it goes to show that if the female victims had weapons [and proper training] they could have defended themselves & wouldn't have to rely on cops who get there too late with THEIR guns to save them. [Why do you think no other country in modern times has tried to take over America? Because they know many Americans have weapons!]In 2058: -Females are referred to as sir.-Eve runs after disembarking from a shuttle because she's in a hurry & a computor yells at her - in public - and tells her - a grown woman - not to run.-A cold bottle or glass of Pepsi is refreshing but a 'tube' of Pepsi sounds disgusting.-A yellow light flashes on the wall of Eve's parking spot at her home, a warning to her [and everyone else passing by] that her payment on the space is late. If the light turns red, a barricade engages.-Sending 'real roses' was considered 'old-fashioned etiquette.'And last but not least- Senator DeBlass is a Right Wing Conservative Republican - meaning, he's evil for any number of reasons. Truthfully, Roarke would more likely be a Conservative, too.There's a group DeBlass helps fund called 'Moral Values,' and the liberals here call it an 'extremist group,' but as we know, liberals are intolerant if your opinion differs from theirs.Eve & her coworkers refer to the people of East Washington as 'paranoid since the terrorist hit.' Feeney says, \\"Couple dozen legislators get whacked, and they never forget it.\\" My question is, \\"Why would they forget something so horrific?\\"As for Eve & Roarke, I don't think they were compatable at all. He was the epitome of elegance & class and she was quite the opposite. Their differences could have been a good thing, but Eve was too unlikable. Roarke deserved better, frankly, than to have a foul-mouthed, standoffish, crude woman who chopped her own hair rather than get a quick professional cut and didn't care one iota about her overall appearance. Clothes didn't have to be expensive to look nice! Did she think 'acting like a man' to use the cliche, was the only way she could fit in? Roarke was proof that not all men act that way.I don't think I could read even one more of this series if Eve is the main character."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I picked up this book because I was looking for something light to read and Sabrina from About Happy Books mentioned it as one of her favorite series. I'd never read anything by Nora Roberts and this was more of a mystery series so I thought it'd be a fun read. All I knew going in was that it was about a female police officer and her husband.Once I read the synopsis and started the book I realized it was also somewhat science fiction because it's set in the future. Also, in the first book, Eve and Roarke haven't met and certainly aren't married. But my knowing they marry later on in the series wasn't exactly a spoiler as it's obvious he's the main male character and they'll end up together.As far as readability and entertainment value, this book is perfect if you're looking for light, escapist reading. I liked the extra element the futuristic setting added and it made it more interesting than if I chose to read a novel set in present day. The book also had a bit of a formulaic feel to it, almost like I was watching one of those hour long cop shows, which is nice when you want something familiar.However my biggest problem with the book was the portrayal of the two main characters. I've seen several people claiming that Eve is a strong heroine but I couldn't agree with that. Yes, she's a police officer who is physically strong and capable of protecting herself. But she's also emotionally closed off from people, doesn't let others in, has problems sleeping, and doesn't seem to want any help overcoming her traumatic past. Plus she lets Roarke bully her and doesn't stand up for herself when he ignores her wishes.And many tout Roarke as the perfect guy who's so charming and romantic but I found him to be inconsiderate and abusive. He tells Eve what to do and, if she refuses, uses physical force to make her do what he wants, often under the guise of it being what's best for her. In one scene they're about to become intimate and Eve pulls back, saying, \\"This isn't going to happen.\\" \\"The hell it isn't,\\" he says back. A few sentences later, Eve observes that he's unlike the men who negotiate when they want something. Instead, he just takes what he wants.In another scene he commands her to sit down and \\"in a sudden fury, he [takes] her shoulders, [and pushes] her into a chair.\\" Later, he offers her a drink but she refuses because she's on duty. He cuts her off with a \\"vicious eruption\\" and commands her to, \\"Drink, goddamn it, or I'll pour it into you.\\"And on two occasions he lets himself into her apartment building without her permission. He even indicates that he's explored her apartment but didn't go into her bedroom and his decision was based on \\"not so much respect for her privacy as it was the challenge she presented that provoked him to discover her from the woman alone rather than her surroundings.\\"So it was scenes and dialogue like that which put me off both characters, Roarke for treating Eve so badly and Eve for just letting him do it. I don't know how they end up falling in love or how so many readers claim Roarke is romantic and the perfect guy. Just because he's rich and handsome doesn't mean he should be able to get away with all that he does.I finished the book hoping it'd get better or there would be some explanation for all the things I disliked. Unfortunately that didn't happen and while I liked solving the mystery behind the crimes, I wasn't sad when the book ended. I don't plan on reading any further in the series (the 35th book was recently released) because it's just not for me."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"This is a very good protective cover for your Kindle.

AS JD Robb, she writes a futuristic mystery/suspense series featuring Lieutenant Eve Dallas and billionaire Roarke.Naked in Death is the first in the series- it takes place many years into the future (2058). It is fascinating to see how much things have advanced- the future is full of technology, rules/regulations, legalized prostitution and contraband luxuries. But even with all these advancements, there is still murder.Eve is investigating a serial killing and she finds out that she is falling for one of the main suspects, Roarke. The serial killer is targeting prostitutes and using outlawed guns to make his point. The investigation is complicated by the fact that one of the victims is connected to a very influential political family. That family, and Eve herself, have secrets to keep hidden--secrets that have to be uncovered to stop the killerNaked in Death introduces Eve and Roarke and their complex relationship. As a couple, they are compelling and have definate chemistry. Despite the killings and Eve's past, they manage to begin their relationship which will progress in the books that follow and continue the series.The plot of the book is fast paced. The ending conclusion and revelation of the murderer comes as a surprise. Naked in Death is a great start to the Death series."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Naked in Death is the first in a series set in 2058. The security is more sophisticated; droids take care of the mundane tasks, interplanetary travel is the norm, etc; however, murder still has to be solved one clue at a time. The new heroine is Lt. Eve Dallas and the murder of a \\"licensed\\" prostitute is a code five which means that she must keep her findings classified.The first prostitute to die is the granddaughter of a high profile senator...the whole family is high profile and self important. The second and third prostitutes to die are apparently less important and not related to each other. EXCEPT that the killer leaves notes saying l of 6, 2 of 6, 3 or 6, etc. One of the suspects is Roarke, the richest, and of course, most handsome men in the world. It's an unlikely alliance, but Eve and Roarke become involved leading the way to future books. The suspense is good to the end with a surpise killer. If the subsequent stories are as good, this will be a fun series to follow and read. I recommend Naked in Death."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"While I love all the \\"In Death\\" books, this one is probably my favorite. It is really great for people who love mysterys, female leads but find that some books don't keep their attention. This series will have you up at four in the morning angry that the stores aren't open so you can get the next one. It will please everyone. For those who like romance there is a great story between Eve and Rorke and the promise for more to come, while those who aren't into the relationship aspect it will seem the romance part flies by because the story of them getting together adds more depth to the charactors. This book will satisfy everyone."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"The first book of the &quot;...In Death&quot; series is great. The whole series is wonderful. Well crafted with a sharp cast of characters and plots that are thick and scenes that are tense. These are page turners, and &quot;Naked In Death&quot; is sure to get you hooked. The premise may detour some readers, but don't let it. Yes, it is set in 2058, but it is not Sci-Fi. It's barely the future at all! There are some nifty gadgets, sure, but they are not so far-fetched as to be unrelatable. Robb does an excellent job of creating a past (our future) for her characters and their country. Very believable and interesting. Legalized prostitution? Kinda. A gun ban? Yep. Wealth and Politics? Some things never change. See what happens when you mix them all together. Eve Dallas is a tough detective and an intriguing protagonist. You'll laugh, I promise, and you'll be sucked into the story from the first murder."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I think this was a wonderful first book to an exciting series.I started with this book and the next thing I know I've finished all the books in this 8+ book series.I am holding on to my seat for the next book by J.D.Robb."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"My main complaint about this book (or series) is that the futuristic setting adds little; in fact, Nora Roberts' sci-fi elements seem to come more from The Jetsons than from current projections of the coming century. (For example -- flying cars and extensive space travel/colonization are both staples of old-style sci-fi, but are very unlikely to occure in the next half century). Eve Dallas could have been written in the present day and it would have worked as well.But speaking of Eve, I'm afraid she's about as stereotypical as they come. She's sharp as a tack; she's tough as nails; she's so dedicated to her job that she pays no attention to her personal appearance -- yet she's so gorgeous and sexy that every man she meets wants her. She's her own person -- except when she meets Roarke, then she seems more than willing to subjugate herself to him (but that's okay, because she's doing so voluntarily, you see -- she's still her own person and still in control of the situation. Because she's tough and capable... hmm, I'm starting to repeat myself). Even her name is hokey: \\"Eve\\" = pure woman, sexy; \\"Dallas\\" = tough, streetwise, perfect cop name.Then there's the writing style; I found it distracting that it's written in third person with insight into Eve's mind -- yet it slips from time to time into Roarke's mind.All this makes it sound as if I hate the book and the series. I don't, I think they're reasonably entertaining. You just can't take it very seriously."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"It's such a delight when you find an author who brings a novel perspective to old tales, especially when you can share them with your spouse! J. D. Robb's Lt. Eve Dallas is just such a series.The writing is fast, fluent & funny; the characters are feisty & interesting, & the source of the stories, murder & mayhem, have a different twist as they are set in 2058 in the dire straits of a future America, primarily in New York City & East Washington, (DC no longer exists), & a few off-world locations.The IN DEATH series crosses several genres: Police Drama, Romance, Suspense & Science Fiction. J. D. Robb has extrapolated the trends she sees today into a world where the chasm between the \\"haves\\" & \\"have-nots\\" is the difference between real coffee & the slop offered by Auto-Chefs. Where transportation & living quarters are space age as are the tools, toys & drugs, music, mores & fashion. Where the laws & politics will have you despairing & giggling, in the same paragraph.Rebeccasreads highly recommends the IN DEATH series as thoughtful, engaging & tasty reading candy"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"THIS WAS MY FIRST BOOK BY J D ROBB AKA NORA ROBERTS AND I CANNOT WAIT TO GET MY HANDS ON THE NEXT BOOK.

Well, I guess I was expecting a bit more than her normal romance novels, because I found the 'suspense and mystery' rather lacking. Eve was a nice enough character if a tad predictable... (Hard-boiled tomboyish female cop who can't dress, can't cut her hair and is so messed up she can't sleep at night...Oh... And lets not forget the disdain of doctors and shrinks...Hmmmm... This is probably the most overused cop stereotype around). Enter Roarke, the supposed chief 'suspect.' This is where the novel became hokey. After establishing the fact that Eve is tough, hard-nosed and without mercy, she instantly falls head over heels for an Irish &quot;Bill Gates&quot; despite the fact that he is so pushy arrogant and annoying I wanted to scream... Oh...And lets not forget to have sex, during the middle of a gruesome murder investigation. Yeah right.While this story started out okay, it quickly got bogged down with a silly romance between Eve and Roarke which should have cost her her badge. I wish Eve at LEAST had the dignity and restraint to refuse involvement with Roarke until this investigation was over. No such luck. Silly.I found Naked to be an average read with momentary elements of brilliance. What ruined it for me was Roarke, who was too superhuman to be believed, and the 'mystery' which wasn't really much of a mystery at all."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"NAKED IN DEATH is a high paced, sexy thriller and it is sure to interest romance and mystery readers alike. This is a very fast paced who done it story.

She was recommended by more than one poster as one of the best heroines in fantasy. Okay, technically Robb's novels are mysteries with a science fiction angle.Eve Dallas is a cop in the near future. She's tough, but she's got a tender side that manifests in nightmares over a case gone bad. She thinks she's off the streets and headed to get a Psych referral when she gets a top security case. It seems, the daughter of a US Senator has been killed in a brutal and sexual manner. When she arrives on the scene, she realizes the victim is one in six.\\"Naked\\" is a great start to the series. It's well-written. Robb really knows how to hook a reader. I like Eve Dallas and her world. I feel strong sympathy for the victims, particularly the second girl, Lola.My reasons for not giving this book 5 stars is my objection to Dallas sleeping with a suspect during the course of the investigation and the fact that I figured out the murderer pretty quickly in the game. Knowing 'whodunit' didn't stop me from reading the rest to find out how he got caught. I spoke to a reader further down the series than I am and was told the mystery element improves as the stories go on. I'm looking forward to that!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I didn't think I'd like it, but it wasn't bad. A friend wanted me to give it a try, because the Eve Dallas books are her favorite series. Nora Roberts/JD Robb is a talented writer in that she develops likable characters, manages a dynamic plot, and paces it successfully enough to create a page-turner. She's a best-seller for those very reasons.The things I didn't like about the book are as follows:- I'm very annoyed by shifting points of view. I want a consistent narrator within scenes, not what he feels, what she thinks, what he wants, what she wants, etc. Sometimes Roberts was switching between three characters in three paragraphs.- Despite the fact that this is a futuristic thriller, we only know that it's futuristic because she tells us. There is no futuristic ambiance, there is no proposal for challenging inventions or lifestyle changes other than standard near-future sci-fi tropes. It seems that the risks of futuristic forecasting were too challenging, so her murder used the motives of present-day killers - the familiar which took the potency away from the futuristic setting.When I need a quick read for entertainment only, I'd consider reading another. I hope in subsequent books, Roberts and Eve Dallas don't fear the future, but embrace it.- CV Rick"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"This book introduces the reader to the world of Eve Dallas, Futuristic police detective living on a war-torn planet Earth.

This very dark series explores horrific sexual crimes graphically described. It takes place in the future when there no longer exists what we know as polite or respectful language or deference to women or young people. Everyone is vulgar both the men and the women in their language and the accepted way they communicate and interact. The main character Eve is fashioned after your hard core homicide detective. She rough and vulgar and prone to violence and anger, barely feminine at all. Even the sex among the main characters is described as violent with the same dark descriptors as the sexual crimes committed in this book.

Robb is her pin name...but I've never really enjoyed the straight up romance novels....even though I read them from time to time. I liked this book though because we do have that element of romance but it was mixed in with the whole futuristic crime drama. The thing with these kind of books is I always, always know who did it from the moment they enter the scene. I just find it so obvious, but I do like the journey of getting there, especially with all the twists and turns that get thrown in. I hated all the typos, this book has been out sense...1995 you'd think they would have gone through and fixed a few of them...and there are some obvious ones, and they just take you out of the moment. I liked Roarke, I know a lot of people don't like that alpha male great at everything type of guy, but I like the chemistry between Roarke and Eve. Eve is the type of girl that doesn't need a man and Roarke is the type who isn't used to the word no...So, it was fun to see them open up. I will have to get more of these books soon, because I flew through this one, I didn't want to put it down."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Love the J.D. Robb books.

As a result, I didn't even know this series took place in the future until I started reading it. It's a fairly conservative view of the future not a lot of fantastical star trek elements in this one. The main character was interesting, as was the mystery. I might read more of these, although after reading the blurb for the second book, I'm not in a hurry to read it."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I have read multiple books from this author and like most of them.

Once I started to read it, I found it hard to put down. The combination of Mystery/Romance/Suspense and Sci-fi is really hard to resist. I am now an avid J.D Robb fan and can hardly wait for my next order to come."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"The first in the In Death series by J.D. Robb was first published in 1995 and the plot reads like it was taken out of our current headlines. Set in 2058, the story is about Lieutenant Eve Dallas, New York cop, who is gritty and hard and is fighting for justice for all it's worth. What is it worth?An upscale prostitute Sharon DeBlass has been murdered the 20th century way. With a hand gun (they use lasers now) and with venomous intent. Sharon isn't just any prostitute; she is the granddaughter of Senator DeBlass who thinks he is as moral as they come. But is he?Roarke, wealthy entrepreneur extraordinaire, is smart and savvy and is a suspect in the case. He has an eye for Eve who tries to go by the book, but can he get past her defenses and her past?I have been meaning to read this series for years and got an opportunity to listen to the book on CD, read by Susan Ericksen. Ms. Ericksen does a convincing job with each of the characters. To me, the plot felt mainstream and I didn't find anything new there, but then the book was written over a decade ago and may have been a new market to some. The romance between Roarke and Eve was okay to bring depth to Eve's character, but it wasn't one of the better romances that I have read. Let's hope they get better in the latter books in the series. The story does contain violence and talks about rape, incest and child abuse, so be prepared for that.Overall I found the story to be fairly interesting, but not outstanding. In fact, I guessed the murderer pretty early in the story. If you like gritty police procedurals with suspense and romance mixed in, this one's for you."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

Robb (aka Nora Roberts) is an excellent introduction to the world of 2058 and NYPSD homicide Detective-Lieutenant Eve Dallas. New York has changed a lot in the future, at once more permissive (prostitution is legal) and repressive (pregnancy is regulated by the state). But these differences are only a backdrop to the quite interesting story of Dallas' search for a serial killer and her burgeoning relationship with Irish billionaire (and murder suspect) Roarke. Eve is a very interesting character, a very effective investigator, focused totally on the job. She has a dark past behind her that she has chosen to do her best to ignore and suppress. Roarke is fun, a man who raised himself from the gutter with not totally legal tactics to become very powerful. He retains a slightly disdainful opinion of the law and really wants thaw the icy Lieutenant. The story has a startling climax that I'm not even going to hint at, but I think it's one the book's best points. I'm really looking forward to reading the next installment in this series and highly recommend this one to everybody."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"This being the first book I've read of Nora Roberts under the name J.D. Robb, and I'm happy to say I'm thoroughly impressed. I'm generally a Nora Roberts fan, though I admit I've found some of her books somewhat sappy. Not so in this case. It was a perfect blend of mystery and romance, with a few quirks thrown in. Being set in the future, Miss Roberts did a fine job of excercising that fascinating imagination of hers. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Damn! I wish I hadn't done that! \\"Naked in Death\\" is the first in JD Robb's popular Death series which is now almost two dozen novels strong ... and I loved it! My pocketbook will protest and my bookshelves will be groaning under the ever increasing load as I begin the quest to accumulate the rest of the series.Eve Dallas is a lieutenant in the New York City Police Department. The story is set in 2058 - a future near enough to be entirely recognizable but far enough away that Robb can postulate some very interesting technological and cultural developments - guns have been banned; prostitution is legal and completely regulated; cars have an auto-pilot setting; VR simulations have advanced to a heart-stopping, palm-sweating, gut-wrenching reality that is light years beyond the technology we know of today; smoking is almost a thing of the past; police weaponry consists only of lasers and high powered stun guns with handguns firing real bullets available only in museums and private collections; and, would you believe it, recreational \\"hotels\\" for the &uuml;ber-wealthy are actually in continuous orbit above the earth!The murder, on the other hand, is one we are, sadly, all too familiar with - the violent, gruesome, almost ritualistic slaying of a sex trade worker, now known by the euphemism \\"licenced companion\\", which is only the first of an intended series by a serial killer. He left behind a note ... \\"ONE OF SIX\\"! This particular licenced companion, Sharon DeBlass, just happened to be the grand-daughter of a US Senator and you might well imagine the political pressure that is being brought to bear on Dallas and NYPD to solve the case. When the investigation points in the direction of Roarke, a self-made reclusive billionaire, the heat and passion in the novel is turned up a notch as Dallas finds herself in the unenviable position of falling for a man who just might be the killer she's looking for!I don't think I can give Robb top marks for the plot - the solution is just a little too predictable and can be seen a fair distance from the end of the novel. But \\"Naked in Death\\" certainly earns both thumbs well turned up in every other way - dialogue, characterization, setting, humour (the side plot about the husband's murder by Hetta Finestein, a lovable little gray haired old lady, is a positive hoot), imagination, novelty, creativity and more. And I have to hand it to Robb ... she writes a mean sex scene. Whew! They're footloose, they're well-timed, they're playful and they're enough to bring a little sheen of sweat up on your brow!Highly recommended! Romance, police procedural, mystery, science fiction ... you name it, they all fit. If you like a lightweight, easy-going enjoyable read in any of those genres, you'll enjoy \\"Naked in Death\\".Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"With so much going for it, I wanted to believe this book was better then it was. The writing is competent, the characterizations sharp, the future world rang true and the mystery was involved. Yet, after the first couple of chapters, I had to force myself to turn the pages. This is a gritty &quot;real-life&quot; kind of mystery with lots of gorey descriptions and profanity. The romance is very background to the story and has almost no development. The characters actually only meet a handful of times during the story and most of their time together involves sex. The mystery wansn't bad, but I found it hard to get past the unbelievableness of Roarke as a suspect. I mean this guy is the richest man in the Universe which should have made him untouchable, plus he has no real connection to the murders. To make matters worse, we find out at the very beginning of the book that he is not the murder, so the edge that should have been their is missing and our brillant heroine comes off as a giant dope for suspecting him. I guess, I was expecting more tension, with all kinds of subtle clues being dropped that it is him, while the heorine is torn by her attraction to him and her fear that she will be his next victim. Hey that sounds like a good plot, maybe I'll go write it. This is a good book to pick up from the local book trader."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"The In Death series is one of my favorite books series. I just love the relationship between Eve and Roarke. I thought it was time to go back and read the first book again. It was wonderful to be re-introduced to both Eve and Roarke. I liked Eve's dedication to her job. I was less comfortable with her notion that her only value was through her job. She said, more than once, that without the job she was nothing. I liked Roarke's determination to see where the relationship with Eve would go. He was definitely the more emotionally daring of the two of them. I liked that Eve did trust Roarke and stand up for him.The mystery itself was less compelling mainly because I remembered who the criminal was. I liked the way the futuristic society was introduced without the infusion of large \\"info-dumps.\\"This was a good start to a series that grows richer and more entertaining with each additional volume. I recommend them to all readers of romantic suspense."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I've got a crush on Roarke! Oh, man, he is HOT!Okay, now, the book. J.D. Robb, pseudonym for Nora Roberts, has written a series of 25 books about Eve Dallas, the finest of New York's finest and a homicide detective, and Roarke, her incredibly rich, incredibly sexy, incredibly handsome, incredibly smart lover from Dublin. What a terrific combination!Now, we add a weird element. The setting is NYC in the year 2058. I don't really care for sci fi, but this element only makes this yummy series more appealing. The stories and people are not extreme in sci-fi weirdness, but the future brings cool new conveniences and interesting changes to their lives. People travel off-planet now and then; robots provide household services and security; cops use laser guns; cars have auto-pilot settings; prostitution is legal and regulated; and, food is supplied and prepared by machines that people stock.Eve and Roarke are two lost souls who make each other whole. Eve is so independent, good at her job, beautiful, full of compassion for victims of crimes, and emotionally needy. Roarke is so good at everything he does, particularly taking care of Eve. They fall passionately in love and simply cannot live without each other.The plot is incidental. The real story is about Eve and Roarke, and it is wonderful and fun."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"An edgy, fast paced, yet insightful novel, providing murder, police drama and romance in a futuristic setting. New York detective Eve Dallas is assigned to the murder of a high class hooker with ties to a prominent family. The investigation leads her through twists and turns and she becomes involved with Roarke, one of her suspects, making her question herself and begin to come to terms with her own mysterious past.A gripping lead in to the series."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"The main character of this book is a spineless whimp who continually throughout the book says things she doesn't mean, acts stupidly and unprofessionally and then lies about it. Roarke is an arrogant, presumptuous jerk and would be an OK hero if someone would take him down a peg. Eve is not the one to do it, as every time she says something, he overrules her (even in her choice of beverages) and she lets him do it. This would be OK, if that is the way her character was written. Instead, the author claims she is a strong-willed, independent professional woman who knows her own mind. THEN WHY DOESN'T SHE ACT LIKE IT? Why does she keep letting Rourke overrule her? Even in simple matters like eating dinner or what to drink (he does this, twice with the beverages). The author should either have Eve be a woman who likes to be submissive and not care about her career or stop having her actions so out of character. She sleeps with a suspect in a murder investigation (sounds like something my self-destructive sister would do) and then lies to her police chief by claiming he's been taken off the list of suspects. HELLO? Can we say incredibly unprofessional, risky, and not to mention, STUPID? She'd only known the man a week. The only thing that gets this book it's two star rating from me is the author's interesting vision of the future and flow of writing. Otherwise, she needs to choose different attributes for Eve. They don't mesh with her behavior. Very annoying to read."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I guess I'm going against the grain though I feel like I'm being generous with a two-star rating. Based on the other ratings I was expecting a lot more. Why two-stars? The story was incredibly predictable. I like at least a couple of twists and turns, and was hoping for a surprise ending, and..... nothing. The story was slow, way too much time on an incredibly predictable love story, (gee - tough, poor good-girl cop with a history gets incredibly wealthy, elusive, handsome guy who just can't seem to resist her - who woulda thought?!), unrealistic conversations, and not in a good fiction book way, the person who you think is the bad guy turns out to be, oh, the bad guy, too little action. I regretted the time I spent reading it and not just putting it down and instead waiting for at least a good ending. Sorry J.D., my first and only ever read of one of your books."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I was a fan of mystery novels before I stumbled upon Roberts &quot;Born In&quot; romance series. Loved the romance but by the 3rd book in the trilogy, I was pretty bored with romance alone. This series is the best thing I've ever stumbled upon. While you're enthralled in the romance, you're thinking &quot;who did it??&quot;, while you're enthralled in the mystery, you're thinking &quot;are they going to 'do' it??&quot; (ha ha). Not big in sci-fi, I could have done without the future, but it doesn't interfere enough for non-sci-fi fans, and actually adds a little flavor to the story.I cannot put these books down. I'm on the 3rd in the series, excited that there are about 15 more to go! At this pace, I'll probably have the whole series read by the end of next week!Die-hard mystery fans may be disappointed, as will die-hard romance fans.

I am not a person who thinks \\"Sex Sells\\" A Book or a Movie...and I normally avoid books with a lot of sex and bad language. They just aren't needed to entertain me.

I cannot really recommend this book."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"This is the one that started my obsession with this series but I didn't actually like this particular story, which is ironic to me because now, many books later I can't wait for the next to be out.One of the things that drew me to the series was knowing that if I liked it, there were so many (over 30 books and counting, not including the short stories) to read after this one. And that it took place in the future.I wasn't a Nora Roberts fan, I didn't (and don't) read romance novels, my main authors are Stephen King (who's quoted in EW as liking and considering future novel in the series \\"Born in Death\\" as \\"SVU in the Future,\\" something I kind of agree with), Dean Koontz, Patricia Cornwell, John Grisham, and Faye Kellerman, and I rarely stray from them. But when they couldn't keep up with my need to read, or changed how or what they wrote about, I started looking for new authors to read.My aunt recommended this series because of it's future/mystery aspect and it interested me enough to give this first book a try. I was determined to read them in order, she insisted it didn't matter, but I've learned along the way that it does matter if the little details matter. There are small mentions of past stories (or details from past stories) in future books, so if you haven't read any in the series yet, you definitely want to start with this first one.While I didn't love the first one, I did like it enough to keep keep reading, and 30+ books later I'm reading the latest and saddened to know there will be a waiting period before I can read the next.*** slight spoiler ***I started reading these back to back and initially got annoyed by the formulaic style, Eve always needing someone (Roarke usually) to come to her rescue and usually because she couldn't just wait for backup or take someone with her to investigate. So I'd alternate with some other author to keep it fresh and eventually the formula changes and alternates so every book didn't end the same way.*** end slight spoiler ***And the characters have grown and evolved with each book so it doesn't feel like you're reading the same story over and over again. I've grown to really likethem (the characters) and look forward to reading about them in each new book.While I haven't loved every story or every aspect of every story along the way, the series as a whole has kept my attention and I've grown to really look forward to when I can read more. Always happy to hear that a new one is coming out so I hope she never tires of writing this series."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I have heard many times about the In Death series by JD Robb, but I never had the opportunity to try it out, and I was daunted by the number of books already released (35) in this series. However, one day audible had a sale, and Naked In Death was on the list, I figured I would finally give it a try. Naked in Death hooked me in with the determined detective heroine, the intrigue of a murder investigation, the futuristic world, and of course, Roarke, the hard-edged billionaire who falls for the detective.I found the setting to be quite interesting and even believable, guns are out-dated, they are collectible only, lasers are the new weapon, communication devices include video, electronics work on voice command, and there are living communities on the moon and in space. What also relates more to this story is that prostitution has been legalized an regulated. Escorts have to take classes, be licensed, and be drug free. In return, there are no pimps and prostitution is considered a profession.When a Senator's granddaughter, who is a licensed prostitute, is murdered with an old fashioned gun, Lieutenant Eve Dallas is put on the case. There are challenges, twists, turns, and Eve has to confront her own past demons to solve this case. Warning: This case involves crimes of sexual nature, and is not always easy to read. J.D. Robb does an excellent job with this book, the emotions run high and the violence and gruesomeness to the murders is not sugar coated.And then, there's Roarke. Roarke is a rich, powerful man, he has a certain mystery to him, and he connects with Eve from the beginning. Several aspects of the case originally point to Roarke as a suspect, and Eve is torn between her personal beliefs and evidence of the case. Through it, Roarke remains strong, he can put up with Eve and understand her, and I loved the dynamic between them.Naked in Death is an excellent read. I am only sad that i didn't read this book and series sooner. I loved every minute of listening to Naked in Death, and I can't wait to read more books in this series. Romance readers, if you are like me and missed this series, you are missing out! I definitely recommend reading Naked In Death.*Note on the Audio* Naked in Death was narrated by Susan Ericksen, and she did a wonderful job. Since the book is futuristic, there were even some fun sounds she had to make, and she pulled it off. I really enjoyed her narration style and will listen to more books narrated by Susan Ericksen in the future. **"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I have never had much interest in reading mysteries. I am a reader who likes my books simple but fun. I don't like having to think too much while trying to enjoy a story. Little did I know that I was wrong. After hearing so much hype around this series by J.D. Robb -- who is actually Nora Roberts -- I finally caved and decided to venture into this genre of reading. I had to see what all the fuss was about and to finally figure out what all the other people were swooning about whenever 'Roarke' was uttered in a sentence.Lt. Eve Dallas is searching for a serial killer. A killer that takes enjoyment in killing licensed prostitutes while playing mind games with the police is just the tip of the iceberg in this story. While Eve is trying to pin down who the killer is, she is also dealing with other cases, political personnel who think they are owed their undivided attention, and a suspect who is quickly becoming a person of interest in her personal life. Now granted, I guessed the killer early on but it still was a surprise to discover I was actually right! I also found that the mystery part of the book wasn't at all difficult to follow along with. The author did a wonderful job of only revealing certain things at certain times to keep the reader second guessing.Now lets talk about Roarke. Hotness has entered the pages and taken over this readers imagination! Roarke demands attention and leaves you wanting more. I couldn't wait until Roarke stepped into a scene in the book because he brings Eve to life and leaves the reader drooling. He is smart, rich, sexy and has an accent -- the ultimate reader fantasy! Eve struggles not only with personal reasons in letting Roarke into her life, but she also deals with job fallout as well when they get hot and heavy. I was cheering for Eve and Roarke the whole time and I loved how Eve finally opened up to him. I can't help but think that Eve still has a bunch of history to work out in future books involving her past. I also can't wait to learn more about Roarke's past as well.I admit that my review is a little scarce on the plot, but I am worried about giving too much away in case you haven't read it yet. I will tell you that there are some amazing side characters as well and that the main characters will keep you interested up until the end. I am now a new fan of romantic suspense that author J.D. Robb obviously knows how to write. Bring on the next book because it is going to be a fun ride to read about!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I picked this book up and read the back cover as I am alway intereste in cop mysteries. When I read that it was set in the future I wasn't sure I would like it but picked it up anyway. Wow was this book well worth the read. It is extremely well written and keeps your interest from begining to end. It is not predictable as many are. This is why I stopped reading Mary Higgens Clark as I could figure out the killer by the middle of the book. This book is a must buy if you are interest in cop mysteries as it is so well written that it makes the future believable. I couldnt put it down."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"This book combines Nora Roberts wonderful, sexy romances with a good solid mystery novel. I love how strong Eve, the lead female character is. And how she is not made perfect and beautiful, but flawed and vulnerable like the rest of us. Of course Roarke is exquisite, as all fantasy men should be. I enjoyed the byplay between all the characters and I love the mystery aspects. I own all of the series so far and have been rarely disappointed. If you love this one you will love them all. Nora Roberts keeps each book fresh and moving by not repeating ANYTHING. Be that plot line or love scene."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Naked in DeathI enjoyed this book immensely! I started the J.D.

Her futuristic crime solving techniques and Eve Dallas' life with Roarke have always kept me entertained."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Having read about a half dozen Roberts books of very mixed quality, this is definately my favorite so far. It starts out with the murder of a prostitute, who also happens to be the granddaughter of a conservative senator. The killer has left a note, \\"One of Six\\", suggesting a serial killer. Eve Dallas is on the case, and more bodies pop up. While investigating the case, Dallas falls in love with a mysterious businessman known only as Roarke.This time, Roberts doesn't waste any time on irrelevant subplots. The story starts from page one and keeps its pace throughout. The romance does not feel gratuitous as in some romantic suspense novels; it's well connected to the main plot. \\"Naked in Death\\" is a quick, entertaining read for romance and (non-romance) mystery readers alike."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"30+ dollars for a set of CD's that my wife would have to swap and keep track of......no way.This title was on ONE (1) MP3 Cd, and was easily copied (no copy protection) to my wife's MP3 player and she was listeing to the entire book at night as she worked.

It's all about a homicide detective named Lt. Eve Dallas and how she goes about solving a case which always seems imposibble to solve at first."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I discovered this series with \\"Divided in Death,\\" and the first time I read that book, I had a lot of quibbles with it. As I mention ad nauseam, I go back about 45 years with speculative fiction, a category that the Eve Dallas series can fit into quite nicely. After a second read, the book began to make more sense to me, and I decided to read the series from the beginning.\\"Naked in Death\\" is, indeed, the beginning, the first book by Nora Roberts as J.D. Robb, featuring Lieutenant Eve Dallas and billionaire Roarke (he uses the single name only). The publisher bills these books as \\"romantic suspense\\" or \\"romantic mystery.\\" I would dub them, police procedural / police action / rocky relationship / semi-speculative fiction, with more than a touch of explicit sex. I guess I'm getting old, but if you're not up for some heavy sex action between Dallas and Roarke, you had better steer clear of this series.Roberts/Robb has set the series in NYC, beginning in 2058. Prostitutes are now Licensed Companions, and after the terrors of the Urban Wars in the early 21st century, NYPD is now the New York Police and Security Department. Guns have been banned, but they somehow still managed to be used in the commission of crimes. Our Lieutenant is a ten-year vet of the force, having pulled herself up from a childhood of physical and sexual abuse, which she remembers only dimly at first. She was found broken and bloody in Dallas, Texas, and thus the social agencies named her with something less than cleverness (shades of Sam Francisco from \\"Alien Nation.\\"). Dallas joined the Police Academy as soon as she was old enough, and by the time of this story is considered a top Homicide investigator at the aptly named Cop Central.I highly recommend that any interested reader start with the first volume, and (if you stick with the series) continue in the order of publishing. Roberts/Robb develops her characters and situations as she goes, including the ups and downs of commitment-phobic Eve and commitment-determined Roarke. After I had read the first few books, the things that bothered me about \\"Divided in Death\\" became more clear.I believe this series is an attempt to fuse the romance, action and SF genres, and I think it is doing a good job of it. Give the first one a try: you might just decide to stay."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"If you like sex, murder and a really good mystery, the 'In Death' Series is a one of a kind. This series is a must-have for anyone who likes to solve a good mystery and enjoy a really juicy story. Here we have Eve Dallas, a Homocide cop for the NYPD. Her character is so real and compelling you can't help but fall in love with her, even with her rough-around the edges, no-nonsense attitude. She's tough, strong and deadly and out to save New York from the sickos of the world, on and off planet. Set in the midst of a futuristic world in the year 2058, our story begins when a dead woman's body is found, along with a piece of evidence that leads Eve Dallas to the powerful and darkly sexy Roarke, an Irish billionare who is the richest man on and off the planet, literally. They find themselves thrown together by fate, unwillingly, when more eveidence and leads bring them closer together. The chemistry between these two is hot and spicy enough to make you steamy beneath your collar the entire story. So keep a fan handy! You're gonna need it.This book was the beginning of a wonderful series that I proudly own all of the books to so far(except for one, Orgin in Death) and strongly suggest to anyone tired of the same fluff and nonsense, grab this book and prepare yourself for the ride of your life!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I pick up two of these books because Nora Roberts is the author of these futuristic books.

She was very smart, fearless and dedicated to fighting crime. Having suffered sexual abuses in her past, she had built a fortress around her emotions and the author was effective in portraying her that way, reflected in the way she spoke and handled situations. Chemistry between Eve and Roarke was great and Roarke was so sweet and patient with Eve. The crime in this book was quite dark."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"This is the first in a series of books that I just love to read... and read and read.

With 'Naked in Death', the first book of the 'In Death Series', the reader is immediately led into the scene and the action, and introduced to the primary characters. Front of stage, with star billing, is Lieutenant Eve Dallas of the New York Police Department. Eve, a product of a fractured childhood and of her time, is committed to her job of protecting the public. Uneasy about building relationships, she is, nevertheless, intensely loyal to her few friends.Set in the future, circa 2060, there are new systems of transport, new governments - even off planet, new weapons - guns are banned. But the reader is not overwhelmed by these, they are ancillary to the plot and don't challenge reality as we know it.The hook that catches the reader's attention is the intensity of the relationships and the speed of the action, and is likely to appeal to both sexes.Crime is interwoven with romance in such a way that the reader is mesmorised and it is impossible to put the book down.Having read the first in the series, it will become imperative to read them all.I'm certainly hooked.JudyC."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"As a fan of Nora Roberts (aka J.

RobbBerkley ~ July 1995Brilliance Audio ~ 2008Narrator Susan Ericksen4 Stars! ~~~ This is a futuristic murder mystery with a great cast of characters and scorching chemistry between the hero and heroine!First off, I'd like to commend the narrator, Susan Ericksen! She did a phenomenal job reading this book and kept me intrigued and riveted from the beginning. Through Ms. Ericksen's talent I was easily able to distinguish the characters as her nuances brought them alive. Now, to the story. I'm a lover of intrigue and mystery, so I'm not sure how I managed to miss this series when it first started in 1995. Just a note though, there is graphic violence. Eve Dallas is a flawed heroine whose experiences as a child weigh heavy on her as an adult. She's passionate about her job and though she is hardened by her experiences she's not totally numb like she'd prefer to be. Roarke is a perfect match for Eve. He often crosses the line of the law, but never in a sinister way. He's a bit of a rogue and a definite charmer! The love scenes are hot and the emotion though often intense, is also tender. The mystery was very well written, as were the details of the not so distant future. I'm very much looking forward to listening to book two in this series."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"i love j.d. robb i own every in death book they put in audio form. i wish it was unabridged but then you cant have it all.

Very close to \\"erotic\\" sex scenes. Interesting twist and turns and the technology is believable as its not so far out fantasy feeling being in her world of a future detective! I give it 4 stars as the sex scenes could have been toned down a bit and left a little to the imagination!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"In 2003ish I stumbled across a few of these and was immediately addicted. Over the space of a few years I finally collected them all, and I have been buying them as they come out since then. This is the first book in the series, and I first read it back in 2005 - and I haven't read it since. I forgot how much I enjoyed it. If you're just getting into this series I highly recommend reading them in order, as characters are introduced and gain importance as the series progresses and I feel you get more from it if you meet the characters and see their progression rather than starting with them later on.This series is set in the future, but it's not really all that futuristic - some of the laws are different (i.e. prostitution is legal, guns are illegal, \\"professional mothers\\" exist etc), and some of the technology is obviously a bit different, but it's easy to forget it's set in the future. I honestly enjoy that aspect; it's amusing to me to think how expensive coffee and steak (etc) might be in the future, and so on. Essentially these are your run of the mill murder mysteries; if you like Grafton, Paretsky, O'Shaughnessy, etc etc you'll enjoy these. The only thing that gets old is the sex, which starts to wear thin later in the series (at least for me), but JD Robb is Nora Roberts, and I assume she can't help it and/or wants to hold her original fan base's interest. Either way it's easy to get past it if you enjoy the stories, which I do.She really develops the characters over time, and adds new ones as she goes - the stories don't get stale even later in the series. We see the characters grow individually and together, and it's really enjoyable. Yes, sometimes they seem a bit repetitive and/or over done, but so do most mystery series with the same protagonist. It was a delight to reread the introduction of several of my favorite characters, although I have to admit that one character (Charles Monroe) does not really jive with his later appearances in the books. However, that really is a minor detail.If you enjoy murder mysteries and series where you can follow the growth of the characters, this series is for you. It remains one of my favorites 20+ books later (nearly 30 now, I think); I always look forward to a new book being released and I am thrilled to finally have a chance to reread some of the older ones. I thoroughly enjoyed rereading this one."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Have not read any books published in the name of Nora Roberts, but certainly will after this! As J D Robb, Ms Roberts writes with wit and style and this work is an excellent amalgam of suspense, mystery and romance set in a futuristic time frame. Eve Dallas is a no nonsense sassy detective and Roarke is the proverbial bad boy made (in this case, exceptionally) good, handsome, caring and clever. The plot is nicely twisted and humour througout is irreverent and appealing. A good read!Glory in Death (In Death, Book 2)"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"If you love the \\"In Death\\" series you can now listen to it while you hike, work, drive.

I am also into police/crime dramas and this book has great stories in it. This book has it all, the right mix between excitement, drama, comedy, science fiction, and romance. I can't wait to read the rest!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Lieutenant Eve Dallas should be on leave. Having just tied up a case that resulted in the death of a child, and Eve shooting the murderer, all she needs now is rest and recuperation. But there's no such luck for Lieutenant Dallas when a high-profile politician's granddaughter is murdered. The case is complicated by Sharon DeBlass's profession - high-class escort - and a note left beneath the body promising \`ONE OF SIX'.The case is made all the more baffling for the murder weapon used - an old-fashioned Smith & Wesson gun; an archaic museum piece since the gun-ban was initiated, but also a vital clue since only the wealthiest of collector's can now afford such a relic.Eve's investigations lead her to Rourke, an Irish-born millionaire living in New York who had close ties to Ms DeBlass's family and an interest in bygone weaponry. But upon meeting the dark-haired, whiskey-tongued Roarke, Eve is convinced he's no murderer. Or at least, she hopes he's not - otherwise this attraction and fevered wanting she feels would be a problem for both of them ...\`Naked in Death' is the first book in Nora Robert's (writing as JD Robb) \`In Death' romantic crime-thriller series, which began in 1995. The series is currently thirty-three books deep, with a 34th book scheduled for 2012, and it's entirely likely that the series will continue well beyond that ...I really didn't want to like this book. Oh, sure, I'd had this series recommended to me time and time again and was assured that I'd love them. People would utter the name \`Roarke' with almost biblical reverence and be positively horrified if I dared admit to never having read a single one of JD Robb's books. But still, I really didn't want to like this book, because liking this book would mean reading the series. A series that, as of 2012, will have 34 books to its credit. I knew if I read one and got hooked, I'd have to read them all (and my to-be-read pile is toppling as is!). So, like I said, I really didn't want to like this book ... but damned if Roarke & Robb didn't reel me in, hook, line and sinker.Robb's \`In Death' series is set in the future, in the year 2058. Inter-planetary travel is now possible, food is delivered by AutoChef, books come on discs (paperbacks are now viewed in museums), guns have been banned for a number of years and prostitution is legalized and regulated. These are just a few of the subtle futuristic scene-setters that are casually dropped throughout the book, and I quite liked that the sci-fi aspect was very low-key. Robb doesn't pull focus to the futuristic setting so much as she integrates it into the story, which I was pleased about since the future-setting had me a little irked when I read it in the blurb. I'm still not 100% sure why the book had to be set in the future, except that things like the antiquity of the murder weapon (a standard issue Smith & Wesson) and legalized prostitution leaked into the murder investigation and put an interesting spin on the crime.The real draw-card of the book (and I suppose, the series) is the characters of Eve and Roarke. Eve Dallas is a tough cop with a black past. On paper she sounds like a stereotype, but Robb has written Eve with many sides. She's stubborn and perceptive, tough but feminine. She's very much a lone wolf, but with inner scars that have her yearning for company and understanding. I liked Eve instantly; when we meet her she's coming off the tail-end of a child murder which resulted in Eve killing a deranged criminal. She's in a very fragile state of mind, but the instant she sees Sharon DeBlass's butchered body, she's on board this new murder investigation and wholly committed. I liked that she was so dedicated to the dead - Eve really sees this job as showing respect to those victims, and getting them justice in death.Because of Eve's rather fragile psyche when the book begins, she is utterly railroaded by murder suspect Roarke. Just \`Roarke' - a millionaire enigma with a criminal past but high-society presence. Roarke is painfully handsome, with an Irish lilt and a sharp mind. As much as Eve is amazed at her instant attraction to Roarke, he is even more shocked at his fascination with her. As Roark admits, he doesn't have much love for cops, but Eve with her awful shag haircut, whisky hair and sorrowful eyes has him lulled and lustful.As promised, Roarke is incredible. Even better is his and Eve's instant attraction and coupling. This is, obviously, one of the reasons Robb's series is so beloved. Unlike practically every other crime series with a dash of romance, Robb's will-they-or-won't-they is put to bed early on, instantaneous and highly flammable. The real interest of the series will come from how Eve and Roarke will cope with their sudden and unexpected presence in one another's lives.I know that Nora Roberts's forte is romance - as evidenced by the dark and dashing Roarke, and his simmering romance with Eve. So I wasn't overly shocked or too disappointed to read that the criminal side of things in \`Naked in Death' aren't quite on par with other crime books. The \`whodunit' mystery is wrapped up in a fairly obvious, if disturbing way. Eve's investigation is more paint-by-numbers than harrowing thriller. Fair enough, I wasn't expecting Karin Slaughter-levels of criminality. Clearly the focus of the \`In Death' series is the romance between Eve and Roarke, it's crime-lite romance-centric, and since I knew that going in, I wasn't baffled or annoyed by the lack."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"What more could you want in a great book. This is the first in the best series I have ever read. It has it all and then some. To me this book was one I was unable to put down until I was finished. I was not dissapointed, in fact it just made me look forward to reading the next in the series. If you enjoy a good Mystery/Murder/and even some romance you will love this book."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"This was a mildly entertaining book. The author seemed to spend most of her time describing various sexual acts and not enough plotting. It appears to be lazily written, with things such as naming the futuristic weapon &#34;a weapon&#34;. I desperately tried to enjoy this book, but did not. Two stars is a bit generous."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I have long been aware of the commercial success of author Nora Roberts but the storylines and writing style (a genre often characterized as romantic suspense with apparent emphasis on the romance) have never tempted me to read any of her work. However, I happened to pick up a copy of volume #21 (depending on how you count anthology inclusions) in the .... IN DEATH series written under the pen name J.D. Robb and was immediately intrigued by its premise of a futuristic police procedural series (the year is 2058) with a strong central character (Detective Lieutenant Eve Dallas) who had a continuing romantic interest (the mysterious Irish billionaire Roarke). I have long enjoyed the Spenser series by Robert Parker and the ensemble cast of Ed McBain's 87th Precinct novels; the reward of finding another such series to enjoy would only be increased by some speculation thrown into the mix regarding the future direction of science in the aid of police work as well speculation concerning the evolution of New York City, an area very familiar to me. I was immediately hooked by SURVIVOR IN DEATH and despite some minor criticisms gave it a five star review (3/30/2005). I read ORIGIN IN DEATH, the next book in the series, as soon as it was released and also enjoyed it sufficiently to rate it five stars as well (7/26/2005). As with other series which I have enjoyed, I then decided to read some of the earlier books to fill in the backstory and see how the characters have evolved. From my perspective, there is good news and bad news in that regard.Among the positives were a plot which was somewhat interesting; the aspects of the book that could be described as a police procedural were quite well done. Second, the story obviously familiarized me with the initial confrontation between Dallas and Roarke that developed into their current relationship. Third, I was pleased to discover that several of the characters whom I had met were an integral part of the series since it's initial installment- these include the irrepressible Mavis Freestone, electronics specialist Feeney, the psychologist Dr. Mira, Roarke's man Summerset and Captain Whitney. Fourth, I chose to listen to the audio CD and Susan Ericksen's narration was extremely well done. (Although one disconcerting note was having a female narrator, appropriately chosen to reflect the gender of the main character, reading detailed and very graphic descriptions of the mutilated bodies of the killer's female victims.) Finally, a lot of the futuristic touches were realistic enough to add a lot of fun and yet helped the author to develop the story and Lt. Dallas to solve the crimes.Among the negative aspects, I did not particularly enjoy the depiction in such graphic detail of the violence and the great deal of sexual content (with regard to the crimes themselves and also other details of the basic plot, Dallas and Roarke's relationship, and the lives of many of the characters in the book). However, my primary criticism is that this initial story in the series is clearly a transition novel which has two relatively serious flaws. In Robb's effort to establish Roarke and Dallas as the main characters of a continuing series, she rushes them into a relationship whose slower development would have added immeasurably to the story. Second, in what appears to be an attempt to attract the fans of Nora Roberts to her new series, she blends two genres both of which suffer as a result. There are scenes of passion much more suitable for a Harlequin romance than a police procedural, and they mean that the flow of the detective story is also disrupted unnecessarily. In addition, the personal conflicts which both Roarke and Eve face as their out-of-character (for both of them) relationship develops can't really be adequately addressed given the constraints of the author's other objectives.The plot is very simple: a conservative Senator's daughter is murdered and her body left in a pose which suggests that the killer is both meticulous and wants attention. And the note found next to the body suggests that great urgency attaches to a rapid solution of the crime; the note reads ominously 1 OF 6. The publicity is particularly unwelcome because the victim's occupation is \\"licensed companion\\"; a choice which despite its legality by the mid-twenty first century has still caused her well known family considerable embarrassment. The political pressure on the police quickly intensifies as subsequent murders occur and clues seem to link the mysterious Roarke to the crimes. Nevertheless, while the eventual outcome of the investigation is gradually foreshadowed, there are enough surprising details to keep the story interesting.If you plan to read the series, I strongly suggest starting with this book even though it was inferior to the two later books which I have read. The later books include details concerning the mysteries of Roarke's and Dallas' childhood backgrounds and the impact on their individual lives which provide a context that I would have preferred to have gradually unfold as I completed the series in the sequence which the author intended, rather than be in the possession of subsequently revealed knowledge which influenced my reaction to this story. And certainly, if you want a romance/detective story then read this book. However, if you only plan to sample a few stories in the series, then I strongly suggest that you skip this book and concentrate on some of the later novels, including either of the two which I mention at the beginning of this review. The characters and their relationships are much more developed as the series progresses and the plots are also more complex. Meanwhile, I plan to continue to pursue the dual goal of reading each of the new releases as they occur while gradually filling in my knowledge of Dallas' past cases.Tucker Andersen"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"A cop in 2058 New York? Bring on the gadgets! Eve Dallas is a good character, and if Ms. Roberts wasn't a romance novelist this could have been a heck of a series. But since she is, she brings in Roarke, the mysterious Daniel Day-Lewis clone Irish billionaire (yeah, I bet New York street cops run into them EVERY day), who proceeds to promptly destroy any credibility Ms. Roberts had going with the story. As much as I hate to admit it, I've read every book in the series (before I gave up reading romance and &quot;romantic suspense&quot; in disgust). All you'll get is futuristic gadgetry combined with mundane murders and pedestrian sex scenes. Hey, Nora, just a bit of advice--even the most in-love couples don't have mind-blowing sex every time. Bottom line--Nora Roberts fans will and do adore this series, others beware!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I was running out of books to check out and try when I happened upon the mystery section of the bookstore I go to. I don't usually go for mystery novels, but after reading some reviews of J.D. Robb's (aka Nora Roberts) books here on Amazon, I decided to give Ms. Robb's book a try.I know I've said that mystery novels are not really my cup of tea, romance is not even remotely in the same ballpark. I always picture romance novels as thin paperbacks with half-naked, beautiful people on the covers. I was surprised to know that I was hooked on Ms. Robb's Naked In Death novel from the first chapter all the way to the end. I enjoyed the perfect blend of crime-mystery and sexy romance from her novel's two main characters.NYPSD Lt. Eve Dallas is one of the better female characters I've ever had the chance to read. Eve is both a tough-as-nails police detective and also very feminine though she would be the last person to think so. Its this duality in her personality that attracts rogue Irish bilionaire Roarke (the cool characters always can get away with using just a single name) to Eve. The attraction seems very unusual at first, especially since Roarke can get and have any woman he wishes, but as the story progresses some hints as to why he's attracted comes out in the open.The mystery part of the novel is very well-done, even though Roarke being a suspect in the beginning seems like a convenient way to get the two characters together. The heat from their initial meeting shows that Ms. Robb can write scenes of romance and conflict and make both look very steamy. I don't know which I enjoyed reading more, the scenes where Eve and Roarke finally have sex or their constant baiting each other to react, but both were written with enough heat and chemistry to make the book a must-read.Ms. Robb's first novel in her In Death series, Naked In Death, is a wonderful and fun novel. It should appeal to others who are not just romance novel readers. The scenes of romance and sensual, steamy sex is a big bonus. The novel overall is engaging and well-written for other genre fans to enjoy."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I bought 20+ books in this series not knowing much about them but after reading all the reviews thought they would be terrific. I found this book to be slow and not as futuristic as I was hoping for, although there is a lot of sex and sex crimes. I have started the second book and find myself putting it down looking for something else to read. Looks like it will take me a long time to get through all those books I purchased."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"In my experience, romance writers that turn suspense haven't turned out all that great. I took a chance on the In Death series and I am so glad I did. This book hooked me from the first page!Taking place in 2058, Lt. Eve Dallas thought she has seen everything in her profession as a cop. When Eve is put on a case for a murder victim, what is shocking is how the victim is killed. Only the very wealthy can afford to collect antique weapons, which include any type of gun. Gun's were banned around 2020, and are very expensive to aquire. This helps her narrow down her suspects. All the evidence soon points to Roarke, a billionaire. Eve is soon drawn into a case that hits too close to home, laying her emotions bare. Soon the desire flowing between her and Roarke is too much to deny and Eve finds herself in a relationship with her prime suspect.The outcome of the book is surprising, but not shocking. The relationship between Eve and Roarke is intense and emotional. Due to both their pasts, they have a hard time opening up to anyone, but find that with each other, they might be able to. Again, this was a great book and I look foward to reading the rest in the series."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I knew I'd love this book because I pretty much love anything written by Nora Roberts (aka JD Robb) but this surprised me. Science Fiction, romance, mystery -- well, those are my favorite genres by one of my favorite authors. Now, I just have to figure out how I can afford ALL the others!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"With NAKED IN DEATH, author J.D. Robb (better known to the world as Nora Roberts) introduces tough-as-nails New York City Homicide detective Lieutenant Eve Dallas. A serial killer announces his intent via a note left at a grisly murder scene: one of six. It is Eve&#65533;s job to stop this madman from achieving his ultimate goal. Her prime suspect for the first murder? Roarke, an Irish multimillionaire who was the first victim&#65533;s date the night she was killed. True to fashion in the romantic-suspense genre, Eve is mysteriously drawn to Roarke the instant she lays eyes on him -- in a computer-generated photo, no less. Roarke is equally captivated by the determined detective -- to the extent that he keeps a button that fell from her suit jacket during their first meeting.Can these two strong-willed people find their way to each other and solve the case? The answer is a resoundingly obvious yes, but the way their relationship is born and plays out is infinitely satisfying. These two are constantly in the public eye, Roarke for his business dealings and social whirl, and Eve for the prominence of her cases, and it is interesting to see how they manage their relationship. Eve has her dark side, too, in that she has vague memories of an extremely sadistic, drunken, abusive father. Her unwillingness to let anyone into that part of her life is matched by Roarke&#65533;s determination to not be shut out.Perhaps not to other readers, but to me, the murderer practically jumped off the pages the second I encountered his character. The fact that the mystery was so obvious despite the feeling I got that Robb was trying to keep readers in suspense was offset by the sheer imagination of the world Eve lives in. Yes, she&#65533;s a cop trying to solve a series of murders -- but she&#65533;s a cop trying to solve a series of murders in the year 2058. This little twist opens up a whole new sense of wonder: at how much is different yet how much remains the same. Little things, or seemingly little things, have changed, making the world vastly different: cars have vertical lift, humans live much longer due to the invention of the cancer vaccine, real coffee is hard to come by due to the destruction of the tropical forests, the basics of crime forensics are exceptionally advanced, and people have colonized other planets. Still, so much remains the same, including the unending capacity for human cruelty and the intricacies of man-woman relationships.The world of Eve Dallas was a fascinating place to visit, and I have quickly become addicted to this series. Highly recommended for Nora Roberts fans as well as romantic suspense fans and even people just looking for something slightly different than what they normally read."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I really love this series, the first three are my favorites because it is the beginning of the relationship between Eve Dallas and Rourke.

Eve is just getting over a tragic accident that happened while on the job, when she is pulled into a high profile case involving a young woman and her death.As Eve works on the case of how Sharon DeBliss was killed, this is where she starts to realize that the person who killed Sharon left a calling card that said one of six. Eve hopes that she will be able to catch the killer before the killer kills 6 woman.Eve works on figuring out how the killer acquired old guns and how he is able to kill without anyone knowing who this person is and how he is able to slip between the cops and deliver document to Eve that shows her the graphic murders. This is where Eve meets Roarke a man who is very rich and seems to have a link to the case.As she interviews Roarke she finds that his man could be a possible suspect, but Eve allows herself to become involved with Roarke and that is where she learns that Roarke might not be the man she had first assumed he might be.As time goes on and more murders happen, Eve is out to catch the killer and she will do anything to catch him.This was a great first book in the series; I hope the rest of the books are as good as this one."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Today's fiction market isn't kind to writers who try to combine genres in their books. The &quot;in Death&quot; series is a wonderful exception -- occurring, no doubt in part, due to the track record of writer Nora Roberts. Aren't we lucky to have something so unusual as a mix of mystery/romance/science fiction and have it be a fun read.This is the first book in the popular series. I've read a few of the others and wish I'd read this one first. The mystery in each book stands alone but this book explains a great deal about what motivates Eve Dallas. It's also fun to read about how she and Rourke get together (even if he's far more overbearing than most real women would stand)."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I was told that this was a romance/mystery/thriller set in the future-as I have never been hot to read those particular combinations together I waited. Even when I heard that Nora Roberts is JD. Then with nothing laying about to read I picked this up-and NEVER put it down. I think about what will happen with Eve and Roarke next....Just ordered the entire rest of the series..."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"This is truly an outstanding book. Well written and highly entertaining, it is more than your typical whodunit. The plot is well developed and the use of the futuristic setting lends much to the story. While not as cerebral (thank goodness) as some, Naked In Death holds one's interest in a strong grip. Truly one of the best I've read in a long time."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I was unable to put this book down until I read the last word. Even then, I didn't want it to end.

Eve Dallas is REAL!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I've been a big fan of Nora Roberts for several years and haunt the bookstores for all of her latest releases. I was delighted to find this new series of detective/mystery stories and have read each and every one of them. Ms Roberts takes the typical fictional P.I., complete with major rough edges, and infuses her with vulnerabilities, so that she is so much more than what we have come to expect from fictional female &quot;eyes&quot;. Over the course of these books, Eve Dallas grows as a person. I hope Ms Roberts never stops writing Eve's story, because I'll never tire of reading it."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I have to give this book 4 stars. High enough to show that I indeed enjoyed the plot and the suspense, but no final 5th star for Dallas herself. For a book under the Romance genre, I was pleased to find that this book had a forward moving plot with good guys and bad guys and twists in the story. This was more a glorified police procedural than a drippy romance. That I liked. But I found Dallas, our cop, to be a bit too hard around the edges. Too much swearing and trying to be a male-wanna-be. Please Ms Roberts/Robb ... for those of us who are strong women, please don't portray the need for profanity and extreme rudeness as methods to get ahead in this world. Her &quot;character&quot; would be unbecoming in either a man *or* a woman. Good thing Roarke was around for the passion and compassion in this book."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I have been a fan of Nora Roberts for some time, and was running out of books to read when I found her J.D. Robb series. I stayed up half the night finishing &quot;Naked In Death.&quot; This book is engrossing and unique. One of the best things about this book is how she blends life in a futuristic society seamlessly into the plot, where most futuristic books overwhelm the plot by focusing too heavily on the hi-tech stuff. I can't wait to read the next book in this series.NOTE TO READER IN WASHINGTON STATE: Nora Roberts started writing for Silouhette NOT Harlequin."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Mystery takes place in the future, complete with some inovative new products.

Robb I had to try this first book. Then, after finishing it, I had to run out and get them all! The characters are intense, fully developed and the plot had me guessing.

That's it. That's actually alot, when there's nothing out there to read for someone who likes romance and action. But the whole \\"In Death\\" series is good only for the frequent smirks you get from a really good smart ass comment. AS usual, Roberts has created an allegedly \\"strong\\" woman character who 1) Allows the hero to do whatever the heck he wants 2) Can't deal with a stressful situation without having an attack of the vapors and 3) emotes all over the place with the slightest provocation. Roberts has never created a strong female character. Amusing, yes. Strong, resilient, mature....No way! I read her because she can piece a story together, and 99.9% of the other published authors cannot. But I always end up angry at myself. I'm a romance book lover, contantly looking for readable books, and failing so very often that I have to lower my standards sometimes if I want to indulge my love of the written word. And the pity of it is, Roberts could no doubt do much better in this regard. She can write. She just chooses to write about ninnies."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"As is my way, I leave the plot recap to others. It takes too much time, especially when I have so many other important things to address. I read this book at the prompting of a friend, after I had recommended a book to her. This, she said, was a great series. Hm... I won't disabuse her of the opinion of the series, as I haven't read any other books in it. But this book was, unfortunately, just average. And, also unfortunately, too predictable. And involved waaaay too many odors. I'm not sure WHY there were so many odors, but it definitely stood out to me (and I appear, of course, to be the only one to notice).As is also my way, I must give examples:The bottle of scent on the dresser was exclusive, and smelled, after a quick sniff, like expensive sex.The air smelled of flowers and pampered flesh.The quiet sound of birdsong and breezes sweetened the air.\\"She...\\" He gestured grandly. \\"Exuded sex as others might exude an expensive perfume.\\"\\"She drew people to her...\\" He searched for a suitable metaphor, used the corner of the scarf again. \\"Like an exotic and fragrant flower.\\"Slickly handsome in a black silk robe, and smelling seductively of sex, Charles smiled engagingly.The discomfort helped distract her from the misery of headstones and the smell of cold, fresh earth.The steam rising from her cup smelled like heaven.She hated to admit even to herself that the tobacco smelled enticing. (and in the same section, though not about smell, was THIS winner -- \\"The tobacco burned expensively between his long, elegant fingers.\\" How does expensive burn?)Mavis Freestone whirled in, a jangle of bracelets, a puff of scent.But Eve had already scented it, already - despite herself - begun to smile.And just a few lines later: Eve brought the bag to her face and sniffed deep.She could smell it, as ripe and sour as the vegetable hash that was today's special.From the smell that had greeted her outside, someone had died out there recently, or the recycle trucks hadn't been through in the last week.Her guide was silent on the ride up and exuded a discreet whiff of sensible scent that matched her sensible shoes and neat, sleek coif.There as a sharp, spicy scent from a bank of dianthus, blooming in shades of rose and vivid purple.However glorious the scent, they failed to stir her appetite.\\"I'm going to follow my nose.\\"So far her nose was just fine.She could smell them: water, bad fish, and old sweat.The room smelled of blood, of urine, of burned food.It was, as she'd suspected, floral in scent and flavor.The scent of brewed flowers lingered in the air.It was foolish to be susceptible to his hands over hers, the press of his body, the smell of him.Thoughtfully he blew out a fragrant stream of smoke.A room filled with violence, the smell of gunsmoke still stinking the air, and weapons still within reach.She could smell flowers and felt the give of carpet under her feet.\\"I'm going to enjoy smelling my soap on you.\\" (Oh, and this line: \\"...that had an orgasm shivering through her like gold.\\" -- how does gold shiver????)From another fount he drew pale green soap that smelled of wild forests.You knew this time, she thought, how it would feel, how she'd look, how the blood would smell.She leaned closer, looked into Joe's surprised and staring eyes, sniffed the pie.Hetta Finestein opened her door with a puff of lavender sachet and the yeasty smell of homemade bread.\\"Don't you so much as sniff this custard pie.\\"A short time later, Eve was in the kitchen, watching the cat sniff with delicate disdain at a bowl of food she'd unearthed...Unable to resist, she swung by the bench, leaned close enough to smell sour vomit.\\"He either knew it or smelled it.\\"She didn't feel awkward climbing back into her clothes with the scent of him clinging to her.She could smell his breath on her face, sweet, like candy.and finally:\\"It's tea, a whiff of whiskey.\\"WOW! That's a lot of focus on aroma, don't you think? Perhaps Ms. Robb/Roberts could start using another sense? (Or scent? ha!)On another note, I figured out the \\"whodunit\\" part by page 60. The \\"gadgets\\" were barely more technical than what's available now, except for the flying cars. Although they DID promise me flying cars! ;) The dialogue was decent and I did laugh a couple of times. While I don't think the use of \\"the f-word\\", as another reviewer put it, was excessive, it was more than twice as someone else claimed.I agree that Eve was NOT the strong, assertive person she was described as. On the other hand, I don't think Roarke was as terrible as some people seem to think. It would take a guy like him to get through to a girl like her. The sex was a lot for such a short book, but I don't really mind that. They were about a 5 on a 1-10 scale of hot, though. Would have preferred something a bit more... sensual.As a forensic science/crime wonk, I was terribly frustrated, if not downright disappointed, with the deduction and investigation side of the story. The mistakes in plot, the steps of the investigation in general, were basic. For example, Roarke is one of those uber-security conscious people, right (I mean, he owns a security company)? Well, did no one think that perhaps his property might have video surveillance that could provide him an alibi? Or that perhaps talking with the victim's family was kind of important and should happen before page 100?I've been assured that the series gets MUCH better as it moves on, and I hope that's the case. If it DOESN'T get better I would be concerned for the taste of these 5 star reviewers. There IS potential here, but really only if Robb/Roberts can do better with the mystery and investigative aspects of her story. Otherwise no matter how decent the writing, or even if I learned to like the characters a lot more, I would get extremely irritated with the books.Now if only the rest of the series isn't as focused on odors...Edited because someone pointed out that I didn't give enough examples of the forensic/investigative problems that I had with the book. Basically, I know that when someone is shot they don't go flying backwards (which was mentioned twice). I know that if you put paint all over your body, even when your skin can't \\"breathe\\" (which I didn't include in my \\"aroma\\" references), you won't suffocate. Mythbusters has shown that both of these ideas are false. :)I also caught SEVERAL bad editing mistakes (Eve was called \\"Even\\" in one spot, for example). With the clout that Nora Roberts must have, SURELY she could have a better editor by now."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Naked in death was the best book I ever read.

I was after a light read after a few heavy crime novels and JD Robb's novel hit the spot. Unfortunately, now I remember why I got into great crime novels..to get away from the romantic suspense novels, that are basically Mills &amp;Boon with a bit of crime thrown in to fill up the pages.I was able to read Naked In Death in a few hours, the plot is ok, nothing exciting but really, a billionaire that is still avaliable goes after a interesting looking cop, she has an affair with him &amp; her superior doesn't really mind..ok.A bit of realism wouldn't go astray, but then again, this is really just a bit of fluff to fill my Saturday lunchtime at work.I don't think that I will be getting another JD Robb book again unless I was completely bored and the library burnt down."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Putnam has set the price for older books in this series way too high.

I understand when newer books in series are offered the same price 7.99 for the kindle & paperback, I don't think it's right;but I do understand.

Great reading for these long Ohio winters!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"After reading Nora Roberts book, The \\" Witness\\", which I really liked, I thought I would see what J.D. Robb books were all about.They are very highly rated and I was curious. I am very glad that I only ordered the first title.The main character, Eve,is a female detective who is snippy, unethical, and not the sharpest tool in the drawer. The hero, so to speak, is an arrogant, self-indulgent, multi millionaire who seems to be determined to get Eve into his bed as fast as possible.This happens quite early on and the hot, steamy sex is very explicit. This book is described as a romantic thriller but I fail to see anything romantic about virtual strangers falling in bed together just because of mutual attraction. It appears that the sex portions of this book were written first and the rest of the book later to fit around them. The plot is thin, the killer obvious, and the excitement non-existent. For those people who think this is great American fiction, I have one suggestion---\\"Get A Life\\""},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I had to quit reading this book about 70 pages in. I had nothing else to read, but thought I would rather stare into space then keep reading it. This is the first and last time I will try this author. The scene setting is supposed to be in the future, but it takes awhile for the author to set that scene. The author is also trying to make the main character into this hard, but sexy detective and instead seems to try to hard. I wish I kept my money and bought something else."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"This is one of those books, that is fairly enjoyable, and then when the climax comes you realize this is just a way for the author to cram down his political correctness and anti-whitey propaganda down your throat.Another weakness is that the male protagonist is wealthy beyond belief, incredibly attractive, incredibly tall and lithe, and incredibly sensitive and intelligent. Think 'female victorian pseudo porn' with an lefty world view.I will skip JD Robb's other books."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I could only get through 10 pages and had to put this book down. Does every book nowadays have to be the lowest common denominator in sexual projections. In 10 pages I noted that the book was antigun, pro homosexual,and anti high moral standards. I hate it when obvious political ideaologies get stuffed down the readers throats. Don't waste your time!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I asked a friend for recommendations for a mindless beach read, and she suggested this series. I've suddenly lost a lot of respect for her. It goes beyond being a bad book, into downright offesive. What woman behaves this way? It seems assembled from off the shelf parts, by men sitting around a conference table, asking each other what women want."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I stumbled onto this book by pure accident. Not knowing what to expect, I was blown away. This series is written by Nora Roberts, writing as J. D. Robb. Although this book has romance in it, it's a story with substance and a kick that had me reading every book in the series. The setting is New York City in the year 2058. The main character is a strong woman both physically and mentally. When you walk into a bookstore, you'll see most of the books in the series displayed on the shelf. There's a reason for this- they're good. You should definitely read the series in order. Start with this one. It's the one that started it all."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"In the start of this series Robb depicts the New york of the future, where only rich people can drink real coffe, robots serve take care of household chores, cars fly and weapons are banned except for collectors...and a ruthless killer.Lieutenant Eve Dallas is in charge of finding the responsible for a series of murders of prositutes. It gets more complicated when she falls for Roarke, a millionaire and one of the main suspects in the investigation.

Set in the year 2058, Lt. Eve Dallas is a smart, tough, take no prisoners NYC homicide detective. Because of an abusive childhood that she only remembers nightmarish snatches of, she allows few people to get close to her. Working on a high profile murder case she meets Roarke, billionaire industrialist, sexy as sin, and number one suspect. Much to her chagrin, Roarke is not all intimidated by the Lt. and gives as good as he gets. The relationship between these two is the backbone of this series. When they're together, sparks fly. Highly intelligent and strong-willed, they're also vulnerable, both with a dark past that they haven't completely overcome. This futuristic series gets better with each book. The plots are totally believable. Robb doesn't overwhelm you high-tech wizardry. Eve and Roarke's characters get more developed in each story, as do the other characters, Peabody, McNabb, Dr. Mira, Mavis, Feeney, and Summerset. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I liked this story about a futuristic cop trying to solve crimes committed with technology from our time.

Oh well my mistake.Eve Dallas is a cop of the future who is thrust into an extremely high profile murder case before she is even done with the last case she was to finish up.In this case it includes \\"licensed companions\\" being murdered brutally. The murder has promised to kill 6 people in total and some how has dragged Dallas into it by sending her information as soon as they are happening. The first victim happens to be the astringed family member of a US Senator.Along comes Roarke who is not only a suspect but a very rich one that Eve feels attracted to against her better judgment.This is a very fast paced who done it. It is the first in the \\"Death series\\" by this author and I have already ordered the next 2."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I read the first three of these series before they hit the market in prereleases. And they blew me away. In this the first of the series, where we meet Eve Dallas - the woman who a bad history, protective of herself to the point of isolation, a lieutenant detective at Cop Central's homocide unit in the not so distant future. And Roarke, the do-die-for Irishman who now owns just about everything on this world and the next, and just so happens to be the lead suspect in Eve's murder investigation.All the trails point to Roarke, but Eve, who has protected herself all these years, finds there is no hiding from Roarke, the man who gets what he wants - and he wants Eve.Kudoos to Roberts for creating a cutting edge series that just gets better and better with each new addition."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"After reading this series disjointedly..before I got them in order, I think that this,the first is the most compelling. The sense of discovery combined with the begining of trust and romance between Dallas and Roarke is very touching. It sets the stage well for the future novels and defines the fragility of the characters as they begin their relationship."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I've read Nora Roberts for year and I'd never gotten around to reader her J.D. Robb books. Well I finally picked this one up at the bookstore and I was hooked. The switch on focus from romance to mystery is great. I enjoyed the daily problems in life in a futuristic society like the Autochef burning toast. The fact that she didn't finalize Eve and Roarke's relationship and made it an ongoing thing makes you want to read the next book. Eve's character is great. We need more tough female cop lead characters. Would recomend this to all Nora Roberts fans."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Of all of Nora Roberts' books this is my favorite. This entire series is awesome. This book introduces us to two remarkable people. Eve Dallas and Roarke. These two have had a rough go of it but have triumphed over countless problems. This book is the beginning of a great series."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"This book is one of the best I've ever read. It includes all the important elements to make it a great story. I love the romance between Eve and Roarke. She is at the top of her career and an important image in the public eye. Roarke is an attractive mutli-billionaire who any woman would want to date. Both of their exciting jobs help to keep the book thrilling. All throughout Eve and Roarke's relationship, murders are taking place and it's Eve's job to stop them. Roarke, who was once the main suspect, gives Eve inside information that helps the case. As Eve continues the search for the killer she finds out just how currupt people can be. The story goes through many twists and turns before you find out who the real killer is. I recommend this book to anyone, even people who don't like to read. It'll make a reader out of you."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I have read one Nora Roberts novel and I hated it. I read everything and eagerly await the new books by JD ROBB. Eve Dallas is the hard working everybody I would like to be. Her job and life have a personal meaning to her. Not always good or happy either. Meeting the right person throws her life in chaos and she struggles with the pessure of keeping her life together while she opens her heart. I love the slightly futuristic feel to the series.

You don't HAVE to read them in order, but this is the first one, and sets up some of the parameters for future books (relationships between characters, mostly).One of my favorite things is that the author doesn't inundate you with details about how the future looks different than the present, she unfolds the details a few at a time with appropriate spacing. None of it feels like you are reading a long description of an unfamiliar world.The mystery in this book is good and left me guessing. Because there is some sex in the book, I wouldn't recommend it for anyone under 16 (just a general guideline, obviously).I recommend this series if you like mysteries, a strong female lead character, stories set in the future, or well written books."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I special ordered because a friend had recommended this in order to understand the whole series.

The \\"tough as nails\\" cop that \\"truly cares\\", vacillating between steely eyed stares and crying \\"oh the humanity\\" at the violence she sees. And I could go on and on about how every man in the book is either a complete evil jerk except for two: Her assistant, who is ok because he does whatever she tells him to, and mister perfect, the billionaire who chases her around like a lost puppy.But let's move on to why I'm really writing. The money. At one point in the story it's a big deal that a guy spent $25,000 four times to shell out $100,000. That's a lot of money!In 1995.But the story takes place in 2058. Assuming 4% inflation per year that's about $2100 a time. Not really the \\"smoking gun\\" the characters make it sound like. This changes it from \\"that's more money than he makes in a year!\\" to \\"that's enough money to buy a decent used car!\\""},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"The book started off ok but then the reader discovers that Eve, the main character, is plagued by a very violent crime involving a little girl. Without giving too much away, I just found myself as a reader having a hard time getting past this point. It seems to me that the crime involving this child was ultra violent and something that did not need to be fictionalized for a book. Nora Roberts is a creative person who could have come up with a myriad of crimes that could have been just as effective in terms of a catalyst for a novel and a main character."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"These books were recommended by a lot of people. I am a mystery AND romance buff. The problem I have with this series is that I dislike the heroine so much I can't go any further with it.

What's up with that???"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"This review refers to the Kindle edition of the In Death titles distributed by Hachette Digital for non-US residents. The Kindle edition of this particular book and the other books in the series is not very readable -- it has been formatted with too much leading in between paragraph, forming \\"rivers\\" of white space that are very distracting. You can only read a few paragraphs per page and have to flip frequently (even for the average reading speed). I would've expected more attention to text formatting like some other excellent Kindle books but was quite disappointed. I love this series and was ecstatic to recollect the titles in Kindle format but am put off by the prospect of having to read future titles in the series in the same lousy text formatting."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"This is only a review for the Kindle edition. I wish I could actually review the CONTENT of the book, but Berkley did such a poor job with the formatting that the book is unreadable. There is a space between EVERY paragraph. This makes it impossible to tell when you switch POV or scene. I demanded my money back. I you want to charge me FRONT LIST prices for ancient books, you need to deliver a quality product."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"If you hate Conservatives and everything they stand for and want to read a book where the author shares the same opinions, (even though it is supposed to be a novel about a woman cop in the future) then this is the book for you! Robb's overzealous rip of all things conservative was so annoying that I painfully made it through this book and will never read another book of hers again. I ACTUALLY believe I would feel the same way if it were against Liberalism as well! I thought the character development was fantastic - but Robb's underlying feelings just never went away throughout the book. Also, her use of the F-word - although I don't mind sometimes, was a bit much. I can't believe that in the future when every other thing has been \\"fixed\\" in the mind of Robb - they haven't found other language to use...like \\"frak\\" (for the Battlestar Galactica fans). Ha! Enjoy it if you must - but beware of author's partial writing!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"This book is just average at best. I don't quite comprehend why so many are raving about this. The suspense was tediously dragged out, uninteresting and not very thrilling, so if they were gushing about the love story, I still don't get it. Didn't any of you read a Linda Howard novel, Sandra Brown or Karen Rose romantic suspense, you guys are seriously missing out.The hero literally falls in love with the heroine from the start for no apparent reason. I still don't understand what there was to love about her as she came across as a mess, physically and emotionally an utter mess. She was an abused child, therefor she acts like an arrogant, know-all cop, a stereotypical dyke. A manly girl, with a butchered short hair cut, who doesn't have time for anything but work. Her willingness to sacrifices her life to help others did in fact move me, however, she goes and sleeps with her #1 suspect when she arrogantly decides the hero is innocent without much proof....how are we do respect her as a cop after this? I just couldn't relate to this heroine.All in all, not a bad book, but I must repeat that this book is simply average at best. Don't fall for the hype."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"This is not a romance novel. It is a mystery. I don't like the mystery genre, and I try not to read them. The only reason I read this was because it was written by Nora Roberts, a romance novelist. I really liked two of her romance novels, so I thought I'd try this. It's not for me. Readers who like mysteries would probably like it and would rate it much higher than I did. Since almost all of my reviews are for romance novels, this 2 star review is meant to say that this book will not satisfy readers looking for romance. There is a subplot of a romantic relationship that begins, and apparently, will continue to move forward in future books. A few sex scenes were good. During the reading, I wanted the book to be over, but that may be because it is a mystery and not a romance. I'm not sure.Story brief: Three prostitutes have been killed by a serial rapist/murderer. Eve is the cop investigating. The first victim is the granddaughter of a senator. The senator exerts political pressure on her. She meets Roarke, who is a suspect in the case. He is attracted to her and helps her.Sexual language: strong. Number of sex scenes: six. Setting: around 2058 New York City. Copyright: 1995. Genre: mystery.For a listing of my reviews of other Nora Roberts and J.D. Robb books, see my 4 star review of \\"Angels Fall\\" posted on 6/30/08."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I am half way through this book. And I love the thought of the book and the series but HIGHLY disappointed that its set in the future!! I was reading and it would say something about a year like 2046 and I was so confused! But on the other hand I did not know before I started reading that it was based in the future and this \\"off planet\\" mess. I thought it would be like James Pattersons WMC but I was completely wrong!

Well, DO NOT believe the hype. I was absolutely wrong. I had to force myself to finish reading the damn book! It doesn't get thrilling until the last 50 pages! Even that part wasn't even that great. I regret purchasing this book, thank god I only bought the first one. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I loved this book! I was reluctant to start this series because I'd tried to read a couple romantic suspense novels by Nora Roberts and hadn't liked them enough to finish them. I figured this would turn out to be the same. However, I couldn't put this book down. Because this is a series, the pace of the development of the characters is slower and more realistic than in the romance novels Nora Roberts usually writes. It never felt like the relationship developing between Roarke and Eve was forced or tacked on. I know some people often feel that the mystery element of the In Death books is fairly predictable, but, for the most part, I don't feel that way. I'm not a regular mystery reader, so that may be part of it, but the mystery in Naked in Death did keep me guessing. It wasn't, however, just the mystery in this book that kept me reading - Roarke and Eve's relationship is interesting, and both characters have things about them and their pasts that the author only hints at in this book."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"from the nora roberts i love. because of all the hype surrounding this book by all those i know that read and love nora roberts, i was expecting something wonderful, but didnt really find it. the story itself is good, but i found myself confused at times as to what was going on and why things were included. eve is a spunky cop with a major attitude. roarke is a well to do who seems far out of eves league, but thru the magic of writting, they end up together trying to solve this case. i will more than likely read the following books in this series because i have them, but if i only had this one in my to be read pile, i doubt i would pick up the next in the series."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Set in the future not much has changed. But instead of big bad guns, acceptable murder is by knives or stunners. If everything is so great in the future, why is lil ole eve so busy?I did like Roark, so there's that.If you want good police procedural read Michael Connelly. If you want female cops that aren't whiney and bitchy, read about Rizolli and Isles or any book by Lisa Scottoline. If you want mystery with beautiful prose, read Scott TurrowThis book is none of these. It serves as a platform for yelling (Eve always yells) about right wing views, followed by pages of preaching the glory of left wing virtue.Not my cup of tea."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Although I wasn't aware this was a former library book it did turn out to be in good shape. The stamps on it were a little dissapointing but that's my only complaint."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"This novel is wonderful! It starts out in action from the very first page and keeps the action coming until the last. This novel was a mystery/romantic thriller. It also has some of the most intense romantic scenes I have ever read. I usually don't like reading novels that are based around a character being a cop. For example, the main character in this story is a cop and usually I find all the cop lingo in novels very boring. However, this novel had just the right amount. I enjoyed this novel thoroughly. There are a couple things that I would have liked to know before I started reading this novel, but the things that I would have liked to know weren't horrible when I found out, just not expected. The first thing that was unexpected was that this novel is based in the future. It has cars that can fly and holographic telecoms. One of the things that I loved most about this novel was that since it was based in the future, the guns we use today are considered antiques in this novel, along with manually using a computer instead of voice commanding it, and reading a book that is not on a computer or some hand held device is very rare. This novel held my interest in many more ways than I expected. However, the only main advice that I have for others that are thinking about purchasing this novel, is that there is very strong sexual descriptions. In violence and in pleasure dealing with women. The murders are very sexually violent and the romance scenes are also very sexually discriptive. I would suggest not reading this novel if things like that bother you. Also I would not let anyone under 17 read this novel because of the violent sexual discriptions.Further more, this is an amazing novel and I will be recommending this to many of my friends that enjoy a good mystery/romance thriller.Naked in Death (In Death, Book 1)"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Purchasing from Amazon sellers is nearly as good as dealing directly with Amazon. It takes a bit longer to receive, but it costs less and is usually used and sometimes out of print. If you can't get it from your local library, check all Amazon sellers. I've never been disappointed. The best part is that you can still order through your amazon account; easy as pie.Jeanie"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I was skeptical about starting this series, but after the raves that several people I know gave it, I decided to see for myself. If you like romance books with a great plot (and no I am not talking about Harlequin romance books) or detective/murder mysteries you will definitely like the Death series. The book has the pace of an intriguing murder mystery with a great romance intertwined. I have already read several of the next books in the series and they definitely do not disappoint!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I was not disappointed with the book.

Eve Dallas, found at eight years of age, broken in body and spirit and without family, has made herself into someone to be respected. She is definitely rough around the edges. That is part of her charm and part of what attracts Roarke, the enigmatic and powerful billionaire who is a suspect in a string of murders. After reading this first one, I was hooked!

Great imaginative plotting. terrific cast of characters and Ms. Robb's vision of the not so distance future is well done and probable.

I can't wait to get the other books she has written under the name of JD Robb. She deserves 10 stars!!!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Nora Roberts decided to do mystery in addition to romance and even threw some sci-fi into the mix. She thus created Eve Dallas, a detective with the NYPD 2050, and Roarke, the richest man on earth, who rose from obscure Irish poverty. Further, the author made Roarke a murder suspect, Eve the detective and the rest became history. This duo is still going strong in this continuing series, which wins readers from both the romance and mystery genres daily. In fact, Roarke usually wins the best romance hero category every time there is a polling of readers for favorite heroes. Eve and Roarke together often win Best Couple. Many women readers have even successfully passed these books onto their husbands for bedside reading. I've read this one and the three that follow it. I have another 4 or so in my to-be-read stack. In a way, the duo remind me of Nick and Nora Charles but set in future day, even more decadent and dissolute New York City. Even though she uses the name Robb for these books, everyone knows it is bestselling romance author Nora Roberts who writes them."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"_Naked in Death_ is the first book in J.D. Robb's In Death series. It's set in New York City in 2058, and it's main character is Lt. Eve Dallas, a homicide investigator with a troubled past. One of the main suspects in her investigation is Roarke, a darkly seductive Irish billionaire who seems to own just about everything in the free world. I'm not generally a fan of Nora Roberts' mainstream romance books, and I read _Naked in Death_ because I was intrigued by the idea of a female homicide detective working in a futuristic atmosphere. This book has both gritty mystery and very satisfying romance-I think both mystery and romance fans won't be disappointed-and both Eve and Roarke are memorable characters."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Eve is one incredibly tough and sexy police lieutenant in NY City and I want her to move to Virginia and have my baby. Eve won't back down from anyone and she has everything this male dreams about...smarts, strength, looks, and is an animal in the bedroom in two very sexy scenes without being pornagraphic. Nora Roberts is an incredible writer and really makes you feel for the characters and root for Eve. This was my first book in the series and I can't wait to join the sexy lady cop as she kicks butt in the other books."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"After reading reviews I decided to buy and was not disappointed.

Thanks to all who recommended this!!!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"From the first book to the most recent, I am still hooked. Go past the fact that this is a futuristic NYC. The gadgets are only secondary to the romance and the mysteries that have to be solved. I have told friends about these books and hooked them too. J.D. Robb aka Nora Roberts has a hit series on her hands. Her writing ability makes her characters real and enjoyable. Order and enjoy every one of them. You have my word that this is a series worth getting hooked on!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I just finished the first four books in the series, and I've enjoyed them all. Nora Roberts has created some wonderful characters in this series. Eve is great--a dedicated cop who is haunted by her past; prickly, wary, a loyal friend to those few she calls friend, and surprised she's in love with Roarke. HE is gorgeous (I keep seeing Pierce Brosnan), rich, shady, totally dedicated to Eve, and indulges her shamelessly despite her protests. Peabody is a refreshing addition to the cast of characters. The stories are great, the bad guys not TOO easy to figure out, and the characters have depth and believability, as well as suprising flashes of humor that leaves the reader chuckling delightedly. Keep 'em coming, J.D. Robb!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"&quot;Naked in Death&quot; is the first book in J. D. Robb's &quot;In Death&quot; series and it starts the series off with style! We are introduced to Eve, the independent and no-nonsense cop and Roarke, the charismatic billionaire who sweeps Eve off her feet.The mystery/suspense elements are exciting and well thought out. Eve is investigating the disturbing murders of female licensed companions (prostitution is legal in the year 2058) and Roarke is her main suspect! These two meet as a result of her investigation, and as Eve gets to know Roarke, she becomes quite sure that he is not a cold-blooded killer. Eve cannot resist the lure of this mysterious and sexy man and they soon end up in the midst of a passionate romance.The romance elements of this book blend perfectly with the murder mystery elements, to provide the reader with a wonderfully imaginative, provocative and thrilling story. The futuristic setting is completely believable, and provides an intriguing backdrop for the story without detracting from it.The main characters, Eve and Roarke are both complex and well-developed, and the dynamics of their rocky relationship will keep readers turning pages.This is a truly great read and I am quite sure that readers everywhere will want to read more of Eve and Roarke after finishing this first instalment. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Nora Roberts has long been one of my favorite romance authors. I especially enjoy her Irish trilogies. Having recently read her new novel, Angels Fall, I finally decided to go back and read some of her books written under the pseudonym of J. D. Robb. A friend recommended this series, so I jumped into the first in her \\"death\\" series.NAKED IN DEATH was really good; I couldn't put it down. This series is not true romance; it's more of a romantic mystery, which only adds to the intrigue for me. What makes it so different is that it takes place in the year 2058 and there are many innovative new concepts, such as \\"off-planet travel,\\" to name just one. I leave the rest for you to discover and enjoy.Of course, her main character, Lieutenant Eve Dallas, is a strong, independent woman ... just the way I like my heroines. And her Irish hero (what else?), a billionaire named Roarke, is more than a match for Eve. They make a fascinating, intriguing couple.I don't know how Nora manages to come up with \\"winners\\" each and every time she writes a book, but she does. What a remarkable talent and a remarkable author! I look forward to reading all the books in this series as well as her entire body of works."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I have loved Nora Roberts for years, and rejoice when I see a new series come out. I chanced upon one of the Lieutentant Eve Dallas stories a few months ago, and when I realized it was one of a series, I started an immediate search to start at the beginning and read them in order. To watch the development of the characters, the blooming of the love story, to see how Eve finds out about her past, little by little, is fascinating. I have fallen in love with Eve and Roarke, and all the other wonderful characters in the series, and since they are hard to find anywhere but on Amazon (or perhaps in a local library), I am buying them a few at a time. The interesting thing is that as I am reading them, I am finding more and more women who are also reading them, and these books were written several years ago! Why did it take us so long to discover them? I think they are Nora Roberts at her best. I recommend the series highly to anyone who is a fan of romance, crime and passion."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"The book started with a bang, and Eve Dallas is an engrossing, attractive protagonist. By the time I had finished the first 50 pages, I had ordered the next two in the series. By the time I finished the book, I was regretting it. Where shall I start? Eve finally gets around to interviewing the parents of the first victim by page 130, and even then, it's an afterthought. Ridiculous. The majority of murders are committed by friends or family. Even if the parents aren't suspects, they might well have valuable information. Second, the killer slips videos of the first two murders into Eve's apartment. Does she increase security? Change the locks? Ask for a police guard? No. She goes to sleep. Baloney. Third, the Chief of Police, who is obviously crooked, makes Eve deny any link between the two murders. This is patently absurd, and the media immediately picks up on it. Fourth, Roarke is an arrogant ass, and Eve, a woman who is depicted as not letting herself be pushed around, constantly lets him get away with it. At one point, he breaks into her apartment and calmly lights up a cigarette. This may seem trivial, but non-smokers really, really hate it when they can't get away from cigarettes, and a non-smoker would never allow somebody to smoke in their apartment. It's not \\"strong.\\" It's not \\"masculine.\\" It's obnoxious. Eve and Roarke's entire relationship seems unreal. He's a cardboard cutout of the Irish rogue who can only be reformed by the love of a good woman and she winds up looking like an idiot for putting up with his garbage for more than an instant."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I started out reading Portrait in Death, decided to read a few more, and now I'm hooked. My husband got me the ones that I was missing for christmas, so I read Naked In Death and I loved it. I don't even want to think about what it's going to be like when I finish the whole In Death series.."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I started reading the Eve Dallas novels about 4 books into the series, and was hooked right away. Just had to find out how it all started and Naked in Death is the debut novel for the series. It's classic JD Robb aka Nora Roberts - with a great plot that develops well, the characters are real (despite the futuristic period setting, which provides an interesting foil for Eve's turmoil and angst) It's good to start with this book first, because JD Robb really fleshes out the characters and creates more intense plots subsequently in the series. Even if you've read her later books, Naked In Death makes for excellent reading and provides you with the background to Eve and Roarke's relationship."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I was impressed. I liked the futurist world Roberts created. The new technology and moral beliefs of the public was basically plausible. The protagonist, Eve, was realistic and well rounded. I thought Riley was a bit flat. He didn't show the tarnish of his stated upbringing, but perhaps future books will show this. Just to give a base line, Eve is a detective, Riley is a suspect for multiple murders. The murderer plans to kill a total of six legal prostitutes and is accomplishing it one per week. It is up to Eve to catch the bad guy before he kills again.My only problem with this book was the ending. I predicted it (including the bad guy) the moment he was introduced in the story. Granted, I read alot, so it is easier for me to predict endings, but I still prefer to be surprised and look for that great author that keeps me guessing. I didn't find it here, but I still found liked it and plan to read more."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I wasn't sure I'd like a \\"futuristic\\" type novel, even though the alter ego of one of my favorite authors, Nora Roberts, was writing it. Writing as J.D. Robb, she has definitely changed my mind about this genre. Naked in Death was impossible for me to put down until the last page was read!J.D. Robb introduces us to Eve Dallas, a tough New York police lieutenant who has always relied on herself in all situations and has never let anyone get close to her personally. Eve Dallas is one of the best homicide detectives that New York Security and Police Department (NYSPD) has to offer - she's smart, gutsy, and holds nothing back when trying to solve a case.In this first book of the series, a ruthless serial killer is murdering licensed companions (the term used for prostitutes in the year 2058). It's Dallas' job to find the murderer and stop him/her before another killing. Oh what a tangled web the reader is tangled in with a variety of characters that are so vivid you actually feel as if you know them personally.Roarke, a multi-billionaire, is of Irish decent, drop dead gorgeous, smart and just the right combination of charisma and attitude to attract Dallas. Even when the first murder victim links Roarke as a possible suspect.The colorful support cast will have you smiling and shaking your head. They range from the talented lounge singer who has become Dallas' best friend, to the obnoxious senator who rules the senate and his family with an iron fist, to Dallas' partner who reminds me of a Basset Hound with droopy eyes and a penchant for sugared almonds. Ah yes, they are quite a bunch of characters, full of antics that will have you laughing out loud.As Dallas is trying to solve these crimes, she falls in love with Roarke. She hopes she can prove his innocence, but knows that if he is the murderer her job always comes first and she would have to arrest him even while her heart is breaking. Sound like she's a sap? No way! She's never been in love before, so not only is it a new experience, it's also an emotion that has her confused and at times irritable. Even experiencing the sentiment for the first time, she's still tough as nails.The book has a great combination of romance, mystery and even science fiction. I love the AutoChef that cooks up meals at the touch of a finger and the automobiles that are able to go from road to sky at the flip of a switch. How about the airbuses that cruise through the city skies full of tourists? And guns have been outlawed so police use stunners that have various settings from a mild shock to the \\"termination\\" setting.Ok, sounds strange, but it is absolutely wonderful. J.D. Robb, AKA Nora Roberts, is the best when it comes to blending the genres and you won't be disappointed with this series. I highly suggest this book if you love mystery, intrigue and romance. I'd also strongly recommend that you have a copy of Glory in Death on hand so you can finish this book and pick up the next in the series. You'll be hooked!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"As someone who probably owns at least 200 unabridged audio titles, many of them by Brilliance Audio, I heartily recommend both this company and this narrator. Although I have heard the Recorded Books version of Naked In Death, I find this version much preferable. I must also admit to doing a victory dance around the desk when I saw that this version was coming out. I hope they get around to UNabridged (abridged versions are already out) of all the titles in this series. Ericksen has a good grasp of how to keep the voices distinct, a fine grasp of accents, and that indefinable energy that keeps one listening all the way through. As to the storyline itself - if J.D.

Eve Dallas is the top homicide detective in Manhattan and has dedicated her life to her career to try and escape a horrible and painful past. When a murdered Liscensed Companion (LC) turns out to be a high powered senator's grand-daughter, she is up to her eyeballs in red tape and politics. When the killer promises that 5 more will die, she knows she must hurry and find the murderer.Roarke is on the short list of suspects. He is the richest man in the world, owns the building the LC was murdered in, and owns the company that handles the security for the building. He also has a collection of antique, outlawed guns, one of which was used as the murder weapon. When he swears his innocence, Eve finds herself believing him, but does not know if it is her top notch cop instincts, or the intense attraction she feels for Roarke. Together, Eve and Roarke must fight mistrust and a deadly serial killer intent on destroying them both.This was a great start to was is sure to be a fabulous series. NAKED IN DEATH is a high paced, sexy thriller. It is sure to interest romance and mystery readers alike. But beware, this is one that will keep you up ALL night, because you just cannot put it down.

Honestly I have to say I was skeptical at first, I'm not to much into the futuristic books, but this grabbed me from the first page and didn't let me go till it was over. Actually it has me wanting to go and read Glory In Death to keep the series going in my mind. The story is about a fearless detective named Eve Dallas. She's self sufficient, she's in control and her whole world gets turned upside down literally when the Senator's Granddaughter gets murdered. Going through all the channels as Detective Dallas has to do she finds herself confronted with a man, a suspect. But not just any man...a man named Rourke. From the moment they meet the chemistry runs over! You will see just how important a little bit of love can help to ending a long streak of violence and brutality that not only is involved in the case, but also involved all they way back to Eve's childhood! If your a fan of Nora Roberts...pick this one up. If J D Robb is new to you, then do yourself a favor and read this book.

Thihs is a must read series."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"This is the first book in the \\"In Death\\" series --- if you like romantic suspense, I can't recommend any other book more highly. This book is probably my favorite popular fiction paperback type novel, and I read alot of paperback fiction! Also, one of the things that makes this series great is the development of the characters / supporting characters over the course of the books, so I would recommend reading them in order if you are interested in the series. (be forewarned that these books have a 'darker' quality than straight romance)."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"After reading Seduction in Death, I got the urge to read NAKED IN DEATH again. This is a fantastic, in every sense of the word, mystery series. Mostly all the players are introduced in this first book. I am glad I began at the beginning. Eve Dallas is our fiesty detective heroine, braving thru personal and professional hurdles. She investigates everyone in her search for the killer and finally gets around to Roarke as a suspect. Eve is relentless and dedicated and this attracts Roarke fiercely.Their first meeting and subsequent confrontations are superbly written by Nora. I enjoyed it more the second time because I knew where it was going. You know almost from the beginning who the real murderer is but the voyage to the end is great.All the other characters are keenly written (Charles and Summerset are particular favorites) but they are all developed so well, you just cannot wait to get to the next installment. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"In this first book of the series we met Eve Dallas. Eve is a Homiside lieutenant in NYPD and she's seen and been through some serious stuff. Eve has been alone in her life battered and abused and her only focus is her work!Eve is the kind of heroine that I like, she is collected, she is responsible for her life and actions, she is persistant and she doesn't yield to anyone (well almost to anyone).While the story evolves we see different aspects of Eve's life, we meet her colleagues, we find out what happened during her childhood and we meet the one person who is meant to bring her world down brick by painfully well-build brick Roarke!I really loved the slight futuristic world he characters live in, the world were coffee doesn't exists anymore (and Eve can be totally bribed by a cup) and the world were a billionaire can built a resort in another planet.The story was evolving almost at 70% and I didn't have a clue as to who might be the murderer but the constant references to Eve's past narrowed the criminals by two.This is a good book, one that will make you feel frustrated and angry, one that will make you feel anxious and the kind of book that will make you laugh out loud at the same time."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"a cop ,a rich man, love. murder, crazy friends once u start reading it whill transfer u to different time and place...,"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"This is the first of the In Death series of books by J.D.Robb (Nora Roberts).

It's wonderful to see a fully developed sarcastic character that really just doesn't like people.

While the reader can see that she loves and trusts these people it's still not obvious to Eve.This is Eve's first high profile case and though she's not completely sure the scenes are adding up she doesn't trust herself to go with her instincts against the profiling and evidence"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"A luscious appetizer in a rich feast of a series, this book launched a lead character who unmistakably speaks to the strong woman in all of us. Eve Dallas, reminiscent of the hard-boiled detectives of fiction in the fifties, exhibits the bravery and assertiveness we all would like to possess to blow back on the slackers and con artists who clutter our paths, bulldoze through obstacles that keep us from doing our jobs, and grab onto the promise of a deep emotional relationship even when logic says it's a bad bet. In this first installment, readers get to watch the crass, callus, self-sufficient cop struggle with surfacing memories of a terrifying childhood while navigating the political minefield of a sensitive case as it shockingly unfolds. And we get to see the beginning of her relationship with Roarke, a capricious and mystifying foil for her by-the-book stubbornness.

I knew what to expect because I have read all of the latest books by J D Robb."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I purchased this book for my sister to encourage her to start reading the series if she likes the material. I am hoping she does because Robb's [Roberts'] Eve Dallas and her husband, manservant, earnest and capable detective understudy and her geek cop sleek manboy, whacky songstress and straight fashion designer, dynomite/weird cosmotolgist, her police mentor, her serene police profiler/psychiatrist friend, her erstwhile newscaster, and her cat have all come together for my entertainment and appreciation. And Eve, from a troubled and horrific past, is one hell of a crime fighter, a good cop with attitude. And like Temperance in the TV series \\"Bones\\", she is befuddled and dazed by her being loved by friends she had never had before and thought she would ever have [or need].The love between her and Roarke is charming and fun, touching as they support one another through recall of their wretched, nightmare childhoods amid present day crime. Its progress is interesting, poignant, and laugh-provoking enjoyment. Murder is the subject of each new book, but the interaction, growth, strength, care, loving, pride, honor, humor, skills and interaction between characters which is written with wit, charm and smooth humor is the reason to come back for more.If you like TV's Beckett in \\"Castle\\" you are going to love Dallas even more.In short, it is one of those sets of books in series that keeps you wanting to come back for more and sincerely appreciate Ms. Robb's [Roberts'] ability to recreate events in the future New York [and enjoyment here in the future Maine].Do this thing, you will not regret it."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I am and have been a huge Nora Roberts fan for many years. Despite this, I have never read any of her J. D. Robb books because I was not into science fiction as I imagined futuristic books would be. I was finally convinced to try her after reading \\"Hot Rocks\\" and the J.D. Robb sequell, \\"Big Jack\\". I enjoyed \\"Big Jack\\" so much that I looked around for the other J. D. Robb books - I read two out of order and was hooked - I have now just finished \\"Naked in Death \\"and the second in the series, \\"Glory in Death\\". I love this series and frankly, I like the in Death series better than the Nora Roberts romance books. This series has romance, a great female lead, a great male lead, and some of the best mystery writing I have yet to enjoy. To top it off, since I have waited so long, there are plenty of books in the series to keep me busy for a long time . . . I am addicted to these books and cannot wait to start the next one."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"As a lover of contemporary romantic suspense novels, I had to give \\"Naked in Death\\" a try. Of course, I've heard of Roarke and I was anxious to meet him as well. =)That being said, I just wasn't as engrossed in this book as I thought I would be. Roarke had very little stage time, and I was really hoping to get into his head more. The writer goes \\"into his head\\" very little, and the developing relationship between the hero and heroine just wasn't very believable.Roarke is, of course, written to be The Perfect Romantic Hero. He's obscenely gorgeous, clever, sexy, strong, indescribably wealthy, very masculine and alpha, old-fashioned, gentlemanly, extremely intelligent, sensitive, gentle, sensual... hmmm..... He was just too good to be true. He doesn't have a fault, not even one. And I was having a hard time seeing him as a believable character.Eve Dallas is ok as a heroine. She's a little too tough and cold to impress me. I've never been into female heroines who are too masculine and Eve just crosses that line for me. Descriptions of her messy haircuts and crass manners were just a turn off to me. And the idea that Roarke fell for her the way he did, for no real reason, is just strange.It's obvious why Eve is into him (what woman wouldn't be?) simply because he's The Perfect Romantic Hero but I never clearly saw why he was into her.The suspense part of the novel was just ok too. The mystery wasn't too hard to figure out.I actually liked the futuristic time setting, but it alone wasn't enough to tempt me into another novel. I might revisit the series one day, but I'm sated for now. I got to meet Roarke and he was everything the ladies says he was- a drool-worthy macho sexy perfect man... but I need more than a two dimensional character to draw me in. I just didn't get attached to Eve and Roarke the way I wanted to."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Nearly a decade ago, Nora Roberts' alter ego J.D. Robb introduced a series with an interesting combination of genres. More than just an old-fashioned romance, it is a romance with a twist: It's a futuristic murder mystery too. And the damsel in distress is tough-as-nails Lt. Eve Dallas. NAKED IN DEATH is the first in a stream of more than a dozen tales involving the steamy/steely lieutenant.In J.D. Robb's future world --- the world in another five decades --- there are myriad changes, as one would expect, but she suggests that human nature will remain what it has always been, and will continue to be: flawed.The murder that gets the story rolling isn't committed with a fancy techno-weapon, but an old-fashioned, messy handgun. While banned in the future, they are legally collectible. Multi-billionaire Roarke has an enviable collection of them. Naturally, the detectives question him immediately. But would a man with the wherewithal and wit to achieve Roarke's position be so cocky as to callously toss the murder weapon down next to the body and figure he can escape police scrutiny? He comes under even more suspicion when it is learned the victim's building security tapes have been tampered with. Roarke is an unequaled expert in the field. To complicate matters, the victim is the granddaughter of powerful Senator de Blass, an ill-tempered politician screaming for justice and decency --- and the capture of the person who killed his precious Sharon.Then a second body turns up, the setting a mirror image of the first. This involves another \\"licensed companion\\" (the euphemistic term applied in 2058 to a prostitute). And another antique gun is casually dropped at the scene. When a third \\"companion\\" is found in identical circumstances, the powerful senator cranks up the heat on the already-overworked detectives. Eve fears her job may be in jeopardy without a quick capture of the murderer.The investigation throws Roarke and Lt. Dallas together almost daily, much to her dismay --- and occasional delight. As Eve eliminates him as a viable suspect, she finds herself drawn to the man. Against her will and her better judgment, she surrenders to her own desires. The pair vibrates with electricity that says this attraction is more than just sexual.The series, starting with NAKED IN DEATH, is instantly likable, readable and full of enough action to satisfy all but the most intellectual of readers. Bedroom scenes come often enough for the romance lovers among the mystery buffs. And a bagful of twists will keep you guessing, right to the very end.--- Reviewed by Kate Ayers"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I loved this book!

As always, it is always best to start with Book 1. &quot;Naked in Death&quot; marks the debut of the NYPD detective Eve Dallas. J.D. Robb (though the book covers now proudly proclaim that best-selling author Nora Roberts is the name behind the pseudonym) takes readers into the near, but quite different, future. There is a ban on handguns, prostitution is legal, and (perhaps most disturbingly) coffee is very hard to come by. But no need to worry in 2058, there is still plenty of mayhem and murder. The &quot;In Death&quot; series is billed as &quot;romantic/suspense&quot; and soon our hard-nosed heroine finds herself tracking down a serial killer and, less successfully so, fending off a lady killer - and one of the primary suspects - the charmingly confident billionaire, Roarke.For those readers (myself included) who might be put off that this is written by a romance author, there is no real need to worry. While there is some steaminess in the bedroom, it takes a secondary role to the mystery/suspense part. However, one minor issue I had (and perhaps this is a holdover from the romance genre) was Eve Dallas's duality - she is a tough, competent, hard boiled cop but all too often seems to be saved (and easily seduced) by Roarke. It would have been nice if this otherwise independent woman was not so prone to having the &quot;white knight&quot; ride to the rescue time and time again.Nevertheless, &quot;Naked in Death&quot; satisfied my need for a quick and entertaining read. I plan on continuing onto the next novel, &quot;Glory In Death.&quot; Just a warning for those new to &quot;In Death&quot; series, avoid reading the critical blurbs at the front of this book as they contain some plot &quot;spoilers&quot; for novels later in the series."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Really good mystery story.

Even though I've never read any of Nora Roberts other books, I would highly recommend you read these books. Mystery fans will love her futuristic view of New York. Enjoy them all!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I must say that I love all of the books in this series. I started with the latest one, Judgement in Death, and then went back to the first one. There is a basic outline that is similar (if not the same) in each book in this series, but there are twists and turns in each book that leave you wondering who the real killer actually is. Also, along with the mystery there is a little romance thrown in. From start to finish of each book, characters are developed and you get more insight into how each one thinks as well as how other characters view each other. Each book in the series in a good read and each one had me captivated wanting to read and read all day because I didn't want to put the book down. So, if you like mystery, romance, and kind of miss your favorite characters when there's only one book to read about them, this is a good series for you."},{"Title":"Old Sam: Dakota Trotter (Bethlehem Budget Books)","review":"If you like horses, family stories or historical tales, you'll love this lively, humorous tale of two boys growing up in the Dakotas in the late 1800s.

Add to that the magnificence of the buildings, the ancient wisdom that designed wind towers so that houses in the desert could benefit from evaporative cooling, the existence of qanats bringing water through underground tunnels to create habitable oases, and the fact that Iranians are the only people who honor dead poets. Buchan's book (also titled &quot;The Persian Bride&quot; in other countries) evokes the sad sweetness of the place, the charm and volatility of its people, and the all-too-real costs of the 1979 Revolution.

It examines a shift from myth to reason in Ancient philosophy and explains how the idea of truth changes from a divinely inspired, poetically- informed truth to a truth based in rational thought and reason. For anyone interested in the role of language in ancient thought, this book offers a multitude of references and insights to poetry, oratory, rhetoric, and the power of speech and voice. Aletheia plays a significant role throughout the book and is identified as an important element in the transition from myth to reason or from religious thought to philosophical thought. In tracing these transitions, Detienne covers concepts such as: the ambiguity of speech; a process of secularization as described in distinctions between mythico-religious speech and diologue speech, and; the distinctions between Aletheia and Apate. Packed with a rich selection of resources and classical references, this book offers an intricate tour of classical definitions of truth and toward the end of the text identifies Simonides, Plato, and Parmenides as significant factors in the shift that occurs from myth to reason."},{"Title":"The compleat angler","review":"A lovely ramble with a fascinating old gentleman, quaint, charming, sunny and a true picture of one aspect of a bygone age and of the way our great-great grandfathers talked and lived.

(Not that I'm a notches-on-the-headboard kind of guy, or anything. I'm just mentioning it to establish my credentials.) And despite all that experience, I'm no closer to an answer than crazy old Oedipus-Complex-inventing coke-sniffing Dr. Freud, which is part of the reason this book sounded so intriguing when I noticed it on the Kirkus website.When I got my copy, I put it near the top of my reading list, and once it made it to the top, I ripped through it in no time flat. This is a delightfully fun little book, a fast and engaging read, and I'm very glad I took a chance on it.The narrator, Brooke Hill, is trying her best to juggle an unsatisfying love life and an occasionally satisfying career. Never an easy task, that juggling, especially in the online age, when new work and new love--or at least tantalizing glimpses thereof--are just a few mouse-clicks away. Are those forays adventures into a new world or just distractions from the real world? It's always so hard to tell, and Brooke and her friends spend a fair amount of time just figuring out the answer to that basic question.Eventually, Brooke's search for online romance leads her into a bit of a love triangle--not the most original of love's geometries, to be sure, but to Van Newkirk's credit, she makes the angles uneven enough and and the characters at the points realistic enough that the reader will keep reading.Along the way, she provides a good look at the trials and tribulations of typical twentysomethings in the tech sector. (Another subject near and dear to my heart--I wrote a book of my own looking at such things from the male perspective.) Here, as elsewhere, her observations generally ring true; if there's a fault, it is that the book leans more towards entertainment than empathy. As the book jacket notes, it's a \\"cat-eat-cat\\" world, where bad behavior and backstabbing seem to be frowned upon only if they are done in a clumsy or self-defeating manner.Still, I'm glad I picked it up, for I found it to be a charming, fun read. And as for Dr. Freud's question, I'm pleased to say that it satisfied my curiosity, in a roundabout way. It didn't provide any answers about what women want, but it furthered my suspicion that there is no answer."},{"Title":"Crush Dot Com: A Novel","review":"As a young professional living in Manhattan in NYC, I feel as if I know the characters in Crush Dot Com.

Or so I hope.\\"Ashley, a Stitch Co-worker:\\" I enter my workspace, fire up my computer, and print out copies of my re-write. I notice Ashley joking with Li Ming. She's got her bare tanning-bed legs kicked up on her desk, and she's wearing some sort of black frock that belongs in Breakfast at Tiffany's (most likely Club Monaco's sexy V-neck dress). Li Ming says hello, but Ash only winks at me and then goes back to her conversation. I don't have time to read her mood. I'm too busy to keep slinking around watching my back as if we're on the Serengeti and I'm the antelope, waiting for Ashley's cheetah claws to swipe at my back flanks.\\"Irene Pheester, a Stitch Editor:\\"\`Hi, Irene!' we hear from down the hallway. She's approaching, so we all stand as if she is the president or royalty, and as she walks by the glass walled conference room, she gives us a small wave. I feel as though we're not employees but fans behind a barricade and Pheester is the fifty-foot parade balloon, floating along. By the smirk on her face, I can tell she relishes the attention, even if we all look a little goofy. But she doesn't look bruised and bandaged as I had expected. Except for the new eyewear, no one can even tell that she's had a snip or a tuck anywhere. And she doesn't seem slowed down at all. She's wearing a shiny, new burgundy coat and looks ready-for-action.\\"Sara, another Co-worker:\\"\`This is Sara,'\\" she says, glaring. \`She's the new Fashion Editor that's been hired to help you seamlessly incorporate the magazine content onto our web pages.

Sara is here to help correct this.'\\"Then there are the men that Brooke meets through CrushDotCom, like Nightynight, the Trend Forecaster who claims that, \\"the city is my office\\":\\"Just when I'm reaching for my cell phone to call him and cancel, he opens the door to the cafe and looks around for me. Bam! He's amazingly gorgeous, with beautiful, dark almond shaped eyes and thick lips. As I signal him with a wave, he smiles, and like a cowboy tipping his hat, he gives me a two-finger salute. As he heads toward me, I examine his attire. He's dressed in a leather bomber jacket, jeans, tennis shoes with his hair sort of messy, but not too long. Yes, it appears he uses products, but he has gone easy with them. His tee shirt says \`Rump.' He kisses me on the cheek, giving me a flashback of Artboy, but something about his mannerisms are less practiced. He has an unfinished quality about him, like a teenage boy who still might grow a few feet.\\"And Crushedout, the creator of City Rats, a popular Village cartoon series:\\"He smiles first, then chuckles. I realize that it's easy to make him laugh. It's not a challenge as with other dates who didn't seem to get my sense of humor. Crushedout not only gets it, but seems familiar with names like Gucci, although his own fashion taste runs toward downtown, functional chic. He's wearing a heavy wool pea coat with black pants and shoes.\\"And, of course, NYC:As the city throbs in the background, CrushDotCom darts from one locale to another -- Times Square, Central Park, Cooper Union, Astor Place, Soho, Williamsburg, the East Village, NoLita, the Subway:\\"The platform is packed with people, but due to their impatient sighs and tense scowls, it appears that they have been waiting a long time. I crouch down on my haunches, lean against the dirty, filth-stained wall, and prepare to wait some more. Sometimes the midnight train can take twenty minutes or more and in the city, that's an eternity. I scan over faces, trying not to stare too hard at anyone. There are people together and people alone. Young people, older people. All out looking, but looking for what? A good time, their next drink, another person to snuggle up close to on a cold, windy night like this one? I think about the online personal service that my co-workers are using and realize that this city is one big personal ad. The way people check each other out on the street. It's all faces and outfits and attitude.\\"Although CrushDotCom may attract a Chick Lit label, Leslie Van Newkirk's voice transcends the usual formulaic offerings:She is adept at biting satire:\\"After exiting the elevators, we fill extra large coffee cups with the French vanilla special. Then we sit at a table near a window that overlooks the blinking lights and signs of Times Square. To my immediate left is a giant, yet waif-like model in white, see-through underwear.

It binds the galaxy together.'\\"\\"For awhile in City Rats, one of the rats named Moe had a drug problem. He was left out of the strip for a week while he attended a rehab facility in Vermont. His partner, Bugsy, was featured in the comic alone, updating the audience every so often about Moe's condition. Supposedly Moe is \`cleaned up' now and goes to group therapy with Anne Heche, Matthew Perry, and Robert Downey, Jr. The whole thing was a parody of celebrity drug culture and was something we Stitch gals used to talk about at the coffee station.\\"\\" \`You have the quintessential New York studio,' he says, looking around my apartment which is so small that it takes him all of ten steps to get from room to room.\`I thought the quintessential studio was a huge, light, airy loft with gigantic front windows and a bunch of half finished paintings leaning against the walls. You know, like a Soho loft.'\`That's new New York. Your studio is old New York. Everyone cramped into a little box.'\\"And poignant observation:\\" I pause. Look up at the screen. Deborah Kerr and Burt Lancaster are kissing passionately amid the surf in From Here to Eternity. But I realize their romance is only a hundred feet above us, in little points of light, beamed out of a contraption above our heads. That's what true romance is, I think. Tiny points of light that are scattered all over, and for only the luckiest people, those points of light come together to form recognizable shapes, heads, lips, hands, wedding rings, baby strollers. For the rest of us it's something more shattered. Like Crushedout and me. Or me, here with Nightynight and his octopus arms. A chipped mug. Cracked glass.

Sentiment has been turned onto active restoration, and Steve Grooms is the first to write a book for the general public on the subject. There have been books about the Yellowstone wolf reintroduction and the Mexican wolf reintroduction. However, Grooms looks at them all -- the two just mentioned, but also the restoration of the red wolf and the successful conservation of the gray wolf in the upper Great Lakes.The book has a number of fine photos of wolves. It is factual and moderate in tone.Those is a very useful, readable overview for those interested in the comeback of the wolf"},{"Title":"Return of the Wolf (Northword Wildlife Series)","review":"The wolf has long both entranced and terrified humans. It wasn't long ago that most of America harbored an intense wolf-hatred, and it was routine to kill as many of them as possible, as quickly as possible. Ranchers saw the wolf as the ultimate danger to their livestock, and offered bounties to wolf-hunters. Such policies quickly led to the depletion or eradication of entire wolf populations in many parts of the continent. Folk tales like \\"Peter and the Wolf\\" and \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\" are evidence of an even more long-standing fear and hatred of the wolf. Wolves are a predator at the top of the food pyramid, just like humans, so they can seem quite threatening, as our \\"niches\\" tend to overlap.More recently, public opinion has seen a dramatic swing in the opposite direction. With the advent of environmentalist groups, the wolf is now seen by many as a symbol of the wild. It is often idolized and viewed as the epitome of nobility. Yet the author of this book asserts that neither this idealized depiction of the wolf, nor the previous view of wolves as bloodthirsty, ruthless killers that should be eradicated at all costs, are accurate perceptions. He states: \\"People used to view wolves imperfectly through filters of greed and fear; they now view them imperfectly through filters of guilt and romance\\" (pg. 31). For instance, wolf advocates have often said that wolves will never attack humans, but this is not entirely accurate. While such incidents are rare, \\"never\\" is not the correct word to use here.Steve Grooms works to dispell the myths that have evolved around the wolf. He begins by describing its history, the stereotypes attached to the wolf, and the long-standing tradition of persecution. It's not a pretty picture. The book offers several very graphic examples of human brutality toward wolves (some are quite disturbing). Grooms goes on to describe the wolf itself and how it lives. He explains the pack system, a wolf's physical traits, what a wolf eats, where they live, etc. The main portion of the book is devoted to the various issues and controversies surrounding wolves today. Unlike other publications, he does not focus on any one particular breed of wolf, or any one particular issue concerning them. Rather, he goes through and describes each of the breeds on the continent - the Red Wolf, the Gray Wolf of the Great Lakes region, the wolves of the Rocky Mountains, the Mexican Wolf, and finally the large Gray Wolf of Alaska. Grooms explains the controversies surrounding wolves in each area, and the various reintroduction programs (some successful and others not) that have made attempts to reestablish the wolf where its numbers have been severely depleted or entirely wiped out. The most notable of these programs are the restoration of the Red Wolf in the southeast, the Mexican Wolf in the southwest, and Gray Wolves in the Great Lakes Region and in Yellowstone.I found Grooms' presentation to be very fair and balanced. He acknowledges the concerns of all human parties, be they ranchers, hunters, or environmentalists. He does not ignore arguments on either side, and validates many on both sides, making corrections when necessary: \\"Because some wolf groups have deified and romanticized the wolf, today it is sometimes as necessary to correct the myths of wolf advocates as the distortions of wolf haters\\" (pg. 183). He obviously admires and respects wolves, but he takes a realistic look at the consequences of sustaining wolf populations in close proximity to humans. When he speaks of environmentalists, he makes two subdivisions - idealists and pragmatists. Idealists tend to see all management (the term being used to mean killing troublesome wolves) of wolf populations as bad. Pragmatists concede there are circumstances where such management may be necessary. He even shows how these two pro-wolf groups have conflicted and sometimes hurt their own cause.As a former Alaska resident, I found Grooms' treatment on wolves in the state to be particularly pleasing. I can say with certainty that he accurately captured the essence of the issue here. Alaska is the only place in the United States where the wolf has not been considered endangered. An estimated 7,000-10,000 wild Gray Wolves make the state their home. Such large numbers have led to a concern opposite that found for wolves in the Lower 48. How can the wolf population in Alaska be effectively kept within an environmentally sustainable limit? Many more radical wolf supporters have expressed outrage at any sort of management program, and even to hunting game animals such as moose. They accuse Alaskans of having \\"sold out\\" to the income generated by leading tourists on guided hunting trips. Having lived there, I know for a fact that most Alaskans have a deep respect for the wolf and most other animals. I was very glad to see that Grooms has accurately represented this outlook: \\"Alaskans typically have a strong attachment to the natural world, but are less sentimental and more utilitarian in their wildlife values than citizens of the Lower 48. . . . [Alaskans] tend to see hunting as a natural, time-honored way of putting meat on the table\\" (pg. 164). Having grown up on wild moose-meat and fish, I can testify that this is true of most Alaskan hunters.At the end, Grooms provides a nice summary, including an overview of well-reputed wolf advocacy groups. He gives a short description of each, as well as providing website addresses for further reference. This is particularly nice since the book, published in 1999, does not have the latest information on the various wolf programs and related disputes that are still ongoing. Furthermore, the book contains an abundance of beautiful photography. There are full-color pictures on almost every page, some of them full-page images. And finally, Grooms' writing style is simple and fluid, making the book accessible to the layman. The book holds a wealth of good information, and I recommend it most highly."},{"Title":"Return of the Wolf (Northword Wildlife Series)","review":"This is the best general information book in print about wolves. Grooms is an engaging writer and a knowledgeable wolf expert. This is a book for general audiences, teachers - anyone who wants to learn about wolves. A five-star book if ever there was one."},{"Title":"Return of the Wolf (Northword Wildlife Series)","review":"I found the book intresting and informative, a good wolf book for general wildlife lovers. But I also found that some of the pages, like regarding hunting and conservation, leaked some proaganda and it made the book seem rather off. Instead of going into depth about the alaskan wolf control program, or the issue of wolf conservation in canada, the author seems to lightly touch on the subjects and take off agian. I was also slightly dispointed to read that Canada is only mentioned just a tiny bit in the whole book. The title clearly says US and Canada but focuses on american science that many biologists have already gone over numerous times. serious wolf people would add it to their collection but it doesn\`t cover anything new."},{"Title":"The Bronx Zoo book of wild animals: A guide to mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians of the world","review":"The Bronx Zoo is one of the best in the world, and this book (written by a former Curator of Publications in 1968) explains why we need zoos, and goes on to provide excellent and still accurate information about an enormous range of the birds and beasts that share the planet with us."},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Burnt Cottage","review":"Readers may not know it, but Enid Blyton's best work probably lies in the five findouter series...which begins with this book: &quot;The mystery of the burnt cottage&quot;. I believe the only reason this series of books was never so popular was because of the way it was titled, i.e. Five Findouters, and this wasn't so eye catching compared with the Famous Five or Secret Seven.The story is about 5 children aged from 9 to 13 and a dog, who first meet each other when a cottage burns down due to suspicious circumstances in their little town. They both find that they have a common enemy in Mr. Goon, the pompous village policeman, and despite their differences they pull together in order to beat him in solving the case. At the end of the book starts a beautiful friendship between the five, and they call themselves the 'Five findouters and dog' (coined by Bets (aged 9)) and despite the fact that it was a ridiculous name (as mentioned by Pip, Bets's older brother), it stuck and remained the same for 14 more super mysteries after that.I believe that the five findouter series is much better in quality, entertainment and plot than most other Enid Blyton books. In this series the kids have realistic and practical lives, with strict but well meaning parents, and sometimes they get hurt by the 'bad guys' which makes it all the more exciting and interesting. As far as plots are concerned they are amazing. Some of them could qualify for an Agatha Christie novel. I was astonished at what depth Enid Blyton could go to in making a great plot.The kids actually AGE as the books go along...and gain experience as well. For e.g: Fatty learns to disguise himself, and this comes in very handy in later mysteries.In my opinion, of all the Enid Blyton stories I find this series the best of all. Even now, at age 21, they entertain me immensely. These books are for all...from age 8 to till your really really very old. ENJOY!"},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Burnt Cottage","review":"It's an ordinary evening in the village of Peterswood-until it happens. A raging fire suddenly starts to burn a poor defenseless cottage; belonging o the short tempered Mr. Hick! Since Mr. Hick had very important papers in the cottage, police investigate the scene and make a shocking claim-the fire was not an accident! Five young children and their dog witness the display and decide to solve the Mystery of the Burnt Cottage. They are: Laurence Daykin( the eldest of the 5, called Larry) Margaret Daykin( Larry's sister, called Daisy), Philip Hilton( a boy who doesn't focus on his schoolwork, called Pip), Elizabeth Hilton( Pip's sister and the youngest of the five, called Bets) and Frederick Algernon Trottevile(given the nickname Fatty because of his initials).This amazing book constantly keeps you thinking. Just when it seems that they have found a culprit, one tiny fact throws them off. Enid Blyton, according to the Index Translationum, is the 5th most popular author of 2006. Since Bets is young, she doesn't understand many things. Like when Larry decides to hunt for clues, she hears it as \\"glues\\" and asks if they are sticky. This is the first book in this spectacular series. Some others are The Mystery of the Disappearing Cat, The Mystery of the Pantomime Cat, The Mystery of the Spiteful Letters, and The Mystery of the Vanished Prince.All of these books are great and filled with detail, excitement, and fun! So if you haven't read this book, do yourself a favor and start reading it!Recomended by Vinay"},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Burnt Cottage","review":"I have read this book while I was aged 9. Ever since I completed the short series, I realised, it was the best recollections of all the books read by me. Even after so many years.

They are my reminsce of yesteryears."},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Burnt Cottage","review":"When I first got this book, I didn't really want to read it. It didn't look very exciting to me. I was around seven then, and I was intimidated by the small writing. But when my dad read them out loud to me, I decided I loved the book, and the rest of the series. I am still rereading all of the books.I love all of the characters in this book (Except Mr. Goon, the policeman). If I had to choose my favorite, I would not be able to decide. Out of the five Find-Outers, Bets and 'Fatty' are the most unique.It is an enjoyable book to read, and never boring. The characters are always looking for clues, or puzzling out the mystery. They have a rivalry with Mr. Goon, the village policeman, who always tells them to \\"clear orf\\" and stop poking there noses into the mysteries. So they don't 'clear orf' and they poke their noses into the mystery.I would recommend this book to anyone; my parents enjoyed it, I, as a seven year old enjoyed it, and I, right now, still enjoy it.

And because he is feeling bored and completely at loose ends, Joe Sandilands gladly agrees to accompany Troop to Ranipur when Troop asks him if he'd like to come along for the adventure. Once there, however, both Sandilands and Troop quickly realize that a man-eating tiger is the least of the rich and wily Udai Singh's problems. The kingdom is facing a real crisis because both of Udai Singh's legitimate sons have fallen victim to freak accidents, leaving the principality without legitimate heirs to take over -- of course there is the King's twelve-year-old illegitimate son, Bahadur. And as Sandilands ponders on Udai Singh's singularly bad luck, a question looms in his mind: were the two princes victims of circumstance, or were they victims of a ruthless killer? Determined to protect Bahadur, Sandilands begins to hunt for answers, and so begins the hunt for a very dangerous killer who seems to stalk the very corridors of the palace...\\"The Palace Tiger\\" is yet another thrilling and suspenseful installment in the Joseph Sandliands mystery series that demands that one finish the book in one go. So that even though I'm not an absolute fan of the series (it is difficult to be a real fan when Cleverly's portrayals of the Indians tends to fall along stereotypical lines: they're either unscrupulous and always smiling or else they're really foolish and always smiling), honesty compels me to admit that Ms. Cleverly knows how to write a good, riveting read that will keep you happily engrossed till the very last page. Complete with a cast of fascintating characters, vivid imagery, atmosphere and an absorbing and intriguing storyline, \\"The Palace Tiger\\" was a riveting read from beginning to end.

Sir George asks Joe to help, which he agrees. He will accompany hunter Edgar Troop as they join a party tracking and killing a man-eating tiger preying on the villagers.Sir George provides Joe with a rifle designed for hunting four legged animals and a Browning M pistol used to kill the deadliest species known two legged beasts. Upon arriving in Ranipur, Joe finds the Maharajah near death and his heir Bishan recently killed by a panther. When the next in line son dies in front of Joe, he obviously becomes suspicious of foul play but by whom. The only one to gain with these deaths is the youngest son, a preadolescent who is the favorite of the British Empire even as the cop wonders whether his country authorized murder.THE PALACE TIGER is a fascinating historical mystery that brings to life 1920s India. The story line is fast paced, filled with action, and plenty of twists including a shocking finish. Joe is a terrific protagonist who feels like an outsider as he makes inquiries that are resented by the Maharaja's family especially his second wife and the local law enforcement. Readers will appreciate this powerful tale and seek out other Raj mysteries (see THE LAST KASHMIRI ROSE) by Barbara Cleverly (perfect name for this author).Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Palace Tiger: A Detective Joe Sandilands Mystery (Joe Sandilands Murder Mysteries)","review":"\\"Heard someone say the other day, \`Where Sandilands goes, trouble follows.' Come on, Joe, live up to your reputation --- enliven our dull lives,'\\" remarks a character in the opening pages of THE PALACE TIGER.Scotland Yard detective and WWI hero Joe Sandilands already has experienced his share of excitement while on assignment in 1920s India. In his fourth outing, he is drawn into a world of royal intrigue. Joe's detecting and diplomatic skills are put to the test as he solves a series of murders while navigating the tenuous political line between the ruling British and the government of the princely state of Ranipur.The maharaja, the ruler of Ranipur, is terminally ill, and the line of succession is in question after the death of his eldest son in an incident first believed an accident and then determined to be murder. Along with a colleague, the enigmatic Edgar Troop, Joe is sent to Ranipur under the pretense of taking part in a hunting party to track down a rogue tiger that has been attacking villagers.Before Edgar and Joe arrive at the royal palace, another fatality occurs. This time it's the second of the maharaja's sons, whose demise also appears to be accidental until clues are uncovered that suggest otherwise. Unable to act in an official capacity because of political restrictions, Joe is tasked with discreetly investigating the murders and with protecting the maharaja's last living son, Bahadur, from harm.No sooner does Joe arrive in Ranipur than he finds himself embroiled in the private lives of the palace's inhabitants, among them Madeleine, the widow of the slain second son; Stuart, Madeleine's brother and a former World War I fighter pilot; Claude Vyvyan, British Regent of Ranipur, and his secretive wife, Lois; Shubhada, the ruler's unconventional third wife; and Udai Singh, the reigning maharaja.In THE PALACE TIGER, Barbara Cleverly unfolds a classic whodunit against an exotic backdrop. Her descriptions of the palace, from courtyards bursting with colorful blooms to winding marble corridors and gilded rooms to the customs and practices that take place within its walls, are intriguing enough. Add to that a clever mystery and a dashing detective, and it makes for an appealing read.The character of Joe Sandilands is without a doubt the main draw. Just as the major players in this drama are compelled to confide in him, readers too will be drawn in by his intelligence, confidence, kindness, and quiet authority. But even Joe had better heed the advice given to him by his mentor, Sir George Jardine: \\"There are man-eaters in Ranipur, certainly ones with four legs but quite probably another prowling the corridors on two legs.\\" As Joe discovers, Sir George is not far off the mark.--- Reviewed by Shannon McKenna"},{"Title":"The Palace Tiger: A Detective Joe Sandilands Mystery (Joe Sandilands Murder Mysteries)","review":"I have never read the other books in this series, but I received a copy of this one. I was a little apprehensive that I wouldn't be able to follow the storyline, as I missed out on three previous books. However, I think it is very easy to get into the story and one need not read the previous books to understand the gist of what is happening.That said, I don't think this book is nearly as great as the previous reviewer thinks. None of the characters really stand out in my mind, possibly because there were so many that one can't really get to \\"know\\" any of them except Joe Sandilands. The plot was fine, but seemed to get bogged down at the end by a great many twists and turns that would have been more believable had clues about them been introduced earlier in the story.Overall, it was an enjoyable read- setting this series in the waning days of the British Raj is an excellent move on Cleverly's part, and the mystery kept my interest, even if I wasn't thoroughly compelled by it.I would read Cleverly's other books in the series, but she is not one of those authors that immediately goes to the top of my to-be-read pile when a new offering is released.

I like that.In The Palace Tiger Cleverly manages to combine the traditional post WW I English House Party murder mystery sub genre with the complicated relationships of the Raj period in India. She is also an excellent writer.As with her previous Joe Sandilands in India mysteries, Cleverly gives abundant clues as to the complex aspects of Indian and British cultures that provide the motives for the crimes, but in such a subtle way that she does not make it easy for the reader to guess the outcome.I found myself awakening at 4 am when about 2/3 rds of the way through this book, with a sudden insight into who had perpetrated the crimes. In an odd way I was partially right, but not for the reasons I had originally thought.I have not yet read any of the later Sandilands books that take place in England and France, but I suspect that I will miss the brilliantly depicted sights, sounds, scents, colors, foods, and heat of India that make up such a large part of these excellent mysteries."},{"Title":"The Palace Tiger: A Detective Joe Sandilands Mystery (Joe Sandilands Murder Mysteries)","review":"This Joe Sandilands detective novel set in 1922 India is darker and less dramatic than the earlier books in this series, which began brilliantly with \\"The Last Kashmiri Rose\\".

Cleverly excels at evoking the atmosphere of Englishmen and women trying to copy with the mysterious East.

Sandilands, a Scotland Yard commander on a never-ending temporary assignment to India, is sent to an Indian Princely state ostensibly to view the succession of a dying prince. But, as you might expect, when he arrives Joe finds himself in the middle of a number of intrigues which he must solve. The book is interesting in its description of life in one of the princely states and its relationship with the British Raj. The intrigues that Joe deals with -- not the least of which is the termination of a man-eating tiger -- are creative and well-executed.

With the Maharaja swiftly succumbing to cancer, it seems that the line of inheritance now falls to his bright and confident (and illegitimate son) Bahadur.Joe finds himself trapped in court intrigue, in which the Maharajah's three wives vye for power, white officials manipulate Britain's agenda behind-the-scenes and two people find themselves in very grave danger: the twelve-year old heir to the throne, and the last prince's widowed wife - a young American woman who is now stranded in a hostile environment.Joe discreetly begins his investigations, meeting and interviewing a wide range of interesting and colourful characters (so interesting in fact, that I wish the book had a bit more padding in order for us to get to know them better) and uncovering a viper's nest of intrigue and ambition. As usual, the setting and atmosphere is spot-on - I could almost feel the heat of India wafting off the pages of the book, along with all the sounds and smells and sights that Cleverly describes so vividly. For the time it took me to read this book (which wasn't very long, considering I raced through the pages), I was in India. Out of all her novels, this one is quite reminiscent of M.M. Kaye'sThe Far Pavilions, particularly in the portrayal of life in the Indian court.Likewise, I appreciated the grey-areas of characterization and motivation in the wide cast of characters: everyone has their own secrets and agendas, which can make several bump heads with each other, whilst still being perfectly amiable toward Joe. Behind every smile and polite word seems to be a cunning mind, all bent on their own ambition and desires. Consequently, for the first time Joe is entirely on his own, separated from a trustworthy companion or \\"sidekick\\" that he can turn to for advice. His isolation is palpable, and the sense that he's wading in dangerous waters is clear throughout.Perhaps \\"The Palace Tiger\\" not the most successful of her stories in terms of resolution: Joe goes through several \\"solutions\\" as to who the culprit is, some of the earlier ones being more likely than the final resolution. However, Cleverly once again delivers exactly what I've come to expect: vivid atmosphere, twists and turns, fascinating characters, an intelligent and sympathetic protagonist, and an altogether rewarding read."},{"Title":"I Can Go Potty (Muppet Babies Big Steps Book) (Golden Books)","review":"The book shows your child step by step what they need to do.

The muppet theme helps!"},{"Title":"I Can Go Potty (Muppet Babies Big Steps Book) (Golden Books)","review":"I bought this item used crossing my fingers it would be ok. However, it was covered in food and other unidentifiable grossness so the minute I got it, I threw it in the trash. Only reason why it got two stars was because it arrived quickly."},{"Title":"I Can Go Potty (Muppet Babies Big Steps Book) (Golden Books)","review":"I was looking for a book to help my little one with potty training and found soooo much junk out there. There is everything from singing and dancing to bizarre methods of berating the child until they cry to make them pee in the potty. That stuff was just crazy to me. One of the singing and dancing gigs taught her a song, but forgot to mention that she needed to pull her pants down before she went! All I wanted was a book that told the basics of how it's done with a character my kid could relate to. Then when seeing mommy go and reading the book while sitting on potty, she'd get the picture. Found it! This is simple and straightforward - which is usually the best option with a 2-year-old!
