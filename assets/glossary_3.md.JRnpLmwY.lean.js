By that time, my children were 1 and 5. Not only did this become one of my favorite books, it went on to the list of books I read to them. They are both fathers now and these are books they've read to their children -- I hope this passes down from generation to generation because the messages in this simple story about a stuffed rabbit who someday wants to be real translate into our everyday lives.With the advice of his frayed friend, the stuffed Skin Horse, he learns about being Real. \\"Does it happen all at once, like being wound up, \\" he asked, \\"or bit by bit?\\"\\"It doesn't happen all at once,\\" said the Skin Horse. \\"You become. It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't often happen to people who break easily, or have sharp edges, or who have to be crefully kept. Generally, by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand.\\"As a 60 plus year old grandmother, I have to love that quote! - but I loved this book at 25 too.This book is on my list of books to read to your little ones. Ages 2 and up can handle being read to without a ton of pictures -- you can show them the pictures in the book first, then tell them to paint pictures in their head as you read -- trust me, it works!Or if you buy the toddler version of this, let them look at the pictures in that while you read the words from the Real book!A great gift for yourself and adult friends, plus a wonderful addition to any child's library."},{"Title":"The Velveteen Rabbit, Or, How Toys Become Real.","review":"The rabbit, feeling a bit out of place and a bit unworthy, nonetheless yearned to be loved, not for what he could be or should have been, but rather for what he truly was.

How well I accomplished the task is up to others to judge, but Margery Williams' 1922 classic continues to be the standard, for me, by which other children's stories are judged. There is a sweetness to the story, and great wisdom spoken gently so as to be not so much understood but felt.The bare bones of the plot are really quite simple. A stuffed rabbit made of humble velveteen, who is made to sit because its legs didn't really work, is made to feel useless and insignificant by newer and more sophisticated toys. He finds a friend in the oldest toy in the nursery, a skin horse, worn and threadbare, who tells the rabbit that all those superior toys will remain toys and never be real. The horse tells him that only the love of a child can make him real. \\"Real isn't how you are made,\\" the Skin Horse says, \\"it's a thing that happens to you. When a child loves you for a long, long time...\\" This is the crux of the book.At a time when most toys are mass produced by huge conglomerate corporations using focus groups to determine whether a toy is real or not, the truth of a simple hand-made toy eclipsing them all is refreshing.Quite by accident, the rabbit becomes the boy's favorite toy and his fur gets rubbed off and his tail gets pulled loose, and he realizes that the skin horse was right: becoming real often means \\"most of your hair has been loved off and your eyes drop out and get loose in the joints and very shabby, but ... once you are real, you can't be ugly...\\" And, when the boy declares him real, not a toy, he bursts with joy!But, when he meets two real live rabbits in the garden, animals who laugh at him because he can't jump, has no hind legs, and isn't real, he becomes disheartened again. He is real to the boy, of course, but he longs to be able to jump and dance like live rabbits.When the boy falls ill with the scarlet fever, the rabbit is doomed. Because he and the boy were inseparable, he is to be burned because he is filled with germs. He is packed into a sack with all the other things the boy had touched and taken to the garden. It is there that the Nursery Magic Fairy comes to him and makes him real at last. \\"I take care of all the playthings that children have loved. When they are old and worn ... I come and take them away and turn them into Real.\\"I gave this book to my daughter on her ninth birthday and will probably give it to my grand-children as well. It was the 1983 publication with illustrations by Allen Atkinson that I gave her. When first published, \\"The Velveteen Rabbit\\" was sparsely illustrated with simple but evocative line drawings. It has gone through many different versions with different illustrators, but to me, Atkinson's watercolor renderings are without equal. He is able, with a few strokes, to capture the most subtle of emotions, and the colors are rich and luminous.It is a book that should be read to them early and often. It's lessons are universal and it's story gentle and compelling. No child should be without it."},{"Title":"The Velveteen Rabbit, Or, How Toys Become Real.","review":"There are reasons that some books, like all things are unforgettable.This is the wonderful story of a toy rabbit that longs to become real, but must be loved enough.

Without the fanfare and wide scenes of OZ, Margary Williams has created a world no larger than a young boy's bedroom and back yard, a world in which cosmic truths and values exist and are learned by a small toy rabbit. Starting with the feeling of being &quot;less than,&quot; and growing toward the understanding of what is Real, I re-experienced my own early feelings and inquisitiveness. Concepts of love, loyalty, desire, along with the value of a tear and the awareness that deep change is a gradual thing are only a few of the things that were refreshed in me. This story removed much of the unconscious callousness with which I had been viewing the world. Re-reading or simply remembering the story keeps me in touch with some basics I'd lost along the way.

The story has a timeless quality that resonates with other writes of children's literature that show the beauty in all things through the magic of storytelling -- Hans Christian Andersen, Grimm Brothers, and Aesop's Fables that translates towards compassion and understanding as told in a very unique way.The Velveteen Rabbit is a delightful short story that may also tug at one's emotions and heartstrings because of the meaning that is conveyed throughout the story. As one reads each passage, there is bound to be a memorable quote that may stick in one's mind that may further enrich the experience of reading an exceptional classic tale about a toy rabbit that realizes the meaning of what it means to be real. Indeed, a tale that is highly recommended for all readers young and old."},{"Title":"The Velveteen Rabbit, Or, How Toys Become Real.","review":"Great & free down load to PC Kindle product; yes, Kindle has a free softward download so that you can read their books on your PC too.

While kids (and adults) today won't necessarily identify with the specific toys in the story (they were widely known by the contemporary readers however), we can all relate to wanting to believe in the realness of our toys. Of course, this idea has been picked up and taken to the next level with the Toy Story movies, but that shouldn't dissuade any reader from checking out this short book.The Kindle edition is perfectly serviceable. There are no formatting issues (I checked it out on my iPhone and my Kindle 3) and I didn't see any typos. The lack of pictures/drawings is disappointing, but the storytelling is vivid enough that it won't distract from your enjoyment. This is definitely one of the free kindle offerings worth picking up."},{"Title":"The Velveteen Rabbit, Or, How Toys Become Real.","review":"The Velveteen Rabbit is a classic in any format, but really needs to be read to the young in hardback/paper. The illustrations are fine and the story is the same, but how can you read a story about a toy becoming real on a mechanical device.

The rabbit idly watches as the boy chooses Skin Horse and then the China dog to play with. The Skin Horse describes to the other toys, what being, \\"real,\\" really is. The Rabbit deeply desires for the boy to truly love him, so that he can become real.Finally the Velveteen Rabbit is chosen by Nana for the boy to sleep with one night. As time wore on, the Rabbit didn't notice that his velveteen body was becoming tattered and torn. The endless play times, and nights in the boys arms finally led to the Velveteen Rabbit becoming real. Will the Velveteen Rabbit continue to be the toy of choice?I love this sweet story about the life of a stuffed toy. I think the same idea was done by Disney when they created, \\"Toy Story.\\" Both, \\"The Velveteen Rabbit,\\" and \\"Toy Story,\\" are extremely popular and heart-touching stories because readers can truly relate to the story line. It is not very uncommon for children to have favorite toys, that they sincerely believe are, \\"real.\\" Children believe their toys have feelings and thoughts just like they do. This is why I think this story is so well loved by so many people, even in their adult years.Williams Bianco uses lots of feeling in her story of the saw-dust filled rabbit. Her choice of words would be perfect for a reader to read on their own, at about age eight. However, I think this book can be read aloud to children starting at age four or younger.The illustrator, Monique Felix uses oils to capture the life of the Velveteen Rabbit and the young boy. The oil colors give the pictures a dreamy like appearance, almost magical. This correlates with the magical sense of reality for the toys. The soft colors also give this book a peaceful look throughout the book. Since, the story line is such a sweet description of a love that is real whether the Velveteen Rabbit is or not, I think the softness reiterates that.My favorite illustration is that of the real rabbits, compared to the Velveteen Rabbit on page 20 and 21. The reader can really see the difference between the real rabbit and the Velveteen Rabbit. This lets the Velveteen Rabbit realize that he is not real to the world, but real to the boy, which is all that matters to him.I think this would be an excellent book to use in a kindergarten or first grade classroom. Favorite stuffed animals are still fresh in the children's minds. Most children will be able to relate to the story. They will also be enchanted by the magical mystery of the stuffed animals' thoughts.The illustrator uses oil paints to give a soft and soothing feel to the pictures in this sweet tale. The soft textures and shapes that are used give a calm and quiet look that match the story's slow incline to the climax of the story. The swirls and curves of the oils help give the story that magical essence that the author is trying to portray.I think the illustrator's choice to have illustrations every other page really gets the reader to anticipate and appreciate the illustrations. This encourages the reader to imagine the story for themselves, since it is a rather lengthy picture book. The illustrations also help remind the reader that the Velveteen Rabbit, is still a toy, even though the story is full of the rabbbit's thoughts and feelings.The illustrations are very accurate in that the stuffed rabbit looks very different from the real rabbits or the boy. The toys look stationary and lifeless in the illustrations. This is a beautiful complement to the story line's plethora of realistic traits of the stuffed animals. With so many stories, that have inanimate objects, becoming life like, this story helps balance the two. This balance of unreal versus real can only be accomplished with both the illustrator's talent to portray the lifeless toys, and the author's ability to portray the lifelike toys.However, the illustrator does an excellent job of giving the toy rabbit just enough realistic traits, on page 33, where he begins to cry. The reader can almost see him transitioning from a toy to real. The lines the artist uses for the toy rabbit, become more full and round, creating more life to his little toy body. His stitches become less evident, and his real tear stands out amongst the whole page.In this book, I think it is the illustrator's contrast to the story that truly compliments the author. Even though, it is the opposite of correlating to the story, it still gives the same effect, if not better."},{"Title":"The Velveteen Rabbit, Or, How Toys Become Real.","review":"It was a real tear jerker.

Kids may be a little frightened by the fact that the rabbit is going to be destroyed. However if they can last through a few pages the most magical things happen.

Being real is about the importance of giving and receiving love without barriers.

But these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand.\\" The artwork does lose something in the conversion to kindle but they are sufficient to assist imagination. There is a lot of talk these days about self-esteem and a lot of empty literature to go with it. But this little book truly helps foster an authentic self-esteem for both children and adults. A tear-jerker of the first order."},{"Title":"The Velveteen Rabbit, Or, How Toys Become Real.","review":"A classic story, and glad to have it on Kindle. It always brings a smile on a dark day. Unfortunately, the formatting could do with an overhaul -- some page breaks and headings would go a long way towards making it more readable."},{"Title":"The Velveteen Rabbit, Or, How Toys Become Real.","review":"The Velveteen Rabbit is charming, sweet children's book that is likely to appeal to many adult readers as well; I certainly enjoyed it. The story by Margery Williams is simple - a young boy receives a velveteen rabbit for Christmas. The toy is quickly overlooked, though, in favor of fancier toys until one day the boy, almost by accident, rediscovers the rabbit. The rabbit hopes that being close to the boy will allow him to become real. The story is beautifully told with many moments that ring true. The story alone is 5 stars.This version for the Kindle is fine overall - meriting 4 stars - but could use some improvements. In particular, the beginning of the book is very poorly formatted. The original version (which is available various places online) begins with a list of the illustrations with their page numbers, with the story itself starting on the next page. The Kindle version has the list of illustrations without page numbers (which doesn't matter as the illustrations aren't included anyway) immediately followed by the story - without any spaces at all! I had to read several times to see where the story actually began. The other major debit is the lack of those illustrations! The original book includes seven beautiful pictures. This version would be fine if you're an adult reader or if you are reading the book aloud to a child. If the book is for a child reader, though, I would go with another version that includes the illustrations and better formatting."},{"Title":"The Velveteen Rabbit, Or, How Toys Become Real.","review":"The velveteen rabbit is a children's novel written by Margery Williams and illustrated by William Nicholson.

A tiny bit. In remembering the story of \\"The Velveteen Rabbit\\" I had placed it somewhere on par with syrupy sappy stories like \\"The Giving Tree\\" or \\"Love You Forever\\". I had believed for quite some time that this book was an old but nonetheless overly sentimental tale that even the most dewey-eyed of youngsters would have some difficulty swallowing. Then I reread it recently and I found that I was not correct in all of my assumptions. Yes, \\"The Velveteen Rabbit\\" has its flaws. It is prone to a couple ooey-gooey moments here and there, but on the whole it is a strong well-written work. This is not a book that has earned its title as one of the best known and beloved works of fiction for children lightly.All children wish that their toys were real and could have feelings like the rest of us. This kind of desire is what has spawned everything from the movie \\"Toy Story\\" to the classic Newbery Award winning book, \\"Hitty: Her First 100 Years\\". In the case of \\"The Velveteen Rabbit\\", this wish is taken to an entirely different level. In the beginning, a boy is given a fluffy stuffed rabbit made of softest velveteen. The rabbit is told by an old skin horse about the wonders of one day becoming real, and it becomes the rabbit's deepest wish. As the boy grows to love the rabbit and wear him down, the rabbit feels that he has indeed grown real. One day the boy comes down with scarlet fever and it is necessary to burn the rabbit along with all his other toys. Fortunately, the rabbit is saved by a magic fairy that turns him into a real rabbit. A little time later the boy is out playing when he sees a rabbit that looks just like the old toy he used to own, little knowing that his toy has come back briefly to bid him one last look.I'm particularly attached to the editions of this tale that are accompanied by Michael Hague's illustrations. Very popular in the 1980s, Hague has the ability to draw illustrations that are at once touching and at the same time a little realistic. His pictures are filled with little touches and details that clever eyes might enjoy locating. For example, a page displaying the velveteen rabbit and other toys shows a small frog toy looking very much like the Frog character from Hague's version of \\"Wind in the Willows\\". On the bookshelf sits his edition of \\"The Wizard of Oz\\", easily identifiable by its spine. As for the characters in the pictures, they are delightful. The rabbit grows floppier and more raggedy as the book goes on (not suprising when the boy enjoys dragging it about by one ear). The boy himself is a ruddy faced youth, as apt to tease the bunny as he is to lavish it with love and affection. Hague has a way with light and color that make these pictures virtually leap off of their pages, and the result is a beautiful and elegant series of prints.I am pleased to report that \\"The Velveteen Rabbit\\" is just as important today as it has ever been. This beautiful tale should always be accompanied by beautiful pictures, and so we are fortunate that Michael Hague lent it his skills. I have no doubt that your children will be entranced by this tale. I have even less doubt that you will find something in it yourself to make you pause and think over. Simple and eloquent."},{"Title":"The Velveteen Rabbit, Or, How Toys Become Real.","review":"I couldn't sleep last night so I decided to try Kindle for Blackberry and this was the first book I downloaded.

But when I spotted this DVD version I was thrilled at the idea of actually watching the story.( *This may contain a few spoilers for those who actually may not be familiar with the story* )This DVD/VHS version is satisfactory though not great. I was very relieved that the beautiful story wasn't turned into a silly cartoon--which was my biggest fear. The 'animation' isn't really animation. Every scene is beautifully sketched out but this is also sometimes a problem. They are merely sketches and I found myself having to squint a bit to see the details in the pictures because they are often very lightly done and you see a lot of white of the paper. I think this would have made for great illustration for a book version but on DVD it seemed a little too simplistic, even for an adult's taste. I can't help but wonder if such light, minimal settings would be enough to hold the attention of a younger child not yet familiar with the story.As for Meryl Streep's illustration and the musical score, I may be a bit biased. As a child I obtained my copy of the story through Troll Books and it also came with an audio cassette to listen along to. Although I no longer have that cassette either I can still remember bits and pieces of the narration on the cassette and I feel that this doesn't quite meet the standard set from that long ago narraration. Meryl streep has a sweet and pleasant voice but she doesn't do a particularly great job of voiceing the charactors.The musical score is minimal but fails to convey the change of the mood of the story, such as a pivotal scene where the velveteen meets two real rabbits. The mood of that scene goes from fairly happy to very somber and melancholy, but the musical score fails to note this change, which is disheartening since that was one of the things I was looking forward to most. But I think the biggest disappointment of all was the mishandling of the scene where the Velveteen rabbit is in the sack contemplating better days. Not only does the music and narraration fail to pick up on the emotion of scene that always leaves me almost hysterically in tears( Yeah, I'm a sensitive person ) but it seems to me that several lines( important ones! ) of the story are missing, rendering it disappointingly incomplete. I am quite certain that the rabbit contemplates what good it is to be loved and become real if it is to end so badly right before the tear falls from his eye. But in this version he only watches his life flash before him before he cries.Maybe I am being too critical but this just isn't the best alternative interpretation of the Velveteen Rabbit that's out there. I highly recommend the Troll Book cassette/book release if you want to have the audio/visual experience. It would be at least 13 years old now and I don't know much else about it but it is far better than this. 5 stars for the story, 2 stars for this DVD version."},{"Title":"The Velveteen Rabbit, Or, How Toys Become Real.","review":"The Velveteen Rabbit, and his timeless message about the meaning of love, is a marvellous children's book which every adult should re-read.

He realizes he's not like the other rabbits and inquires of the other animals what it will take him to become real.Much like any idea, when something is important, when something has established itself as important and assumes a deeper meaning - it becomes real. The rabbit of the story in question, despite his drawbacks and the taunts issued him by the other woodland creatures has high importance to someone. He helps his person through a very difficult time in his life, a near fatal time and is repaid, ingratuitously with a trip to the burn pile... The short end of the long, he's rescued and becomes what he longed to be - still, none the less real in terms of physical dimension ala space consumed, but living.A tale of despair, suffering, hope and ultimately transcendence.Full 5-stars."},{"Title":"The Velveteen Rabbit, Or, How Toys Become Real.","review":"Wonderful book.

I've read the book many times at various stages of my childhood, and now that I'm 22-years-old, I find that this timeless story isn't just for children.This, of course, is the story of a stuffed toy rabbit who seems to have a life of his own. \\"The Boy\\" finds the rabbit in his stocking at Christmas. After playing with him for a short time, the rabbit is put away on a shelf where he is to stay for an extended period of time. While on that shelf, he befriends a fellow stuffed toy animal called the Skin Horse. The horse tells the rabbit all about what it means to become \\"real\\", and the rabbit is quickly enamored by this aspiration. One day, the rabbit is taken off the shelf and given to the boy who cuddles with him every night and takes him wherever he goes during the day. The rabbit feels truly loved, and is thrilled when the boy tells him that he's real. There's a touching part of the story where the rabbit toy is confronted by two real rabbits who tease him about being just a toy, and he vehemently maintains that he, too, is real because \\"the boy said so.\\"I'm not going to give away the ending, but I have to admit that I felt the same lump in my throat while reading this book now as I did when I first read it many years ago.

The story is enchanting. I am not a child, yet I wish to read the Velveteen Rabbit for a specific purpose. I must state, that I was not disappointed. The story touched my heart...deeply. It brought back such precious memories of my childhood. Indeed, not all children grow up in an atmosphere of a room filled with many toys, and a Nanny to guide them through childhood. Yet, many do indeed have very precious memories of a special, stuffed toy within their lives. A toy that became a best friend. A toy,...which one did not wish to part from. A toy,...which one loved so very, very much that one spent endless hours holding secret and loving conversations with this precious, quiet friend. This book is illustrated most beautifully. The cover is absolutely heartwarming, and takes one back to a time of a more gentle nature. As I read, I must say that I also wept, because this lovely story touched my heart deeply. Each one of us have had a Velveteen Rabbit, or bear, or kitty, or some other stuffed creature in our lives which touched our heart: Which we loved immensely. It was that love which made them come alive, and captured a part of our heart...which they still hold...even to this day...If, we only allow ourselves to remember."},{"Title":"The Velveteen Rabbit, Or, How Toys Become Real.","review":"When I was a child, \`The Velveteen Rabbit' was one of those books you just read. We read it in school, I read it at home, my friends had the book. It was a very endearing and meaningful story, even in my youth and so sharing it with my children has been a joy. My daughter is obsessed with all things \`Toy Story' and that seemed like the perfect segue into this story from my childhood. While it isn't as abrasive in its themes as \`Toy Story' is, \`The Velveteen Rabbit' covers similar ideas with more finesse and subtle intimacy. It is touching and compelling and it stays with you.It's stayed with me.In this beautifully illustrated children's book, we are introduced to a velveteen rabbit, brown and spotted and with pink satin ears and no hind legs, just a base for a bottom. He is given to a young boy for Christmas and spends much of his early life in the playroom being snubbed by the mechanical toys, who think they are superior, but eventually cozies up to a skin horse who informs him that once he is loved, truly loved, by the little boy he will become Real. Real is something that the Rabbit really wants to become. He gets his chance when the boy needs something to sleep with, and he is chosen. He relishes the boy's company and tucks away in the boy's bed every chance he gets. But, when scarlet fever sets in things change and the relationship between boy and toy are changed forever.The finale is beautifully composed, simple and yet so assuring (the recognition in those eyes) and the stunning art work (nostalgic yet impactful on its own) help tell this story with so much care. My children love this as much as I, and it is one of those beautifully rendered stories that I could tell again and again. You can place this alongside \`Where the Wild Things Are' as my favorite work of children's fiction because it beautifully details the feelings of childhood, what it means to be a child, without being too direct.When you \`get it', you \`get it'.When children are growing, their toys are their first true connection with the world. They explore reality to fantasy in their playing and thus learn and mature through the use of their toys. You can see the growth as you watch their play change over the years. By giving toys feelings and emotions, Margery Williams' classic story gives children, and parents alike, something to hold onto and to ponder with regards to that thin line that runs between a child's fantasy and an adult's reality."},{"Title":"The Velveteen Rabbit, Or, How Toys Become Real.","review":"what a beautiful story and such lovely illustrations.

In contrast to the sadness of the Velveteen Rabbit, the tale of Poor Cecco the wooden dog, his fellow residents of the nursery toy cupboard, and an amusing cast of human and animal supporting characters - all with distinctive personalities - and their droll adventures at home and on the road, is a treasure replete with mystery, surprises, and an elegantly natural style. I was lucky to be given it as a child and wish others could be so fortunate."},{"Title":"The Velveteen Rabbit, Or, How Toys Become Real.","review":"More and more persons who celebrate Easter are taking time to experience the Stations of the Cross, a tradition some scholars believe was started by the first Christians in the years after Jesus' death, that is largely associated with the Roman Catholic,Orthodox Christian, and Episcopalean traditions.It is a walking devotion with 14 stops, or stations, at which the pilgrim or journey maker pauses to recall a phase of Jesus' dying as recalled in the Bible or from tradition. From his condemnation to death, carrying his cross, falling, meeting his mother, meeting the women of Jerusalem, being stripped and nailed, dying, and being taken down and being entombed, the stations are inescapably about physical experience. This is as it should be. Too often Jesus is plastic-wrapped onto a Styrofoam tray like every other blood sacrifice in the grocery story and sold like a commodity. We hose off the blood and crud and find ourselves with a socially acceptable ornament.We need those stations to recall, as Jesus scholar Marcus Borg has pointed out over and over again, that Jesus the political rebel, the teacher, the human being of integrity, the lover of souls, saw his life in the Spirit to its logical earthly conclusion. Jesus taught all who could see or hear or recognize the Truth that life in the Spirit is governed by the rule of love. Nothing else matters. It was in a way simply a matter of perspective, and this meant that Jesus was simply a threat to all the domination system that imprisoned all people into thinking they were insignificant that they were magnificent in heart and spirit. He died out of love for and commitment to the Truth. His death was gruesome.With this in mind, The Velveteen Rabbit remains the only book with a bunny on it worthy buying for any child of any age as we approach Easter. This book captures the mystery of the Spirit as it moves through physical reality. Few adults get through this story without crying. Children often seem less moved, perhaps because they are closer to the Source of the great love than we are. Perhaps we can be optimistic and say the world of complete and selfless love is not strange to all children yet. Perhaps those who weep do so because they long for that lvoe.Williams's story is set in an Edwardian nursery. A rabbit the quality of a carnival prize occupies a lowly place among the state-of-the-art and formerly state-of-the-art toys and gizmos of the Boy's room. Quite by happenstance, he becomes the boy's bedtime cuddle buddy and then his companion in all things. Often he is neglected, left outdoors, trampled, forgotten. The boy, in his boyish way, does not recognize the central role this toy plays in his day to day living. Equally, the boy doesn't realize the transformative power of his attention and affection--even if it self-centered or self-serving in a naive way--on the little bunny. The bunny is becoming real--he is realizing his soul.The domination system of the nursery can't hold him down. He is becoming. His transformation is not complete until he accompanies the boy through a long illness and becomes infected with the disease. The bunny, like everything else in the nursery with which the child had had contact during his illness, will be burned.He is burned. The Velveteen Rabbit as the boy knew him is no more. All that remains is what is Real. The Spirit survives the fire and, in the world of the story, manifests himself as a living bunny rabbit.The survival of Spirit is a detail of the story, in a way. Love requires sacrifice, and sacrifice it will have. So be it. The focus of this tale is really the quality of the love, the casual disregard of the source of this love, and the burning of the bunny without care or conscience. There's no looking back. No, \\"I should have been more thoughtful.\\" No recollection, really, of what the bunny endured outside on damp nights. Love takes in and takes on the ugly and unpleasant and painful. The lover of a soul doesn't look back, either. Looking forward, though, you know the feeling. Moving forward, you bring it with you. You know there is no greater strength, no greater beauty."},{"Title":"The Velveteen Rabbit, Or, How Toys Become Real.","review":"I also am very fond of the book.

This rabbit is given to a boy on Christmas morning, and he loves it very much for all of two hours. Then when his aunts and uncles arrive and he gets to open more presents, he promptly passes it by.The other more expensive mechanical toys mock it for being filled with only sawdust and not gears or springs. But an old horse tells the rabbit that over time he has seen mechanical toys come and go; they receive lots of play, until their mechanism breaks down, that is, and then they are tossed aside, to be replaced by the newest and greatest thing.And then one night, when the boy can't find the china dog with which he is accustomed to sleep, the nurse picks the rabbit at random and gives it to the boy, that he'll finally go to sleep. Suddenly, the rabbit's world is turned around; the boy takes him everywhere and plays with him as if he were a real rabbit, getting the toy dirty and ragged. But the rabbit doesn't care; these wounds and scars are really proof of the child's affections! And when he meets some real rabbits, he tells them that he too is real; once can tell because the boy said so himself!But sadly, one night the boy doesn't want to play; he comes down with scarlet fever. He clutches the rabbit close to him for days; the rabbit providing a small amount of comfort to the boy in this troubling time. And when the boy goes to sleep, the rabbit whispers in his ear that he will one day get better.In time, the boy recovers. And what's more, he's getting sent to the seaside! But all is not gumdrops and happiness; this is really a nefarious plot to burn all of the toys and sheets and everything in the nursery to kill off the scarlet infection. The boy discovers this beforehand, but his anger is assuaged by a new shiny rabbit given to replace his old thoroughly used and ragged one. All is well in his world, but not in the rabbit's.I thought this short story was horrifically depressing! It's supposed to be all uplifting and such since the rabbit becomes real in the end, but instead I took away how callous and flighty people are. The boy flits from toy to toy without a care in the world! He loves the rabbit. He's got more gifts, so the rabbit is forgotten. He loves the rabbit again, but only because the china dog is missing. The rabbit is replaced by another in order to be burned and is again forgotten! I kind of want to smack this boy!And then in the end, it's all supposedly made \\"better\\" because the rabbit is made real. And one day, when he comes upon the boy playing with some new toys, the boy thinks about how that real rabbit looks much like the toy he once had. What kind of crap is that?! This should've ended with the bunny growing fangs and attacking the boy a la Monty Python and The Holy Grail!I, for one, am very disappointed. All this story does for me is serve to highlight how someone can mean everything to you, and in their eyes, you are merely something to be used for momentary happiness, and then discarded without another thought.For more reviews like this one, please check out my profile!"},{"Title":"The Velveteen Rabbit, Or, How Toys Become Real.","review":"This book is uplifting.

In truth, even now as I await the tear-fairy for my own final transformation, I read it with the same pain in the throat and often give way to the tears as I read to the children in my life.I cannot honestly say how many copies of this treasure I have owned and given away only to replace one with another to give away in time, as well. And I continue.This edition, the first, has such beautiful illustrations so carefully placed as to shame all the late-comers with their \\"updates\\" which the gentle Miss Margery Williams would have no doubt kindly \\"set aside\\" in favour of the originals done for her with a quiet passion and dignity of the story itself."},{"Title":"The Velveteen Rabbit, Or, How Toys Become Real.","review":"Daughter Anna (now 19 years old) loved this book. It was her favorite above all others. As we sorted through some old kid things for give-away purposes, we stumbled upon this old, well worn copy of &quot;The Velveteen Rabbit.&quot; She insisted we keep the book for HER children.This was her book that Mama (me!) had to read to her again and again and again. As soon as the last word was read on the last page, it was &quot;Mama, please read it again!&quot;(how I miss those days, by the way!)The book also has a powerful message about Love that children understand and cherish.This is a wonderful book. No child should be without their own copy of &quot;The Velveteen Rabbit.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Velveteen Rabbit, Or, How Toys Become Real.","review":"Very sweet and well written story - makes me wonder why these and other childrens classics are not as widely read in schools or sold in book stores. I looked for one of my favorites, The Steadfast Tin Soldier, (Hans Christian Anderson) but could not find it at Barnes & Noble. It's too bad because these classics are so much better written with more life lessons for kids than today's popular fiction."},{"Title":"The Velveteen Rabbit, Or, How Toys Become Real.","review":"I've never read this children's book, but as I have a Kindle, I can download it for free. Now I know why it's such a classic. Such a lovely and well written story."},{"Title":"The Velveteen Rabbit, Or, How Toys Become Real.","review":"I remember reading this story as a kid, and it always struck me in a powerful way. I had to sift through a lot of updated versions, and only found one that stood up to the standard of the original. Thank God the publisher didn't try to remove any 'stressful elements' from the story. The ones that do destroy the book. Just to be safe: buy the first edition.I read this book to my daughter when she was in the NICU. She couldn't understand it of course, but don't worry, I'll be reading to her again, probably many, many times. When I got to the last few pages, I barely got through it. It is a story about love, dying, and rebirth. About the eternal nature of love and purpose. Those who have had someone special become 'real' will be touched by this book in a way very few books, whether they be kid's books or classic literature, are able to. But I doubt you will be able to read it without tears.And I guarantee you'll read it again."},{"Title":"The Velveteen Rabbit, Or, How Toys Become Real.","review":"I can't believe that this book is free for Kindle. It is such a wonderful story for children and it teaches them the art of empathy and kindness. Don't pass up owning this classic for your Kindle."},{"Title":"The Velveteen Rabbit, Or, How Toys Become Real.","review":"This Christmas edition of \\"The Velveteen Rabbit\\" by Margery Williams is simply beautiful in the presentation as well as the illustrations. The artist, Don Daily, beautifully captures the essence of this classic tale of true love that makes a toy rabbit \\"real\\". The lush, vibrant colors are a magical experience for both adults and children. Some of the illustrations are on a double spread, which makes this book a treasure and delight which I will keep for years to come. My almost 5-year-old kept flipping through the illustrations and loves hearing the tale over and over. At just under ten dollars, this is quite a bargain and makes a perfect gift for Christmas and any other occasion."},{"Title":"The Velveteen Rabbit, Or, How Toys Become Real.","review":"I read this book when I was a little girl and it touched my heart. I bought it for my kids and read it again...and again. I realized that even as an adult, the memories of being a child and dreaming of your stuffed animals being real never fade. This book makes you remember what it was like to be a kid and even now makes me shed a tear."},{"Title":"The Velveteen Rabbit, Or, How Toys Become Real.","review":"This is a charming classic for children, but it is entertaining and touching for adults as well. It is about a stuffed velveteen rabbit, a little boy's favorite toy, that learns what love is and in the process becomes \\"real\\". It is sad in places, but has the most beautiful ending. A true old-fashioned classic that withstands the years."},{"Title":"The Velveteen Rabbit, Or, How Toys Become Real.","review":"This is a completely classic book without revision from the original - so no surprises there. I got it through Amazon Prime, so it arrived promptly.

I did, and they loved the story and haven't stopped asking questions about the story, incidently they are 2 active boys aged 11 and 16. Buy it!"},{"Title":"The Velveteen Rabbit, Or, How Toys Become Real.","review":"This book is always one of my favorites. I have bought several copies of this to give as gifts to share this lovely story."},{"Title":"The Velveteen Rabbit, Or, How Toys Become Real.","review":"The Velveteen Rabbit is a classic children's book and this edition has beautiful artwork. The book is written with some great time-period language and phrases to enrich vocabulary. The artwork is certainly the crowning piece of this edition though - and is heartwarming. A great book to give as a gift or keep for yourself as you await having children or grandchildren to share it with."},{"Title":"The Velveteen Rabbit, Or, How Toys Become Real.","review":"I love this CD. The music is beautiful and works very well with the story. My 2 yo listens to it every night while she's falling asleep."},{"Title":"The Velveteen Rabbit, Or, How Toys Become Real.","review":"As the father of a girl who kept the same stuffed animal for over ten years, I can relate to the story of a stuffed animal that becomes real. It is also a story that mimics religious tales, where heaven (what you always wanted) is what happens to you when your body is old and wore out.The velveteen rabbit is a simple stuffed toy that sleeps with and does everything with the boy. Being the recipient of so much love, all of the whiskers and other markings are worn off. When the boy becomes extremely sick with scarlet fever, the velveteen rabbit stays with him. However, the doctor insists that the rabbit be thrown away as it is now contaminated with germs.When the rabbit is lying in the garbage, a fairy arrives and turns him into a real rabbit, satisfying his lifelong dream. It ends with the boy seeing a wild rabbit having markings like his former toy peeking through the brush at him.This is truly one of the best children's books ever written, it captures the feelings that children have for their stuffed animals. Like adults, children like to believe that their spirits live on and that includes the spirits and love incorporated into their prized toys."},{"Title":"The Velveteen Rabbit, Or, How Toys Become Real.","review":"Rabbits are my son's favorite animals. He also likes his stuffies. He did not like the part of this book where the rabbit is almost destroyed. I think it colored his opinion of the whole book. I would not recommend this book for a sensitive child. It is recommended for ages up to 8 and grades K-3rd."},{"Title":"The Velveteen Rabbit, Or, How Toys Become Real.","review":"Having a seven year old niece, I realize just how pandering and how uninspired most children's books seem to be in light of the Velveteen Rabbit. Never saccharine or insipid; the Velveteen Rabbit is filled with love, humanity and such tenderness that it still grabs you as an adult as an enduringly wise tale that never loses its power. I gave this to my niece to read and felt like it challenged her to not only read something that hones her linguistic skills but entertains so truly and uniquely. The world could learn so much from this little book about what it means to be \\"real\\" and what it means to love unselfishly."},{"Title":"The Velveteen Rabbit, Or, How Toys Become Real.","review":"I've lost count of HOW many copies of this book I've bought for gifts. My own grown children had their copy when they were little. I have always resonated with the story. And I feel it pertains to adults as well as children. My grandchildren also have this book and love it.When my girlfriend had her first grandchild, I gave it as a gift and have continued to do so for many other first time parents and grandparents."},{"Title":"The Velveteen Rabbit, Or, How Toys Become Real.","review":".....but a great way to revisit it. This is a nostalgic tale for me that brings back wonderful memories of a very sweet time in my life - the e-book is a quick and portable way to recall those memories! However, without the pictures and with some structural/editorial problems in this version, I'd suggest that you go with a hard copy for an initial read.If what you are looking for is a great story to read to your little people, this is still a beautiful and FREE way to have a classic tale on hand."},{"Title":"The Velveteen Rabbit, Or, How Toys Become Real.","review":"My mom read this story to me as a child and it was very enjoyable to reread this tale. This story can be enjoyed by children and adults alike with its easy to understand language and plot that grabs at your heart. Cute story, a classic that should be read at least once."},{"Title":"The Velveteen Rabbit, Or, How Toys Become Real.","review":"The story is the same, a beautifully engrossing tale. This is my third purchase of this book as it always manages to get away from me into the hands and homes of one of my grandchildren. However, I think this is also a wonderful story for adults to read. I thoroughly enjoyed having my husband read it to me. So, if you think yourself too old, have a spouse or someone else read you this story. It will change your mind. No one ever grows out of being read to or out of the wonder of fairy tales."},{"Title":"The Velveteen Rabbit, Or, How Toys Become Real.","review":"This book was recommend by my son's school, and is such an interesting story, I would recommend to read every night, every time you read find interesting things to talk about,nice illustrations, great Book!!"},{"Title":"The Velveteen Rabbit, Or, How Toys Become Real.","review":"I have read this story so many times over the years but I never tire of it.Fortunately, I am old enough to forget various parts so each reading awakensnew elements. But, the story and the beautiful writing will never gets old.The Velveteen Rabbit should be kept in every reader's toy chest no matterhow many new toys are added to the collection. This one is the keeper.If you like sentimental stories, this one might work too.She Came From Heaven"},{"Title":"The Velveteen Rabbit, Or, How Toys Become Real.","review":"In a way, I was sheepishly annoyed with it: \\"How dare this little story make me feel small??\\"Because I was an ungrateful, careless git with my toys back then.No, I didn't decimate, but I always grew quickly tired of them...and certainly never to the extent that I slept with a stuffed animal. I'm sure if I did, it would be full of drool in no time.Anywho, setting aside my self-centered ruminations, The Velveteen Rabbit is, truly, a charming story. To the extent that I was half-expecting something horribly terrible (redundancy for emphasis) to happen to the gentle little rabbit. The way it was achingly confronted by the \`real' rabbits and made to realize it's shortcomings hind-foot-wise felt all too familiar - how people more and more equate being \`real' with the misguided idea of being physically \`whole'; when in fact, the only thing that matters is how one feels and finds contentment with one's lot in life.This lovely story is a must-read. Doesn't demand anything from the reader, but the message packs a wallop."},{"Title":"The Velveteen Rabbit, Or, How Toys Become Real.","review":"A great story that teaches a great lesson for children and creates feelings of nostalgia for a beloved childhood toy. Even if the story ended happily, I ended up with a good cry. One feels sympathy, sorrow, and joy for the Velveteen Rabbit.

I read it to two kindergarten classes and I got comments such as \\"That was a GREAT story!\\" and \\"I wish you could read it again!\\"The kids loved it and I loved re-reading it and seeing their little concerned faces when Bunny was about to be burned.

She made me a blue velveteen rabbit, which is perhaps part of the reason for my affection for this book! Children will treasure this story as it will make them look at even their most simple toys with new eyes.Strangely the book has a message of \`awakening' and \`presence' too, that I missed at the time but that, perhaps, was a seed planted for me.A wonderful book!

It's just like good old nostalgia."},{"Title":"Morbo","review":"American audiences exposed to the EPL, La Liga or any other league for that matter, often times only get to see 2 dimensions of the game. First, the emphasis on the bigger team names, and second, the game itself. What they often fail to see is the intracacy of the game behind the game - that is, the cultural elements that make soccer overseas so unique, so passionate, and often times, so beyond the grasp of comprehension to the audience that is watching on Fox Soccer Channel.In Morbo, Phil Ball does a wonderful job of illustrating the cultural background to spanish soccer. And true to form, he effectively illustrates that La Liga is not only about Barcelona and Real Madrid. There is much history between these two clubs but fortunately, Ball doesn't spend all his effort on them. Instead he dives into the history of spanish soccer, starting with English miners, to the history of clubs that no one has heard of outside of Spain, like Recreativo de Huelva.This is far more a cultural study, than it is a history of spanish soccer. Balls successfully discusses how the two paths combine, and how club support was defined more by class/politics/ and culture, than by a jersey's color. It certainly goes a long way in helping outsiders understand the level of support and the long ties people have to clubs. It is especially interesting in light of how the modern world is shaping the game.Finally, like many sports leagues, there is history and their is myth. Ball does a service to the spanish game by not buying into the myth of some of the rivalries (Betis-Sevilla, RM-Barcelona, Athletic-everyone else). In doing so, he provides a complete and true picture of how the game has evolved on the Iberian peninsula.For people interested in understanding how events actually shaped the game in Spain, this is a must read. There are plenty of books out there about Real Madrid and Barcelona, but there are few books that look at Spanish soccer with this depth and refreshing candor."},{"Title":"Morbo","review":"This is a remarkable book. Whereas it took Jimmy Burns of the Financial Times a whole book to wax about Barcelona, Phil Ball does it beautifully in a few pages. Morbo is a superb exploration of Spanish politics, Spanish geography, and the one thing that unites all of Spain-football. Spain is, it seems, a poor advertisement for the sort of national unity that dominated 19th. century Europe-Germany, Scotland, and Italy and later, India and China. Phil Ball's book exhibits a child-like happiness when he visits soccer stadiums in the forgotten corners of Spain. He exposes the hypocrisy of Basque politics, the long shadow of Francisco Franco in Spain and, finally, the exuberance of that Catalan city: Barcelona. This is a must-read for people who are interested not only in the cuisine of a particular peoples-Basque and Catalan- but in their vibrant history beyond the kitchen, beyond the football pitch as well."},{"Title":"Morbo","review":"Anyone who doesn't know much about twentieth-century Spain will be surprised by this book from the first page, because it is not simply about Spanish football-soccer but about the widely divergent regional footballing traditions that converge every weekend in the stadium. The progression of chapters (Huelva, Bilbao, Barcelona, Madrid, Seville) is, of course, chronological (following the founding dates of major clubs from the past and present) but also a device to ease the reader into the myriad political and cultural undercurrents that flow beneath the surface slickness of Spain's Primera Liga, which is now beamed worldwide via cable.This is a great introduction to Spanish soccer for anyone bewildered by the Catalans rooting for Germany during the 2010 World Cup. The author, a British expat, provides the necessary lens adjustment for the outsider looking into this cultural product that now sells itself on a world market but is still dominated by deep-rooted meanings and symbols that are often imperceptible from abroad. The chapter about the national team's chronic underperformance is, of course, now seriously outdated after a European Cup and a World Cup, but the \\"morbo\\" surrounding Bilbao-Real Madrid games or Barcelona-Espanyol matches certainly isn't."},{"Title":"Morbo","review":"A great region-by-region look at soccer in Spain. Focuses on the \\"morbo,\\" or impassioned rivalry, that fuels the sport. A nation divided by regional identities is united in futbol, and Ball deftly combines firsthand experiences with historical insight. His methods are interesting, such as interviewing taxi drivers throughout the city of Seville, but how he can cast judgment on the Sevilla-Betis rivalry without experiencing the derby himself? Published in 2003, the chapter on the national team is now dated following Spain's triumphs in the European Championship and World Cup. Still, a great look at Spanish culture and soccer."},{"Title":"Morbo","review":"For anyone who follows Spanish soccer closely, this book is a must-read! Phil Ball conveys the cultural and historical background of Spanish soccer wonderfully well."},{"Title":"Morbo","review":"Great introduction into the cultural and sports history of modern Spain. Well researched, even better organized, recommended to anyone who wants to get acquainted with the development of one of the major soccer nations. In my opinion there are though several weak points that reader should have in mid while reading the book:1. Altetico Madrid and Valencia got only brief treatment, which is considering the importance of these two teams for Spanish and overall European soccer.Since whole theme is morbo which in free translation means grudge this is understandable.2. Like virtually almost all intellectuals from the British Isles Mr. Ball is leftist and he is not shy to show it. Franco's supporters are always thugs, on the other hand even people who tried to kill legendary Ricardo Zamora are described almost with sympathies, but this is as I said nothing new.3. Patronizing view regarding the scandalous refereeing during the World Cup 2002 when both Italy and Spain were drastically hurt in favor of hosts South Korea. I highly doubt that the author would be so nonchalant if England suffered the same fate.In spite of these expected biases it is good book and good introduction taken with grain of salt so to speak."},{"Title":"Morbo","review":"I regularly read Phil Ball's columns, but this book is better -- the title would lead readers to believe the book is about Spanish football, but it really is about how football fits into Spain's very fun and attractive culture, and for that reason I loved this book. Ball's unique perspective first as an Englishman, second as a long-time Spain resident, and third as a resident of the very unique Basque territory make his insight so enjoyable."},{"Title":"Morbo","review":"If you remotely like football you will like this book. Well written and researched. This is the updated version so it covers impact of the victories in 2008 and 2010."},{"Title":"Morbo","review":"If you're like me and you ever wondered why certain Spanish players seemed to fidget nervously and carry odd expressions during the playing of the lyricless Marcha Real before national team matches, this great book by Phil Ball goes some way towards explaning the backstory.Though older now, the book still is very relevant in that it explains the background for all things Spanish football. In Spain, there's no separation of football, politics and culture. Ball does very well to capture the essence of this phenomenon and does so through creative first hand experience.I found the Betis-Sevilla segment particularly enjoyable as Ball converses with the local taxi drivers and even the local barman. Ball makes the reader feel as if he is along for the ride and sitting in on these often entertaining conversations.This highly readable and enjoyable book takes the reader through every nook and cranny of the Spanish landscape, and you feel as if you have a much better understanding of the often times complicated subject matter that is Morbo."},{"Title":"Jefferson: Political Writings (Cambridge Texts in the History of Political Thought)","review":"This volume is a welcome addition to the various editions of Jefferson's writings available. Although many of the selections may be found in the Library of America edition, this work conveniently arranges them topically. In addition, there are many pieces *not* available anywhere else. Perhaps the most valuable aspect of the work is the large and informative list of short biographies in front. The only real drawback I can see is the exclusion of some important documents, most notably his draft of the Kentucky Resolutions of 1798. But on the whole, it's great, and it should appeal to most serious Jeffersonians."},{"Title":"Jefferson: Political Writings (Cambridge Texts in the History of Political Thought)","review":"This volume is a welcome addition to the various editions of Jefferson's writings available.

The book is a good read even for those who might not GM a game. It gives you insight in to enemies in a way that some of the other GURPS books do not, being such an all in one world. The Myth world however, is very self contained. The magic system is different than what most GURPS magic uses, with mages being sometimes infinitely more powerful in one area, but at the same time extremely focused. The races are somewhat limited, and although you could bring in time travelers with alternate tech or races, a large part of what makes this interesting is the horror aspect of it. There are shambling undead of course, but one of the things this world excels at is very focused evil. The undead are sometimes ambidexterous sprinters with four foot long sharpened Escrima sticks in each hand . . . and they want to dice you just for living. All around, very good character development for the land, and its inhabitants"},{"Title":"Living with Fibromyalgia","review":"As a sufferer of fibromyalgia syndrome who has fought it alone the holistic way (with considerable success) for over four years, I was intrigued when I spotted this book. Initially, I was somewhat put off by the title, as I did not want to have to 'live with' fibromyalgia - I wanted to get rid of it... However, I soon revised my opinion, as I found it to be a truly excellent and comprehensive read for anyone with any interest at all in this debilitating, painful and miserable syndrome - especially those who are prepared to help themselves)for there is no magic answer to it. I have always maintained that any chronic disease (fibromyalgia included) represents a breakdown of health, Christine Craggs-Hinton explains just what is known about this syndrome, and then takes the reader through the various forms of treatment available - including (most importantly) a range of self-help measures to help rebuild the health - before going on to give sensitive tips on how to cope physically, mentally and emotionally with this invisible disease, in a fluent, positive and immensely readable way. 'Living with Fibromyalgia' - and fighting back too, in fact. I was particularly pleased to find a chapter on 'complementary therapies', and also one on diet - the foundation to fighting any disease, in my opinion. A really 'holistic' and informative book, which I cannot recommend too highly. Thankyou, Christine!"},{"Title":"Living with Fibromyalgia","review":"This book was me. It described my symptoms exactly, explaining the intricacies of the condition in an easy-to-understand, down-to-earth way. At last I knew what was going on in my body, and at last I could begin to take action, for, as well as factual information and resource data, this book is full of great suggestions. The chapter on pain and stress management has been particularly useful, and is explained in such a comforting, caring way that it had me riveted. I am now in much less pain because of this book. Not only that, I have the confidence to deal with different situations and recently even went on my first holiday abroad for ten years! Thankyou for helping me to turn my life around, Christine!"},{"Title":"Living with Fibromyalgia","review":"I would recommend this book to anyone who has Fibromyalgia or is living with someone who has the complaint. It reinforces all the points that you are told when you are diagnosed with Fibro and helps you to realise that what you thought were things only in your mind are in fact really part of Fibro. The book was recommended to me and I am very thankful to my friend who passed the information on to me. I would advise anyone who doesn't really know what Fibro is all about to take a look and see."},{"Title":"ANIMAL TRANSGENESIS & CLONING","review":"The subject of animal transgenesis is both interesting and controversial, and its ramifications for all life on Earth are awesome. Once a highly specialized area in biology, and employing very unreliable experimental techniques, it has grown into a field that employs hundreds of individuals in science and industry, and along with using more reliable laboratory procedures, it makes use of highly sophisticated mathematical algorithms and results.The author gives a fine overview of the subject, and with some prior exposure to molecular biology, the book can be read by anyone needing a background in it or anyone merely curious about the current status and capabilities of the field. The book addresses both the science and technology of transgenic animals, and the profound ethical considerations involved with its widespread use in the natural world. The creation of transgenic animals has not been as controversial as that of plants, but the advent of xenotransplantation and the possibility of transgenic animals being released in great numbers in wild populations will no doubt raise the level of debate and truculence. One can only hope that the harsh and bitter vitriole that characterizes both sides of the debate on genetic engineering will evolve into dialog of a more calm and rational nature. If the techniques of genetic engineering are proven unsafe or not viable, then they should not be used. If they are safe, they should be employed immediately in plants and animals, including humans.The author endeavors in all places in the book to be up-to-date, quoting the latest papers and preprints on the subject. There are places in the book the read more like a literature survey, but most of the book is a detailed account of the experimental techniques used in animal transgenesis, and for someone like myself who is not an expert in wet biology, it has some interesting surprises, such as the fact that cloned goats were normal in all cases attempted, even in those where the oocytes were obtained after in vitro maturation. But as a sign of the rapid developments in molecular biology, the recent developments showing that some mammalian cloning, such as that for primates, faces severe difficulties, is not discussed in the book, despite its publication date. Also, in the discussion on gene therapy as applied to severe combined immunodeficiency, the author does not mention the recent problems with patients developing leukemia after this kind of therapy.Throughout the book the author is very honest about the current limitations of transgenic technology. She states explicitly that all the mechanisms controlling gene expression are not known and that the construction of a gene may eliminate essential signals or combine incompatible signals. This will lead to disappointing transgene expression, according to the author. This assertion is also interesting in that it casts some doubt on the viewpoint that the genome of an organism is 'flexible' or easily changed. It is quite possible that they are instead conservative over time, and highly resistant to stable modification. In fact, recent experiments with mosquitos have given evidence supporting the latter point of view. The author gives additional evidence in the human genome, the major part of which is non-functional. Therefore, the author concludes, a foreign gene added to the human genome has a small probability of being integrated into a host gene, and is therefore silent.The possibility of vectors used for animal transgenesis to be transmitted to intestinal bacteria and then disseminated into the environment is only briefly mentioned by the author, stating only that such a transfer can be avoided by removing the prokaryotic origin of replication. It would have been nice if the author had spent more time on this, given the current controversies on this kind of transfer.A very interesting discussion given by the author concerns the use of what she calls 'non-classical' vectors for the recombination of targeted genes, one being the use of bacterial recombinases. The author mentions one example of this, involving a bacterial Rec A enzyme that is associated in vitro with a mononstrand DNA sequence. Such a technique was able to induce a homologous recombination of the corresponding gene in mammalian cells and mouse embryos using microinjection, but she cautions that conformation of these experiments is yet to be performed.The author also includes a discussion of the use of the triple helix between RNA and DNA as a technique for animal transgenesis. Such a technique involves the targeted inhibition of a gene by the formation of the triple helix in pyrimidine-rich regions. The triple helix blocks transcription by RNA polymerase II and RNA synthesis can be directed by the transgene. The author reminds the reader though that such techniques have yet to be successful though in animal transgenesis.Another topic of current interest is that of RNA interference, and the author discusses it in the context of animal transgenesis. She discusses experiments in which (double-stranded) RNA interference can be implemented in cultured cells to inhibit gene expression. The author considers the possibility, yet to be explored, of the expression of transgenes coding for double-stranded RNA inhibiting gene expression in mammals.The author discusses many applications of animal transgenesis, including the study of human diseases, models for viral infections and prion diseases, Alzheimer's disease, xenografting, the production of pharmaceuticals, and improved animal production. As the techniques of animal transgenesis are improved, there will no doubt be many more beneficial applications. There will also be the delightful possibility of the creation of new types of animals with the sole purpose of making the natural world a much more diverse and interesting place to live."},{"Title":"Functional Movement Reeducation","review":"A good book for both junior and experience therapist"},{"Title":"Functional Movement Reeducation","review":"Ihave had the great good fortune to have been,over the past 5 years a severely functionally paralyzed recovering stroke patient of these truly exceptional stroke recovery theraputic practitioners, educators,leaders, and innovators in their field of physical and occupational therapy;and highly recommend this book as a means of providing usefuland valuable supportive insight and understanding for any one else suffering from the traumatic impact of serious stroke functionalparalysis."},{"Title":"Functional Movement Reeducation","review":"Ihave had the great good fortune to have been,over the past 5 years a severely functionally paralyzed recovering stroke patient of these truly exceptionalstroke recovery theraputic practitioners, educators,leaders, and innovators in their field of physical and occupational therapy"},{"Title":"Starlings,","review":"I cannot vouch for the 2008 edition as I had a second hand copy of the 1948 edition, but the book is perfect in every way.

I just bought an old copy of it for a friend who likes starlings, she's 30, the book is still engaging and informative. It's fun and you won't finish it without a new or renewed love for starlings.

The pictures and descriptions in Baldassare Mineo's book are extraordinarily accurate, interesting and authoritative. We've seen Mineo's thrilling gardens and know that he understands his subject from the scree up! This book will become a classic."},{"Title":"Rock Garden Plants a Color Encyclopedia","review":"Clearly a work of long effort and love, this magnificent volume shows what'you've always wanted to grow in your rock garden'...including some very rare, very astonishing plants. The pics are truly beautiful and show the plants as well as the flowers. The only thing it seems to lack is a discussion of some of the finer points of culture of some of these gems, but then again this isn't purely a book about rock garden culture. For that, look for Linc Foster's Rock Gardening or Reginald Farrer's classic The English Rock Garden."},{"Title":"Rock Garden Plants a Color Encyclopedia","review":"There is a rock garden plant for everyone and many of them are represented in this catalog, uh, I mean book. It is not a catalog because there is no certainty that you will ever be able to acquire, much less keep and grow, the particular plant that you love at first sight in this book.Since alpines are found all over the world and represent an assortment of ecological communities there is not a classifiable and finite family of plants. In this book you will constantly feel that you are only skimming the surface of a much much larger subject. There is barely enough information to help you keep the plant alive until you do learn it better. There are thumbnail images with thumbnail descriptions. Like I said, it is a glossy availability list. Only they are not necessarily available.But they are so cute! All that is needed is a properly situated shelf with a few artistic pots and you too can nurture a tiny corner of paradise. It scales up from there indefinitely, until the problem is bringing your face close enough to fully appreciate each plant. Well, then there is the problem of keeping them alive. You are the artisan of rocks and gravel. These plants are your fragile gems."},{"Title":"Rock Garden Plants a Color Encyclopedia","review":"I went to the library at my college and check it out.

He has created several rock gardens and found this book to be a superb reference."},{"Title":"Gone the Dreams and Dancing","review":"I can't believe a book as great as this one can be out of print. I am not a big fan of westerns and before I read this book and its predecessor, The Season of Yellow Leaf, I did not have much of an interest in Native Americans. These two books absolutely captivated me, however. I am no expert, but both of these books seem very authentic and believable. The culture of the Commanches is fascinating, and the characters are complex and easy to relate to. This is not a book without flaws. For example, Jones is not always 100% consistent in his views of the Commanches and the white settlers. This is a very ambitious work, however, and its small flaws are easily forgivable. This book comes very close to being a masterpiece of American Literature and it will change the way you think about Native Americans forever."},{"Title":"Gone the Dreams and Dancing","review":"This marvelous story focuses on Liverpool Morgan, a simple but very literate former Confederate army man who, after the Civil War, works for the Indian Agency and the army in Oklahoma Territory. His friendship with the Commanche tribe and its intelligent, perceptive chief, who are struggling to adapt to the world of the white man and the disappearance of their world in just a few decades, is wonderfully told. It's really a classic and must be based on true stories of this frontier."},{"Title":"Gone the Dreams and Dancing","review":"This book is part two to Season of Yellow Leaf. It focuses on a fictional Quanah Parker and his relationship with an ex-Confederate soldier who now works for the local agency and Fort. Kwahadi (Quanah) frequently comes across as a bit too mysterious and all-knowing. All in all, it was a great story. It's not all action and some parts are more exciting than others. I do recommend this book, but I believe that in order to get the most out of it, you should read Season of Yellow Leaf first. Although each book can stand on its own, there are several characters continued from the first book and you will be able to see how they evolved."},{"Title":"Gone the Dreams and Dancing","review":"A very heartfelt journey from one way of life to another. I have followed characters thru many books by this author and watching their history thru past or future generations hea made me feel like I have been travelling with family and friends. The real historical composites of these people while mixed with true history has been one of my best reading experiences and I read a lot. It reminds me a lot of Lonesome Dove except with even more accurate and extensive research."},{"Title":"Gone the Dreams and Dancing","review":"I like the way this story was told in the first person by someone who cared about the Indian tribe being contained on a reservation. There wasn't a lot of blood and guts and horror as is depicted in some books about Native Americans, and granted they may be more realistic. But I like how the characters white and Indian were shown to be more human and having a desire one to know the other as brothers not enemies."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Tibetan Lama","review":"This book is a good antidote to the Western fantasy that all Tibetans are enlightened beings and the dream that the Tibetan monastery is a utopia. Lobsang Gyatso is a monk who comes through the ranks (rather than an incarnation); the tale of his mischievous childhood, struggles to study, and life in exile let the reader see how much work a life dedicated to religious practice is. Iconoclastic, frank, and sometimes hilarious, Lobsang Gyatso comes across as a practical and devoted monk. And despite the fact that readers are told early on that Lobsang Gyatso was murdered in 1997, the editor's account of his brutal killing comes as a shock, as it adds another painful story to the debate over the status of Dorje Shugden."},{"Title":"Photography","review":"This is a great book for beginning photographers interested in learning photographic techniques.

Not only does it describe step-by-step the different techniques deployed and invented by photographers, it also explains the science behind the wonderful art.

I never thought it possible to make such a complex subject so simple to understand. I have begun viewing (and taking) photographs in a whole new light!"},{"Title":"Photography","review":"As a child, I was surrounded by cameras and photographic equipment. My mother was an amateur photographer and had a healthy love of art in all its forms. She imparted this love to me, though somehow I learned more about the art and theory of photography than how to actually use a camera. And even more unfortunate, when I became ready to pick up a camera, most of the \\"how-to\\" manuals I encountered were utterly indecipherable-as both text and resource.Authors Barbara London and John Upton understand that a photography text has to have a double-edged value: as an accessible instructional tool within the (home) classroom and as a reliable reference beyond it. PHOTOGRAPHY is the resource many of us need-and have waited a long time for-in order to develop the skill to use the camera effectively and with confidence.PHOTOGRAPHY fluently guides the burgeoning photographer through some familiar and not-so-familiar terrain: clear, thorough discussions of everything from aperture and depth of field to using filters and lighting; alternative processes such as multimedia and hand coloring; a chapter on digital imaging; and beautiful \\"Photographer at Work\\" interviews that go inside the many worlds of photography and the photographer's craft. And topics are clearly cross-referenced. (Something often lacking in certain other photography texts.)But learning to control the photographic process is only part of it. The book emphasizes \\"visual awareness\\" and how to make informed visual choices that result in good photographs."},{"Title":"Photography","review":"The 6th addition of &quot;Photography&quot; provides the easiest and completest compilation of terms, techniques, and history of photography.

In addition, the content is graphically presented in such a manner that schools can accept the illustrations without fear of censorship without sacrificing artistic license. The thorough presentation of most all common (and some exotic) photographic processes and camera techniques will appeal to all levels of people interested in photography. As a teacher of photography for 25 years, I would be proud to have this as the primary text for all courses."},{"Title":"Photography","review":"This book was required for my photography course, and it was definitely worth the price.

There are new things in this editionnot found in the third but I was quite unimpressed with the mediocre graphics. Some of the illustrations look like they were done by a high school student learning how to do airbrushing. In this the third edition is far superior. I liked the profiles on living photographers in the third that is not found in the sixth. However, the section on problems with developing black and white film is exceptional. If you have any technical struggles this section can pinpoint immediately what the problem is. Also the book always has one entire theme or idea on the two full pages in front of you. It is an easy book to find your way around in and it really is one of the very finest books on photography available. It would be good of them to update some of the older photographs. I am tired of seeing models from the 70's in an almost year 2000 book. The book also is pricey. It should be available in hardcover for those who use it as a teaching manual or textbook. It would certainly last longer. I do recommend every student who enters college and majoring in photography to add this one to their library. This edition is also 28 pages shorter than the third edition. Why? It shoud have been longer!"},{"Title":"Photography","review":"This is the textbook we use in my photo course and it's everything you need to know about photography.

The index is well done and makes using this book as a reference easy; there are lots of good photos that illustrate what's being explained. (What would be the point in buying a photography book without lots of photos, after all??)This is the book that got me started, and I can't imagine not having it. My only complaint, if I have to have one, is that I can't seem to keep it on my shelf -- all my friends are always wanting to borrow it!"},{"Title":"Photography","review":"This book has been around for a while, in many different printings. Every time I see it in a used bookstore I buy it, so I will have it on hand to give to the next person who asks me about photography.This book has everything you need to know about photography, from discussing the various types of cameras to lighting and metering techniques to how to develop and print your own film. It is well organized and easy to understand. It is written so a beginner will have no trouble with it, but with enough information to get you to a pretty advanced stage. What more could you ask for?"},{"Title":"Photography","review":"If you really really can only buy one book, get this. Somehow it cost only US$30 here in Singapore. There's no better book on general photography than this for any amount of money.The book generalised photography and yet does not skimp on any topics, there's just enough for one to know about any form of photography and that's the good thing about it. It links all aspects of photography together and makes one appreciates other forms of photography not previously explored.It helps to get specialised books to further enhance specific topics, like John Shaw's Profrssional Field Techniques, Landscape Photography; Jim Zuckerman Natural Light Photography; Another excellent book on general photo techniques is Lee Frost's A-Z of Creative Photography. There are many other great photography books that I keep, for reference and leisure reading."},{"Title":"Photography","review":"This is my choice of the best text book available for all levels of photography. This sixth edition is well illustrated with examples from a variety of photographic disciplines.It provides excellent coverage of topics such as the zone system, history of photography, digital imaging, color, view camera, and seeing photographs."},{"Title":"Photography","review":"I spent some time at a local bookstore looking for a good book for my sister-in-law who had just picked up the hobby of photography. Since I spent time making a living from photography, I was looking for a well-illustrated book that covered all the basics that beginners would need. Plus more advanced subjects as well. Easily readable, thorough and well organized. Plenty of actual photos that provide clarity to the subject matter. None of the other books were as good. At the checkout I was surprised at the price. A little steep for a gift, but I still bought it. The book is that good. If I were to write a book on photography, this is the book that I'd write."},{"Title":"Photography","review":"...and don't just take my word on it. The entire photojournalism department at Ohio University (one of the best in the country) uses this book. I have used it in almost every class I took while studying for my degree and have found it invaluble as a reference since then. I have not yet &quot;grown out&quot; of this book; it continues to provide information as I learn. My only complaints are about the size (not exactly backpack-friendly for students) and the price (as with everything in photography). Without a doubt, this is the best photography book out there for students."},{"Title":"Photography","review":"I have used this book as a text book for my photography class for the last seven years.

I couldn't put the book down, a real page turner. The story involves love, sex, drugs, infidelity, betrayal and murder. Detective Norelle Phillips was the first African American, female police officer on the previously all male police force in Nyack, a small town in upstate New York. She was a tough, hard working police officer who was involved in helping disadvantaged kids in the community. Detective Norelle was about to retire when three young men were found stabbed to death in the town park. She decided to postpone retirement to investigate these murders. The three young men were last seen with a beautiful young lady before their murder. Detective Norelle and detective Henry Stark team up to investigate the murders. They remembered a 25 year old unsolved murder of two young men in the same park. Could there be a connection between these murders? You have got to read the book to find out. I liked the ending of the mystery. Ms. Buckhanon had closure to the story just the way I like it.Without any hesitation I recommend this book, so go get yourself a copy. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"Siren","review":"For a first novel it was really good.

It is not your typical serial killer mystery; and has a great plot which captures the readers attention from start to finish. Buckhanon's description of Nyack, and the changes undergone within its community is beautiful! (One who grew up in the town can truly appreciate this writer's talent and craft of creativity). Her characters are wonderfully strange, funny and amazingly real. I highly recommend this book to readers, it is a must read!"},{"Title":"Siren","review":"I could not put this book down!It kept you guessing &quot;whodunit&quot; it's a fast moving fast read.

Occasionally there is a book I like to read without putting it down, SIREN by Maragret Buckhanon is one of those books. The murder mystery involves detective Norelle Phillips and detective Henry Stark who are investigating the murders of three young men in the town's park.There are many suspects; could it be Buddha or Tyrone the drug dealers, Spice the drug addict, Harley, or the beautiful young lady that was seen with the men before their murder?

I love all the Hairy Maclary books."},{"Title":"Hairy Maclary from Donaldson's Dairy (Gold Star First Readers)","review":"I love this book. I won this book as a readathon prize 20 years ago when I was seven. I think the target audience for this book is probably more likely to be kids aged 3-6. It was a definite favorite of my little brother's - he learnt the words off by heart before he could read. It is also a favorite of my nieces and nephews, and I have just ordered one for my baby who is due any day now. The really fantastic thing about this book is that it is actually a fun read for adults too - If my nieces ask me to read them a book I always grab a Hairy Maclary. They are just the right length, and have enough of a storyline to keep you entertained as well."},{"Title":"Hairy Maclary from Donaldson's Dairy (Gold Star First Readers)","review":"These books are all wonderful. We bought the entire series a number of years ago when we were living in London and have read one or more Hairy books every night for years.

I can't recommend this entire series highly enough."},{"Title":"Hairy Maclary from Donaldson's Dairy (Gold Star First Readers)","review":"We've been reading the Harry Maclary books since my daughter was about nine months old, and they continue to be favorites at bedtime. This one (which I guess was the first one) has the usual list of characters, and we have the greatest time giving each his own voice and personality each time we read it. It's fun for me to try to make it different, and my daughter has great fun with it too. The book takes several characters who are chasing Harry Maclary home \\"with their eyes on the bone\\", and they gradually fall out of the chase for various reasons. Very cute! Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Hairy Maclary from Donaldson's Dairy (Gold Star First Readers)","review":"I can stronly recommend this book, as well as most others by Lynley Dodd. Our family in England has sent them to us over the years and they have been great favorites with both our son and daughter. The verse sings along, and the text is humorous to both kids and adults.

This is a delightful book. But get ready to untwist your tongue after your youngster requests that you read it to her."},{"Title":"Hairy Maclary from Donaldson's Dairy (Gold Star First Readers)","review":"My 16 month old daughter ADORES this book. It's fast-paced and fun, and she squeals with laughter when we get to the bit about &quot;Scarface Claw&quot;. It's her favourite book by far and I would recommend it to anybody."},{"Title":"Hairy Maclary from Donaldson's Dairy (Gold Star First Readers)","review":"Kids love this &quot;building&quot; story - Hairy Macleary from Donaldson's Dairy (a tangley little black dog) goes for a walk, and is gradually joined by lots of other dogs with impossible rhyming names. The dogs increase until Disaster! - they meet Scarface Claw, the toughest tomcat in town. (A screetchy meow is necessary at this point.)Lynley Dodd has a wonderful tumpity-tum rhythm throughout the book that makes it great fun to read. It also makes a good flannelboard for storytimes (not too many pieces to make, either).The only caveat is that if you buy this book you will be made to read it over and over - although it's fun to try and remember all of the dogs' names: Schnitzel Von Krum (with a *very* low tum), Bottomley Potts (all covered in spots), Hercules Morse (as big as a horse)...Ignore the editorial reviews above - they relate to &quot;Hairy Macleary : rumpus at the vet&quot; and &quot;Dragon in a wagon&quot;"},{"Title":"Hairy Maclary from Donaldson's Dairy (Gold Star First Readers)","review":"Our toddler WILL NOT GO TO BED until we've done Hairy Maclary from Donaldson's Dairy, or more recently, some of Hairy's other exploits (especially Hairy Maclary's BONE and the CATERWAUL CAPER).Unfortunately for yours truly, these are pretty dull books to read night after night, so you have to be very imaginative about how you read them: I find allocating each of the dogs a different accent (sometimes rotating accents each night) or spoonerising the text as you go along keeps the old fellow happy as the young one is still entranced.On the other hand, the rhymes kick along quite nicely, and the illustrations - which are an unintentionally dead-on representation of the mind numbingly mundane world of semi-rural New Zealand - are great.The final line - I don't think it's spoiling anything to reveal that it's \\"straight back home to bed!\\" - is an unfailing cue for young sir to lie down, close his eyes, and refrain from screaming the neighbourhood down should father deign to switch off the light. As there is nothing else on this dear earth I have found which will do that, Lynley Dodd has truly earned my heartfelt gratitude and respect.My one literary nitpick is that Dodd has wholesale nicked the character Scarface Claw off the great New Zealand cartoonist Murray Ball, whose long-running newspaper strip \\"Footrot Flats\\" featured a timid sheepdog and its travails with a truly ferocious, semi-feral tomcat by the name of Horse.And as for being the \\"toughest tom in town\\" - pshaw - Horse would have Scarface, any day of the week."},{"Title":"Hairy Maclary from Donaldson's Dairy (Gold Star First Readers)","review":"I bought this to replace a copy I had that fell apart.

I recognised the scenario immediately, though we do not have a dog. But just the other day while on a car trip we saw Schnitzel Von Krumm, and siblings out for a walk with their human.This is the original H.Mac book and introduces all the dog characters and Scarface Claw, the toughest towm in town (oh, yeah, until you get to the Caterwaul Caper!)Firm favourite in my household, and one parents don;t get tired of reading over and over.Not O/P in Australia - try to get a copy!"},{"Title":"Hairy Maclary from Donaldson's Dairy (Gold Star First Readers)","review":"We received two copies of this book: one from Australia and one from New Zealand. Both senders referred to it as their country's favorite children's book. And no wonder! When our then six-month old son first heard Dodd's wonderful alliteration, he was instantly enamored with the story. Now we keep one copy at home and one in his diaper bag, so that we always have it handy. The suspense-laden arrival on the scene of Scarface Claw (the toughest tom in town) is particularly delightful: our son finds this part of the story so exciting that he jumps up and down with anticipation, eager for us to turn the page. We plan to purchase the entire series!"},{"Title":"Hairy Maclary from Donaldson's Dairy (Gold Star First Readers)","review":"We've had this book for over a year now and have eagerly sought out other Hairy Mcclary books.

Our family found this one rather disappointing. There is very little story, and the word choice is not nearly as colorful as in Slinky Malinki. Still, my son does enjoy this one, although I suspect it won't hold his attention as long as Slinky, since it's so much simpler. Now that I know this is one of Lynley Dodd's early books, I understand that better. It's probably best for a slightly younger child (right around 2) who loves dogs."},{"Title":"Hairy Maclary from Donaldson's Dairy (Gold Star First Readers)","review":"I bought this book based upon all the 5-star reviews.

Her writing style of rhyming verse should be popular with fans of Dr. Seuss.In this book, Hairy McCleary is joined by a slew of other dogs (some have their own books) as they explore down the street. But a terrible cat gets in the way of their doggy behavior.The book is nicely illustrated with full-page illustrations. The verse follows patterned rhymes and the list of dogs is repeated each time a new one joins up. The repetition and simple plot make it good for younger readers and it sets the stage for many other adventures. All in all it is like of combination of BISCUIT (Alyssa Satin Capucilli) with its repetitiveness and ANGUS AND THE DUCKS (Marjorie Flack) with its resolution of curiosity."},{"Title":"Hairy Maclary from Donaldson's Dairy (Gold Star First Readers)","review":"As an expat New Zealander now living in the US I am delighted to finally be able to get these books here.I have been reading them to kids for 15 years and now have a son of my own and he already has the entire collection of Hairy Maclary related books (14 and Counting....)This is one of my all time favourite books. Every child I have read or given these to has become addicted to that scruffy black dog. His is an everyday New Zealand kind of life. The illustrations are typical NZ scenery, great for those who have been there and remember fondly the backdrop to these great tales.Lynley Dodd has also written several other great kids books, so check her out on the web.

My sister has been sending me Lynley Dodd's books directly from New Zealand for years and my kids STILL talk about them, repeating line after line of the memorized text from so many years ago and still enjoy hearing them as they are shared with their younger siblings. This is the first book of many with the same characters (Schnitzel von Krumm with a very low tum, Bitzer Maloney all skinny and bony, Bottomly Potts covered in spots, Hercules Morse as big as a horse, Muffin McLay like a bundle of hay and of course, Hairy Maclary from Donaldson's Dairy.)

And while it's not the best &quot;Hairy Maclary&quot; book (my favorites are HAIRY MACLARY'S RUMPUS AT THE VET, HAIRY MACLARY'S CATERWAUL CAPER, and SLINKY MALINKI), it's an essential &quot;Hairy Maclary&quot; book; it's the one where all the major characters are introduced. In fact, that's pretty much all the book is, an extremely entertaining introduction--and that's not a bad thing at all! We meet among others, Harry Maclary &quot;from Donaldson's Dairy&quot; (some sort of terrier), Bottomley Potts &quot;covered in spots&quot; (dalmation), and Muffin McLay &quot;like a bundle of hay&quot; (English sheepdog). Once the dogs are all introduced, they head to town where they run into Scarface Claw, &quot;the toughest Tom in town&quot;, who frightens them all away. My son, who is two and a half, really loves this book. He is always on alert for Schnitzel von Krumms (dachschunds) and Muffin McLays when we go out for walks. Also, we've been inspired from time to time to make up our own rhymes about these dogs. Bitzer Maloney, for example, &quot;loves to eat baloney&quot;. And Hercules Morse &quot;eats roast beef, of course&quot;.

We quite often run into 'Muffin McLay' and 'Barnacle Beasley' and there is great excitement whenever we see 'Hercules Morse as big as a horse' or 'Schnitzel Von Crumm with a very low tum'.

He is a canine character they can recognize. Every neighbourhood has a small, cheerful,scruffy dog. He hangs out with a group of friends who walk downtown undisturbed until they meet the aggressive tomcat \\"Scarface Claw the toughest tom in town\\" and run home for safety and security.This is described in wonderful marching rhyme using words and names that sing off the tongue. Reading this story aloud is an upbeat experience for both the adult reader and the child who will quickly join in, repeating the list of names.Much of the magic for children comes from the clever artwork which picks up the characteristics of the different breeds. They will look for and recognize \\"Bottomley Potts all covered in spots' and \\"Schnitzel von Krumm with a very low tum\\" in their own world. And of course in communities where they have opportunities, dogs do make canine friends and socialize in groups irrespective of size and breed.I help out in a small community library where \\"Hairy Maclary from Donaldson's Dairy\\" is one of the well thumbed, always out, books.I have bought this book for grandchildren who live on the other side of the Pacific confident that the universal appeal of the characters and the rhythmic text will please and delight both the recipients and their parents"},{"Title":"Hairy Maclary from Donaldson's Dairy (Gold Star First Readers)","review":"My sons - 4 years old and 18 months both adore this book. The rhyming text keeps them engrossed as I animatedly read about the adventures of Hairy Maclary and his friends. My 4 year old asks lots of questions about the different dogs that are introduced, so it is also very educational."},{"Title":"Hairy Maclary from Donaldson's Dairy (Gold Star First Readers)","review":"This book, and others in the series, are among my children's favourite books, not to mention mine, too. They can't get enough of Hairy Maclary & co. Our copies of these books have been read and read and read and read.(so this is more a review of the series than the individual book....)They are written as verse, using magnificent, evocative language. Some of the words are ones children won't know, but read in verse, they certainly get the message (eg \\"Hairy Maclary felt bumptious and bustly\\"). I thoroughly enjoyed reading them too - there's a great sense of theatre about reading these books.I know of a media training firm that used reading a Lynley Dodd book out loud as a tool to get stitched-up execs to relax - they figured - rightly - that absolutely no one could read it without expression.We borrowed one of the books for a week when my son was 2.5 years old. Two months later I was surprised to hear him reciting a couple of pages of the book - the language has that kind of magic (and yes I then bought it!). Another surprise bonus is that children like to hear just the stories - so I've been able to dredge a Hairy Maclary out of my mind to recite to the kids for those times when you've been unexpectedly held up (eg a queue at the supermarket) and have to keep them out of trouble.The pictures are delightful too.The stories are simple enough to be enjoyed by very young children (with language that lets the book be enjoyed for a while yet). There's a real sense of joy in simple things - like getting your buddies together and walking down town. They make good use of repetition and the \\"climax\\" in most stories is fun to read.I would recommend this for reading aloud to children from two and a half until they start school. They won't grow out of Hairy Maclary too fast! This is definite value for money.It will be a sad, sad day for me when my kids decide they are too old for Hairy Maclary... and when I'm old and grey, I'll still have \\"Out of the gate and off for a walk...\\" embedded in my mind for my grandkids!"},{"Title":"Hairy Maclary from Donaldson's Dairy (Gold Star First Readers)","review":"These are great fun books, sly and funny which kids and adults can both enjoy. Lynley Dodds writes and illustrates this series of books, which I think began with this one and so you can find the same characters in other books too. The rhymes are great, and they are repeated so littlies quickly get the idea of what is coming next.Hairy Mclary is a little terrier, he has his friends Hercules morse, Bitzer Maloney, Bottomley Potts, and Schitzel von Krum for company.We keep the collection of these books about Hairy Mclary and his friends at home for the kids. We started reading them from an early age as the pictures are bright and it seems to appeal to them. My 3 year old is now 'reading' them herself. She knows the rhymes and is interested in the letters as well as the pictures.

And it gave me a more open mind as to what REALLY happened in thr 20's and 30's the years, Bare Croats who were brave enough to speak about it, called it the golden underworld years of Croatian freedom. From what we were bieng told in school by the Socialist Communist Schooling System, believing that what the Communists wrote was right, this book tells a different story. It tells of Croat Extremeists, not with the intention to kill ews and serbs, but to overrun the falling Yugoslav kingdom with the Macedonians and Italians. Thus, the NDH was born..

While he made no claims to &quot;definitiveness,&quot; I was impressed with Lotterhand's insights to some remarkably difficult queries; those answers are mind-opening, and yet non-threatening and absolutely not spooky-kooky. This down-to-earth style is deceptively easy on a reader. Jason is adept at taking difficult concepts and presenting them simply, often summarizing with a brilliant and memorable turn of words.

BUT NOT THIS BOOK. It is clear as a bell, and funny, and combines the lure and lore of the Tarot with that of the Kabballah. Turns out, they are very connected, and when you read this book so much becomes clear. About the Wheel of Fortune as the Fool in each of us wonders through this myriad world in this lifetime, and what it all means.Jason Lotterhand was a mystical fellow and very pragmatic. And hilarious at times.This is a book you do NOT have to read sequentially. You can pick it up and open to any section or page and dive in.Now, if you are also interested in learning the Tarot, this book will give you a very comprehensive view.'I have been buying this book for friends of mine for years, usually for $15 or $20. Not I see it is out of print, and selling for a lot of money for used versions. it's worth it, but I called the author and learned that it is coming out with a new publisher and a new name, its original name, the Spoken Qaballah (Kaballah).I am glad. It is a great book, and I can't recommend it enough.I have two on my bookshelf, an old one, with bent pages, and notes, and a clean, crispy new one that I can give to a friend when one shows up and expresses interest in the Ancient Wisdom.This is a book you should buy and give away and then buy another one.

Sentences may have to be read over a few times before they are fully absorbed. Many of the words are difficult, and a few of the character's names, as well as the names of places, are similar to one another, which makes it confusing. The story is fast paced and does not stay focused on one event for too long. It does, however, explain the events in great detail, with plenty of sensory imagery, making it easy to form a mental picture of the action.The general plot is rather repetitive. Odysseus overcomes a challenge on an island, and while leaving via boat, a storm takes him to yet another island, where the process is repeated. This makes the story predictable and less interesting. It is even a bit disappointing, because while one usually expects a hero to be happy, helpful, and maybe funny, Odysseus possesses none of these traits. He is stubborn, selfish, overly confident, and serious. Also, before the tales of Odysseus' travels even begin, the reader finds out that he was gone for ten years, and is now safely retelling his story to others. This and the fact that early in the story, a man tells Odysseus of a prophecy detailing exactly what will happen to him, spoils the ending, so there is little to look forward to.This work would be more enjoyable for people with an extensive knowledge of Greek mythology, or for people who like poetry. It is doubtful that many people college age and younger would take an interest in this story, and it is certainly not something to read for fun."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"People have followed over 20 years of Dirk Pitt's life through 17 books. In his younger days he did a lot of crazy stuff with ease. In the more recent books there have been hints of aging. Sure it happens to everybody, but not characters from a book... Trojan Odyssey really brings the issue to light. They're all getting older. Dirk Pitt doesn't do nearly as many death-defying stunts in this book as in earlier ones. He's not immortal, he's getting old and decides to settle down. I absolutely love the big ending. I actually got tearry-eyed. Especially the last paragraph.My main advice is don't finish the book at 3:00am with nobody to babble to but a cat sleeping next to you on the couch. He won't care and you be left saying 'wow, i can't beleive it.'BTW Pay attention to Sandecker's hint on p.305 second to last paragraph."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"This book was not my favorite Dirk Pitt Novel but I think it ends well. The action is a little less intense than his other books but Cussler still has chases and clashes with the &quot;evil doer&quot; I would recommend anyone that has read the other books to read this one but new readers should read earlier Cussler novels because because there is history some history revealed in this book."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"As a long time Cussler fan I am disappointed to read so many unfavorable reviews. So I thought I would put my two cents in concerning Trojan Odyssey. I thought it was a vast improvement over Valhalla Rising. VR had some good parts, Ono Kanai was a good villian and the plane chase through New York city was amazing, too bad it wasn't in a better book. The plan at the end to blow up the World Trade Center with an LNG tanker was eery considering it came out before Sept 11. I will admit though, that Cussler has a cheesy streak in him that turns up once in a while; that combined with a tendancy to sink into maudlin melodrama, (which doesn't happen regularly in the other books), and my skepticism due to the Captain Nemo story idea started me off on the wrong foot. Though, having been slightly disappointed with Atlantis Found, I was further tainted by skepticism. I am sorry I started that way, because he tied up the story well, and I actually bought the Nemo idea, thanks to Julian Perlmutter. Also I will concede that Cussler's books are formulaic, and not always seemingly original at first scanning the book cover. But, what author doesn't resort to formula, the Grisham books atleast the first three are all very similiar. Boy the mob sure gets around. That aside, I was pleasantly suprised to be pulled in so easily to TO. Cussler's story was interesting, and kept me wondering. Technical details gotten wrong that might have been a glaring error to others didn't bother me. The edge Pitt had in his earlier books, which he had seemed to have lost in the last two incarnations returned. The end scene in congress, as however implausable it might be was just as audacious as anything I have read before in the series. Suffice it to say, the old Dirk was back, as ironically, a page is turning, and we see that the old adventures we have enjoyed all these years, are most likely coming to an end. If this is to be the last Dirk Pitt novel, Mr. Cussler has chosen a high point to end on. So there you go, my two cents. Oh one last thing: Good work Clive! Thanks for bringing back the Dirk we remember."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Cussler has finally developed another interesting novel. While he continues to use a template to his writing that is consistent with every Dirk Pitt novel, the subplots were well developed and interesting.The Celtic history and questioning Homer's Odessey were very entertaining.Anyone who is a fan of Dirk Pitt is ready for his near death-defying feats. Cussler uses Dirk's introspective very well. I do believe that Dirk Jr. &amp; Summer characters need to be much more developed.If Cussler is ending the Dirk Pitt saga, I hope that he greatly improves his other series. The Golden Buddha was far from entertaining."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I am in need of a psychoanalyst. I continue to read these things hoping against hope that SOMETHING will change but no - we still have the same cardboard characters (Dirk & Dirk Jr are equally wooden - daughter is just for show), the action is over-the-top as usual and and the \\"plots\\" still take outlandish license with history as Cussler attempts to make sense of nonsense.Ready? It's a gawd-awful mixup of Greeks & Celts & England & Persia along with a modern-day cult based on Greek (or Celtic?) mysteries. Someone's trying to direct the ocean currents to Nicaragua to freeze the world and sell a special type of battery that...need I go on? You are probably asking what the freezing oceans have to do with Helen of Troy and of course, you are absolutely right - not a cotton-pickin' thing.This is SO much worse than Lincoln in the middle of the Sahara. (If you don't get it then you are lucky.) Or Atlantis or the claim of the US from Iceland or fill in any of the hysterical events. I am convinced he wrote these with Mystery Science Theater in mind. If not, they should be adapted for that particular medium."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"If you are looking to feed your mind, this is the curly-cheese fries of literature. The author takes an interesting theory on the location of Troy and turns it into a bad James Bond movie.If you've read any of Cussler's previous novels, you'll have no problem predicting each of the unlikely coincidences which lead to a showdown between Pitt and Specter. For the uninitiated, let me give you a taste of what you're missing:Dirk Pitt's twin children, who look, act and have the same first names as their parents, get caught in the worst hurricane, ever. Nearby, a giant, floating hotel is on the brink of being crushed against a rocky shoreline. The owner of the hotel is &quot;Specter&quot;, the leader of a druid cult out to create a global disaster so that they can corner the market on a new energy source. Pitt's kids discover a celtic relic on the wrong side of the ocean, which threatens to rewrite ancient history. A history which happens to be related to the druid cult.The story zips along like a 500 page comic book, thanks to the author's lack of character development. Instead, most people are described by their eye-color and a description of their outfits. The bad guys (or gals?) wear color-coded jumpsuits and paint all of their vehicles lavender (if only Bin Laden was this crafty). The good guys ride around in turquoise planes and ships.The story is very uneven. One minute Dirk sees a woman with wet hair and deduces that there must be a bomb on his boat, the next minute he can't decide if a bikini-clad bombshell pulled off a sinking Odyssey gunboat might be dangerous. As with other recent Pitt novels, the author can't make up his mind which previous Pitt adventures to negate and which to keep in the Pitt timeline."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I guess Cussler had a renaissance of sorts here. In some ways this was the best Pitt novel in a long while. Clive has some of the old spark back. Plus I suppose Dirk had a dose of gold kryptonite taking away his superpowers of recent novels.I did like it and I agree with another reviewer that this is likely to be the last Dirk Pitt novel. Not the last of the NUMA crew for sure but then again, we'll likely have Dirk Junior to knock around for the nest decade or so.Like the last half dozen Pitt stores, Cussler revives his tried and true - if somewhat tedious - formula. Dirk and Al the heroes against another billionaire meglomaniac bent on:SELECT \\"evil_plot\\" FROM PITT_PLOTS where (SELECT plot_type, evil_villan, FROM PLOTS where (plot_id = (SELECT (rnd(plot_id))You get the idea. My thought is Cussler has a computer write his books from a database of mad scientists and evil plots. This one is better, but still the same old repetitive story, now the evil guy is Specter ( SPECTRE?) maybe KAOS and THRUSH are next.I guess I liked it overall. It moved fast enough but still so predictable I probably could have written it myself all I need do is fill in the name of the bad guy and historical background facts.It is worth reading I think for long term Pitt fans wanting all of Dirks loose ends tied up. I won't give away any more than that, probably don't have to anyway. Everyone already knows what it's all about - the same as the last 6 Pitt novels.Unfortunately tt's no \\"Raise the Titanic\\" but fortunately it's no \\"Oregon\\" either. So read and enjoy and then go re-read \\"Titanic' or Vixen 03 and have great memories of Dirk and Al."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I read reviews and marvel at people running down the exciting and happy writing offered with the Dirk Pitt Novels. Some complain it is the same old thing. Others state many of the things are unbelievable, and etc. and etc on and on. Why do they read it knowing it is fiction. Clive Cussler has well proven his ability to produce readable interesting stories. It is quick, interesting, and many times instructional. Behind all fiction is some fact and his real life in the seas surely substanciates that. Instead of total criticism to a wordsmith take a long look and see if you have the ability to better his writing. If so I strongly suggest you get on the word processor immediately and bang out something better. As I feel I will look forward to each book written and will enjoy his topics in the sense of happy action stories. Long live Dirk Pitt and all concerned."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"What, Dirk Pitt is getting old and is hanging up his shoes? Since when did he turn into Dick Marcinko? Of course readers could see this coming since \\"Valhalla Rising\\" introduced his son and daughter in a somewhat contrived fashion toward the end of the story.Storywise it features a fair amount of action and is worthy of being in the series. However it does seem to lose a fair amount of steam after the rescue of the floating hotel: the second part of story almost reminded me of something from \\"Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death\\". Where was Adrienne Barbeau as Epona?I almost thought we'd escape a Clive Cussler cameo in this novel but he pulled one out very late. Nothing pivotal to the plot as they usually are...just a bit of fluff.So it's a good CC novel but nothing spectacular. That said, it's good to see the series end while it still has some modicum of respectability left."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I have not had this much funny reading in a long time. This is my 3rd Cussler in a row and each one seems better than the last. This book is un-put-downable, engaging, compelling, and upbeat all the way."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Was this really Clive Cussler who wrote this book? If it was ,what happened to the old cussler? He use to write books for entertainment and not money. It is sad to see that after writng so many other books Cusslers writing skills have declined to that of a high school student. Trojan Odyssey is not the same as the classic Cussler books like Sahara,Inca Gold or Deep Six. the story line seems to have been re hashed from past books, but don't let that fool you into thinking that this is one of them. The story line is stupid, like the fact that there is four gigantic tunnels running under ground, that have been built with out any one on the surface discovering this. These tunnels are hundreds of miles long, and when reading the book you find it hard to believe. The fact that I am Nineteen and found it hard to believe, I would hate to think what a more mature reader would think. A great pity to end on such a low. This cussler book is only for the die hard fans.If you are not one of these people, save the money for something worthwhile."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I just recently read this book and found it to be not as thoroughly researched and full of errors, more than usual. While the plot is OK and enjoyable enough, I still think Inca Gold or even Atlantis Found as better books.A number of errors that I can remember in particular include:(1) The ship that Jason sailed on was the 'Argo' not the 'Argonaut'; the Argonauts were the Greek heroes that sailed with Jason!(2) Fuel Cell technology that uses Nitrogen and then produces water as its output waste??? I mean at least do a little research on fuel cell. The reason why Hydrogen produces water in the first place is because the hydrogen ion produced bonds with oxygen to produce water while generating electricity. How can you produce H2O WITHOUT the H???(3) How could Summer be the \\"Daughter-In-Law\\" of Loren Smith Pitt?? Shouldn't she be the Step-daughter??(4) Pumps in the tunnel... why would you need pumps in the tunnel when the water pressure at that depth is enough to induce water flow? He probably meant a turbine which can produce electricity when connected to a generator.Some additional comments: Why does he kept referring to China as \\"Red China\\"? Nobody refers to China as that any longer - even in 2003 when this book was published.He never did place a connection between what Odyssey was doing and Hurricane Lizzie! I suspect he meant to include that in the book, i.e. that the freakish super hurricane was brought about by climactic changes that occurred because of the experimentation or whatever by Odyssey.And what is the deal with that \\"low cost\\" fuel cell thingymagingy that can produced with 8 parts?? 8 parts?? Are you hallucinating? Even the most rudimentary wind-up toy requires more than 8 parts, let alone an ultra-sophisticated piece of technology. Why didn't he just leave well enough alone.Clive puts too much useless details in this book that made it even less plausible than it already is. I would have been willing to gladly suspend disbelief given the genre of the book, but this calls for beyond even that! It's ok to inject Sci-fi elements into a book of this kind, but please at least do some research and put some semblance of plausibility scientific or otherwise into your stories. Clearly Clive is very well versed in automobiles, marine science, sailing, piloting choppers - but for those that he is not, I wish he'd stop cutting corners just to get a book out in print. Mr. Cussler please do your research or fire your editor!"},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I've enjoyed Cussler for several years. I admire his work in marine archeology. But he's no longer on my must buy list after this one. The one saving grace for the book is it exposes the reader to the hypothesis about the location of Troy and the evolution of the Illiad and Odyssey. Beyond that, the characterizations are the thinnest parody of the worst of the Bond Movies. The addition of Dirk Pitt's newly found children to the cast of characters is a little unbelievable, and certainly unwanted. The tempo is uneven. The dilemmas are so over drawn as to give melodrama a good name. The basic premise is the least plausible one to show up in one of his books. I read it through hoping it would improve, and it just got worse and worse. At the very best this book is better than being trapped in an airport with absolutely nothing else to read...but only just. Clive Cussler is a talented writer, but he must have rushed to finish this book."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Did Cussler really write this book? Weakest plot of any of his work. Unlike his others, this book starts very slow...and then fails to pick up speed. And mistakes? There were many...especially with directions like east and west (hurricanes travel from east to west and not west to east as Cussler said)or distances like hundreds of miles and thousands of miles (the Pananma Canal was 100's of miles away and Cape Horn was 1,000's not the other way around as the book indicates). If Cussler actually wrote this book, who edited it? I have thoroughly enjoyed all the fiction Cussler has written with his name on the author's line. Until I read this one. It's a shame that Dirk and Al had to end their careers (or so the story implies) on such a low note. And how exciting are the books with Dirk Jr. and Summer as the main characters going to be? Being brother and sister, Cussler can't even turn the series into romance novels."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Let's clear the air right now. No one ever claimed these books were great works of fiction. They are supposed to fun escapism. Sadly the series has gone downhill to the point where I am now nitpicking everything instead of just going along for the ride.I agree with other comments that suggest this book needed much more editing. Maybe that would have done it. It needed to be read by a totally disinterested third party completely unfamiliar with the subject. Then some of the glaring inconsistencies would have been resolved.Examples: How does one fly a helicopter into the eye of a hurricane? At one point it is mentioned the hurricane extends upwards in excess of 50,000 feet. Ain't no chopper I ever heard of goes that high. Yet it appears, drops off the passengers and equipment and sails off without a care in the world.Or another- Summer photographs what appears to be a lady's comb while in the underground cavern. A big deal is made that all artifacts must be returned to where they were found. OK, no problem. Later on, during a meeting, she wonders what the computer analysis of the comb revealed. Uh, wait a sec here. I don't remember the materials actually being turned in for analysis. And sure enough, later on the next page the photos are shown for the first time.I think some of the wording could be improved as well. We get the point- Summer is one smokin' hot babe. However, some of the word choices in places could lead me to believe Summer & Dirk Jr. are going to end up rolling in the hay together.And I promise I will not go into the issue of Mr. Cussler's proclamation years ago where he stated all his books would use the metric system and this book does not. After all, this review should just be limited to the subject at hand.In my opinion, this book needed one more re-write and it would have ranked right up there with the other great Pitt stories. Instead, the next time I'm in an airport bookstore, I'll skip over the Cussler offerings altogether. Too bad."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Clive Cussler novels have always been page-turners. I once had to buya hardcover copy of \\"Inca Gold\\" after reading the first few pages in abookstore; I was so drawn into the story there was no way I could waitfor the paperback. Throughout the years, I've thoroughly enjoyedreading every Dirk Pitt book through \\"Valhalla Rising.\\"I stopped reading Cussler after buying one of his \\"with Paul Kemprecos\\"titles. Having lost interest in that tome after reading about fourpages, the author's books dropped off my radar.Recently, I found \\"Trojan Odyssey,\\" and bought it immediately when Isaw there was no co-author. The perfect vacation read, me thinks.I never noticed the prose before when reading a Dirk Pitt tale; thestories just flowed, and the writing never got in the way.Unfortunately the writing in \\"Trojan Odyssey\\" kept hitting me in theface like a splintery board. It was hard to see past it to followthe oh-so-thin plot. The first half of the book was the worst; itread like a Hardy Boys book, one penned by a particularly talentlessghostwriter. Clearly no one who could even spell \\"editor\\" looked atthat part of the text before publication. It didn't help that Itwigged to several major elements of the plot in about 20 nanoseconds.The writing improved noticably in the second half of the book, nearlyreaching the level of a mid-tier Hardy Boys. Surmounting the stilteddialog was still a struggle, but at least some of the subplots wereenjoyable.Years ago, readers of the last Travis McGee novel were surprised (aswas he) by the appearance of his adult child at the end of the book.I remember thinking this could be the death knell for a series about afree-spirited adventurer. Unfortunately, due to the untimely passingof John D. MacDonald, we never got to find out. It was certainlydeja vu when Dirk Pitt's adult twins turned up at the end of \\"ValhallaRising.\\" Reading \\"Trojan Odyssey\\" we get a sense of what might havebeen in store for the McGee franchise.As a man of a certain age facing the realities of getting older, Iwant to escape into a character who has heroic adventures, harrowingscrapes and dalliances with beautiful women. I'm not so interestedin reading about a character of a certain age facing the realities ofgetting older. In theory Pitt's progeny could pick up the slack, butonly if they weren't so lame.I'm willing to cough up ten!!! bucks for a well-crafted adventure storyof the quality of the previous Dirk Pitt novels. One actually writtenby the person whose name appears on the cover, and edited by someonewith at least a passing familiarity with English. One that doesn'tforce me to grit my teeth and plow through its surprisingly large typeby sheer force of will. One that doesn't leave me feeling cheated, asthis one did.Now that the diatribe is over, I want to return to the earlier DirkPitt novels for a minute. I think the series peaked with \\"Sahara,\\"but all the books through \\"Atlantis Found\\" are a ripping great readif you like adventure stories. \\"Valhalla Rising\\" is also recommended,but the \\"Pitt feels angst about getting old and starts behaving likea responsible adult\\" theme is a little depressing."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Let me start by saying that this is the only Dirk Pitt/Clive Cussler novel I've read so far. I have no opinion on any other DP books. This, however, was dreadful.This book's only redeeming point is the seemingly interesting theory about the Trojan Oddyssey having taken place in the Atlantic Ocean instead of the Mediterranean. Unfortunately, this theory has preciously little to do with the rest of the book, and seems to be there mainly as a selling point for a mostly unrelated (and very poor) story.The actual story is best compared to a bad James Bond movie (one from the seventies would do nicely), complete with super-villains, world-threatening schemes and secret bases. The problem here is that all of this is completely silly from start to finish (what on earth was up with the hologram pirates?). Everything is far-fetched, implausible, or most likely both. It also has none of the style and very little of the humor which often redeems James Bond.To make matters even worse, this movie must contain the worst characters in living history. From Dirk Pitt to the super-villain, they're all extremely dull and flat. Yet, no opportunity is wasted by the author to rub in how wonderful, beautiful and talented all these characters (supposedly) are. Together with lots of unnecessarily lengthy descriptions of just about everything, this book is truly full of filler.The characters are also completely super-human, apparently, since there doesn't seem to be anything that Pitt cum suis can't handle, including flying a helicopter into the hurricane of the century (just after the hurricane nearly took out a much more sturdy plane) and much more. This takes away any form of suspension there could have been.If this book didn't take itself so seriously, it might have worked. As it is, though, \\"Trojan Odyssey\\" is a totally daft, horribly written excuse for a book that does almost nothing with a potentially very entertaining theory."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I've been a Cussler fan since the mid-'80s and have read everything and anything his name his on. But I've got to say that this is by far my least favorite. The writing is pedestrian, the story predictable, and the characters just do not live up to their terrific heritage. The introduction of Dirk's kids is awkward, and at first more than a little confusing, since his son is also \\"Dirk Pitt.\\" I think what surprised me most was the repetition and appalling lack of editing the book recieved. Clive repeats facts, scenarios, and background information over and over again in different chapters, as if it was the first time being presented. It's almost like there were long gaps during his writing period where he had forgotten what he had already written. I guess that's understandable, but what's not understandable is how all this got past his editors! I would highly recommend most of Clive's books, but not this one."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"The prologue was bad, the next 20 pages were worse, I gave up after that."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"The plot may be doubtfully realistic, but it's not what bothers me about this book - Actually the plot idea is fairly exciting. The way the people talk to each other, really bothers me. It's either scriptspeak, or overtly complicated. It's just not realistic. Even in heated action the characters will use complicated play-on-words, analogies and sayings which seems completely ridiculous to me. The way brother and sister talk to each other also seems way overscripted and complicated. People just don't talk like that.Moreover there's a lack of degrees of contrast - From the happy happy rosy family dinners to the evil emotionless enemy (who will still be shocked, though, at seeing an american flag, while the good guys will stare in reverence.....sigh).But the base plot is good, and I kept on going because of that."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I have been reading Clive Cussler novels for 25 years. He has not written a bad novel yet. His stories are pure escapist, action adventure yarns. Do not judge his books by the two that have been made into movies. Sahara doesn't follow the novel at all. I think some of the other reviewers on this site are too [...] a novel that is soley intended to be mind candy. This is like a comic book with no pictures. A relaxing read perfect for the beach or a long flight. Keep'em coming Clive!"},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"the other reviews pretty much covered it: bad/no editing, annoying new pitt kid characters, scenes that could have been dramatic and page-turning but instead drab, big plot mistakes.the formula doesnt bother me, because many of the pitt novels follow the formula; many of the ealier ones work well within it . . . refer to shock wave or even atlantis found.all i ask from a cussler novel is to be amazed and informed in an exciting way, but i had to put this book down after a couple hundred pages. the opening had a lot of potential, but then it went nowhere, very slowly.i thought at first it was me--i havnt read a cussler novel in five years, but instead have been focusing on \\"fine literature\\" and reputable writers for my creative writing degree. i loved these books, but after so much dense prose i decided to reward myself with some fun reading instead. have i become jaded from so much classic liturature? nah, this is just plain horrible.if you're looking for a fun read, try the harry potter books or the da vinci code, just like everyone else."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"The Dirk Pitt series that has sprung from the keyboard of Clive Cussler over the past 20 years has badly needed a transfusion of excitement. That excitement is found in \\"Trojan Odyssey\\". Harkening back to a time when Cussler wrote more involved and complicated plots, \\"Trojan Odyssey\\" has a lot going for it. The staple characters, Pitt, Al Giordino, Admiral Sandecker, Rudi Gunn, and others are present as well as Dirk Pitt's newly discovered children, Dirk Jr. and Summer. While the two Pitt children are little more than sidebars in the plot, they are, nonetheless, being groomed by Cussler to replace Dirk Sr. and Al very shortly.The book's plot deals with the plan of a nefarious character (known as Specter) to create a global disaster involving a new ice age. Specter and his band of Amazon (Druid) female followers have begun building a tunnel through Nicaragua that will link the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans and create a temperature swing in the water temperature that will have a drastic effect on the climate of any land mass north of the 30th parallel.Dirk and Al do their best to foil the plan and and involved in a number of interesting situations along the way. Cussler actually revives the Pitt franchise somewhat with \\"Trojan Odyssey\\" and leaves his readers wanting more. Based on the ending, however, this reviewer is not sure that will happen with the Dirk Pitt series, but the ending at least left the door open to more adventures with Dirk and Al.If you're a Dirk Pitt fan, you will want to add this novel to your collection. It will not disappoint!"},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I think everyone has beaten to death the story of this book so I don't see a need to give a synopsis.I just enjoyed this book as a good beach read! If you are a true Dirk Pitt fan this is a fun one to read.Without giving away a lot of spoilers, this should really be the last Dirk Pitt book written. Dr. Cussler did a great job of cleanning up any loose ends. He's done a great job of giving all the true fans an ending that really is worthy of ending the series.However, it appears that this won't be the last book he writes for Pitt fans but it does appear a little bit that the next book will be written with his son. Could be nice to have a fresh view on things. Could also be interesting to see where he takes everything now that new things are in place.But, before I end this thing, does anyone else have a problem with the relationship between Dirk Pitt Jr. and his sister?! Thankfully, it was explained that they had \\"girlfriends/boyfriends\\" but without that, the relationship was a little too odd. Just my two cents!Bottom line, read this book as a Dirk Pitt fan. It's really important I think and it's also pretty fun."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Every few years, Dirk Pitt saves the world from an ecological disaster. This daunting task is always achieved, but only after harrowing adventures, dastardly villans, and heroics that are beyond mere mortals, such as I.This book is no exception. It IS a page-turner, a roller-coaster ride, and a lot of fun. It is NOT great literature or scholarly research. If that is what you want to read right now, then, as some other reviewers have suggested, go elsewhere for the moment. When you are ready for fun, read Trojan Odyssey.What I always enjoy about Cussler's work is the &quot;over the top&quot; physical deeds of heroism of Dirk and Al. Although they are getting a bit older, they still provide the thrills.While this may not be his best (I'm still partial to Sahara) it is very much worth the read for fans. Perhaps those who are new to Cussler's work should go back to a book that predates Flood Tide....get to know the players, and enjoy them. Just a thought. But for me, I wanted a &quot;Dirk Pit fix&quot; to enjoy, and I did."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I have read Clive Cussler novels for over 20 years and count some of his novels as the best I've ever read, in particular Sahara, Night Probe and Atlantis Found. I picked up Trojan Odyssey pretty much the day it came out and, like most of his books, devoured it quickly. And I have to admit that when I was done, I didn't have that &quot;Wow!&quot; reaction like I have had with many of his books, but I did enjoy it.I thought the typical catastrophic event that pervades Clive's novels was novel indeed. An evil corporation attempts to freeze out Europe using underground tunnels to attampt to change water temperatures in the oceans. He hasn't done that one before. Dirk Pitt and his partner Al Giordino again go through much agony to save the planet once again.Of course, what has changed here is the addition to the storytelling of Dirk Pitt's newly discovered twins, Summer and Dirk, who made their initial appearance at the end of Clive's previous novel, Valhalla Rising. I have to admit that I'm not a big fan of the twins, primarily because they are exactly like their namesakes (their mother, Summer Moran, was a character in the very first Pitt novel, Pacific Vortex). I wish Clive had made them a different from Dirk Sr. and Summer Sr. But I was glad that they only have a secondary role here. I hope it stays that way in the future.All that said, if you've never read a Cussler novel, I think you'll enjoy it. If you've read the entire Cussler catalog, I can see why you might be disappointed a little. But understand that Clive wrote this with a heavy heart as he lost his wife of 40+ years, Barbara, to cancer early in 2003. He still plugged away for his fans, so I'm going to cut him some slack. I'll bet the next Pitt novel will be a great one!"},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Trojan Odyssey written by Clive Cussler is a fictious novel that is easy to read and is pure adventure entertainment. Dirk Pitt, Cusslers alter ego, battles a deadly foe as in his other books, but things are a bit different in this book, Pitt has help.After finishing \\"Valhalla Rising\\" we are introducted to two new characters... these being Dirk Pitt's fraternal twin children with Summer Moran... Summer and Dirk. This introduction of Pitt's grown children makes for some interesting reading and scenes in the book.Cussler fleshes out his characters in this book and we get a pretty good impression as to who's who and what's what. Cussler's books are entertaining and they all follow closely to a pattern and this book is no exception. Here Dirk Pitt doesn't make an appearence till page 102 so we get a lot of background and some interesting underwater scenes with Summer and Dirk,Jr.Of course, there is a meglomaniac involved with a world disaster, the mysterious Mr. Specter is the current edition. This book has bits and pieces of Celtic lore and Druidnesses making for an interesting read.This isn't one of Cussler best book, but it isn't one of his worst either. I gave this book a solid 4 stars for it's readability... it's bubble gum sugar treat for the brain. It is an entertaining read with dazzling suspense and really good action. This is a book that shows Dirk Pitt getting older, ready to wrap things up with facing off with the bad guys, and it has some twists and turns in it to make it interestingly intriguing."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"One very important point to remember when reading Clive Cussler books, they are meant to be purely entertaining. Any rescue or feat of survival that appears possible in the real world is merely accidental, the escapes from certain death are to be expected and accepted.Dirk's back, but there has been a major change to his life. He has discovered that he is the father of a pair of fraternal twins who are now 23 years old and he has had to make a complete readjustment of his life's priorities. His children, named Summer and Dirk, are every bit as intrepid as their father and have both been given jobs working with him at the National Underwater and Marine Agency (NUMA). The whole Pitt family are all involved in the start of adventure, with Dirk and Summer trying to work out the origin of a massive slick of brown crud that is killing the sea-life in the Caribbean. Like so many other Dirk Pitt adventures it appears that a mysterious multi-billionaire megalomaniac is behind the environmental disaster in the making, with even grander and earth shattering plans in store. Again, like other Dirk Pitt stories, the evil mastermind is willing to use deadly force to keep his nefarious activities a secret. It's up to Dirk and his sidekick Al Giordino to save the day - and the world.Clive Cussler sticks to his tried and true formula, starting with a brief history lesson, this time harking back to the Trojan Wars around 1190 B.C. and then fast forwarding to 2006 and the research being undertaken in the Caribbean where, lo and behold they come across an ancient artefact. As usual, a nice job is made of marrying the ancient story to the present day crisis. The second part of the formula involves Dirk Pitt saving the world, yet remaining stoically modest about his role in proceedings. We all know it's going to happen; it's just a matter of how Dirk's going to get us there.Unfortunately, this Dirk Pitt thriller isn't the fast-paced thrill ride of earlier books. You get the distinct impression that Dirk Pitt is getting tired and is preparing to call it a day. The usual snap is missing and the heights of excitement just aren't reached, probably reflective of Dirk's malaise. Sure, the corny dialogue, improbable escapes and unbelievable rescues are there, but the edge feels as though it's missing. Could it be that the young Pitts will soon be taking over from their old man?If you've never read a Dirk Pitt story before I would advise against starting with this one. Dirk Pitt has come a long way and been through many adventures and does quite a bit of reminiscing about the past. Better books to start with (and these are the first ones I read) might be Dragon, Sahara or Inca Gold, but don't forget the warning at the top of the review because this can't be stressed often enough, these books aren't to be taken seriously."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Sigh. For something like twenty years these have been my guilty pleasures. I've eagerly bought each new Dirk Pitt adventure the week, or even the day, it was released. This will probably be the last.The copyright on this book is held by something called &quot;Sandecker, RLLLP&quot;, which seems to mean that it wasn't written by Clive himself. The writing in the first 2/3 of the book is simply terrible. The plot is sketchy and formulaic: historic nautical event, modern disaster averted by our heroes while finding some artifact, trip to Perlmutter's, research by Yaeger, etc., etc.It usually works for me, but this time it felt like the author was going through the motions. The dialogue is even more stiff than usual -- and that's saying something for a Cussler book! Even the character names are ... weak -- Specter, a pair named Dodge &amp; Ford, a island native named Moreau (as least he's not a doctor).One of the hallmarks of the older Cussler books was his accuracy and the chance to learn a little something. Here, the book loses ALL credibility when in the first 25-50 pages, you have a meteorologist simply make up a name for a hurricane. I can't imagine Clive, who's spent his share of time on the sea, either not knowing or not thinking his readers would know about the pre-ordained list of hurricane names from the NOAA or whomever. A small factual quibble perhaps, but to me it was quite telling.That said, I still got sucked in and was up until 2:30 last night finishing the darn thing. If it weren't for one semi-cliff hanger, I might have thought this was to be the last Pitt book. I guess it's not.When does the next one come out? Hopefully, Clive will write it himself. By then, I'll probably have forgotten how bad most of this book was and be ready to jump back on the band wagon. Sigh."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Who wrote this trash? It seems like Mr. Cussler may have written the outline, and left the details to folk who have no clue.The plot is obvious, the technical details absurd. Even the geographic details lack any realism. Go north fron Nicaragua and find Key West? Not on any map I've ever seen.Maybe it's time for Mr. Cussler to retire along with Dirk. Either that or start writing the whole story again."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Clive Cussler's latest Dirk Pitt adventure is a fitting addition to the bestselling series. While some may lament a slight shift of the narrative focus to Pitt's children (at the conclusion of Valhalla Rising Pitt discovered that he had 24-year old twins), that the original Dirk enters the narrative at the 100 page mark heralds the beginning of another enthralling adventure by Cussler's intrepid hero. The plot is standard Cussler fare, opening with the mythical voyage of Odysseus following the Trojan war before moving to a present-day disaster of cataclysmic proportions. Naturally, Dirk Pitt and Al Giordino uncover sinister details behind this disaster and face off against yet another mystery.While Trojan Odyssey may not be the best in the series, it is certainly a rollicking good tale not only for new readers but for Cussler fans, eager to find out what could possibly be Pitt's last adventure."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"This book is full of errors and contridictions. As mentioned by another reviewer, the hurricane entitled Lizzie originates off the Cape Verde Islands near Africa (paperback edition, pg 25 para 2), travels EAST (pg 104 para 1) WEST (pg 116 para 4) again EAST (pg132 para 4), SOUTHEAST (pg 144 para 6), all the while traveling in a straight line, as if on a railroad track (again pg 104, para 1). I always thought the Caribbean was west of Africa.Also, not necessarily an error but a bit misleading, the hruricane moves about 50 miles into Nicaragua and dies. This is from the east coast (pg 144, para 6), but later when discussing the damage there, the statement is made that next to Haiti, the WEST coast of the country is the poorest stepchild of the Western Hemisphere (pg 182 para 1)Another bit of confusion is the statement regarding service provided by Commodore Vanderbilt moving people across Nicaragua, CUTTING OFF HUNDREDS OF MILES BY NOT SAILING AROUND CAPE HORN BUT ALSO SAVING ANOTHER THOUSAND MILES BYPASSING THE ISTHMUS AT PANAMA. ?????????????A contridiction occurs when the book states that they will be pumping the South Equatorial Current into the Pacific (pg 369 para 2) but into the Atlantic (pg 421 para 4)There are other misconceptions in the book, such as the characters yelling at one another because they are standing near a noisy ventilation fan while endeavoring to be stealthy. Loud noises do not necessarily mask other sounds near them, loud noises make it hard to hear when the listener is close to them. Try standing near your running garbage grinder and speaking to someone further away; they can hear you, you can't hear them.Althgether a hard book to read, confusing to say the least. Not up to the standards of some of his earlier books."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"This is the first Clive Cussler novel I've ever read, and will probably be my last. I can deal with the ridiculous plot line, the impossibly perfect good guys, and the nothing-but-evil bad girls, but I kept getting bogged down in adjectives and distracted by mistakes. Although not to my taste, Trojan Odyssey is not so much badly written as it is VERY BADLY EDITED. Nothing, it seems, is too minor to be described in minute, painstaking detail. (Obviously Mr. Cussler loves good food and classic cars.) Occasionally this leads to humor when the long string of adjectives end up inadvertently pointing to the wrong word. This is no doubt due to careless editing, which is also displayed by not catching the repetition of something already stated in the previous sentence (something along the lines of: Having never been here before, she . . . . . . She had never been here before.). Another example would be when Dirk sent Renee below to make Molotov cocktails, at which point she \\"disappeared below.\\" Six paragraphs later on the same page, Dirk, still on deck, tells Renee to lay low and take cover behind the things they've piled on the stern. Then two pages later Renee reappears on deck with the Molotov cocktails. Even with better editing this wouldn't be one of my favorite books, but I wouldn't have felt like I was trudging though sludge trying to get through it. It took me longer than usual to read this book because I couldn't stop putting it down!"},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I am not a follower of Cussler's books...a friend gave me this as a gift. Cussler's plot suffers from poor writing and even poorer editing. Statements like \\"...win, or occasionally lose, which wasn't that often.\\" make no sense. How does something like this make it past an editor's desk? Unnecessary words hinder textual flow. If you say \\"occasionally\\" you don't need \\"which wasn't that often\\". The book is full of this type of writing.If you are a fan...go ahead. If you are used to reading polished authors, you will be annoyed."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"this is my first cussler novel, and seeing as this particular book is the last of a series maybe i needed to get some background on the characters before reading it. now that i have read it the chance of this happening is zero. Simply put this book has nothing to recommend. the plot is dull,the lack of excitement is astonishing for such a well known author, the two main characters Pitt and Giordino whilst on their deeds of derring do never come close to being in any danger at all. what surprised me the most was the numbing dialogue, characters often explaining the banal with regularity, and if you use dialogue to explain all of the plot it better be done well,otherwise,like this novel,its gonna be sooo bad."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I've only read the first half of Trojan Odyssey but I'm not sure that I can finish it. The writing is that bad. The dialog is stiff and unnatural. The plot seems to be going nowhere. There is lots of \\"filler\\" that doesn't add to the story -- it just makes it longer and more difficult to read.Several pages in the first half of the book are devoted to an airplane designed to fly into hurricanes to gather weather information. The plane is literally torn to pieces, but a NUMA helicopter is able to enter the eye of the storm to drop Dirk and Al onto a floating hotel without sustaining any damage? Once our heroes arrive at the hotel, they have only two or three hours before the second wall of the worst hurricane ever recorded hits full force. It never happens. They hook up the cables and the hotel is safely pulled out of danger at a speed of one to two knots!I read an interview in the local paper with Mr. Cussler and based on it I believe that his son is taking over the series. Was this book perhaps written by him instead of Clive? It definitely doesn't appear to be written by the same person who wrote Sahara and Inca Gold."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Although Clive Cussler can still spin a good yarn, this was basically a disappointing book. Clive Cussler's work has gone way downhill, and the character development is shockingly thin. The introduction of Summer Jr. and Dirk Jr. at the end of the last book could have presented an opportunity for Mr. Cussler to pump some life in to a series that is getting very tired - instead, he squandered that by leaving them as one-dimensional clones of their parents: who cares? Also, it was totally obvious that someone (Mr. Cussler's editor?) forced him to insert a paragraph that led the reader away from thinking something bizarre was going on between Dirk's children. This book needed another good edit (lots of obvious typographical mistakes and inconsistencies) and needed to trade character quantity for depth.Finally, the &quot;shocking&quot; change in Dirk's personal life at the end is a really obvious attempt to pump some life in to this series (just like introducing Dirk's children). Because I was hugely disappointed by this book, I am not optimistic about Mr. Cussler's next effort.Also, I was a bit disturbed by the three (?) snide political references to President Clinton and liberals in the book. What's that about? They were wildly inappropriate.If you're a fan of Mr. Cussler, go ahead and give it a try (but try to pick it up from the library or wait for paperback). If you've never read Mr. Cussler, do yourself a huge favor and choose a different book to start."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Dirk Pitt, special projects director of NUMA, is constantly running around the world, discovering spectacular shipwrecks, solving unusual riddles of the sea, and saving the unsuspecting people of the world from total devastation. He is the James Bond of North America, and like his British counterpart, the books about him are very lightweight, but fun to read. There's always an interesting reversal of world history or literature, this time being the &quot;real&quot; location of Troy, and the &quot;true&quot; route of Odysseus home. It's quite intriguing, and I actually found it fascinating, but it was a mere sideshow to the deadly menace of a group of latter-day female Celtic druids. The action is non-stop, and as long as you don't spend a lot of time thinking about the absurdities of the plot, you'll enjoy the book. Also, like Alfred Hitchcock in his movies, Mr. Cussler insists upon inserting himself in his books. I find it fun to wait for his appearance."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Trojan Odyssey begins with a barebones recitation of the Iliad and the Odyssey, with minor variations on those familiar stories. Then, Dirk's twin adult children, marine engineer Dirk and marine biologist Summer (who both work for NUMA), find themselves in the pathway of a once-in-a-millennium hurricane after uncovering unexpected artifacts while searching for the cause of what is killing marine life. The same storm threatens a new semi-submersible luxury hotel, which is abandoned to its fate by its secretive billionaire owner. The book begins to get interesting when Dirk Pitt and Al Giordino appear from nowhere to attempt a rescue of the hotel. Later in the book Pitt and Giordino uncover a massive subterranean excavation project for an unknown purpose. Eventually, they discover a connection between all of these elements that has important implications for the world and Dirk's own children.Mr. Cussler often gives us fascinating mysteries to think about that cause us to see the world differently. In Trojan Odyssey, he opens up new dimensions of how climate is influenced by the ocean and what ancient writings might mean. When the story finally takes fire in pursuing those mysteries around page 320, Trojan Odyssey becomes a typical Dirk Pitt adventure thriller. Until then, I found Trojan Odyssey to be the least satisfying Dirk Pitt book I have read by a wide margin.Part of the problem seems to relate to adding Dirk and Summer as important new characters. However, Mr. Cussler makes poor use of them in the story. They just pursue activities that Dirk and Al would normally do . . . and do much better. So Dirk and Al just have two more people to get out of trouble. But any characters would have done for that purpose.The book's ending suggests better things could be ahead, so I suggest giving Mr. Cussler one more chance after this book before abandoning what has been a fun action series for many years.If you haven't read any other Dirk Pitt books, go back and read any of the earlier ones. They are all better than this one."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I've been reading Cussler's Dirk Pitt novels since grade school - always fascinated by the fantastic scenarios and engaged by engrossing action.Sadly, Pitt is getting a bit long in the tooth. Pages spent on the decor and menus of local restaurants, descriptions of female characters' cosmetic applications straight out of Vogue, and even brief details provided re: sending facsimiles and other trivial action all seem hopelessly out of another time (not 2006 as suggested), and out of place (not occupying the mind of our alert hero, who may or may not share ALL of his author's preoccupations).I purchased this book on sight. Cussler + Trojan War should = instant delight and a very fast read. However, with rather obvious plot developments leading the way, accompanied by seemingly irrelevant and distracting scenes and/or descriptions of fleeting settings necessitated by said scenes, this has not turned out to be the speedy, pleasurable read I usually associate with Cussler. Furthermore, the introduction of Pitt's kids is going... where?Of course, anyone who's read the other Pitt adventures MUST read this one, if only to enjoy the quality of Cussler's premise - as good as any that have come before. The discovery of Troy is certainly right up there with Atlantis, et. al. Any true fan will forgive Cussler this time - hopefully he'll reinvigorate the franchise next time around.And who knows, perhaps Cussler will yet pull off a feat that few other action writers have dared attempt: Realistically aging his hero to the point of retirement, while retaining the audience. I, for one, will keep rooting for Pitt - and Cussler - either way."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I have read nearly 200 books, primarily novels in the past 3 years, including several Clive Cussler novels...this book is without a doubt the worst book I have ever read, period.Do yourself a favor and literally run from this book. If you see a spare copy laying around somewhere...set it on fire.First of all, the story line is ridiculous. Cussler is trying to put together evil villians, women who think they're ancient goddesses, Greek mythology, etc. and make some kind of plot/storyline out of it. It's horrible!Secondly, the dialogue is even worse (if that's possible). It was SO bad I started highlighting the stupid phrases, things nobody would ever say in real life. I stopped reading the book when my highlighter went dry from all of the marks.And lastly, I thought if Cussler spent another full page describing one of Pitt's stupid cars, or leapt from the story line into another 8 sentence description of some wine that's being drunk, I was gonna have to kill myself.Have I mentioned how horribly bad this book is??? Seriously, Clive Cussler, if you read these, I want my money back, all $8.50 of it. Please do NOT write another book, retire."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Having read Golden Buddha recently (which I was very disappointed with), I wasn't sure I wanted to read Trojan Odyssey, so I let my father-in-law read it first. When he told me he thought it was Clive's best Dirk Pitt book yet, I was intrigued. I began reading and was soon so entranced with it, I couldn't put it down. Every spare moment I had, I picked this up to continue reading.I have to say that Clive is truly back in form, his writing is superfluous, his research impeccable. He breathes life into every one of his characters, no matter how short a 'life' they have. Although fiction, Clive has a knack for making the implausible possible.The story begins with a hurricane of unheard magnitude that devastates the shores off Nicaragua and almost kills hundreds of people in a luxury floating hotel, not to mention Pitt's twin children, Summer and Dirk, who are conducting research in an underwater enclosure in the hurricane's path. And this is just the beginning. There are evil red-headed women to contend with, a link to the story Homer made famous in The Odyssey, the opposite of global warming (brrr) and a little bit of romance thrown in (but not too much for you diehard Dirk Pitt fans).I have a soft spot for Night Probe, but Trojan Odyssey is easily the next best Dirk Pitt adventure yet.

They, like their father, love the ocean and work for NUMA where they investigate toxic contamination that is destroying the fragile sea life in the Caribbean ecosystem. While taking samples underwater, they discover a man made palace that sunk to the bottom of the sea millennia ago. While NUMA scientists analyze the find, the twins head to an island off of Guadeloupe to see if a sailing expedition lies beneath the waters and if so is it from the same era that was found in the Caribbean.Their father is saving a floating hotel from a force five hurricane before going to Nicaragua where the toxic contamination seems to be originating from. He finds a company owned by a mysterious four hundred pound man is working with the Chinese to construct underground tunnels that will connect one ocean to another. When he learns what the tunnels will be used for, he and the U.S. government try to stop them without creating an international incident.Clive Cussler always writes an exciting action thriller that appeals to readers of both genders. Pitt is a modern day James Bond who hooks the readers into hoping that his heroic acts won't get him killed. The hero realizes with a family to care for he can't take so many chances and is prepared to change his lifestyle. In the last part of the book, the protagonist feels he will cross paths with his enemy once more implying hopefully that there will be more Dirk Pitt novels in the future.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Before I received this book as a gift, I remembered reading in the news that Clive Cussler was retiring from writing, and so with great dread I knew that the Dirk Pitt-NUMA novels were coming to an end. So I was pleasantly surprised when Cussler released this book, as I was not expecting to see anymore Dirk Pitt novels. However, as I read this book, I could sense Cussler winding things down for Dirk and his pal Al Giordino. This is not to say that there is any less action in this book than there was in his other Dirk Pitt adventures. I have read EVERY book of fiction that Clive Cussler has written (both NUMA files series - Dirk Pitt and Kurt Austin - and the new Oregon files series), and &quot;Trojan Odyssey&quot; is not one of his best, but I was still entertained.As one other reviewer mentioned, be sure to read &quot;Valhalla Rising&quot; before you read &quot;Trojan Odyssey&quot; because of the new characters that were introduced in the former.If you're as big a Clive Cussler fan as I am, you'll enjoy this book, but you'll recognize that Cussler's heart didn't seem to be in it quite to the extent that it was in his earlier novels.This was a good book, but not outstanding."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I've enjoyed Cussler for several years. I admire his work in marine archeology. But he's no longer on my buy vs library list after this one. The one saving grace for the book is it exposes the reader to Iman Wilkens' hypothesis about the location of Troy and the evolution of the Illiad and Odyssey. Beyond that the book is littered with factual errors a sixth grader would spot. The characterizations are the thinnest parody of the worst of the Bond Movies. The tempo is uneven. The dilemmas are so over drawn as to give melodrama a good name. The basic premise is the least plausible one to show up in one of his books. I read it through hoping it would improve, and it just got worse and worse.At the very best this book is better than being trapped in an airport with absolutely nothing else to read...but only just."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Four sentences, pulled at random from different chapters, should tell you all you need to know:\\"Now as their objective stood before them it became obvious that unlike the others towns and cities they had sacked, this one would not fall without a long and lengthy campaign.\\"\\"'You ain't gonna believe this,' he answered in a Georgia accent, 'but the last dropwindsonde profiling system I released recorded horizontal wind speeds of up to two hundred and twenty miles an hour as it fell through the storm toward the sea.'\\"\\"Exotically designed minibuses with luxurious interiors and painted lavender pulled up to the aircraft to accommodate the passengers.\\"\\"Seemingly adhered to the marble slab, he could not move nor turn his head.\\"Talk about phoning in your work!

Is this the novel where Mr. Cussler's problems with simple science began? Or am I gonna have to go back and re-read some of his earlier works?My mental warning sirens went off as I read the description of Summer Pitt diving in tropical waters in a full dry suit as protection against suspected toxic substances in the water. Leaving aside for the moment the question of whether an off-the-rack dry suit was ever intended to be an effective shield against an irritating or perhaps lethal contaminant, was it not ludicrous to begin the paragraph by mentioning the wisps of auburn hair that were peeking out from under her dry suit's hood? Wouldn't that compromise the suit's seal?Further on, Summer and her twin brother Dirk Jr. were left at their undersea habitat by the NUMA research ship. A hurricane was bearing down and there wasn't enough time to carry out the long decompression process that would allow them to surface without suffering the \`bends.' When the NUMA vessel returned after almost being sunk in the hurricane (and not visiting any port in the meantime), it miraculously had a hyperbaric chamber on board, which then allowed the two castaways to be quickly treated after their rescue from the now-tattered habitat. Wouldn't it have been more logical to employ the chamber before the hurricane struck, thereby removing the two siblings from immediate danger? Or at least concoct a story as to why the chamber couldn't be used sooner.Oh, and what type of helicopter has an operational ceiling sufficient to fly over a typical hurricane (which easily tops out above 30,000 feet) so as to bring Dirk Sr. and Al down through the eye to engineer the rescue of the giant floating hotel? Finally, the Spanish translation of \\"Little Tuna\\" for Sandecker's new gizmo-packed boat can be misinterpreted as \\"slightly pretty\\" in English. Better \\"el At&uacute;n Peque&ntilde;o\\" or something similar.Since I'm only one-third the way through the book, I suppose there will be more of these issues to come!"},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I have read all of the Dirk Pitt novels and I would count this one the one that departs from the typical Cussler yarn the most. Dirk is much more introspective, soul searching, etc. The story itself I would rate as a little better than the average Dirk Pitt novel. I would recommend this as a must read for Pitt fans because of the changes that he experiences during the book. It will be interesting to see where he goes from here."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"THOUGH MUCH BETTER THAN HIS &quot;GOLDEN BUDDHA&quot; WHICH I TORE UP IN DISGUST, CUSSLER SEEMS TO REWRITE THE SAME FORMULAIC STORY LINE, OVER AND OVER.

This book was fantastic! I've read every Clive Cussler book to date, and this one did not disappoint. Once I started reading this, I couldn't stop. Believe me, it's that good!"},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Cussler's veteran hero Dirk Pitt has stood him (and us) in good stead over the years. Cussler has even had the good manners not to pretend that time stands still for Pitt the way it has for James Bond through more than four authors over half a century (\\"Casino Royale\\" was released in 1953). Now it has me wondering whether or not Pitt is about to retire. He's become very serious about his longtime love Representative Loren Smith. There's a strong hint that Pitt is about to be promoted. His long-lost twin son and daughter have come back into his life and are following in his footsteps with NUMA (it's them who discover a potential biological disaster in the Caribbean that may be man-made and deliberate). For years Cussler has been introducing a slightly-younger hero into the NUMA ranks with the help of co-author Paul Kemprecos. But is Cussler going to do a Tom Clancy and also bring Dirk Pitt Junior in as a hero in his own right? It seems possible as two generations of Pitts go after a mega-rich villain very much in the Goldfinger mold. There's one bit of irony here as life imitates art. This book came out in hardcover last November, at the end of the Atlantic hurricane season. Central to the first half of the story is a huge storm so big and nasty that NOAA scientists skip several letters of the alphabet to name it after axe murderer Lizzie Borden. Several months later, between the release of the two editions, we in Florida get clobbered in the real world by a record-setting four humongous blows."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"This goes right in there with all the other Clive Cussler books. Clive takes you on an amazing ride and has you sitting on the edge of your seat.With the exciting adventures, the great cars, and the charismatic main characters Cussler makes a wonderful book and makes you really think about what really happened at Troy."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Being a huge Clive Cussler fan I usually grab a copy of any new novel he releases. Trojan Odyssey was no exception, however the quality of the writing makes me suspect that Mr. Cussler is on hiatus. This book could not have been written by my favorite author, it's not even average. After seeing Robert Ludlum release a new book (apparently from his grave) I'm beginning to believe that there ought to be a disclosure if the work is not that of the author listed on the cover."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I realize this is fiction, and I realize an author can take liberty with his works, but I have to admit: I am used to authors who try to remember what has happened in their own previous creations. Cussler obviously doesn't care anymore. For one, how can Loren's father be present when Dirk found his DEAD BODY at the bottom of a lake in Vixen 03?! And HOW can Cussler write that Loren strayed and returned when Dirk slept with how many women?! Pot meet Kettle! And finally, I never understood how the twins exist at all since Dirk and Summer never had sex! I'm going to attempt to forget that this book was ever written!"},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Having read the joint effort, 'White Death' and this latest Dirk offering back-to-back, the former pales into insignificance against the latter. After the shocking finale to the previous Atlantis Found, whereby Dirk discovered he had adult twins, Dirk and Summer, born to his previously thought deceased wife of twenty-plus years ago, Cussler moves into Trojan Odysessy with a new lease of life. He also chooses to link the timeframes of White Death and this novel together with a brief meeting between Dirk and Kurt at NUMA, as the latter heads to the Canadian \`fishery' that is so prominent in White Death. Unfortunately, White Death makes no mention of the storm of the century even though Kurt and Joe have heard about Dirk and the Ocean Wanderer. Still....Historical purists might wince at the paraphrasing of the Illiad and the Odyssey by our author, his condensing of ten years of epic into a ten week battle between the Dardanians and the Achaeans and a new slant on the Trojan Horse, but it has its reasons in the story to follow....The first part (and full third) of the novel opens at high speed with the storm of the century (Hurricane Lizzy) defying all previously known hurricane traits hurling herself across the Atlantic with 250mph+ winds devastating all human sea activity. Caught up are Dirk and Summer who are used as the storm's plaything in their marine outpost, Pisces. Having previously discovered a rare bronze urn in the shipwrecked Vandalia (thus linking us into our prologue) they narrowly escape death and are rescued by the ever familiar Dirk and Al, who have previously saved over a thousand lives on a floating hotel called Ocean Wanderer (owned by the mysterious Specter) together with the NUMA ship Sea Sprite and her hardly captain, Barnum from the effect of the hurricane.Part Two commences with the bronze artefact and Dirk's and Summer's instruction to investigate it more fully whilst Pitt and Giordino head towards Nicaragua to investigate the brown crud that is originating in the area, threatening the sealife. Whilst down there they come under scrutiny from the Odyssey corporation who promptly try to blow them up then chase them off with a hologrammatic projection of the pirate Leigh and some well placed missiles. Several battles later they end up in one of four great tunnels designed to allow the Pacific ocean into the Atlantic - allowing Max to prophesy an arctic winter for Europe for eight months a year - designed to enable the Odyssey corporation to cash in on their new source of free nitrogen-based energy.It ends up down to Pitt and Giordino to storm the Odyssey bastion, capture the evil Flidais and set off a volcanic eruption to literally squash the scheme. Meanwhile, Dirk and Summer end up on a celtic sacrificial altar as the other half of Odyssey, Epona, continues her personal insanity. Along the way Cussler gets to propose his alternative location for the battle of Troy and hence where Odysseus' voyage actually went. Inevitably, the Navidad Bank where the artefacts were located ended up being Circe's island and the treasure haul that Epona and Flidais had previously located had funded their empire.This volume is clearly a turning point in the Pitt series. By the end Al is moving on to technical director of NUMA, Sandecker's running for Vice President and Dirk is to become head of NUMA, thus paving the way for \`Pitt:The Next Generation' novels which may be no bad thing. This latest volume is enjoyable in a true Cussler style and is portrayed as Dirk's swansong on the front line but so long as he retains an appearance in the future adventures then fans will continue to read them. A vastly exciting volume, Cussler has produced one of his better Dirk Pitt novels and, at least for now, has nothing to fear from Kurt Austin...."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"You have to develop a taste for Clive Cussler. He is simply outrageous with overblown plots, superhero characters and enough miracles of timing and coincidence that force credulity to its limits.That said, Cussler writes some of the most entertaining, exciting novels to be found. They read quickly and definitely have the ability to keep you awake long into the night.This time, unassuming, always modest, strategically well connected and fortunately wealthy Dirk Pitt has been reunited with his two unknown children after 20 years.All work for NUMA, a mysterious US government agency that concerns itself with a wide host of marine issues.A monster hurricane introduces us to Specter, a mysterious global tycoon who has anchored a hotel off an island lying directly in the path of this killer storm. Dirk and friends rescue the hotel while the meanie Specter escapes.Without a day off, Dirk and his ever present companion Al Giordino go off to explore mysterious construction in Central America - and needless to say discover a nefarious plot to dominate the world. I'll save the details for your reading --- it's way more fun to read the book and see it all unfold.Dirk's children (trouble prone as you might expect in the children of unassuming superheros) in the meantime discover remnants of the fabled Trojan era civilization in the Carribbean Sea. That is a story onto itslef and a fascinating one at that.Cussler requires you to set aside your sense of credulity. And you know what? It's worth it. He is a magnificient writer and carries you away with his story, no matter how unbelievable it becomes.Jerry"},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Having read Golden Buddha recently (which I was very disappointed with), I wasn't sure I wanted to read Trojan Odyssey, so I let my father-in-law read it first.

(although his recent penchant for including himself in a cameo appearance in his novels is a little bizaar!) I did not care for this latest effort. In fact after reading about 1/4 of the book I just closed it up and said &quot;Nope, I'm not going to waste my time with this drivel. Seems like he wrote it just to meet a deadline. Nothing new or exciting really. So, I'm thinking Cussler is off my list of authors to seek out for awhile."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"A Christmas present that comes early has arrived once again with the new Dirk Pitt novel by Clive Cussler entitled Trojan Odyssey. Once again Cussler has combined known history,action, adventure, romance, a evil villian and drama together. Cussler combines the plots of a terrible hurricane, a mysterious discovery by Summer Pitt, a evil man named Spector, a substance affecting the ocean, and mysterious tunnels. You will not be disapointed by Trojan Odyssey, it the typical Cussler and will be hard to put down. This novel also has great heart in it and leaves you wondering what happens next for Dirk Pitt, Al and company. Read this book it is well worth it for any Dirk Pitt fan."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"At the end of 'Valhalla Rising' we found out quite by surprise that Dirk Pitt, hero and world-class adventurer has not just one, but TWO children (fraternal twins Dirk Jr. &amp; Summer). This came as quite a shocker, especially for those of us who have known Dirk to be quite the ladies man -- but also a confirmed bachelor. His relationship with Congresswoman Loren Smith has come CLOSE to wedding bells once before, but I personally figured that if it didn't happen THEN, it was probably NOT going to happen at ALL. However, I've learned long ago to NEVER say NEVER.As usual, 'Trojan Odyssey' begins with an interesting re-telling of Homer's Odyssey, a version that is apparently gaining in popularity. How does it tie-in with events from today? As is always the case, finding out is half the fun. Summer &amp; Dirk Jr. are busy attempting to examine a tide of brown crud that has infested waters in the Carribbean when they stumble upon something extraordinary (well Summmer does, at first). Suddenly things take a nasty turn as the Mother of ALL Hurricanes begins to form and head directly towards Summer &amp; Dirk Jr. and also towards the most unique floating Hotel ever designed. Can they all safely escape before the Hurricane arrives? Maybe, maybe not. Along the way Dirk Sr. and Al make an appearance and suddenly as a direct result, their plans for the next few weeks are set in motion. Are massive tunnels being excavated underneath Central America, and if so, for what purpose? Once Dirk &amp; Al figure it out, an all-out race is on to avert an incredible disaster of amazing proportions.Along the way, Dirk Sr. and Al discover one of lifes more unfair absolute rules: we cannot remain young forever. Getting shot at and risking your life can only remain fun for so long. Dirk realizes that with the sudden appearance of two grown children his death defying exploits are no longer a challenge, and more of a major hindrance to his ultimate goals. Dirk does a LOT of soul searching, and along the way it wasn't hard to figure out where it would eventually end up. Is 'Trojan Odyssey' the last outing for Dirk Sr. as a souped up version of James Bond? Maybe. I can't answer that for certain, but with a son named Dirk Jr. it can safely be assumed that Dirk Pitt adventures WILL continue.Along the way I found a few genuine surprises (Admiral Sandecker's New appointment for one) and a few genuine sad moments for us die-hard Dirk Sr. fans. Unlike James Bond who will forever remain youthful, Clive has treated us fans to one simple reality: we ALL grow older, and so did Dirk. He no longer can do all the stunts he used to without serious repercussions. Healing from wounds no longer are as quick as they used to be, and the thought of leaving his two children without a Father begins to seriously force Dirk to re-think his life. I finished 'Trojan Odyssey' with mixed emotions. Did I enjoy it? Absolutely. Did it make me excited about what was on the horizon for Dirk &amp; Co.? Again, yes. But it also saddened me at the same time. You will just have to read it for yourself to figure out what all of this means, and why.Clive continues to be the BEST action/adventure author writing today, and no matter WHAT it is, if his name is on it, you can be rest assured that I WILL be reading it. Long Live Clive &amp; Dirk Pitt, both senior &amp; junior."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Like all of Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt novel's this one has our heroe's battling some dastardly plot to destroy or take over the world. This one is somewhat different from the others in that the adult son &amp; daughter that Pitt learned he had in the last page or two of Valhalla Rising are now working at NUMA.The book starts with what has become Cussler's formula of some great event occuring at some point in the past and then moving forward to the present day,in this case Aug-Nov 2006. A super hurricane is about to wipe out some fantastic floating hotel when Dirk Sr. and Al Giordino arrive to save the day,kind of a wasted story element as it is only lightly linked to the rest of the book (D.Sr. &amp; Al don't even appear until chapter 8 by the way).The rest of the novel switches back and forth between Pitt's children and the older generation, sometimes together but more often not. You'll find the usual mix of a great old car or two, narrow escapes and explosions tempered by Pitt (you'll almost need a score card to keep track of which Dirk you're reading about, Sr. is usually referred to as Pitt, Jr. as Dirk) and Al referring to the years getting to them.The stories have been going on for almost 25 years now and it seemed to me that at times Cussler was ignoring past story plot lines although many times he'd put something in about a lot of the past adventures. A couple of times there was a problem with the timeline - Valhalla was set in 2003 but Trojan Odyssey, set only 2 years later, is set in 2006. Another time warp occurs when a man is sacrificed by the evil Druid group, the way subsequent events regarding the man's holdings are related far to much time goes by to fit into the general storyline.In the end all ends well with Pitt marrying longtime love Congresswoman Loren Smith, and it looks like he and Al will have job promotions at Numa. Cussler himself makes his usual appearance in the story but this time only in the last page or so.Mr. Cussler may be planning to retire, I kind of wonder from the tone of this book. I wonder if someone else will write some Dirk Jr. &amp; Summer Pitt novels, perhaps Paul Kemprecos whose Kurt Austin &amp; Joe Zavala characters are very briefly in this book."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I am always excited when I see a new Dirk Pitt novel (not one of those poor &quot;Kurt Austin&quot; collaborations).However, almost right off the bat I sensed that this was not going to be one of Cusslers better Dirk Pitt adventures.The action was slow to develop and had none of Cusslers great &quot;feel like you are there&quot; narrations. The action sequences were flat, average and predictable.Cussler just could not pull me into the action on this book.Cussler spent way too much time on technical details in this book and the plot was transparent and obvious.At times, Dirk Pitt seemed to be remarkably &quot;slow to catch on&quot; to events in the story. The good humor &quot;give and take&quot; with AL seemed &quot;forced&quot; and uninspired.At times, this book seemed to be like the lame &quot;Kurt Austin&quot; books and if I did not know better, I'd say that Cusslers co-writer in those books had a hand in this one as well.This book was an &quot;Ok&quot; Dirk Pitt novel, but not one of the better ones."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"It's difficult to know how to describe this book. Exciting, gripping, realistic, well-written, intriguing, thought-provoking? This book is none of these things. The plot would be considered overly silly for an Austin Powers movie, and I seriously expected that at any moment, the arch-baddie (Spector) was going to appear on a video screen in the White House to demand 'One Million dollars'.The dialog would be considered poor for a 1950's Boys Own comic book and the characterization is so thin that my partially blind pet cat could see through it. The only reason I continued through to the end was the fact that I was on a dare from my wife to finish it. I could not recommend this book to anyone, even if they were in solitary confinement in a Turkish prison and the alternative was insanity."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I've been an avid follower of the Dirk Pitt Novels since the mid 80's when my folks forced me read Treasure as a teen, for which I am still grateful. When reading his early books start to finish I couldn't put them down. T-O took me over a week to read.I did enjoy the premise of the book but felt overloaded with technical schematics on every bit of equipment utilized throughout the story. A little background is good but this is an adventure novel not a &quot;how to&quot; manual on a TBM Boring Machine. Pitt's constant inner monologue on how he was getting to old for the lifestyle he leads left me a little down.The supporting characters were not fleshed out and the twins were boring. After the introduction of the twins in Valhalla Rising, which I found to be the best DP book in a while, I was left excited at the potential of the Jr. Pitt's. However, if they are going to take over the series they need some more personality and verve. Cussler has spoiled us with Dirk, Al, Rudi, Loren, Sandecker etc. The twins are pale shadows in comparison.The story did not have the edge of your seat suspense prevelant in so many of his other books. Also, figuring out the bad guys was much too easy. I did enjoy the book just not on the level of say Raise the Titanic, Treasure, Inca Gold and his other earlier works.There were also some really obvious mistakes in this book that leave me wondering if his editor needs an eye exam, as well as distortions in the timeline and incorrect past character reference.To sum up there are a good number of the DP books in my library that get re-read every couple years. This won't be one of them."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"What a very disappointing wrap up to Dirk's career. I have never seen the NUMA crew be so incredibly dumbfounded by the clues that are so apparently staring them in the face. How many times can you say &quot;Not Odyssey, again&quot; after the reader has figured it out 50 pages ago. The whole Spectre debacle at the end was obvious from the first introduction of the amazonian women early in the book. The editing on this book was done with an obvious attempt to get the book to market instead of a concerted effort to make the book readable. The time warps are ridiculous. I have recently read the Buddha book and found it somewhat enjoyable. Then Cussler introduces the same supersecret propulsion system (or one very similar) into one of NUMA's vessels. Then a little later we have the fishing smack that has all the earmarks of a smaller Oregon with its fancy decor supposed to fool even the hardiest of fishermen. Then we have the special jetski deigned by NUMA to penetrate covertly into enemy territory. Why would NUMA make this machine. No reason except to have a new toy for Dirk and AL. The kids are ridiculous and serve no purpose in the story line. I hope we do not see them as the new Pitt Al duo.What a shame to release this book. This was an obvious attempt to make some quick cash and it worked because all of us Pitt fans will read it even after reading these reviews. Shame on you Clive Cussler. GO back and read your own work some time and bring back the glory days of old. And to think I even named my cat Dirk Pitt.Shame on you."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Trojan Odyssey continues the line of Dirk Pitt adventure stories. This one is not that different from the others and many of the plot devices have been used before (the evil cult that Dirk is trying to expose, the death-defying heroics of Dirk and Al, the impossible situations they find themselves in, the causes and reasons for the situation, etc.). Unfortunately, this storyline is rather perfunctory and seems like mostly rehashed material. Unlike some of his previous ones that had me holding my breath in anticipation (Sahara for instance) or staying up way too late to continue turning pages, I could see what was coming almost from the first page.Another problem was that some of the plot devices were put out there and not really followed up. The story starts with a wonderous concept that gets into severe trouble. The main evil being does not do anything to help, and leaves thousands of people behind at risk. One would think that somewhere along the line, there would be a discussion of why that occurred. Why was the thing constructed, and why was it abandoned as it was. But none of that occurs. The only obvious puropse it serves is to provide a convenient entry point for Dirk Pitt and Al Giordino.There are also several mistakes in the book that make me think that Clive Cussler is poking fun at this audience. For instance, there is a hurricane that developed off the African coast and moves towards the U.S. The book repeatedly talks of its eastwards movements. Excuse me? Last I looked at a map, that would have it moving WEST!!! This \\"mistake\\" is repeated several times so it cannot be a real mistake, and I cannot believe that no proofreaders caught it either!Towards the end of the book, several things happen that make me believe that Clive Cussler intended this to be the last book in the series. Now, I know that is not true as a sequel has appeared, but the ending was not a typical Dirk Pitt ending ... there was no dropping of a villain down the elevator chute in the World Trade Center, etc.So, I am overall slightly disappointed."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"This book was a lot of fun to read. I've been a Cussler fan since I bought Inca Gold at a yard sale for 25 cents. Once again he provides a great story. There are a few editing glitches which will hopefully be taken care of in the paperback edition, but all in all highly recommended.The Trojan plotline was very intriguing, so much so that I've been trying to track down Where Troy Once Stood.... the inspiration behind the novel. Pitt fans won't be disappointed!!"},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"After reading some of the less flattering reviews I decided to read Trojan Odyssey for myself, not believing one of my favorite guilty pleasures could have missed so badly. Sad to say, though many of the &quot;Cussler&quot; gimmicks are still included, they seem weak, over done and flat in the overall plot this time. Dirk's kids are just not interesting and after spending so much time with them before the plot takes any real &quot;action&quot; I wanted to send them to their room for quiet time. Dirk (Sr.) is getting long in the tooth and would be better served if replaced permenantly with Kurt Austin ( a doppleganger to be sure, but hey, no insufferable offspring yet.). Maybe Clive is stretching himself too thin these days, maybe his flare for exciting thrillers is running dry. Whatever it is, I hope this is only a blip, and if he needs three or four years between books to get back in top form, I'm willing to wait before crossing him off my must read list - after all, so many books, so little time!"},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"O.K., so Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt novels are formulaic. We can even describe the formula: Begin with an ancient event, real or imaginary, such as the sacking of Troy. Fast forward to a few years from now (in this case, 2006). Invent a cataclysm that threatens to destroy human life in large numbers (in this case, a hurricane that threatens a floating resort). Bring in Dirk Pitt and Al Giordino to rescue equally large numbers of people. In the course of the cataclysm, make sure someone discovers clues to the ancient event. Throw in a menacing organization that is somehow connected to all of this. Have Pitt and his NUMA crew defeat the baddies, while also shining the light of truth on that ancient event. Voila! Another book.It's all here. What makes Trojan Odyssey interesting is the other stuff. Pitt's heretofore unknown twin children, introduced at the end of Valhalla Rising, are now working for NUMA (surprise!). Pitt, Admiral Sandecker, and Al all make decisions that determine the future direction of the series (We knew that Dirk and Al were going to hand things off to young Dirk and Summer--it was just a question of how. The bigger surprise lies in Sandecker's decision). While those decisions are predictable, they are still satisfying. They also meet the first criterion for series novels--they set the stage for the next book.Trojan Odyssey isn't the best book Cussler ever wrote, but it isn't the worst, either (that dubious honor goes to Dragon, an incredibly racist diatribe against Japanese economic power). It's a bridge book between Valhalla Rising and whatever's next as young Dirk and Summer take the places of their father and Al in Cussler's adventures. Is that enough to make us come back next year? Only if Dirk and Summer are fleshed out (telling us a LOT more about their upbringing would be a start) and Pitt and Sandecker are believable in their new roles.As has been true with most of Cussler's Pitt books, Trojan Odyssey suffers from poor editing. Verb tense disagreements, dangling participles, and introductory clauses that don't agree with sentence subjects abound. These errors are so elementary that one wonders if a high school junior English student shouldn't do the next editing job. On the other hand, folks like me have turned NUMA into a money machine for Cussler and his publishers, so why should they bother?"},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"It's been awhile since I've read a Clive Cussler book, and now I remember why I quit reading them. I found this a bore of a book. The best part of the book is the first part where Cussler describes a Category 5 hurricane and the effects that such a thing can have. I did not like the characters in this book. For example, Dirk's new-found children are stiff and wooden, and don't seem real at all. Even the bad guys (or women in this book), seem character parodies rather than to be real villains. The premise behind the book is a good one - an alternate explanation to Homer's epic poem \\"The Odyssey\\". That part did make me think a bit, and I wasn't aware that there was a school of thought out there about Odysseus' adventures occurring in the Atlantic Ocean rather than the Mediterranean Sea. But other than that, I wouldn't recommend this book. If you must read it, borrow it from the library or from a friend."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Normally Clive is pretty accurate, but in this one, he had the hurricane traveling on an eastbound track towards(?) the US mainland. It referenced this \\"eastbound\\" several times, when most of us in the southland know that almost all hurricanes originate off the African coast, heading westward toward the US.Cest la vie"},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I was looking for an adventure book and was fully expecting elements that were somewhat beyond reality, but this was ridiculous. A floating hotel with guests totally oblivious to the dangers of hurricanes in the Caribbean? A billionaire who ranks among the world's wealthiest but who remains completely anonymous even to the CIA?The writing is extremely laborious (was Cussler paid by the word?) and the dialogue does not even closely resemble everyday conversation.I tried to convince myself that I could get through a few flaws and still enjoy the story for what it was - but I could not. Ultimately, I just stopped reading. If you value your time in any way, don't bother picking this one up. Horrible!"},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"The plot of this one was about as difficult to figure out as an average daytime soap opera and parts of it were half as interesting. I mean honestly some parts were great but other parts were as bad as internet fanfiction. I as a reader feel I have matured beyond the paranoid voluptuous rich mindcontroled lesbian plotline. This is apparently more then I can say for Clive Cussler who makes the idea the centerpiece of his book!!!There was however an interesting take on why the Trojan war actually took place (If it ever took place to begin with)Overall-I might have been prepared to overlook the shorcommings of the book and chalk it up to simple summer reader fun. This was of course before I got to the end where Cussler wrote himself into the plot. That was just stupid."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Being a Dirk Pitt fan, I have read and loved most of Clive Crussler's books. He have a way for making the most outrageous plots more believable. That is in my humble opinion, make his Dirk Pitt books so popular and enjoyable to read. However, in this book, it seem like Crussler is either running out of fresh ideas or recycling old ones. I think I read Trojan Odyssey before but under different titles. The concept of the Celtic Homer and all that is geared toward pure fantasy. Clive Crussler is not Dan Brown in this case. There is little to be said about this book, it seem old and tired. I can't buy the plot that Crussler wrote and considering that I have brought every single other ones he wrote, that itself should be a good indictor of quality of this book.The book also suffered thanks to the introduction of his kids which definitely break up the momentum of the pacing of the book as distracted papa Dirk who seem to spent half of his life saving his two younguns. It seem like Crussler is trying to set up the two young Pitts as the main vehicle, retiring Papa Dirk who got married and nominated to head NUMA. Maybe for that, I gave the book three stars when it really deserves no higher then two, that this novel is a transition book. But I thought it would have been whole lot better."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"The novel is very much a repeat of previous plots --an old event or war, a ship that somehow made it to America, a treasure to be found, an evil mastermind, Clive Cussler meeting Dirk Pitt-- and so would merit the same reviews as all the previous novels.However, I'd like to suggest that the author stick to English: whenever he has anybody speaking Spanish, there are glaring syntax and vocabulary faults, that any competent Editor would have pointed out. One of the best (worst) examples: a guard calls out to Pitt \\"LA PARADA!\\", hopefully meaning \\"HALT!\\", but actually being \\"THE BUS STOP!\\"... not much of a warning, isn't it?"},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"First of all, the editing for this book was terrible. Trojan Odyssey is full of errors that a seventh-grader editing the back pages of the junior high yearbook would catch. It takes away from the story.As others have mentioned, there is a basic Cussler formula, and TO sticks to it. Formulaic and predictable, especially for longtime Cussler fans, there were happily a few minor surprises. As always, the attention to detail in regards to ships and diving was superb. The same cannot be said for the writing in regards to much of the action, and it would be nice to see other characters evolve besides Pitt (to be fair, it seems that may be the case with the next offering).A good time-killing, waiting at the airport sort of book, but not Cussler's best effort (I've always liked Night Probe and Iceberg the most)."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"This is my first Clive Cussler/Dirk Pitt book and I enjoyed it so much that I can't wait to pick up the others. This book was not original or intellectual but it most definitely was entertaining. If you're looking for something easy and fun to read, this is a good book to pick up."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Although I sadly realised that Clive lost his wife Barbara, hence the tribute, I realise that the Dirk Pitt series may be coming to an end as Dirk seems to have accepted the takeover as head of NUMA and Al is fed up of getting shot. It may be that Dirk Jr and Summer may take over as the lead characters with Dirk Sr as head of the organisation but I feel that this book left a lot lacking regarding the plot against other books in the series. It didnt grip me as the rest of the series did, especially Sahara, which is being made into a movie and about time and is my favourite! I have to say that it wasnt that good apart from the hotel rescue at the beginning but after that, a little lame. Sorry fans but I read my first Clive book aged 7 which was raise the titanic in 1977 and Ive got his full collection, disappointed with this one."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I am a big fan of Cussler's books and generally enjoy them tremendously. The enjoyment is not based on their intellectual challenge. Far from it. Cussler's books are not challenging, but just pure fun. Bubble gum for the brain. The plots are spectacular, at times unbelievable, and the characters are super human. But it does not matter. Almost.Trojan Odyssey is a little bit too unchallanging and too predictable. It seems at times that Trojan Odyssey is just an amalgamation of Cussler's prior books. It is still a fine diversion from the real world, just not as much as the others."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Another Clive Cussler hit. It is one of those books that you hate to put down, and if you have to put it down, you cant wait to get back to it!"},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Bought this for my Husband's new Kindle my daughter and I purchased for him for Valentines Day. He's a HUGH Cussler fan and I know he will enjoy this book as he has with the other Cussler novels."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Another standard Cussler read. Enjoyed the fictitious slant on historical events. Would like to have seen a little more technology slant. Overall entertaining. Would recommend to non Cussler fans."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"THE LOWDOWN: A solid adventure thriller from master adventure writer Clive Cussler, with cocky hero Dirk Pitt becoming a little older and a little wiser with gray hair around the temples, a few more wrinkles, two fully grown children, and by the end of the story, a wife.THE PLOT: Dirk Pitt is on board a NUMA resarch ship when an unnaturally large hurricane suddenly pops up an threatens a new, high-tech \\"floating hotel,\\" as well as Pitt's children in a bathysphere. After pulling off two dramatic rescues, Pitt begins to track down the source of a \\"brown tide\\" that has been polluting the waters off Nicaragua, and is led to a ruthless tycoon who has a following of female druid priestesses. The mechanism causing the brown tide is changing the ocean's currents, causing hurricanes and slowly cooling the Earth down into a new ice age, all to make the world dependent on the Odyssey Corporation's new power cell.THE PROS: While not the best of the Pitt stories, I found myself thoroughly enjoying this book. The villain's plot is James Bond-style large scale, but the idea of changing the ocean's currents is more interesting than the typical spy movie caper. There are plenty of suspenseful scenes, including rescue in the middle of a hurricane, a head-on collision with a \\"ghost ship,\\" a ship-to-ship battle between a NUMA ship and an Odyssey catamaran, an attempted druid sacrifice, and a shark attack.THE CONS: The historical mystery was definitely a drawback to the story; the idea of the Trojan war being fought in the British Isles, all over the price of tin, is a bit of a stretch. The two Pitt children, Summer and Dirk, while not bad characters, are not particularly interesting, and spend a creepy amount of time together. If the junior Pitts are going to be included, they should have some specialties (like Yaeger with computers and Perlmutter with history) instead of making them generic NUMA researchers."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Clive Cussler has another terrific Dirk Pitt story in this novel. Cussler novels can always be counted on to give us several tried and true story elements in this series of adventure novels. You can be sure the usual historical information is included; this time with a twist! Cussler moves the Trojan War from Mediterranean Turkey to England, and Odysseus' voyage to the Carribean. There are the fistfights, shootouts, traps, and other action features we have come to expect. This book also is improved by the addition of Dirk Pitt's grown children, Dirk Junior and Summer. This allows Cussler to take the story in two directions at once for a richer feel. The whole NUMA (National Underwater Marine Agency) staff are involved as well, providing technology support and several rescues. It's a rollicking good story. A fun read! I highly recommend it to any reader who enjoys a good adventure story in the tradition of the great pulp fiction writers like Edgar Rice Burroughs, and Kenneth Robeson. The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is that Trojan Odyssey is not as richly complex as a Tom Clancy or Robert Ludlum thriller."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Dirk Pitt, the until the previous novel Valhalla Rising unknown son of Dirk Pitt, is diving together with his sister Summer Pitt to find the source of a brownish contamination in the ocean's waters, when they stumble upon a strange historical artefact. At the same moment the father is trying to rescue a gigantic maritime hotel from total devastation due to a enormous hurricane. Little do they know that this is only the beginning of revealing a plot so devious that the whole world will suffer from its consequences?To say that the Trojan Odyssey has an unbelievable plot is like stating that water is wet. If this book was a parody on some of the most crazy James Bond stories, then it would indeed be an excellent book. But, unfortunately it is not. Although the story arc about Homer's Odyssey is very entertaining and quite informative, the main storyline can only be catalogued as completely absurd. If only ten percent would be true, it would mean that the whole world has gone mad. It can always be that this preposterous plotting is to the liking of the fans, but only a hint of realism would be nice to keep the interest of the average reader.Unless you really want to know how silly things can get, skip this book and pick up one of Clive Cussler's earlier works."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"This book was very action packed and had me reading until 2.00am...I could not put it down until I was finished. The plot was well thought out and the solutions to Pitt's many obstacles....far out. Recommended reading for all actions lovers."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"One hair raising narrow escape after another.The first was a monster hurricane threatening a huge floating hotel. Followed by the rescuing of Dirk's twin children who were trapped where they had been working in an under water habitat that was rolled over into a trench by the hurricane. An evil organization run by women trying to divert the Gulf Stream through tunnels under Nicaragua to create massive climate change in Europe and the eastern United States had to be stopped.Typical Cussler novel - Super hero who can overcome any crisis or evil plot."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Other reviews for this book tear it apart for its goofiness - and they're right. The last quarter of the book is based on a truly goofy premise, and the final paragraph was the goofiest! But throughout the book are exciting action scenes and it was able to keep my attention. All in all, not a wasted time spent reading, but if my next Cussler is like my first, it will be my last..."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I too have been reading Clive Cussler for about 25 years and feel he is one (if not the best) thriller writer in the business. However when a writer reaches this level they should be held to a higher standard- unfortunately the opposite seems to be true and I think sometimes their editors are intimitated by their fame and amount of $ they bring in.This is still a fairly entertaining novel and exhibits flashes of why Cussler is such a great storyteller with its multiple plot lines, growth and chage of his characters, and seemingly inexhastible knowledge of marine lore.The villians in this novel are perhaps the most one-dimensional characters that Cussler has created since his totally evil Cuban communists in Cyclops. Dirk and Dirk Jr. deserve better than this-they need villians as resourceful and engaging as they are. As stated in the other reviews the editing in this book was a tad loose in both the inconsistencies in the plotting and in the sloppiness of the writing.On the plus side it is wonderful to see Cussler's characters grow and some possible monumental changes occuring in their lives-(Dirk Pitt the DIRECTOR of NUMA? and MARRIED?) These developments are what is keeping this series fresh and entertaining. I just feel Clive needs to spend a little more time and attention on the flagship of his empire."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I enjoy Cussler's Dirk Pitt stories - they are great lighthearted adventures which also throw in a little maritime history or science. Trojan Odyssey is a fine example of a Dirk Pitt novel, with three great adventures wrapped into one story: rescuing a water hotel, searching for proof that Odysseus' adventures took place in the Atlantic instead of the Mediterranean, and stopping a plot to cause cataclysmic climate change as a means to gain wealth and power. If you like Pitt stories I'm sure you'll enjoy this one. If you're looking for hyper-realistic thrillers, Cussler is not your author.A P-3 Orion aircraft makes a cameo appearance as \\"Galloping Gertie\\", the 'hurricane hunter' belonging to the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration.I enjoyed how Dirk's children get to work with him to solve the main mystery, while Al yet again serves as faithful sidekick. This book is a bit longer than some of Pitt's stories, with the first 150 pages being an interesting yet almost throw-away introduction...almost like two books were blended together. The wrap-up of the book certainly makes it appear that the Dirk Pitt stories have come to a close, with lots of little threads tied up nicely."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I absolutely loved this book. I especially love how Cussler mixes history with science and adventure. It made this book really awesome. Plus that was cool how Cussler did a little cameo appearance at the end of the book."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I just finished a read through of the entire Dirk Pitt series, and overall I'd say that as the series went on, it did not improve.Now, I don't think that anyone expects great literature, but the author seemed to get caught up in the trap or escalating danger rather than variations of situations to approach.And as the series progressed, more errors crept in. Perhaps Cussler's reputation made his editors think that they no longer had to edit his manuscripts, I don't know. In this book, obviously the hurricane path issues are obvious. Another item, for those who have read the whole series, is that Lauren Smith's father who's death was cronicled in Vixen 03 was resurrected to come to the wedding.Oh, and although it might be cute, the ever increasing roles that Cussler wrote himself into got to feel just silly.Overall, I can't say that I'd recommend this unless someone had read the rest of the books and just wanted to get the series over and done with. Read the first couple novels in the series instead."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"If Clive Cussler wrote this piece of garbage, he's either lost his talent, or he's submitting copy to make money. This is the worst Dirk Pitt novel in the series...and where the hell were the editors. The copy just doesn't make sense in places, or is laden with inconsistencies and inaccuracies. E.g., Cussler (or whomever) describes a meal of lobster thermidor; two paragraphs later, it turns into lobster sauteed in butter. Another: Pitt jumps in the water during a period when he's in the calm eye of a hurricane. Next paragraph, the hurricane's second half has come and gone and Pitt starts to do his routine...but what the hell happened when the hurricane hit...no mention...what did Pitt do, slide up and down the mountainous waves? Third...it's a Cadillac ESCALADE, not Esplanade!This is the kind of rip-off that's becoming more and more prevalent in publishing. Do yourself a favor and skip this book; if you must read it, wait until you can find an old paperback for 25 cents a few years from now!Oh, and by the way, please retire Mr. Cussler!"},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"While well-plotted, Trojan Odyssey is so unevenly written that I found myself distracted every few pages by another clumily constructed sentence. I could tolerate the bland two-dimensional characters, but when I read a best-selling author who's seemingly so indifferent to the quality of his work as to fail to proofread it, I begrudge him his literary success.I won't be reading Clive Cussler again."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Wow, where can I start? This book was truly dreadful in pretty much every imaginable manner. Not only was the plot completely absurd and filled with glaring inconsistencies, as already mentioned, but was totally transperant. In this type of book a little artistic license can be granted for the sake of a gripping storyline, but this book offers nothing in the way of suspense. The characters are ridiculous cardboard cutouts which do nothing to fix the book's predictability. I've never read any other of Cussler's novels (and now never will), so I'm not sure if his writing is always like this, but here he seems to have little command of the English language, his prose is drowning in mangled phrases, overblown cliches and pointless technical jargon.A travesty from start to finish - don't waste your time on this book!"},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I read some good early reviews on Amazon and bought the book on a whim. It's lousy, like his last several have been. Besides the rehashed plot, two-dimensional characters, and poor dialog, the book suffers from horrible editing. I'm sure Cussler can afford a proof reader and editor, but you couldn't prove it by this book. There are time/space conflicts, contradictions, subject/verb agreement problems, etc. I love Cussler's early stuff (Raise the Titanic, Sahara, etc.) but save your money and skip this one. If you want to read adventure pick up Lonesone Dove or early Cussler."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Blah blah blah, I laugh at this idiot who tries to rewrite history in his own words, a total moron, cant believe this garbage got published."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Someone gave me this book, plus Valhalla Rising. I'm not sure why I continued reading after the first few pages. Maybe morbid fascination. Cussler is one of the worst writers (&quot;Curse you, Red Baron.&quot;) I have ever had the misfortune of reading. In a word, he's awful. Dennis Halsey."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"See storyline above.Cussler again delivers a high level adventure that should please all his fans. This time he throws in a little history about Odysseus' great voyage as well as a lesson in Celtic Culture and the Druids.I thought this was a well rounded adventure and a great escape. One of Cusslers best. It includes all the regular characters, as well as introducing Dirk Pitt's new found son and daughter, Dirk and Summer, who have an adventure of their own. You'll get no disappointment reading this newest adventure.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"OK, a bunch of disconnected &quot;historical&quot; factoids which are never really tied together coupled with a mystery scheme to get rich. Throw in the usual cast of characters and predictable events and you end up with a mess.The good news (for fans of Loren), is that her Dad who was killed off 3 years before Vixen 03 (a very good book, BTW) has had a miraculous recovery from his death. I guess Vixen 03 was a &quot;dream&quot; (aka Bobby Ewing) - like the dream that we all have that Cussler could still put together a good read. Clive - TV programs use people called &quot;continuity checkers&quot; - you might want to investigate that! I also found the obligatory CC appearance at the end to be even more contrived than usual."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Clive Cussler's Trojan Odyssey, while not his top shelf material is a step up from some of the latest drivel that he has put his name to. Cussler resurrects his irrepressible hero NUMA special projects director Dirk Pitt. Pitt in the Valhalla Rising adventure, had been shockingly introduced to his previously unbeknown children, fraternal twins Dirk and Summer. Raised by their mom, the late Summer Moran they both pursued careers in marine sciences and were now both working for NUMA.The Pitt twins were researching a dirge to marine life in the Caribbean called the brown crud which was destroying the delicate ecological coral reef systems and surrounding sea life. While conducting underwater investigation they came across an archeologic relic which subsequently was discovered to be of Celtic origin and 3000 years old. Such a discovery in the middle of the Caribbean was inexplicable. Their research was cut short by the formation of a massive hurricane of super colossal magnitude which was threatening the Dominican Republic and an immense state of the art, luxurious, floating hotel, the Ocean Wanderer moored two miles off the coast.Miraculously (and unbelievably) Dirk Pitt and his sidekick Al Giordino helicopter through the &quot;perfect&quot; storm to save the day towing the hotel to safety and rescue Dirk and Summer who became trapped inside an undersea habitat.The Ocean Wanderer hotel is owned by a mysterious Mr. Specter an obese billionaire whose face is hidden by huge sunglasses, a turban and facial coverings. Spector is the owner of Odyssey, a giant research and construction corporation whose upper management is composed entirely of statuesque red haired women versed in Celtic lore and Druidism. Pitt and Giordino probe an Odyssey facility based in Nicaragua which is determined to be the source of the brown crud. While reconnoitering they discover that the crud is a by-product of a heinous, diabolical scheme that will tip the balance of world power.Cussler in Trojan Odyssey puts forth an intriguing explanation for the origins, locations and mechanics of the Trojan War and the subsequent voyages of Odysseus which were clever and fascinating. If this was Cussler's literary swan song, he departs on a high note which ties up many of his character's loose ends."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Couldn't wait for this one to come out. Well written as all of Cussler's books. He seems to have toned down the action a bit, but still managed to keep me riveted. Unfortunately Cussler is chosing to retire Dirk Pitt and Al Giordano.Still I'm looking forward to the next one by Cussler, I believe it'll be out in July, and it is called Lost City, most likely with Kurt Austin and Joe Zavala."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I have read all of Cussler's Dirk Pitt novels and I have enjoyed every single one. As for TROJAN ODYSSEY, the best recommendation I can make is do NOT read it before VALHALLA RISING. The introduction of key characters in TROJAN ODYSSEY can be found on the last couple of pages of VALHALLA RISING. The introduction of these two new characters is a bit of a shock. Thus, I cannot reveal who they are, but I can say that meeting them in VALHALLA RISING makes TROJAN ODYSSEY a great anticipation.Without exception, Dirk Pitt has always been the source of the initial hypothesis for the cause of the earth shaking calamity about to erupt. In this case, a computer beats Pitt to the punch. As for me, I thought this was a sad commentary on plot development. Following the thought processes of the hero is an extremely important component of my reading pleasure. Thus in this novel, in the battle between man and machine, machine wins. Although the hypotheses comes from the computer, Pitt is the one who develops the precise plan to save the earth, the European economy, and, of course, identify the true wrong doers.In Cussler's past novels I have always found myself getting lost in the reading. I traveled in my mind. The TROJAN ODYSSEY did not share this characteristic with his other novels. This is not to say that the story line is bad, the novel lacks that metaphysical quality and intensive writing style that makes me travel with my mind.On the last couple of pages, Dirk is facing a gerontological crossroad. He has to make a critical decision, but doesn't. Clearly, Cussler will have Pitt make a decision at the beginning of an upcoming novel. I feel sure I know the final decision (as most readers would); however, the implications for the decision are going to lead to a whole new series of twisted intrigue."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I always hate how stilted Cussler's dialogue is, but every story is great fun and full of adventure, albeit unbelievable adventure! And where did he come up with those names for his characters in this book??? Mason Jar??? Really. But the suspense and adventure are as good as any other of his books. I can always count on them to be entertaining stories!"},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Clive's most recent books have been very much influenced by archealogist Graham Hancock. In 1997, a true life sunken city was found off the coast of Okinawa in 70 feet of water. What is so amazing about this city is that not only does it have pyramids, but also a Greek style ampitheater with an area called \\"the stage\\" that has to be seen to be truly awed. It's Grahams summarization, based on this city ans several others recently discovered off of India, Malta, and Florida, that there is a missing chapter of human history. He goes on that 11,600 years ago, we were in an ice age. Then suddenly, quite suddenly, the ice age ended. The oceans rose 360 feet and a large amount of the human race was wiped out. Then, as in the present day, 75% of the human population lived within 50 miles of a shoreline (think New York, L.A., Houston, Chicago et. al.).We not only see Graham's influence in Atlantis Found, but either Graham plagiarizes Cussler, or vice versa, because certain phrases are shared.Moving on to Trojan Odyssey, Dirk's children make an astounding find in a Caribbean reef. This eventually leads to Dirk and Al geeting involved, and predictably coming to the recue. There is some long coming twists at the end of the book, but Cussler seems influenced by Clancy in these changes. Well worth the price. Read it and love it as I do."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I totally enjoyed it. I still find Dirk Pitt to be the quintessential hero - the books have more action than james bond. Thought the hurricane was exciting. Cussler's books are always great escapism - some maybe better than others, but you are always assured of a fun read &amp; this selection was no exception."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"While I have always enjoyed Cussler's work for what it is, a light read where the good guys always win and have some fun blowing stuff up along the way, this latest novel is just too formula driven from the same mold as all the others. There are even scenes in this book which are cookie cutters from others, specifically the yacht chase from Sahara. I enjoyed reading Dirk and Al in action one more time, I just wish the story had been a touch more original."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Granted there are logical errors--yes, Loren's father being alive was an error, just like no mention of the Titanic occuring in Vahalla Rising. But these are not the reason why anyone reads a Dirk Pitt novel!! Like an old fashioned roller coaster, people read Pitt because he is fun, exciting, and a good escape from a world that would be a little less interesting if he wasn't around. Perhaps Cussler did have some problems while writing this opus--notice the dedication--and in an early interview Cussler has said he was slowing down and having trouble writing. Yet even with all this, Trojan Odyssey is a fast, fun, amazing work. Perhaps, in the future, young Dirk will replace his father as the Special Project director and we'll have a new generation of Pitt adventures!"},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"If Dirk Pitt is OLD to you . . .Then this book shows it. OK, the basic storyline is fun and rumbles along with the typical sociopathic private corporation with its private security force and its plans to make a fortune while incidentally creating a global disaster. The ancient shipwreck story is straight out of Homer (of the Odyssey, not Simpson, but with Cussler you never know) by way of Cambridge, England.So where do the signs of age creep in? First, the finale really doesn't involve much of a shoot-'em-up and Pitt (and even some of the bad guys) seem actually to avoid killing people - unless absolutely necessary.Then Loren's father shows up at an intimate event and neither Dirk nor Loren nor Cussler (who also shows up) remembers to say \\"Welcome to Washington Mr Smith. How come you managed to come back from the dead after being found in a submerged plane wreck several novels ago?\\"OK I still had fun reading it, but zero points for editing and nowhere near as good as Inca Gold.If Dirk Pitt is NEW to you . . .These books are fun to read but don't expect a lot of depth. We are talking airport books with lots of action but very linear plot development and close to zero character development.Cussler is pretty good on technical stuff like boats, guns and diving equipment. At least, I think he is, but I'm not sure. His books abound with lots of bizarre technical errors on other subjects. In one book he talks of \\"square acres\\". In this book, he gets into the chemistry of a revolutionary new fuel cell based at one point on ammonia and oxygen and at another on nitrogen and oxygen. Let's just say he's being inconsistent and not even discuss feasibility (it is supposed to be fiction after all). At least the hypothetical science is no more misinformed than in his other books.But let me say this, I enjoy reading Cussler's books - just don't look for a lot of depth. Cussler claims that he wanted Dirk Pitt to be a kind of underwater James Bond and he comes close to that goal. When he strays from his area of expertise (boats, guns and diving), Cussler tries to impress us with Pitt's sophistication in all matters - just as Ian Fleming would with 007. But come on! Chardonnay with steak! And it might be nice to see Pitt order something foreign, like a biriani or a moussaka or paella for a change. You won't see it because Cussler also has a barely disguised xenophobia that runs through all his plots - OK Bond killed his share of Russians in the SMERSH days, but only in the line of duty and Bond would have been shaken, not stirred, by Dirk's ordering a frou-frou white wine with a blood-red steak.As I said earlier on for the OLD readers, try Inca Gold. Maybe you'll get hooked. Just take it for what it is - fun - and don't get too serious about it."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Why is this guy so popular? I've struggled through a few of his novels and I've been pretty stunned by the quality of writing - Mr. Cussler can't seem to be able to keep a plot line straight half the time - he contradicts himself from chapter to chapter, he brings back dead characters without even bothering to explain their reappearance, and his character development is non-existent. This story is particularly bad and the characters are one-dimensional and more stereotypical than ever. We have Dirk Pitt's drop-dead gorgeous daughter Summer 'giggling helplessly' over and over again while the muscular, dashing Dirk Jr. (who has the personality of mud) keeps a cool head and solves impossible problems, a bunch of evil female druids who are coincidentally man-haters, and the dull and grizzly main action figures themselves, Dirk Sr. and sidekick Al (predictably boring in his commitment -over and over again- to bachelorhood). Don't get me wrong - I am all about entertaining, fiction-for-fun books, beach reading that you don't have to think about to enjoy, but this is so bad that it's downright frustrating. My conclusion is that Clive Cussler has gotten as bored with his characters as we are, but he's not motivated enough to create some new blood - why should he when the same old tired cast can reappear in retreads yet again and still sell?"},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Cussler continues to be the master story teller.

His latest work is less intense then the previous novels I have read and enjoyed. He hasn't gone totally down hill, but he has mellowed out.

They are backed by the mainland Chinese. The background for all of this is the theory that the Trojan war was not about Greece or Turkey, but about the British Isles and tin mines (tin is needed to move from the copper to the bronze age). Odysseus traveled not to the Mediterranean but the Carribean. Sort of interesting and almost believable. A decent yarn, which might be Dirk's last (he is getting a little old for all that activity)and two major things change Dirk's life. Perhaps some of the future action will go to his son and daughter.

The villain was one-dimensional and pretty forgetful and Dirk's kids were just boring characters all the way around. The dialog throughout the book was week and I often read some of the lamest to my wife just to elicit a laugh from her. The nefarious deeds of the villains as well as the antics of Al and Dirk are getting even more unbelievable and poorly devised.I got the feeling that Mr. Cussler had grown somewhat tired of the whole Dirk Pitt/Kurt Austin formula. It seemed that he just banged this one out at the instanced of the publisher or his agent or for some other motivation unrelated to the actual desire to tell a compelling Dirk Pitt story.These novels are starting to make James Bond look believable.

Am I describing a new Steven Seagal movie? No I'm talking about Clive Cussler's novel: \\"Trojan Odyssey\\". Which isn't to say that the novel was all bad. The alternative history detailed in the first few pages of the book had me hooked. There were also some well thought-out scenes where Cussler was able to demonstrate his considerable knowledge of marine wildlife and archeology. These items alone weren't enough to carry the book however.If you are looking for intelligent edge-of-your-seat storytelling I wouldn't recommend this book for you. Then again I, like most of us I think, enjoy a good B-movie once in a while."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I read this book while on vacation fully aware that I would need to let my imagination run wild to be able to believe another one of Dirk Pitt's adventures but I had no idea that my imagination would need to stretch that far in order to even begin to believe this tale.Clive Cussler gives another performance of Dirk Pitt and Al Giordino, the dynamic duo of NUMA who go racing around the globe in search of the last evidence of Odysseus' Odyssey from the Trojan War while trying to stop the evil of a secret society of women from spreading throughout the world. Bottom line: typical Dirk Pitt theatrics.The end of the novel leaves the reader believing this is the end of the adventure career for Dirk and Al and one almost hopes it is. After nearly a 30 years career of being shot at, gunned down, and countless near-drownings, wouldn't you be ready to for a little R&R;? I'm ready just from trying to believe this story."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Having read all of Cussler Novels, including the ill-fated cooperation books with other authors, I believe he should stuck to Dirk Pitt.The Story itself is quite solid, tying together several mystical legends. However Cussler should stay to his characters and their story. Lorens father supposed to be dead, died as he tried to savage gear of a lost airplane (Vixen 03), how can she be walked down the aisle at her marriage with Dirk by him? Believing that Cussler has intentional introduced this mistake, like he did in several others of his novel (mixing up Dirk mother names) it could be guessed that he wants us to comment on his books.Nevertheless it is page turner! Can't stop till the last page. Friends always know when I am not returning calls or emails, that I am reading (again and again) CC books."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"As always I cannot put down a Clive Cussler book.

Adults: Caveat Emptor."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"The followers of Clive Cussler will find Trojan Odyssey to be an enjoyable, entertaining book. It is a classic Cussler story of good versus evil. As would be expected, Dirk Pitt and Al Giordino again fight tremendous odds and calmly face down death repeatedly as they race against the clock to unearth and then thwart the evil scheme being hatched by Spencer. Adding to the storyline is the inclusion of Dirk and Summer, Pitt's twin children who appeared out of the blue at the end of Valhalla Rising. This is simply a very good novel filled with all of the action, suspense, and frequent plot twists that have become Cussler's trademark. In addition, after all of the action has been concluded, there is still a chapter or two that provide some material that Cussler fans should find interesting. All-in-all, if you have enjoyed the adventures of Pitt and Giordino over the years, Trojan Odyssey should keep you turning the pages as well."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Cussler chips in again with another good piece. Sticking to his tried-and-true formula of a historical event, enviromental disaster (calling for the rescue of numerous people in peril) and bad guy trying to take over the world, it all comes together for a good read.Pitt spends alot of time agonising over getting older, and the normally amusing banter between Pitt and sidekick Al seems very strained, which leaves me as a long time follower a bit down!Maybe the surprise introduction of Pitt's twin offspring in the previous book will breathe some life into the Pitt legacy, as they play a signifigant part in Trojan Odyessy.Keeping my fingers crossed."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I always get excited when opening Cussler novels.

That way it's a lot easier for him to take and read when he travels."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"If you've never read Cussler, all his books are done via formula. Essentially they're all the same, but you'll never complain about the retread. They're all the same, yet all very entertaining.This book is Cussler's last (though not the last of the series). It suffers for that reason, as Cussler strives to tie loose ends.The reigns are being passed from Dirk Sr to Dirk Jr (a convenient appearance, but not wholly unbelievable). At the same time the reigns are being passed from Clive to his son.The story is entertaining, and likely was likely read by the writers of The Day After Tomorrow. It was novel before the movie, might be tired after, but this came first.There are some creepy moments between Dirk Jr and his sister, as she's set up to be a sexy character despite spending much of her time alone with her brother in the middle of the ocean - am I the only one that sees this? Couldn't the editor have stepped in on these?I won't complain much, though. Cussler has given us many, many (many) entertaining reads, and even though he ends on a dip it is a necessary one, and still a solid effort.If you're a Cussler fan buy it. If you're not yet a Cussler fan buy this, along with some older ones and read those first.Adventure fans will not go wrong."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I grew up on Cussler's Dirk Pitt novels; my mother was a fan, and I enjoyed them as well. I am well aware of the car fetish, St. Julien's foodieness, the cheesy camaraderie, the constant barrage of stunning women, a character named Clive Cussler cameoing in every book, etc. It's an adventure series; I get it. It had been years since I read one, though, until I grabbed this one, which my husband had picked up from the library. Now, all I can think about is whether they were this immature all along and I just didn't see it because I was an immature reader. I'm horrified that a large part of my early years might have been spent idolizing books that rival Twilight for pure audacious failure.To begin with, there are punctuation errors scattered throughout the book. I also found missing commas, periods, quotes, etc. I checked the front of the book and realized I had a first printing copy, so hopefully someone caught those and fixed them later. I mean, three of them by page 30? Come on.Then there are the adverbs. They're everywhere, a plague upon the story's existence. The most egregious sentence had four of its ten words end in -ly, but trust me, if you notice adverb overuse, just walk away now. They're more prevalent than moss in a Pacific Northwest forest.The book's overall feel is rough and unpolished, but in some places, the rough draft aroma is overpowering. The places it jarred me out of the story the quickest involved contradictory details. One happened early on with a boat which first had propellers, then magically had always possessed those caterpillar drive engines instead. Later, a blonde character, being introduced, had her hair loose in one sentence, then tied back in another in the same paragraph. Another major problem was awkwardness in sentence structure. It was crazy how many times I had to reread a sentence because it folded back on itself or got things out of chronological order. It was frequently painful, wondering how this book got out the publishing house door. Was it...smuggled?Exposition: Mr. Cussler, you're killing me here. Don't talk to me, tell your characters' story! I am, in fact, interested in saving the planet, and in its amazing quirks and details of composition, but do you really think the beginning of every other chapter in your adventure novel is the place to stop? Everything? And tell me about them? In present tense? No. It's not.Another big irritant was the sloppy language. I've seen better writing projects by teenagers. Sentences continually included extraneous phrases or (re)stated the obvious. In so, so many places, this story felt like it was written by someone who had to explain the details to himself so he wouldn't forget, as if he'd never written in this genre before, let alone this series.We haven't even gotten to story elements yet, so let's do that. First: Specter. If it wasn't obvious what was going on with that character from the absolute first time he showed up, then your brain was off. Yet none of the MCs can figure it out. Specter and the lavender-hued Odyssey were absolutely everywhere in this book, hogging the attention, while the historical reasoning for, you know, the whole plot as well as the book title was confined to a tiny section toward the back of the book.Everything is ridiculously easy for our heroes. Sandecker plans everyone's entire missions in minutes, it seems, informing them that all they need to do is show up and do the job. This happens a ridiculous number of times in this book, so that the characters can keep to a fast-paced schedule. Searching for things takes minutes instead of weeks, and everyone's smart enough to deduce all that they need to know, yet dumb enough to be oblivious to the plot details they're not supposed to figure out yet. (What, no one in the entire world of espionage, observation or research noticed the color-coded bad guy vehicles parading around the Caribbean for the last several years? You're all fired.)Was this a case of a terrible ghost writer dragged over from the YA section? A madly rushed edit job done by a chimpanzee with ADD? An author who felt his previous successes earned him the right to \\"break the rules\\" (No. No matter how often your books have succeeded, the minute you write a sloppy-ass story, you should get nailed for it.)? I've no idea, and it could easily be something else. But I am horribly disappointed with the quality of this story, even within its own series. Endless examples of what not to do in fiction writing. I'm forever going to use this book as an unfortunate example of how some truly terrible books can still get traditionally published. Oh look, Twilight! You have company!"},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"This novel was a deep, jagged pothole in the road of Dirk Pitt's adventures, BUT PLEASE don't judge the rest of Clive's work by this stinker. Read 'Flood Tide,' 'Atlantis Found,' 'Valhalla Rising,' 'Black Wind' 'Treasure of Khan,'or any of the previous works to discover your love of the series and James Bond-like escapist fantasy. My absolute favorite is 'Atlantis Found,' which can't be beat for pure audacious story-telling and incredible set-pieces. This novel was an oddly boring snooze that was badly written and edited even worse, if it was indeed edited at all. Perhaps this is why Mr. Cussler now hires \\"writing partners\\" for all his works. Immediately after this, the books are much improved."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I borrowed this book from our workplace library thinking that a nice thick book would help me endure the train ride home each evening.While I could endure the train ride, I could barely endure the book.This book can be compared to the awful romatic novels that pubescent high school girls might read but in this case for pubescent boys or men who get off on fantasy (not the good sci-fi stuff). Dirk Pitt is an aging McGuyver who could work his way out of anything no matter what the hindrance. Dirk Pitt is a lame Man of La Mancha with his sidekick Giordino, who is obviously a Sancho Panza ripoff.As soon as I read about Spector, who has never been seen, hides his face..I knew that Spector was someone else - in disguise. It was obvious to me, and I'm not a particularly good crime solver. Maybe Cussler meant to do that?The women in the book are perfect in appearance, whether evil or not. Each meal that is eaten is a gourmand's dream. Each sip of wine would bring Bacchus back from the grave. Wretched crap.This must be Cussler's mastabatory fantasy. I hate to be crude, but if the shoe fits....I guess Cussler appears in each of his books at the end, but it was so stupid and so self promoting, I wanted to gag.I finished it, but only to prove I have the intestinal fortitude for anything."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I picked up this book, remembering a few pleasurable volumes of the past. What I forgot is that I was in HIGH SCHOOL at the time! I found this book to be so fantastic, absurd, and boring that I could not finish it. Even a good book of the fantasy genre has a plausable fact upon which to build the story. This has none. I do not know how an adult reader could enjoy this type of work. On the other hand, I would recommend it to high school freshman and sophomore boys who might not have an interest in reading. It might be attractive to them. To others - - stay away. And with that, I will be silent as I would be embarrassed to admit I tried to read this book to any of my friends."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I have not read a Clive Cussler book since high school when I read Raise the Titantic. My parents were clearing out their library in preparation for moving and my wife and I took two Clive Cussler books (Trojan Odyssey and Valhalla Rising). I read Trojan Odyssey while my wife read Valhalla Rising. While we both finished the respective books, we both walked away with a dislike of Dirk Pitt as well as Cussler's writing style.I'm accustomed to fiction that has some basis in technical and historical accuracy. That includes authors like Tom Clancy and Jack Whyte. Clive Cussler is not one to let improbability or scientific inaccuracy stand in the way of his story. Combine that with a writing style that feels dumbed down, over exaggerated, one dimensional, and offers few positive comments regarding women with the exception of how they look in their bikini or sun dress, and you have a book where the entertainment value is greatly diminished. Then, there's Dirk Pitt; a \\"protagonist\\" that provides little appeal to the reader unless you like shallow characters that can miraculously save the day chapter after chapter with little effort under odds that every other character finds \\"impossible\\" or \\"inconceivable.\\"With all of my disdain for Dirk Pitt, historical and technical accuracy, and Cussler's writing style, there is certainly some entertainment value to the book. It's a quick read and has some nice descriptive elements, especially regarding the ocean, a favorite topic of mine. If you are looking for a relatively mindless book to read and credibility is not an issue, then you may enjoy this book.I may reread Raise the Titantic again just to see how much Cussler's writing and Dirk Pitt have changed in the more than twenty years between their being written."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I like a good thriller with a nod to history and other cultures. This wasn't one of those books. It was a bunch of nonsense, poorly written and with a weak plot, weak character development and nonsensical scenarios. The first and last of Cussler for me."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"My exposure to this author prior to reading this book was very limited, having seen only the movie \\"Sahara\\" (which I enjoyed immensely). My expectation that this book would be as enjoyable as the aforementioned Dirk Pitt movie was simply not borne out. Don't get me wrong, this is not a total flop, but neither will it impress very many readers.On the plus side, I thought the general storyline was quite creative and engaging. The various elements drawn into the nefarious plot of Specter, such as the foray into Homer, Celtic history, and modern issues of Chinese ascendancy and Western energy dependence, were skillfully crafted, in my opinion. Also, I enjoyed the flavor provided by Cussler's technical knowledge of all things nautical. It was reminiscent of a Tom Clancy novel in that sense.Where the story falls flat is pretty much everywhere else. I thought the characters were too shallow and too slick -- which is really sad considering how many novels this author has written about them. One would expect much better character development at this late stage in the series. Also, the dialogue seemed a bit stilted and unrealistic. Finally, there was very little suspense, which is a key element in stories of this nature. Pitt and Giordino made everything look too easy. Their seemingly flawless handling of every tight situation made James Bond look like a bumbling moron by comparison. As a result the ending was more than a little predictable and therefore disappointing.To summarize, I think Cussler is a talented writer who simply didn't deliver in this novel. I will likely read more in the Dirk Pitt series, but if the next one or two novels don't excite me any better than this one did, that will be the end of it for me."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Why is the author slowly letting the superstars Dirk and Al fade away????

His lucid style and awesome research makes accessible the complexity of a tense period that threatened the American way of life. This book uncovers not only the escalating events but the dynamic and individualistic human elements within the U.S. administrations that sets the stage for dramatic, if not drastic, responses against the Soviet power. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Empress in the Wrinkle of Time","review":"Empress in the Wrinkle of Time was a definite page-turner from start to finish. Building on the mythology of alien abduction, the author takes us far into the future where an interplanetary feudal society has only the vaguest memories of their roots in our own world. This is a tale of heroism, duty and sacrifice in which Tai and Chehada must navigate a mine field of political intrigue and the manipulations of a not-so-benign artificial intelligence, and the stakes are nothing less than the survival of the species. The characters are well developed and human, the story line is clean and clear, and the plot runs and twists like a wild horse. Definitely a must read."},{"Title":"J SCOTT SCHEEL COLOSSAL CASH IN COMMERCIAL PROPERTY","review":"If commercial insight is what you are needing to get started in commercial real estate, this CD set should do the trick."},{"Title":"J SCOTT SCHEEL COLOSSAL CASH IN COMMERCIAL PROPERTY","review":"Great Real Estate Program for beginners to learn to make alot in buying and selling real estate"},{"Title":"J SCOTT SCHEEL COLOSSAL CASH IN COMMERCIAL PROPERTY","review":"Happy_sellers, who has this item listed, is dishonest, ships after the expected delivery date, and severely misrepresents the product.

Young Eddie is determined to help his father find the right woman, so there is plenty of humor to get past the sad part. If you liked The Bridge to Terabithia, you'll probably find value in this modern classic as well. It inspired the film starring Glenn Ford (The Blackboard Jungle, Superman), Ronny Howard (The Music Man, Andy Griffith), Shirley Jones (The Music Man, Oklahoma), and Stella Stevens (The Nutty Professor), as well as the TV series starring Bill Bixby (The Incredible Hulk), and a more recent TV pilot with Josh Hutcherson (Bridge to Terabithia, Little Manhattan).

Each book was almost 3 times the amount of the first book.I am happy that I decided to read all three. I was also confused as to why thE Author always made reference that the Mennonites were saved and the Amish weren't because they too were good people.

Very pleased with all of her books as they show forth the Christian faith."},{"Title":"The Reckoning (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Heritage of Lancaster County)","review":"In this last book of the trilogy, Katie, or Katherine as she now calls herself has inherited her surrogate mother's wealth. Living in the huge estate in New York, she has servants waiting on her hand and foot. There's also Justin Wirth, Katie's new love.But Katie really and truly isn't sure that this is for her. She finds new outlets to keep her busy. She volunteers at the hospice house, and meets many special people there. Especially a boy, Willie, who is slowly dying of brain cancer. She finds in this boy, and instant friendship.Katie also starts a quilting club, the way her Amish folks at home had. Many of the women fall for it, and 2 of them are Amish themselves. They are trying to put a large quilt together for the Hospice Katie is working for, using it to hopefully donate a large sum of money for that cause and help others at the same time.Jason Fisher, Katie's very first love who has not really died but disappeared for awhile, is coming after Katie there in her new home. But when he looks her up, there is a rude awakening to him, as Katie is very angry; not understanding how Jason could just pretend to have been dead all these years when he wasn't, and not coming back to her. She turns him away, and Jason goes away broken-hearted. It is not until later on that the two through circumstances back in Hickory Hollow, meet up again and maybe come to terms.Mary Stolzfus, Katie's best friend is in love with the bishop John Beiler. They become romantically involved and eventually get married. Mary has always felt guilty that she took Katie's place with John there after Katie ran out on her wedding day with John. And she feels she must make peace with Katie over this matter. And moreso since she is also mother to John's five children. Katie had promised John's youngest son that she would be his new mommy, and when the wedding fell through, the boy was devastated.Rebecca, whom I identify as Katie's real mom longs to see her daughter again. And they do find each other again later in the book. Her Amish dad, Samuel never does get over Katie's transgressions as far as he's concerned and never really speaks to his only daughter again. And there are several people in the Amish community that still feel this way.Katie, through all of these new life ventures, between plain vs. fancy, discover really what the true God is, and where God wants her to be in her life. The conclusion I thought was a bit predictable, yet it seemed the way that things would turn out in the end."},{"Title":"The Reckoning (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Heritage of Lancaster County)","review":"I fell in love with the Bev Lewis books and could not stop reading till I had finished this book."},{"Title":"The Reckoning (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Heritage of Lancaster County)","review":"I loved The Shunning. I tolerated The Confession. But The Reckoning? Oh, no.Katie started out as an interesting, believable girl in The Shunning, but by the end of The Reckoning she was annoying and preachy. In fact, the whole tone of this book is annoying and preachy.And then there's Justin. He's the heroine's love interest, and he's never even given a personality. He's just a nice but bland cardboard cutout who spends lots of money on Katherine.And then there's the conclusion. I won't spoil it for you, in case you decide to ignore my warning and read this book anyway, but I will say that it's just what the title of my review says - a very disappointing ending. Not only that, but it doesn't even fit with Katie/Katherine's character...at least, not her character from the beginning of the trilogy.And, as another reviewer pointed out, there is the constant, and not at all subtle, refrain that the Amish aren't \\"saved\\" (though apparently the Mennonites are). This is particularly bad at the end of the book, though by the time I got there I was so fed up with it all that I didn't really care.My advice: Read the Shunning. Then make up your own ending rather than reading the rest of the series."},{"Title":"The Reckoning (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Heritage of Lancaster County)","review":"What was Justin Wirth's reaction to Katherine not marrying him? Again, the author seems to leave out important parts of the story because she does not know what to write. Was he angry, heartbroken?Even though Katie had many friends at Mayfield Manor and out, like Natalie Judah, not to mention her handsome suitor, Justin Wirth, I still felt she felt somewhat solitary and isolated compared to the life she had led with the Amish, where there were always frolics and things to do and people to do it with. The Mormon Church is the same way. When I left it after five years, I felt so lonely because I was not used to being alone, it is so easy to make friends in the Mormon Church because everyone shares the same beliefs and that right there separates you from most of the rest of the world, thus making it hard to relate to anyone on the outside, so the only friends you have are Mormon, but after more than a year of \\"breaking away\\" (and I was lucky, because my family wasn't Mormon like Katie's was Amish), I am finally starting to make friends in the real world again, and I was lucky to have a friend like Mary Stoltzfus, though Mary stayed, my friend did not--we were baptized around the same time and left around the same time, I had someone to make the exodus with me, Katie was pretty much alone, even Peter and Lydia Miller, her Mennonite cousins, could not completely understand why she wanted to be all worldly. I would say, from my understanding of the book, that the Mennonites are that healthy balance between faith and works. Laura's life was extravagant, but that did not make her happy, it was her faith in Jesus that made her happy, but the comforts like electricity did make her life a little easier.Laura's journals were boring and could have been left out. I would have much rather heard one of Rebecca Lapp's famous stories or even an authentic Amish recipe favorite of the author's would have been better. Katie must have gotten her strength from her biological father because Laura seemed like such a weak individual, allowing both her first boyfriend and her husband to use her. I can understand being young and naive at seventeen, but at twenty-six (when she married the dastardly Dylan), at thirty-nine (which I figured was how old she was when she passed away)? Katie was never that naive, even when she and Dan were going together in Hickory Hollow.Katie was half fancy (by nature), half Plain (by nurture), so I suppose it was inevitable she become a Mennonite (as her beloved Daniel is Mennonite), but just as she could not see the reason why she had to wear the Amish kapp, why does she then wear the Mennonite head covering, as she says \\"in obedience to God and my husband\\"? God does not require it, just as He does not require the Amish bonnet.Obedience to one's husband is very important in Mrs. Lewis's books, because Laura wanted to have a Bible study in her home (since she was too sick to attend church, I am assuming) but Dylan did not want those people coming over and so she obeyed, just hoping someday he would find Jesus. I do not think obeying one's husband is equal to obeying God; I think sometimes we obey God when we disobey our disbelieving husbands, and there was another thing. Ruth Stine, the girl Owen and Eve Hess (Dan Fisher's Mennonite friends), were trying to get him to see, still lived under her parents' roof, which she was going to do until she married, Mrs. Lewis makes it sound like this is what God wants for all women (and just women), but according to the Bible, the same standard should be applied to men, because a man leaves his father and mother and cleaves unto his wife, indicating he is still living at home. I do believe all girls are better off living at home (if it is a loving one) for safety reasons more than anything else, but also financial ones.All in all, this was a consistently very good series, though a bit heavy on the preaching, a little too much telling and not enough showing in parts, but worth reading over and over again.P.S. Not everyone has a glow about them or is suddenly happy when they get saved. When I was saved, I looked and felt no different than before, yet I have faith that I was saved. I do not need proof (I am not saying Katie did, I am just saying Christian authors try to make it sound like getting saved is that way for everyone, which may lead some people to doubt their own salvation). Christian authors need to be careful of this."},{"Title":"The Reckoning (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Heritage of Lancaster County)","review":"I am very disappointed in the editors of this series.

It seems like, after Katherine gets her dream life, she loses everything that endeared her to us in The Shunning. Please don't get me wrong, I love this book and it's predesessor, The Confession.

I wish there were more!"},{"Title":"The Reckoning (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Heritage of Lancaster County)","review":"While the story is great and I've learned a lot about the Amish community, I felt that the story was ended short. You read the whole book to have Daniel and Katie get together in the end, in the last half of the last chapter. It would have been great if the author would have grown the relationship a litte more and explained in more detail about Katie giving up her mansion and what she did with her money. Also, it would have been great to see if Justin Wirth was really a good guy and really loved Katie enough to give her up in love or was really angry when Katie said &quot;no&quot; to his marriage proposal. I do hope there is a sequel."},{"Title":"The Reckoning (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Heritage of Lancaster County)","review":"Katherine is now the lady of the mansion inherited from her mother, Laura, and she has learned that her childhood sweetheart is alive, not drowned like she thought for 5 years. His contact with her is very interesting........as is the fact that her best Amish friend, Mary, has conveniently coaxed her boyfriend....the parson, to revoke the speaking ban against Katie. Is it all enough, and in time, to pull Katherine back to her Amish roots and to Daniel Fisher the ex-lover she feels has lied to her and whom she wants to forget? Will her new beau be enough to make her forget? Or what, really, is his purpose for pursuing her...is it just to get her wealth, and will his apparent love for her survive the doubts and struggles that burn in her bosom? What of her &quot;other&quot; Mom, Rebecca Lapp, and her lifetime Amish friend, Mary? What of her new-found friends who work for her in the mansion? Katherine tries to completely lose herself in her volunteer position at a loc! al hospice...only to become extremely attached to a dying child. She also decides to incorporate &quot;some&quot; of her Amish ways at her new luxurious home and life....she starts a quilting class for friends and the city's elite. Learning there is an Amish family near her new home, and deciding to visit there under the guise of purchasing jellies only adds to her confusion. Will all this eventually make her content, or only serve to confuse her more? Can she ever give up the &quot;worldly, English ways&quot;, all the conveniences and the pretty clothing and things she always longed for, or can she completely erase the memories of her life as an Amish girl? What a can of worms was opened with the simple discovery of that tiny satin pink dress way, way back in book number one. This third and last book is a wonderful, intriguing and powerful conclusion to Beverly Lewis's 3 book series called The Heritage of Lancaster County."},{"Title":"The Reckoning (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Heritage of Lancaster County)","review":"This book was the best one of all because I really wanted to know which one Katie chose, Dan or Justin.It surprised me when she chose Dan at the end because all through the story she had rejected him.I was glad she chose him. And when she got saved, it made me cry; I was so happy she got saved. I was really waiting for her to do it throughout the story. At first, I thought that all the Amish people would be won over to the Lord like Katie and Dan had been. Since they weren't though that was ok too because the story was already interesting enough."},{"Title":"The Reckoning (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Heritage of Lancaster County)","review":"I enjoyed &quot;The Shunning&quot; immensely. I couldn't wait to read the sequels and find out what happened to Katie. The sequels provided closure to the events in the first story but failed to develop the characters further. Even more disturbing was the intimation that the Amish are not Christians; that they have need of being &quot;saved&quot;. If the author meant to insinuate that she needed to find a way to back up her theology. The 3rd book is consumed with this idea and thus confuses the message. The Amish ways may be rigid, tradition driven, and unyielding. It could be argued that they are wrong on certain theological points--but not Christians? I wouldn't want to be the one to judge."},{"Title":"The Reckoning (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Heritage of Lancaster County)","review":"**This is the conclusion to The Heritage of Lancaster County Series. If you haven't read the first two books, The Shunning and The Confession, you may not want to read this review**We have followed Katie Lapp, now known as Katherine Mayfield, through her unbelievable journey. We followed her as she left her Amish community to find her biological mother. We also followed her as she found her biological mother and had her taken away so quickly due to a rapid illness.Her story continues as she becomes head of the Mayfield Manor. She may have left the Amish community but you can't take the Amish out of her. Katherine decides to volunteer at hospice all the while her relationship with the artist continues to flourish. What she didn't expect was for her dead first love to come knocking on her door opening up a door full of heartache and love. What will happen to her relationship with the artist? Will Katherine re-connect with the man she loved who she thought was dead? To find out, read The Reckoning.I really liked this book, however I thought that it did drag on some. I had a feeling that Katherine and Dan would re-connect, I just didn't think it would be drawn out until the final pages of the book. Overall, I thought the series was a must read if you enjoy Amish fiction. Please make sure to read the series in order starting with The Shunning, The Confession, & finally The Reckoning. It is important to read these in order because each book leads into the next and I promise you don't want to miss a thing!I rate this book 4/5"},{"Title":"The Reckoning (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Heritage of Lancaster County)","review":"So, a while back (it's been over a year now I think) I joined GoodReads.It's an amazing website, sign up if you don't use it already!And on that website I found a book group which I adore, Fans of Amish Fiction.I have since really gotten into the genre. After being an active member of the group for some months, I decided it was time to read one of the most well-known Amish books of all time, The Shunning by Beverly Lewis.Immediately I was sucked into the series, and so finally, I have read the entire series. Today marks my last of the reviews from the series.Today I am reviewingThe ReckoningThe Reckoning is the third book in Beverly Lewis' series, The Heritage of Lancaster County.It is the final installment following the story of Katherine Mayfield.If you haven't read the first two books and you don't want anySPOILERS, then STOP READING NOW!:) I will try not to give away too much, but in order to write my review I have to give away some secrets from the first two books.Katherine is now the new Mistress of Mayfield Manor. She has left her Amish family behind after finding her biological mother when she learned she was adopted many years before and her parents had never told her.Katherine is beginning to miss her Amish family. Her biological mother has passed away, and now that she feels so much more alone, she is feeling the pangs of loneliness. Yet she cannot go home to her Amish family unless she confesses and joins the church as she is under the shun.During this book, her long-lost love, Daniel Fisher is trying to locate her once again, and the book revolves around the two as he is trying to get the chance to meet her.Will Katherine find contentment in her new life? Or will she decide to return to her Amish family? And what of her former love, Daniel Fisher? Will he find her? And if he does, will they be able to work through the past and move forward?Read The Reckoning to find out!I am so glad I finally read this series. It almost seems like anyone who loves Amish fiction must read this series at some point.While this wasn't my favorite book in the series, I think it's a great conclusion to the story. I found it frustrating at some points who Daniel and Katherine almost met, and yet he gave up too easily when he struggled to get information about her and encountered other obstacles.I think you MUST read this series, and definitely take the time to read this third book. It is not really a stand-alone novel, so start at the beginning of the series with The Shunning (you can read my review of that book here) and then move on to The Confession (you can read my review of that book here) and finish with The Reckoning.3.5 out of 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Reckoning (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Heritage of Lancaster County)","review":"Having read the first two and finding them quite enjoyable, I was extremely disappointed in the last book of this series. It seemed more like the author had tired of the story and just wanted to wrap it up and try and answer everyone's questions as quickly as she could. There were WAY too many side-stories in this book, the only one I found myself interested in was Mary's. You already know what is going to happen with Katherine once Daniel makes his appearance. Even though Katherine seems genuinely in love with Justin, she suddenly makes decisions to which we get no real detail of her execution of those decisions and are left wondering what really happened. She comes off more like a ditz who can't make up her mind... I am Plain, no I was meant to be English... oh wait no I am really Plain... I read it and managed to finish it because I felt the need to read them all once I started but it was really a huge waste of the money I spent on the eBook download, not to mention the time I will never get back!"},{"Title":"The Reckoning (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Heritage of Lancaster County)","review":"As the ending of a super trilogy, I was a bit disappointed.

As with all of her books, she writes very well, about the \\"Plain\\" people and the countryside and lifestyles of the Amish folk.ALL OF HER books are \\"page turners\\" and I highly recommend them!

I would have like to have seen less of Bishop Biler and Mary's courtship which too up several pages and more of the courtship of Daniel and Katherine/Katy which was only a few sentences. I think the author was in a rush to finish the book and just tacked that on the end. I would have liked to have the scene where she finally broke it off with Justin. I would have like to see her come to the conclusion that it would not work with Justin because Justin did not share her beliefs but we did not get that.This is the first series I have read by Beverly Lewis and not sure I am going to read any more if she is going to rush things in all her novels.

I've found this series a little drawn out. Typically, if I really enjoy a book, I will read it in a matter of a day or two but I've put this one down several times, for several days at a time. Not a horrible read, just not the greatest either. The book quality was immaculate and I'm glad that I bought it on amazon at a lower price rather than the high prices the bookstores were charging.

The story she started in November with Katie ready to marry Bishop John Beiler before she learns of her \\"adoption\\" by her parents Sam and Rebecca Lapp comes to a surprsing end. Since the end of the second book where we learned about Dylan's duplicity with the imposter, Katie is aknowledged as the only child of Laura Bennet-Mayfield and is being courted by Justin Worth, the artist that guessed her identity and finds her captivating and wants so much to show her a world she has never seen.

One thing I noticed in all of the books was the theme that the Amish faith is mistaken and everyone should become Mennonites. I didn't like that at all. The other thing I got was that the Amish eat a lot of pies, which made me hungry :)I have a good Mennonite friend and many of the things mentioned in the book about Mennonites doing aren't correct from what he has told me. For one, they don't celebrate birthdays at all (at least where he's from) and they don't often have official meeting houses. They typically hold Church in the members' homes. And, they have computers, Internet access, etc. He comes from a family of 16 and almost all of the men have served in the military and most work in law enforcement. One of his sisters is a physician.For the most part, the character development was very good. I still laugh over Katie thinking Katherine is a fancy name. I always considered it plain and old fashioned. I suppose my favorite character was Ella Mae Zook. She was a riot.

All three books tell of the life of Katie Lapp, who grew up in the Amish community of Hickory Hollow in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.'The book is not only concerned with the romantic life of Katie Lapp, but also includes her spiritual journey as well. These books are a wonderful read. They also include relationships with the Mennonite brethren, another group in the Anabaptist tradition, from which the Amish broke.Amish hold to the \\"old ways\\" and forbid themselves the use of electrical power tools, electrical appliances, and even the use of electric lighting. On exception is that the Amish do permit the use of battery powered flashlights. They do not operate vehicles powered by Internal Combusion Engines, however, they will be a passenger in a car of truck if a non-Amish drives.THE RECKONING completes the series, bringing to an end the various loose ends introduced by the author. I enjoyed the entire series, and hope to read more Beverly Lewis, who grew up in Lancaster County, PA, and has done a great deal of historical research for her novels./"},{"Title":"The Reckoning (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Heritage of Lancaster County)","review":"I liked this one too.If you get this one,get all the rest.You will be hooked.Nadia Rehmani"},{"Title":"The Reckoning (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Heritage of Lancaster County)","review":"I'm originally from Lancaster County and thus grew up knowing a fair amount about the Amish lifestyle. This series (&quot;The Shunning,&quot; &quot;The Confession,&quot; and &quot;The Reckoning&quot;) weaves an intriguing plot and can enlighten readers about a culture that is part of our society and yet deliberately separate from it at the same time. For that element, I highly recommend these books.However, the change of setting for part of the story bothers me. I visit Canandaigua, New York, several times a year, and it's a truly wonderful place. I was initially surprised and pleased that Beverly Lewis chose to have Katie / Katherine move to that area. But why use a real city without revealing the unique personality of the place? None of Lewis' characters ever mention the fact that Canandaigua sits at the northern tip of one of the Finger Lakes. The lake is large, noticeable, a tourist attraction, and comes up in local conversation at least once every few days, even if you can't see it from your house. Even during wintertime -- which is when Katie / Katherine lives there in &quot;The Confession&quot; -- people talk about whether or not the lake is frozen over. Certainly an Amish woman with a farming background would wonder about the presence of sea gulls around her new home. And she probably would be astounded by the size of Canandaigua's Main Street, which has a wide grass median down the middle of it and doesn't look anything like Lancaster, Pa., or any town she would have seen before. (For those of us who watch TV and movies, the street resembles the Bedford Falls of &quot;It's a Wonderful Life,&quot; but of course, Katie wouldn't know about that.) Perhaps Lewis should have created a ficticious city in western New York, instead of doing an injustice to an existing one."},{"Title":"The Reckoning (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Heritage of Lancaster County)","review":"I have not started reading this book yet. I am in the middle of the second book! But I am willing to say it is as good as the other two and I will not be able to put it down either."},{"Title":"The Reckoning (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Heritage of Lancaster County)","review":"If you've read The Shunning and The Confession, you've got to follow up with this new title! As with the first two books in the series, this was a page-turner. While the previous titles left me with a negative feeling toward the Amish (in relation to their beliefs and practices), Lewis digs a little deeper into the hearts of the Amish characters in The Reckoning. In it, she shows that, though under the hand of the order, the men and women are truly individuals who can see the imperfections in the Amish beliefs but still revere the traditions. Also, it's good to see Katherine mature in The Reckoning. She opens her eyes to the world and to the Lord. Just as with the last two, I can't wait to see where Lewis takes Katherine/Katie in the next title in the series."},{"Title":"The Reckoning (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Heritage of Lancaster County)","review":"The story itself wasn't that bad, but pretty much a typical romance formula. Young lovers run into problems, part, reunite... Of course this one had an Amish flavor, and I enjoyed reading the speech patterns. My main gripe with the series wasn't the story or it's predicatbility. It is that the story could have been told in a single book, or maybe 2, if the author had fleshed it out some.(Here's the 'spoiler' part; for those who don't want to know the end...quit reading NOW!) Katie and Daniel do, of course, reunite, but it seemed the story dragged out forever before they got there! It seemed totally out of character for Katie to not see what was up with the stranger the first time the butler turned Daniel away. And for NO ONE to realize he was speaking of the REAL Katie Lapp, and not the imposter, was totally unbelievable! Then, when Katie finally DID meet Daniel, her reaction was NOT what I would expect from someone who'd been in love with his memory all those years. I'm not Amish, but Katie was, and I would think that at least some of the 'confession and forgiveness' thing would have rubbed off to the point that she could have accepted him as a friend, if not her mate.Getting past that, for a 3 book series, the author left way too many things unanswered. Forget that the stepfather and imposter daughter were not prosecuted in the 2nd book. But what about Justin Wirth. Many times the author hinted at the idea that he may have been more interested in Katherine's money than Katherine. We never find out if he really loved her, or if he wanted to marry into her wealth as her 'step'father had marreid her biological mother. How does Katherine turn down his proposal and how does he react? Katie's mother attended her wedding, but what about her 'dat' and her brothers? Is she able to maintain a friendship with Mary, and how does the Bishop react?As I said, the story itself wasn't really a BAD story...just incomplete, and way too long for the material covered."},{"Title":"The Reckoning (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Heritage of Lancaster County)","review":"The Lancaster county series enticed me into the amish way of life. Beverly Lewis truly did her homework before writing these books. I love when an author can truly captivate the Lord's love and grace. Mrs. Lewis certainly did this. It was very interesting to see how the amish live and the bondage that they lived in. Also, it's good to see that the bondage and the feeling of capitivity can be transformed through Jesus Christ. A heart warming series that will stay in my heart."},{"Title":"The Reckoning (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Heritage of Lancaster County)","review":"I read all three in the series and I couldn't wait to finish. This one made a great ending to the whole story of Katie. Allthough I wish it would have told more about Katie and Daniel's life together, it gave me some pondering of what happened to them!"},{"Title":"The Reckoning (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Heritage of Lancaster County)","review":"After quickly digesting The Shunning and The Confession, I was a bit letdown with The Reckoning.Her mother, Rebecca, never told her people that she had withheld an important truth from them. I would have found it to be more believable that she would admit this truth, since rumor had gotten out about Katie's adoption. Surely the honesty and goodness of her adoptive mother was as important as the sterling qualities of her birth mother.I was rooting for Katherine and Dan to get back together, but there was not enough of an explanation about why she returns to Dan. What happens to the kind, loving man named Justin? Certainly his character was shown as a strong, caring man who was always good to Katherine. Why isn't there at least a conversation explaining how she turns her back on Justin and runs to Dan? Again, we see no real compelling reason for her to do this at the end.A glimpse into Katherine's soul or at least her emotional viewpoint before the important climax would have made it more interesting."},{"Title":"The Reckoning (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Heritage of Lancaster County)","review":"I thought that this book seemed a little rushed at the end. By about 1/2 way through, I knew what was going to happen at the end (if not earlier). I thought that it was well written, but some story lines were just dropped--for instance, we never know what Justin's reaction is to Katie's decision, and we never find out more about Katie's life change at the end.I did like how the Amish quilters were brought into the story. Also, I liked how Daniel was written in. However, I think that it is a little strange how, by the end of the book, a bunch of the Plain people are being &quot;saved&quot;. As I said in one of my other reviews, I think there could be a little less preaching going on in the story, but it's ok.There were emotional sections of the book, but I think that there could possibly be one more book coming in the series. The book ended well, but there were still questions, in my mind..."},{"Title":"The Reckoning (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Heritage of Lancaster County)","review":"I bought this book assuming that it would be a conclusion to &quot;The Shunning&quot; and The Confession.&quot; While Katie Lapp (aka Catherine Mayfield) is reunited with her childhood sweetheart at the end, there seem to be alot of hoops for the poor young man to jump through - for one thing, why weren't Catherine's servants told that her real name was Katie Lapp, so they wouldn't assume Dan was looking for the imposter who called herself by the same name? It would have left more room in the book to better explain the events that seemed a bit rushed at the end!"},{"Title":"The Reckoning (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Heritage of Lancaster County)","review":"As a former resident of Lancaster County and a friend of many Amish, I was thrilled to read this blessed series from Ms. Lewis. A friend here gave me the first on and I just knew I had to read all three. I hope she writes something new very soon."},{"Title":"The Reckoning (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Heritage of Lancaster County)","review":"The Reckoning is the third book in Beverly Lewis' Heritage of Lancaster County series. While I loved the first book, and abhorred the second, I have mixed feelings about the third.The story starts with Katherine becoming accustomed to life at the mansion after her biological mother's death. Just as she is settling in and getting used to things, Daniel, an old boyfriend whom she thought dead shows up on her doorstep begging forgiveness. Its a little more than Katherine can handle and she send him away.Meanwhile, to fill her time she dates the charming painter Justin and volunteers at a hospice where she makes friends with a young boy dying from terminal cancer. She also hosts a quilting class in her home with several friends and also some newer friends, local amish people.Something is missing from her life though and as the ban on her shunning is partially lifted she returns home to talk with her family and friends and somewhat misses the Amish even though she has found a new religious relationship.The ending came as quite a surprise for me. While I had a suspicion that it might end up the way it did, I never imagined the destination to be what it was. It was as if Lewis changed her mind literally between paragraphs to a different ending and followed through with it.While I was pleased to see the development of characters improve in this novel over the second, I have some reservations about the novel. There seemed to be a quite open agenda throughout the entire novel, a theme if you will. While I realize Beverly Lewis' writings are technically classified as Christian fiction, this book was so blatant about its proselytizing it was almost off-putting. While I love reading about the Amish and their culture, the constant references to being saved by Jesus in the Mennonite and regular Christian churches Catherine attends was heavy handed.Lewis still offers a lot of detail in her writing and a nice history of the Amish. While most of it is written in the 3rd person, the prologue and epilogue are written through Katherine's eyes. It brings a nice change and divide in the novel.The ReckoningPublished in 1998281 pages"},{"Title":"The Reckoning (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Heritage of Lancaster County)","review":"(DISCLAIMER: IF YOU HAVE NOT READ THE BOOK, DO NOT READ MY REVIEW. I DISCUSS SPECIFICS ABOUT THE ENDING.) I was a little disappointed in The Reckoning, because after reading all 3 books in the Katie Lapp series and wondering which roads Katie would take, the author hurriedly tied-up the ending in 2 or 3 pages. It seemed like Ms. Lewis was rushing to finish the novel. She left out the best parts! We did not even get a glimpse of Katie's wedding to Dan; or how the nurse took the news that Katie's house would be donated to Hospice; of how Justin took the news that Katie was breaking-up with him immediately following his proposal to her; or how Katie's or Dan's families reacted when Katie and Dan came back; or whether Katie witnessed to any of her Amish family, etc. While the dry details of the novel were drug-on through the book, such as the specifics of making Mississippi Mud, or how much time Katie spent lounging in her library, the most important facts of all three of novels were breezed over in the end.Also, the diary of Katie's mother seemed contrived, and not at all what one would expect of a pregnant teenage daughter. The adolescent's parents seemed thrilled at the prospect that their daughter was pregnant, and not at all vested in any decision that she would make concerning her decision of whether to keep or give away the baby. And the girl refered to the baby's father as \\"my boyfriend\\" instead of by his name, as if the reader was not intelligent enough to figure-out who he was.Lest I am too hard on Ms. Lewis, though, I should mention that I have been pleased with the wholesomeness and Christian principles that her writings portray. And the storylines are usually quite suspenseful."},{"Title":"The Reckoning (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Heritage of Lancaster County)","review":"I love this book!

However, it is easy to overlook that Singapore was more than just a bastion of British might, even usurping the Sumatra rubber burning industry as it was more efficient than the Dutch efforts, despite desires of the Dutch to keep that money maker inside its borders. Therefore Singapore was basing a good part of its well being in the early part of this century upon the lack of industry on the Dutch side, mainly because it was a modern city hub of the region at that time and one that provided stable reinvestment.Other examples are given, like the industrial machining might developing about 1930 because it was the next logical step.All that was needed was for multinationals to give them the steady workload as they had already done most of the jobs before (as was the case industrial wise in Japan, Germany, and similar countries after WWII, the people's skill was the primary mover).It may seem like a small issue, but it destroys the myth of Singapore being a backwater and bodes ill for any country trying to rise up in short order from absolutely nothing (no examples of such, actually, in modern times, though Australia &amp; N.Z. come closest from the periods of 1787-1900 &amp; 1830-1900). It is interesting that in those cases as was similar with Singapore &amp; Hong Kong, migration of an industrious population was the keystone, beyond natural resources.)"},{"Title":"The Economic Growth of Singapore: Trade and Development in the Twentieth Century","review":"There are many texts about the development of Singapore from when it achieved self-government in 1959. This book does not try to compete with them. Instead, most of it deals with the period between about 1869, with the opening of the Suez Canal, and 1959. Much of the analysis about the early period contradict popular mythology about Singapore -- the country was not backwards and poor when it became independent; in fact, it had a GDP per capital about 1/3 that of the U.K. This book describes how this came to be the case.It also discusses the more recent period, but the material there is similar to what is available elsewhere. The five stars I'm giving the book are for the earlier chapters.I have heard representatives of third world nations describe their development plans as being \\"Singapore like,\\" meaning that they plan to rocket from poverty into selling intellectual and financial services in a short period of time. I wish more of them understood the special circumstances that allowed Singapore to make the leap, and the length of time that it really took. This book is valuable for anybody considering similar problems."},{"Title":"None Dare Call It Education: What's Happening to Our Schools & Our Children?","review":"It's a little ironic all those open-minded liberals out there have such a limited view of the world -- theirs. And their view is the equal opposite of the Christian worldview. What's even more ironic is that these same anti-Christian liberals want to have such a direct influence over the hearts, minds and moral values of your kids and mine. They talk endlessly about their open-minded views but ensure the courts forbid Christian views from creeping back into public schools. Now they're getting excited because tens of thousands of Christian parents have finally figured out their game plan and decided to remove our children from their indoctrination program called public education. We need more books like this. We need more parents to read books like this and act accordingly. Because Dr. Stormer's book deals with both education and Christian values, I recommend several other books similar to None Dare Call It Education, including, The Harsh Truth About Public Schools, Legally STUPiD: Why Johnny doesn't have to read, Godless: The Church of Liberalism, The Deberate Dumbing Down of America, Schools We Need and Why We Don't Have Them and Public Schools Against America: The Hidden Agenda."},{"Title":"None Dare Call It Education: What's Happening to Our Schools & Our Children?","review":"Global system WILL DEFINATELY BEINFERIOR!

How Mr. Stormer slants that information is a bit hard to stomach.I am homeschooling my children and am always on the lookout for information to further support this decision. If I can bring myself to pick up the book again I think I'll find some more valid reasons to do so hiding amongst the \\"real\\" reasons for this books release.I think a more appropriate title would have been along the lines of \\"How the evil, sinful homosexuals of the world are attempting to brainwash our children in our schools\\"Unless you share this very biased Christian view, the reading of this book is going to be very hard going.If you can take what you want and leave the rest, this book does have some value to offer in making clear what some of the problems are today with our school system."},{"Title":"None Dare Call It Education: What's Happening to Our Schools & Our Children?","review":"This book is the most ridiculous and sick publication I've ever read. Stormer is clearly whacked out and completely uninformed. He doesn't back his ridiculous claims and when he trys to do so, quotes textbooks from the 50's that aren't even used anymore. He sites examples taken from parents and has obviously not researched the problems these people are having with their children. Instead of blaming bad parenting, he blames our educational system. He's very good at passing the buck.I've talked with educators as well as school district personnel who can't believe the ridiculous claims Stormer makes. After researching this whack job, I also found that he's directly correlated with the John Birch Society and Pat Robertson - there's a clue! It's clear this man is a homophobe and is using this book to shove his twisted views down the throats of those of us looking to improve our children's education. Don't buy into this garbage - it's clear that he feels that our children should never enter into society.Don't buy this book - it's a joke. If you need more info, try checking out reviews on his other ridiculous book \\"None Dare Call it Treason\\" - here he claims that our whole country is run by communists and we just don't know it!

When?) The King James Version is not an answer to *anything*, much less to our underfunded, overburdened public school system.

I highly recommend it...in fact, I have loaned my copy out to at least 12 people and every one of them, without exception, loved the book...most of them purchased their own copy after reading mine. The information contained in this book will scare you, especially if you have children in the public schools.

It is a real eye-opener revealing the plans and goals of education &quot;reformers&quot;. As stated in their own words, &quot;we no longer see the teaching of facts and information as the primary function of education&quot;, which is very obvious by the numbers of high school graduates who can not read, write or do math at an acceptable level. Instead of the 3R'S, programs such as GOALS 2000, OBE, or STW are all part of the plan to create &quot;a new social order&quot;. Read about how the national health care plan which was defeated in Congress is finding it's way in the back door in the form of medicaid reimbursements to school based health clinics. The signing up of school districts with the promise that &quot;the potential for dollars is limitless&quot; is being aggressively pursued across the country. Income eligibility guidelines are being reshaped in some states to include all children up to the age of 21 no matter what the family income. I fear in our country, we are like the frog that was placed in lukewarm water and very slowly the temperature was turned up, lulling him into complacency until it was too late for him to escape. Over the past 65 years or so there has been such a gradual change in the goals and philosophy of public education that we also have been lulled into complacency and fail to see the danger lurking. I urge concerned citizens to read this book and pass it on to someone else. Hopefully we will wake up before it's too late and we find we have no hope of salvaging our education system and most importantly our children, the future generation."},{"Title":"None Dare Call It Education: What's Happening to Our Schools & Our Children?","review":"This is an in-depth analysis about the many problems in the public school system in America. While reading it I often thought of Thomas Sowell's damming account of the public school system as detailed in his book \\"Inside American Education.\\" John Stormer covers many of the same areas and expresses many of the same concerns, but John Stormer does it from a religious standpoint. Both books are very concerned about the declining academic standards in the public school system, both books are explore how children are being brainwashed in public schools, and both books are very concerned with the political agenda of the NEA.John Stormer starts off by saying that before you can decide on what is the purpose of an education, you have to think about:1) What is the nature of man?2) What is his purpose?Most public school officials have a humanist point of view about the nature and purpose of man. John Stormer points out this leads them in fundamentally different directions than most Christian want to go.John Stormer quotes a number of professional educators who over the years have declared their intent to remake society, to \\"fix it up.\\" His opposition to this appears to be what drove him to write this book. He is concerned about the declining academic standards, and the first chapter documents how each year students are performing worse and worse in math, spelling, reading, history, and so on. Most of the rest of the book focuses how in different ways public schools are trying to remake society.There were a number of interesting points made in the book. For example John Stormer points out that it doesn't take years to teach Sex Education, the basics can be taught in an hour, maybe a couple hours if you really take your time. The reason Sex Education is taught for so long is to wear down the values being taught at home. Many at public schools are looking to have schools replace the family.If you are concerned about the decline in American Education over the last fifty years, but you aren't interested in a religious point of view, check out \\"Inside American Education.\\" If you are a Christian, and want more information on what is happening in public schools, this book is a good one to check out. \\"None Dare Call It Education\\" is well written and well documented."},{"Title":"None Dare Call It Education: What's Happening to Our Schools & Our Children?","review":"This book is mandatory reading for anyone who really cares about himself/herself, our children, and about the future of our country.

Hirsen's books, &quot;The Coming Collision, Global Law vs. U.S. Liberties&quot; and &quot;Government by Decree&quot; are the best way to find out what we're not being told by our own government.

If anything Stormers book is not strong enough.

You need to read this book today while there is still some opportunity to stop these wicked and deceitful people."},{"Title":"None Dare Call It Education: What's Happening to Our Schools & Our Children?","review":"Although this book contains some fluff, it makes an outstanding point. Anyone who thinks that the children who attend public schools are better educated than those who attend private or home school need to do some serious research. The public school system is a complete FAILURE and it just keeps getting worse. My children have experienced home, public, and private schools. After one year of public school, they were never allowed to go back. The format of this book may not be for everyone but it is worth every parents time to investigate what is going on in the public school systems of America."},{"Title":"None Dare Call It Education: What's Happening to Our Schools & Our Children?","review":"John Stromer has written a book that for the most part is precisely what I have been witnessing first hand since first grade, and into middle school with my children. We are fortune that homeschooling is possible for us and has been one of the best decisions we've ever made as a family. Our schools are in desperate need of change. The moral decline and lack of respect in our schools is appaulling. When you have teachers that are telling you that homeschooling is a good decision, you know something is wrong! Much of what Mr. Stromer writes in his book is extremely accurate and is cause for alarm for the future of our country."},{"Title":"Sociocultural Contexts of Language and Literacy","review":"For current or prospective teachers in most parts of the US, this book--or the equivalent--is almost a necessity. Perez's choice of essays allows us to get a broad perspective of the theory and practice of teaching in modern American classrooms, particularly in those areas with students who speak another language (about 17% [p. 11]) or a dialect of English other than the official standard (about 15%).In part 1, Perez reviews the situation in American schools through the turn beginning of this century. She notes how views of teaching and learning in relation to dialect and language have see-sawed over the years, more charged by politics than science. One prominent idea that some teachers have is that people who aren't fluent in \\"standard\\" English are somehow backward or deficient--and maybe morally suspect. Such an attitude keeps those teachers from learning from their students and from research, which shows that, when teachers respect and encourage students' home language or dialect, students learn standard English more readily.The bulk of the book, part 2, illustrates the differences in learning to read, write, and interact socially in English for students from a number of different language/dialect backgrounds, including Native, Chinese, Vietnamese, Hispanic, and African Americans. Each of the essays in this section is well researched and supported by references for further study. In addition, the authors have practical suggestions to help teachers who don't share these backgrounds to help students from them.Most of the focus in the book is on elementary schools. However, teachers at the secondary and college level can benefit from the discussion, if only to realize how it has come about that some of their students still have trouble with standard English. Teachers at those levels, of course, should be able to adopt and adapt the practical suggestions to their classrooms. The main point, though, is that everyone benefits--long and short term--from students' contributions to the class.No book is perfect, and this one has some shortcomings. In chapter 3, for instance, I was surprised to see R. Kaplan's diagrams of how people are supposed to think. These are terribly simplistic stereotypes bordering on racism. At the college level, many white middle-class American native speakers of English exhibit these same patterns of writing. (Also, the study was done in 1966, not 1970.)Also in chapter 3, I found the discussion of different writing systems to be somewhat muddled. The idea that anyone off the street of today's Chungdu or Beijing can automatically read a Chinese text from two thousand years ago is far fetched at best. (If Dr. Perez--or Dr. Pinker--will pay for the flight to China and walk the streets with me, I will quickly demonstrate to them that most Chinese cannot read \\"very old\\" Chinese documents any better than most Americans can read \\"very old\\" English documents.)The idea that a writing system has magical power is carried forth in Ji-mei Chang's chapter (7) on Chinese. Starting from the well-documented fact that people from Singapore, Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan score very high on math, she makes the incredible leap that people who speak \\"alphabetic\\" languages don't do well as those who know a Chinese-based language (pp. 189-190). She's not solely to blame, since she got this notion from another writer. First, Korean and Japanese did not \\"come from\\" Chinese. True, they borrowed Chinese writing, but they also developed their own systems. The Japanese have a \\"syllabary\\" (syllables instead of letters), but the Koreans have an alphabet. Hungarian math scores are also high (see the TIMMS reports for 2007 and before), but Hungarians use an alphabet.Part of Chang's argument repeats the claim that English numbers are crazy, but if that's so, then we would expect French and German students to score well below American students. After all, the French and German counting systems are even more bizarre--by Chinese standards. Conversely, why aren't Thai students tied for the top with Singapore? The Thai number system is as regular as the Chinese (and may have been adopted from the Chinese!). Moreover, Thai is written like Japanese, with a distinctive syllabary.In short, Chang's argument, which Perez seems to have bought into, is a kind of \\"reverse-Kaplan.\\" Kaplan's diagrams show English as \\"direct\\" and \\"straight,\\" while all other languages supposedly meander around. Here, Chinese is mathematically \\"direct\\" and \\"efficient,\\" while languages like English, French, German and so on are confusing. A \\"sociocultural context\\" would lead us to look at a few more factors than just language if we want to account for math (or any other) differences.Another shortcoming of this book is the writing, which seems odd for a book partly devoted to helping our students improve their writing. The prose here is often deadly, but this is a problem in much academic writing. It's not that it's filled with the jargon of the profession--carpentry and plumbing have their jargon, too. For me, the problem is that by trying to sound \\"scientific\\" many of the authors use confusing constructions. Look, passive sentences for chemistry and physics and computers are okay, but those fields deal with inanimate objects or mathematical principles. Education is about people, so the language should come alive. Only a couple of authors understand this, and only in parts of their essays. (See S. B. Heath's Ways with Words (1983) for a clear and direct argument in this field.)The problem of dense writing is compounded when the authors do not use standard English. A couple of articles have garbled sentences, there are some misspellings, and some paragraphs seem unconnected to what comes before or after. (In professional terms: there are problems with cohesion and coherence that affect/are affected by the word choices and sentence structures some authors use.)One solution is to beef up proofreading, but I've been told that publishers are skimping on proof readers. For the 3rd edition, I suggest that Perez get a couple of grad students from another department--history or biology, say--and have them go through the book and edit it for the experience. (They can put it on their resume/cv.)Because of the important of this book to the teaching profession, I have given it four stars. But starry-eyed novices should be skeptical of extravagant claims for the power of this or that language. The main point here is that we need to use all the language tools at our disposal to help meet our students' language needs. It's important to learn from them and to value their language/dialect.Another important related text is Dialects in Communities and Schools by Adger et al. And Heath's Ways with Words is a great read. Both were available on Amazon the last time I checked."},{"Title":"Sociocultural Contexts of Language and Literacy","review":"if it were not a required book for the college class i am taking i would never have bought or read this book."},{"Title":"Lucid Dreams in 30 Days, Second Edition: The Creative Sleep Program","review":"I really think a person needs to read a more in depth book on lucid dreaming before they buy this book. This book does touch on quite a few aspects of lucid dreaming in a condensed type of way, and even covers ones that aren't found in other books. This can be good for some people, and bad for others. It all depends on one's personality.I found it helpful, in that it gives you lessons that you need to complete. This feels like having someone standing over you, making sure you complete your homework. A good book for procrastinators!?For what you pay for it, and what you get out of it, I say its a buy."},{"Title":"Lucid Dreams in 30 Days, Second Edition: The Creative Sleep Program","review":"I have several points about this book. It certainly does work, although I have never finished the book being not dedicated or constant enough in my energy. It takes work, as it should, and some of the exercises aren't practical to say the least.The comment about the authors not being legitimate researchers, well, all I can say is the exercises are very effective if you can actually stick to them so legitimate or not, they've got something right.The main thing about lucid dreaming exercises that I think the book can't or doesn't help with, is that you don't get any spiritual guidance with it, and some dreams I have had have really made me wonder if thats something you need. There is a \\"realness\\" too it where I feel that I am navigating in foreign lands without a map. It depends how you view things, but for me it has called a lot into question.However, I think its an excellent book and with determination is definately effective."},{"Title":"Lucid Dreams in 30 Days, Second Edition: The Creative Sleep Program","review":"Well, I love this book. It really discusses with accuracy everything about lucid dreams, most of all, how to induce yourself to have one, how to remain in one for a long time, how to program what your dream is going to be like.

On average i'll get a lucid dream each week, one technique in this book that worked instantly for me was the abililty to recall dreams by keeping a dream journal by your bedside.If your looking to have lucid dreams fast I recommend this practical book, it does not bog you down in theory and has day by day exercises for you to follow. This book worked very well for me and I did'nt even finish it! I remember having my first lucid dream and it was one of the most amazing experiences I have ever had.I remember reading that you should rub your hands together in a dream.

There was also a little hula doll dancing and talking to me.The water glowed in the sun just the way I saw it.

I will avoid such tactics and go for an honest assessment. This inexpensive and well written little volume successfully makes a complicated subject easily understandable to the general public. The authors are clear that it is a handbook of practical exercises and not a book of theories of anecdotes, and openly credit and refer readers to other authors for that side of the subject. For readers who want to get right into the practice rather than theory, this book is highly recommended. The exercises are based on modern research and methods proven and tested throughout human history, dating back to the ancient Greeks and Egyptians. These are the same techniques used by LaBerge and others, but Harary and Weintraub are careful to note the historical context. Another difference I find between this book and others is that the authors encourage a balanced approach, and do not urge people to try too heavily to control their dreams, at the risk of unknown complications. They are also careful to let readers discover their own experiences, instead of giving so many anecdotes that you cannot tell the difference between your original thoughts and the power of suggestion. They also do not try to sell or promote expensive hardware, which can induce seizures even in some healthy people, to induce lucid dreams. This distinguishes them from others, who have turned lucid dreaming into a minor cottage industry. The fact that they have managed to craft such a well researched program and present it so effectively in this inexpensive little volume is an impressive accomplishment, which helps to explain why this book is becoming a classic in the field. This is a great introduction to the subjection and may be the only guide most people need to explore the personal experience of lucid dreaming."},{"Title":"Lucid Dreams in 30 Days, Second Edition: The Creative Sleep Program","review":"As an experienced Oneironaut and somebody who is very educated on the subject, I don't really like this book. I got this back when I was starting out with lucid dreaming and had been for about 6 months. This book was very demanding and the tasks it was saying to do could not always be done in one day. It pretty much expects you to lucid dream within about 10 days, which is incredibly unrealistic.I really do not like this book. To me, it sounds like the person wasn't that educated on the subject. Please, don't waste your money on this. It really does not include a lot of information and the title makes it very misleading.Definitely go by Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming by Stephen La Berge.

By the way I bought this in the hopes of improving my musicianship for anyone out there who thinks of doing the same but it should help in any cerebral skill."},{"Title":"Lucid Dreams in 30 Days, Second Edition: The Creative Sleep Program","review":"This is a short but interesting book. Lucid dreams are dreams where you become aware that you are dreaming and can therefore decide how the dream is going to progress. For most of us this is a fairly improbable scenario as even the most bizarre of dream sequences do not necessarily prompt awareness of dreaming. Therefore the starting point is to take more interest in our dreams, to try to recall what our dreams have been when we wake up and to keep a dream diary. This actually does work in that if you get into a routine of trying to remember what you have been dreaming about when you awake, then you become much better at this quite quickly.The book is written on a Day 1, Day 2 etc basis with specific exercises to perform each night as part of your dreaming. On the earlier days this tends to be along the lines of influencing what you are going to dream about in various ways, but towards the end there are more advanced exercises such as using your dreams for healing, weight loss, out of body experiences etc.We all spend a lot of our time sleeping and everyone dreams, so it seems to me that it is worthwhile experimenting a little and this book is a good starting point."},{"Title":"Lucid Dreams in 30 Days, Second Edition: The Creative Sleep Program","review":"This book is very easy to read and very easy to follow.

Anyone looking for a reliable step-by-step guide to lucid dreaming will be much better served by Laberge and Rheingold's EXPLORING THE WORLD OF LUCID DREAMING, less expensive and much more extensive (335 vs. 128 pages), it presents both new and traditional methods of lucid dream induction, an original and scientific theory of dreaming, as well as a sweeping review of the possible applications of lucid dreaming richly illustrated with anecdotes from scores of creative dreamers.

For those who believe in Doing Something with that &quot;lost&quot; third of their lives."},{"Title":"Lucid Dreams in 30 Days, Second Edition: The Creative Sleep Program","review":"This book is excellent! It gives you a lot of practical, detailed exercises, and it works! I was quite skeptical at the beginning, because I used to see (or remember) dreams extremely rarely, once a year (!) maybe, and overcoming the first barrier - remembering my dream - I thought was my biggest challenge. I decided to try just for fun, and I was amazed that I could remember my dreams four nights in a row - something that has never happened before. Several weeks later I saw my first lucid dream (that is the dream where you realize that you're dreaming), and it was truly amazing and FUN! I'm sure I could have progressed much quicker, but I wasn't consistent in my practice.This book is very fun, easy and interesting to read, it explains in detail how to reach lucid dreaming stage, and it also gives a lot of advice on how to use your dreams for self-discovery and self-development (like exploring your subconscious or finding a teacher in your dream). I was never interested in this subject and started reading this book accidentally (recommended by a friend). After reading this book, I got so interested in this topic, that I started reading other books, like Laberge, Garfield etc. Laberge is excellent as well. But he gives a lot of theory (what is dream, how it works, history of dream research, modern lab research etc.) and some exercises (not particularly structured and not given in the order of difficulty), while in this book by Weintroub and Harary the main focus is exercises, and how to experience for YOURSELF, it's very structured, step by step approach (exercises for day 1, day 2 etc. - exactly what's needed for a beginner, who wants to EXPERIENCE, not just READ ABOUT). If you're a serious researcher, I recommend you read both, Laberge (better on theory) and this one (better on practice). Good luck!P.S. I've read one comment here about Astral travel, and how it was all silly, and shouldn't have been mentioned in the book etc.. Well, maybe for people who just start exploring dreaming, it really is too early to talk about astral travel (W &amp; H do talk about it briefly at the very end of their book), but I wouldn't recommend jumping into conclusions before trying, practising, experiencing first.

Comparing a practical little handbook like this one to a book about research and theory is like comparing a field guide to bird watching to a big academic book on ornithology. I have done most of the exercises and they really work! They are also lots of fun. Plus the book makes reference to the fact that the exercises are based on techniques that date back thousands of years in addition to current research. What is curious to me is how some other experts don't always reference the fact that their original methods are not very original after all. You would think that human beings didn't know how to have lucid dreams or even how to just plain dream until they came along! In contrast I respect the fact that the authors of this book don't try to knock other scientists and other books to promote their own. They just tell it like it is and recommend other books and authors for those who want to study other sides of the subject. This is also my first choice book if you want to get right into lucid dreaming because it doesn't try to tell you what kinds of dreams you should have but just helps you open up to your own experiences."},{"Title":"Lucid Dreams in 30 Days, Second Edition: The Creative Sleep Program","review":"OK the tittle is true.

The exercises presented by Harary and Weintraub are based on thousands of years of human exploration of this fascinating subject, including Harary's own considerable work on altered states. Harary and Weintraub are careful to present accurate facts and references, including references to Laberge, to whom they are very kind. They do not take credit for the work of others, nor do they try to sell accessories or classes. Nevertheless, it appears that some of Laberge&#65533;s followers are very threatened by this unpretentious and enjoyable little book, which does not present itself as an academic text. Its stated purpose is to provide natural, step-by-step exercises for safely exploring the lucid dream state, and it does this very well. Harary, a veteran researcher and longtime contributor to OMNI Magazine, and Weintraub, an editor of OMNI for most of its long life, are both talented writers. Like their other books, this one is a pleasure to read. They are careful to present accurate facts and references, and while they never demean the implications of the lucid dream state, they also don&#65533;t try to interpret the experience for their readers.

I have been interested in altered states of consciousness for as long as I can remember, and have read many books and attended many lectures and workshops on various altered states. I began doing the exercises in this book not long after it was published, and I have also done Harary and Weintraub's \\"free flight program\\" for out of body experiences.The exercises in this book helped me to induce the lucid dream state, and I recommend it whenever someone asks me about lucid dreams. So when a friend who is interested in dreams told me that her new year's resolution was to begin a dream journal, I suggested that she buy this book. She looked it up on Amazon and brought my attention the two most recent reviews, which are negative, and which I feel compelled to address:First, there is an understandable misunderstanding about the meaning of \\"in 30 Days\\" in the titles of the books in this series. Each of the books contains 30 exercises, to be done one per day, at whatever pace the reader chooses. As I recall, the authors state this in the beginning of each book.I don't remember the instructions to wear layers of garish costume jewelry to a company picnic, etc., but I do know for certain that a very important part of inducing the lucid dream state - and the out of body state - is surprising your consciousness and subconscious. I don't know why, but experiencing and perceiving in ways that are completely different from what you are used to can trigger these types of experiences.Finally, I find it strange that the last two reviews (and some others in the more distant past) trash this book so vehemently and then so glowingly refer readers to LaBerge's Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming. It seems like someone has an agenda here - either for Dr. LaBerge or against Dr. Harary and Ms. Weintraub - which is silly. And by saying this, I do not mean to disparage Dr. LaBerge's work; it is just very different from Dr. Harary's and Ms. Weintraub's, mainly in that Dr. LaBerge offers a lot of technical information and encourages the use of devices to induce the lucid dream state. While Dr. Harary and Ms. Weintraub's book is also based on scientific research, as well as historical research, it is much easier for the lay public to understand, and the exercises can be done without having to purchase special devices. Maybe some people feel more comfortable having special accessories, but I think that just adds unnecessary complications and expense, and find Harary and Weintraub's approach more empowering. They aren't trying to gather a following and the methods they describe - many dating back to ancient times - are fun and easy ... and they work."},{"Title":"Lucid Dreams in 30 Days, Second Edition: The Creative Sleep Program","review":"Discerning readers will be able to tell when any comments are placed to promote another author by disparaging an excellent book.

This distinguishes them from others, who have turned lucid dreaming into a minor cottage industry. The fact that they have managed to craft such a well researched program and present it so effectively in this inexpensive little volume is an impressive accomplishment, which helps to explain why this book is becoming a classic in the field. This is a great introduction to the subject and may be the only guide most people need to explore the personal experience of lucid dreaming."},{"Title":"Lucid Dreams in 30 Days, Second Edition: The Creative Sleep Program","review":"For one I don't ussually give online blog reviews, especially book reviews. However, I have become extremely intrigued and obssessed with lucid dreams. This book is the prequel to my obsession. After I had my first lucid dream by accident, which by coincidence is actually the strongest lucid dream I ever had to date, I decided I needed to look into this. When researching online this 30 day program is ONE of the things I saw first, and non-coincedently caught my eye the most.What it comes down to is that this book makes it appear, by the title, that lucid dreaming can be obtained on a set schedule. If you were hoping that this is the case I am sorry becuase it doesn't work like that. Ever since my experience I have been trying to train myself to become lucid in my dreams upon command. I have been trying for about six months. At this point I have about two (remembered) lucid dreams a week (which is below my desired).Since the book, that you are reading a review about, was my first read on lucid dreams, apparantly it doesn't work like it says.After failing this books program, at about 6 days in, I gave up. I didn't even think about lucid dreaming anymore, but, then:), I had another natural occurance. So I became obssessed, read everything that interest me on the internet about lucid dreams, which came out to about 90 pages of print outs (only meant to be impressive to a begginer or novice oneironaut:) ). Upon my research I found much information about such a unique science.The most interesting thing I found is that lucid dreaming is uncharted. There are very few people involved in the exploration of awake dreams, but, ironicaly, is obtainable by 99.9 percent of the population. The percentage meaning the only people that can't lucid dream are the people that can't completely understand what a dream is, or can't even remember their dreams (but you can even enhance your dream recall).When researching I learned so much, and plan to learn much more. However, if you want a book that will give you a core of the information you need to know, read the standard, \\"Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming,\\" by Stephen Laberge.Even though I shoot this 30 day program down it doesn't mean I don't think you should get it. I think \\"Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming\\" only gives you a generalization of all the common lucid dreaming knowledge. One should go beyond that, because the \\"already established\\" science of lucid dreaming is actually muy pequeno:)My blabber must come to an end, so, in conclusion, \\"Lucid Dreams in 30 Days : The Creative Sleep Program\\" is a gimmick. There is no way to know how long it will take you to achieve your lucid goals, but you can achieve them. \\"Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming,\\" by Stephen Laberge, is probably the best start, but is definetly not the entirity in the lucid dreaming world. To credit this book it has taught me many lucid dreaming techniques that I have never read anywhere else, including online."},{"Title":"Rootabaga stories","review":"Excellent book.

So yes, it is hadbound, but it is not an authetic printing of the original."},{"Title":"Rootabaga stories","review":"Carl Sandburg's *Rootabaga Stories* (once collected in a rather hefty volume, now available serially as they were originally released) are well-enough known that many may find it puzzling that these stories -- which seemed so wonderful to them as children -- are not more widely read and spoken of. I certainly do: but I wonder if the salient quality of the *Rootabagas*, the \\"vividness\\" emphasized by Maud and Miska Petersham's clean-line expressionist illustrations, make them something of the juvenile counterpart to Sandburg's multi-volume biography of Lincoln (a memento of an American past not fondly remembered by many). In other words, we might perhaps conjecture (quietly if necessary) that these stories were intended to 'equilibrate' children in an industrialized present, something like Walter Benjamin's cinema, and that the flavor of the monumental (which intimated to the post-war reader that they were in the presence of greatness) may not be to the taste of those not prepared to shoulder the burden of social control. But for those of us with sympathy for Robert Capa and suchlike, it is pleasing that we have a new \\"friend\\" in Libros Viajeros, who are making this book available as the imposing lump it ought to be; and perhaps it is still the case, even in this era of shorter school hours and an unfriendlier public sphere, that every child ought to have a hardback book. If so, this would not be the worst one."},{"Title":"Rootabaga stories","review":"Carl Sandburg, winner of Pulitzer Prizes both for his biography of Abraham Lincoln and for his COMPLETE POEMS, explores another genre in ROOTABAGA STORIES, fairy tales that he wrote for his daughters. When asked how he wrote the stories, Sandburg replied, &quot;The children asked questions, and I answered them.&quot;The ROOTABAGA STORIES are unconventional in almost every way. Unlike traditional fairy tales, they have no perfect princesses and evil witches. They are American fairy tales with a rural flavor and, in fact, they have no evil characters. The settings, though fanciful, include images that defined America in the 1920s, when the stories were published: the railroad, which &quot;ran across the prairie, to the mountains, to the sea,&quot; and the skyscraper.In Rootabaga Country the railroad tracks go from straight to zigzag, the pigs wear bibs (some checked, some striped, some polka-dotted), and the biggest city is the Village of Liver-and-Onions. Characters in this fanciful world are equally peculiar: Please Gimme, Blixie Blimber, Eeta Peeca Pie, and dozens of others. Children and literary critics alike would be hard-pressed to explain (even symbolically) the events that occur in the stories. Nevertheless, meaning comes through and truth is revealed. For example, in &quot;Three Boys with Jugs of Molasses and Secret Ambitions,&quot; ambition is defined as &quot;a little creeper that creeps and creeps in your heart night and day, singing a little song, 'Come and find me, come and find me.'&quot; Who would expect that &quot;The Two Skyscrapers Who Decided to Have a Child&quot; would have an absolutely poignant ending?Although the events of the stories may not be explainable, the stories are replete with concrete images. Sandburg provides both visual and auditory description with musical, repetitious phrases and novel juxtaposition of words (&quot;a daughter who is a dancing shaft of light on the ax handles of morning&quot;). Occasionally he invents words, such as &quot;pfisty-pfoost,&quot; the sound of the train's steam engine, and &quot;bickerjiggers,&quot; the buttons on an accordion.ROOTABAGA STORIES are wonderful for reading aloud. They provide an opportunity for readers and listeners to delight in language and revel in truths revealed in a fanciful world."},{"Title":"Rootabaga stories","review":"Sometimes it is late and you want to read your child something short so you naturally will reach for this book - where most of the stories are 4 pages or less and they are not really connected - the problem is: you can seldom stop at one and if you are not careful you will read the whole book! My 10 year old is just as mesmerized by Sandberg's words as my 8 year old was 2 years ago, mostly because Sandberg's choice of words and fantastic plots and settings are continually unexpected and surprising. I'm mesmerized too, but I won't reveal my age."},{"Title":"Rootabaga stories","review":"I wish I could give this book 10 stars...what can you say about an author that gives his characters such wacky and fitting names? The &quot;Potato Face Blind Man,&quot; &quot;Bozo the Button Blaster,&quot; &quot;Ragbag Mammy,&quot; and &quot;Spink and Skabootch&quot; leave their marks on your memory as perfect children's fairy tale characters. The imagery in this book is unbelievable and I have to believe that this is the prose equivalent of e.e. cummings poetry because Carl Sandburg enables you to see the fantastic worlds he has created almost as if you had created them yourself. If you can get your hands on a copy of &quot;More Rootabagas,&quot; which is out-of-print, buy it, if only for the two stories, &quot;A Girl Named Silver Pitchers Tells a Story About Egypt, Jesse James, and Spanish Onions,&quot; and &quot;The Story of Peter Potato Blossom Wishes and How She Went Down into Rootabaga Country and Came Back with Five Sky Blue Whispering Cats.&quot; I can't think of any more lyrical and imaginative writings for children than the words you will find in these, or any of the Rootabaga Stories."},{"Title":"Rootabaga stories","review":"A refreshing book of fantasy and rhymes, 'Rootabaga Stories' is sure to please.

I should know, because unfortunately, that is what I did last October.At a get-acquainted meeting prior to the trip, one of my fellow pilgrims announced that she had come upon the book at a local bookstore. Some people in the group then bought it, too, but I thought I'd save money by ordering it from the library.The library's copy was already on loan, so I left for the trip with plenty of secular guides to France, but not The Pilgrim's Guide. At times on the tour bus I read from other people's books, but that does not compare to having one's own book when visiting a sacred place. Our tour guides filled us in on generalities, but that was not to the detailed level that this book does. (Yet the reading is enjoyable as well as intensely informative.)Being on a tour, we did not need to know about accommodations or travel directions, but it was all there, along with very, very interesting commentary on the lives of each saint and what to see at each shrine. I can not begin to imagine how long it took the Heaters to compile all the data.Shortly after I returned home, I was able to take out the library's copy of The Pilgrim's France. I renewed it as many times as I could because it was a useful reference as I finished writing in my trip journal.Reading it was also distressing to me, however, because I realized things I'd missed that I wouldn't have missed if I'd had a copy of the book with me on the trip. Then and there I decided to buy both The Pilgrim's France and the Heaters' other book, The Pilgrim's Italy.I had a fantastic pilgrimage experience, but it could have been even more fantastic if I'd owned this book. Whether you are an actual pilgrim or an arm-chair pilgrim, I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's France: A Travel Guide to the Saints","review":"James and Collen Heater have written a wonderful series of travel books for those of us seeking a more spiritual journey - or a spiritual quest of sorts.

This book presents the lives of the saints in such a dynamic way that you are drawn in and before you know it, you cannot put the book down. It is packed full of helpful and practical information on each area of France, and cities of pilgrimage, as well as how to make the most of your stay. I found the extensive resources on learning more about the saints and places mentioned in the book a wonderful addition.

On the contrary, &quot;The Theory of the Leisure Class&quot; is stylishly written, endlessly startling (for example, Veblen analyses religion as an outgrowth of the gambling instinct), and very, very funny. Its expose of &quot;conspicuous consumption&quot; (yes, Veblen was the one who invented this famous concept) is as relevant today as it was in 1899, if not more so. Whether or not you agree with all that he says, it's thought-provoking and exciting stuff."},{"Title":"The Theory of the Leisure Class (Modern Library Classics)","review":"This opus by Veblen exposes the real meaning of the pecuniary advancement of the working and merchant classes, and the formation of elites based mostly upon money and asset valuation. The transfiguration of the traditional social and individual ethical values that this phenomenon produced, is portraited with clarity and sarcastic intelligence by the author in the book, first published in 1899.Now a classic of economic theory, as well as a text book of social science, it describes the tendencies of consumerism, leisure and the &quot;materialization&quot; of the ideals of the aspiring new princes (or noveau rich) of society. Veblen's vibrant satire of the tendency of the modern individual to believe that real accomplishment is all about aquiring a condition of ostentatious wealth and status, and his analisis of the inception of modern class structure in America, still stand, a century after, as recommended reading for historians and economists.If you are a fervent follower of advertisement, fashion, &quot;glamour&quot; and other modern expressions of consumerism , then you will find a surprisingly fresh portrait of yourself in this book. It worries me that the leisure class and its shallow views and values as described by Veblen, may still today represent elites in America and their religion, as analyzed by professor Lash in his last book &quot;The Revolt of the Elites&quot;. I highly recommend Veblen's best book, to scholars and sociologists at large."},{"Title":"The Theory of the Leisure Class (Modern Library Classics)","review":"Known by his contemporaries as the only social theorist to apply Darwin critically, in 1899 Thorstein Veblen published The Theory of the Leisure Class: A Economic Study of Institutions, which was to become the basis from which all further American leisure history and theory stemmed. In his study, Veblen is primarily concerned with the &quot;new rich,&quot; whom he regards as social parasites that retard the growth of modern life. Thorstein Veblen wrote The Theory of the Leisure Class from a perspective that was largely isolated from his own culture, which either aided in his understanding of the Leisure Class or perhaps negatively influenced his opinions due to his exclusion from it. In The Theory of the Leisure Class, Veblen essentially confines man and woman's existence on the planet as a struggle to change and adapt with the growth of their communities. Through this belief, Veblen develops a theme that amounts to the idea of a certain &quot;dominant&quot; type of individual. This individual develops a social structure through dominance in which social advance is sought by others. She/he will feel the discrepancy between the modern life and traditional life during the process. Though Veblen's rhetoric is sometimes anxious, sometimes negative, he actively pursues a specific account of the origins of the Leisure Class through individuals. The struggle for individual advancement eventually expands to include society, and the more individual struggle for advancement in society leads to the accumulation of surplus goods.Surplus of conspicuous consumption by the Leisure Class gives the class license to indulge shamefully in pure conspicuous consumption, where their occupations eventually become leisure itself. These &quot;professions&quot; of the Leisure Class by nature render it closed, and impenetrable by outsiders.Thorstein Veblen wrote the Leisure Class represented the new phenomena of conspicuous consumption compared to pre-Industrialized wealthy communities as well as contemporary working-class ones. But as intellectual inquiry into the topic of leisure has progressed over the past one hundred years, leisure has come to hold a number of definitions and meanings."},{"Title":"The Theory of the Leisure Class (Modern Library Classics)","review":"The basic premise of this book is that modern humans have inherited an instinct to compete with each other for material resources. This competition takes place within the context of a small groups that share the spoils of the competition amongst themselves. (Other primates essentially do the same thing). The theory hinges on the question of what happens when a group of people have access to essentially unlimited resources, but still have the competitive urge. Veblen's answer is that they simply compete amongst themselves to see who can afford to be the most wasteful (like the scene in that Woody Allen movie in which two guys start ripping up dollar bills to impress each other). He refers to such waste as \\"conspicuous consumption\\".According to Veblen, the urge to consume conspicuously explains a lot of human behavior, including fashion, sports, and religion. In all cases the consumer wants to demonstrate to his peers that he can't possibly be involved in doing anything useful. A particularly funny consequence of the urge to consume is the notion of \\"vicarious consumption,\\" in which really rich people acquire other people (essentially servants and wives) to do their consuming for them. To emphasize the point they dress up their vicarious consumers in preposterous outfits and require them to perform pointless tasks with high precision (think of a butler in a tuxedo serving a 12-course meal or some such).In this vein, anthropomorphic religions essentially worship the richest guy of all. God is imagined to be so rich that he sits on a throne all day while people in silly clothes (clergy) do nothing but tend to his fabulous mansions (churches). It's an intentionally funny image, although Veblen is careful to say that he's not poking fun at the spiritual aspects of religion, just the form in which modern humans choose to express them.An interesting subtheme is the alliance between the \\"leisure class\\" and the poor, something we see happening today in American politics. In Veblen's theory the alliance occurs because the two classes essentially share the same mindset (obsession with status).Overall the book is fun to read, except for the writing style, which is reminiscent of essays written by high school students who are studying for the SATs."},{"Title":"The Theory of the Leisure Class (Modern Library Classics)","review":"This may not be a book to read for recreation, unless you like 1890s verbal locutions, but there are other reasons to read it. The emergence of the economic analysis of Western society might intrigue you. You might discover the origins of such still useful terms as 'leisure class' and 'conspicuous consumption,' among others. You might be curious about author Thorstein Veblen's status-conscious, anachronistic world of working men and idle wives, which reflects upper-class society in his day. Published in 1899, this is a classic in sociology and economic literature, although it is a veritable dreadnought of density. It discusses property, ownership, status and leisure in a turn-of-the-last-century American context. Though scholars call it a 'satire,' the book is neither witty nor ironic. Instead, it is a stolid analytical daguerreotype of a world long gone. We suggest that if you tackle Veblen's old-fashioned, slow-flowing prose, you should do it for the background you may glean and the scholarly satisfaction you may feel when you are done. Instead of Alexander Pope's, 'What oft was thought but ne'er so well expressed,' this book presents what oft was said and usually better, but not as early."},{"Title":"The Theory of the Leisure Class (Modern Library Classics)","review":"This is one of the most thought provoking books I have read in a long time. Veblen leaves no stone unturned in his dissection of America's upper class and the unconscious traditions that lead them, and us.

Even though Veblen attempts to press the application of his thesis a bit too far, the thesis istself still has merit for the 21st century. His thesis, although not stated as such is biblically rooted in Ecclesiastes 4:4, \\"And I saw that all labor and all achievement springs from man's envy of his neighbor.\\" Interesting perspective on society... worth the read!"},{"Title":"The Theory of the Leisure Class (Modern Library Classics)","review":"Mr. Veblen is a refined person in the use of the words he uses to address and explain the economic habits of the refined people of the upper-class of the beginning of the last century. He spares no expenses in detailing in a very polite manner the idiossincracies of the noble and very rich when deciding what to buy, what to use and how to behave, going also to all lenghts explainning how these habits mold and form the habits of the not so rich and noble strata of the society. His theory of the leisure class reachs significance when compared to the rationality which some economists, classics and neo-classics, ascribe to the human being as an economic agent. I was quite surprised by the elegant style of Mr.Veblen and the fine irony (which he does not admit) with which he treats the rich and noble of his time. Sure, this is a book which could be also serve well times ahead and before Veblen's time."},{"Title":"The Theory of the Leisure Class (Modern Library Classics)","review":"I was extremely pleased with this book. It reduces the notion of society to a popularity contest in which fashion becomes the perfect expression of everyone's desire to be praised and noticed. As the American economy shifts from being a breadbasket to being the entertainment capital of a devil in blue jeans world, this book, from a much earlier historical period, shows how America always had the potential to achieve this kind of greatness. More than any other book, this one allows total enjoyment of the thoughts which it expresses. When a mind has been trained to blossom in this way, the greatest danger might be that it could be considered grandiose for daring to make such comments."},{"Title":"The Theory of the Leisure Class (Modern Library Classics)","review":"Boring sciences often require insightful, imaginative writers to make mainstream. So it was with Einstien and theoretical physics, and so it is with economics and Thorstein Veblen as described in this book. Mr. Veblen descended from Norwegian immigrants to the US, and lived in the Midwest from the late 1800s to early 1900s. With a keen eye and insightful mind, he took in the huge economic growth of the US and the beginnings of mass consumerism and corporate advertising in the American population. What he saw was the formation of a middle and upper class that had both idle time and money to spare. Together, this created a leisure class that defined respect, social standing, and self-worth in terms of \\"pecuniary emulation\\", i.e. spending money on stuff and entertainment just because one could. Like a zoologist examining wild animals, Veblen picks apart the rituals, clothing, speech, and consumption habits of this newly rich. All of this is recorded and explained in extraordinary and sometimes comical detail in this book. Upon publication, this book became the first great work of economics by an American author, and made Veblen famous. Along with the Great Gatsby, this book provides one of the best description of the American upper class at the beginning of the 20th century."},{"Title":"The Theory of the Leisure Class (Modern Library Classics)","review":"Excellent.

This product received is exactly as pictured. I am pleased. Will order again from these nice people."},{"Title":"The Theory of the Leisure Class (Modern Library Classics)","review":"I have no idea whatsoever of how true Veblen's analysis of American social reality was one - hundred years ago, or how true it is today. No doubt he did see ' social phenomenom' that were emerging and succeeded in finding the 'name ' for them. 'Leisure class' and ' conspicuous consumption' are part of the everyday vocabulary of the description and analysis of 'social life'. I know that Veblen was particularly hard upon the nouveau riche, those trying to prove by buying and having more that they were as good or better than ' old money'. However I wonder if in ' work ethic' America there is not also another kind of phenomenom, of people of great wealth feeling a special social obligation, as multibillionaires Gates and whether for good purposes or not, Ted Turner have displayed in recent years. I also have a problem with making the concept of ' leisure' an entirely pejorative one. What about those ' surpluses' at the state of the agricultural age which Lewis Mumford said were so key in creating civilization? Isn't it true that in many societies those who do not have to do productive work were freed for higher work of mind and spirit? I wonder then that is whether Veblen's condemnation of the 'leisure class ' is too ' blanket' a one in many ways. And this without denying the truths that great wealth often corrupts, leads to arrogance, and indolence, folly and waste. For years the conception of the US was of a society in which the middle class element was predominant, a society reflecting an equality of opportunity and the fact that the majority of people had been able to in time and through work raise themselves to a good level of life. The decline of the middle class in the sense of the growing gap between very rich and very poor is a fact of life in America. Perhaps this makes Veblen's analysis of a certain part of American society more pertinent. But again I think that there is a counter- tradition emerging in which many of the very wealthy assume that the way to real respect in the eyes of the public is in doing good for others."},{"Title":"The Theory of the Leisure Class (Modern Library Classics)","review":"Conspicuous consumption describes the phenomenon of buying a product or service not for its utility or necessity but because of its prestige factor or impressive social value. Mr. Veblen's book is described as a satire, pointing out the hypocrisy and shallowness of the leisure or wealthy class. I am only partly through this book but I am finding it very thought provoking.If Mr. Veblen thought that consumption had a negative conspicuousness, indicative of a hypocritical nature among the wealthy of his day, I can only imagine what he would think of our entire culture today. It seems to me in our present society we have taken conspicuous consumption, beyond the hypocritical and the satirical and into the realm of the obnoxious, the immoral and even the criminal. This really isn't an economics book, nor would I say that it is scientific or academic in nature.It is more the thoughtful extrapolation of an intelligent, thoughtful and educated individual. Thorstein Veblen is more academic than Mark Twain and not quite as humorous. But he is very entertaining and extremely thought provoking. His style is much like Galbraith's - wordy, circular and humor so subtle that if you are not paying attention you could easily miss it. I am enjoying this book.Richard Edward Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:\\"Hobo-ing America: A Workingman's Tour of the U.S.A..\\""},{"Title":"The Theory of the Leisure Class (Modern Library Classics)","review":"I have found it quite amusing to read Veblen's book is depicted as a classic by those who like it (you know, considering that he, more than once, states that the appeal of classics is due largely to the leisure class scheme). Perhaps the unique, brilliant, at times repetitive and dull, at times invariably amusing, and always surprising tone and ideas Veblen has made their indelible mark, but I think that perhaps he would have said that those who admire his book solely as a classic cannot properly understand its message.From his anthropological analysis of the rise of the predatory and peaceable instincts to his ridicule of contemporary (ca. 1900) institutions and customs (I think his theories on clothing apparel, sports, and religion stand out) to his very serious critique of waste and exploit, Veblen wrote an incredibly interesting, unconventional theory. Undoubtedly, to my apprehension, direct and vicarious conspicuous waste (the most famous variant being direct conspicuous consumption) is the most interesting concept presented in the book, yet this is exclusively associated with the rich and what they do. No doubt, the rich's excesses must have been what prompted Veblen to write the book in the first place, but I think the more universal message is overlooked. He repeats this over and over: the leisure class scheme of life pervades society.I do not know if those who appreciate the book see that Veblen makes the case that conspicuous waste is EVERYWHERE. Those who command the scheme are those who we might identify to be the rich, sure, but how can we deny we are not all part of it? Veblen says that \\"any consumer who might, Diogenes-like, insist on the elimination of all honorific or wasteful elements from his consumption, would be unable to supply his most trivial wants in the modern market.\\" To him, I am sure, stripes on a shirt would have seemed wasteful, and a regrettable vestige of some eccentric attempt at invidious pecuniary emulation. Veblen's notion of waste is constructed to be universal, but in varying gradations (which is why he identifies waste most prominently with the leisure class).All this being said, Veblen is quite far from being perfect. The book does consider that there are motives and actions that are not guided by the leisure class' predatory instinct, but is at times vague in dealing with such things. Moreover, some of his explanations are on occasion convoluted or simplified so as to make them fit his general framework. Notwithstanding, anyone who has any interest in reading a great theory about how the rich ultimately dictate many of society's customs and institutions by inciting the lesser instincts that make consumerism possible, or in being amused by a sardonic critique of how wasteful our society can be, should turn to this book.A word of caution: To make a point, Veblen uses a language that would be today considered tedious and cumbersome, perhaps needless and excessively verbose at times, so be ready to deal with that. (I think that, unless pointed out, the fact that it is inferable that Veblen does this to make a point might go unnoticed. At the end of the book he states that usage of proper, preferably archaic language is observed precisely because it is useful and not up to date; this language is preferred because they \\"argue waste of time and exemption from the use and the need of direct and forcible speech.\\" The way in which he writes his book is the last, perhaps most subtle, sardonic bit of satire he offers us.)"},{"Title":"The Theory of the Leisure Class (Modern Library Classics)","review":"Some of the most influential and important studies of America and American life have been authored by visitors from other lands. One such example is this political study of economic man, The Theory of the Leisure Class. Authored by Thorstein Veblen, an immigrant from Scandinavia who settled in the Eastern US, this book examines the behavior of the rich and wanna-be rich in the US at the end of the 19th century.Defining the growing upper class of Americans who owned land, dressed nicely, showered daily and read the latest gossip as the \\"leisure class\\", Veblen proceeds to dissect their behaviors and actions and its causes and effects. The author shows how much of this behavior had no practical economic benefit, but instead served to advertise social success instead. As such, this is one of the first major works to apply Darwinian thought to social evolution and human behavior. Terms such as conspicious consumption and consumerism would spring forth from this book and those that followed in its wake.The book itself is quite easy to read for an economics treatise. Few are the numbers, fewer are the equations. Instead the reader gets wit, sarcasm, and lots of dry humor as the author recounts episodes of rich people acting dumb in the name of showing of their wealth status. The book is good reading, and recommended for those studying history, economics, sociology, or any other social science."},{"Title":"The Theory of the Leisure Class (Modern Library Classics)","review":"This is a great classic book even if the writing style is a bit dense. This is a must read for anyone who wants to really understand why the 2008 banking meltdown happened. The book was written over 100 years ago and everything he talks about has just happened again. This book will give you the psychological and sociological understanding of why the wealthy act as they do and why the rest of the population suffers from their excesses over and over again. It will also give you good reasons for knowing why their intense desire to control all the resources must be actively managed if the middle class is to survive in any way shape or form in this country."},{"Title":"The Theory of the Leisure Class (Modern Library Classics)","review":"Just read this after years of thinking I knew what it was, based on college professors years ago telling me what they thought Veblen was about. Turns out the guy was from Wisconsin, not Sweden, and that he was a master satirist, not an economist or sociologist, and that he died in 1929 at the ripe old age of 72. He gets a special award for using the word &quot;honorific&quot; over and over, and another commendation for making breathtakingly sweeping generalizations about human history and social development, and about contemporary (circa early 1900s) industrial relationships with ZERO (!) reference to data, and a dismissal of any need for any empirical verification of his conclusions. The conclusions themselves loop around themselves like a biplane seriously out of control, and in the end this mainly entertains. And in the propwash, we get new terms that have joined the English language: Conspicuous consumption, conspicuous waste, canons of respectability, and even skiing terms like &quot;traverse&quot; which could also, in our &quot;post-predatory&quot; culture, be a legal term from common law pleading. I think Veblen was mainly having fun here, and am surprised that my professors of yore saw this as a serious critique of capitalism. I thought they were smarter than that."},{"Title":"The Theory of the Leisure Class (Modern Library Classics)","review":"I'd been to led to expect this book was an account of rather silly snobberies by the rich. And that it was exquisite in scholarship, writing style, and detail. Wrong.Thorstein Veblen - 1857-1929 - and I only checked these details after reading this book - was one of many children of Norwegian immigrants into the USA. They were, or may have been, ripped off, though his father seems to have made money afterwards - I'd guess via a gift of land from the US governement, though if so he seems to have been ungrateful. 'The Theory of the Leisure Class', published in 1899 when he was about 42, caused a stir - or at least that's the story. It precedes Ida Tarbell on Standard Oil by a couple of years.Veblen's writing style is agonisingly plodding, repetitive and dull. He includes a few Latin and other tags. This must have been a deliberate attempt to project an educated image. He took time to explain his use of some English terms (e.g. 'invidious'). Part of his effect is achieved by using words in slightly the wrong sense. He used 'evolution' rather than 'change' - it sounded more up to date. His typescript (or MS) must have been the sort publishers' readers dreaded. I can't quote a sample here for space reasons.----His model of human history is very simple indeed. There *WERE* two types of people and societies:[1] The sedentary village, low on force and fraud. He calls this 'quasi-peaceful'. There's a law of status. (pp 215 & 236). 'Savages' (undefined) have this sort of lifestyle.[2] Barbarians, who hate manual work, and prefer 'exploits'. They are ferocious, self-seeking, clannish, disingenuous. They like hunting. A predatory type. Veblen often calls them 'peace-distubing dolicho-blonds'. (He himself had very dark hair - remember Norway and Sweden separated at about this time.)---------However, *NOW* (about 1900) there is industry.[3] Veblen takes progress as given: 'as populations grow denser..', '.. stage of society..', '.. as the community advances in wealth and culture', are typical phrases. These days, the collective interests of modern industry work against the ferocious or selfish aristocrat type (p 227).4] There is a 'hierarchical gradation of reputability. Ownership on a large scale [is]... the most reputable of economic interests. [then] banking .. law.. the lawyer is exclusively occupied with the details of predatory fraud..' (p.231).-----------Veblen means by the 'Leisure Class' property and company owners, financiers, bankers, lawyers. In other words, anyone not concerned with direct manufacturing. Much of his book is concerned with the way they spend or waste money, and the way other people attempt to follow or imitate their behaviour.What is of value in Veblen?I have to say I was struck by the small number of piquant examples of oddities in spending and consumption; I'd expected more. Dogs as useless deferential mouths to feed; clean clothes uncontaimnated by evidence of work; William Morris's Kelmscott Press. Of men - walking stick, and powdered wig (from Alexander Pope?) On women, bodices, bound feet in China, and general feebleness, were signs of wealth in the husband. He has an odd passage about public parks - men keep the grass tidy, and this is an example of conspicuous consumption, because they are more expensive than cows.He doesn't seem to know about Chinese mandarins' fingernails, British sumptuary laws, rose gardens and knot gardens and huge country houses as statements of things which are attractive, but unnecessary. He doesn't know about follies, or for example the Hell Fire Club and the Parthenon, both of which in their ways offered employment. Moreover he doesn't seem to understand the economics: a US department store would not stock very cheap items - there's not enough money in them and will reduce other sales. They will cater preferentially for richer custiomers - and offer, say, sherry, wine, champagne, brandy and other glasses, just to make more money. Veblen's examples are a mostly natural outcome of normal economics. As further evidence, consider that, if Veblen was right, any conspicuous waste might happen: burning of notes, buying of things just to destroy them.As to the 'leisure class', Veblen, surprisingly, barely considers inherited wealth. New England had many sons and daughters waiting to inherit and the 'leisure class' would seem to fit them perfectly. But Veblen concentrates on other targets. Like Marx, he assumes factory owners just sit back and collect loot - he doesn't seem to realise such people *may* work extremely hard. Similarly, many younger sons of British wealthy families went off to die in various white man's grave parts of the world. For that matter, the 'wolfish earls' in 'Shakespeare' weren't exactly leisurely.Veblen comes across as a man who moved directly from a peasant society into a much more technologically advanced one. (This must be common now, with uncontrolled mass third world immigration into some modern societies.) It's not surprising such people gawp, and feel fear, and boost their egos with cautious contempt. But I don't think ultimately this book delivers very much."},{"Title":"The Theory of the Leisure Class (Modern Library Classics)","review":"Sad to say, the Dover durables of midcentury and beyond are gone (if not forgotten); but when this value-price line was introduced in the mid-'90s, this book in particular was very welcome. Herein (though not exclusively) we find Veblen supplying an alternative to Nietzsche, specifically *Beyond Good and Evil*. This is a book about morals, or the lack of them; but coming from a man who all-but-assaulted his estranged wife with &quot;notions&quot; one ought not to expect a rousing defense of bourgeois morality. Rather an unstinting defense of some other way of life (such as is provided in his impossibly rare *Instinct of Workmanship*) what we have here is a Grand-Guignol treatment of the &quot;life-lie&quot; Veblen calls conspicuous consumption, which just might happen to exclude Symbolist &quot;vitalism&quot; (and as to the provenance of the concept &quot;dolicho-blond&quot;, consult Veblen's essay on the American small town).

The book is not completely satisfying. It seems unnecessarily repetitious and wordy at times. It seems to promise a tale of psychological and moral triumph, but to fulfill that promise ambiguously. Nevertheless, it provides a penetrating analysis of what one might call paradigm collapse and the suffering of the individuals who experience it. Courage is the core virtue necessary to one's survival of such damage, but, as Charles Taylor, writing in The New York Review of Books, explains more lucidly than I can, this is a special kind of courage, the courage to hope for a future good that cannot yet be conceived. As our society, and indeed societies around the globe, are facing partial or complete collapses of the assumptions that frame the experiences of their members, these ideas will have an immediate personal significance to the reader who understands that the rules of the game are changing, and that he must change too, or perish."},{"Title":"Radical Hope: Ethics in the Face of Cultural Devastation","review":"Radical hope explores the question of how cultures, in this study the Crow Tribe, respond to the one situation that cultures are incapable of imagining, the demise of the core culture. The Crow were dependent of buffalo hunting and personal warriorship against their rivials the Sioux (Lakota) and Cheyenne. With the near extinction of the buffalo and the collapse of traditional life on the plains, Crow culture evolved to total irrelevancy overnight. This book focuses on the life of the last great Crow Chief Plenty Coups, who said that after the demise of the buffalo \\"nothing happened\\". This is the void that engulfed Crow culture in the last decades of the 19th century.Radical Hope is a detailed exploration of the ultimate chaos that can afflict cultures when they quickly collapse from external pressures. This book shows how insight and the use of traditional problem solving provided Crow leadership with a pathway to re-establishing themselves in this most challenging of circumstances.This book is highly recommended to those people fascinated with how culture institutions respond to crippling challenges and how hope can emerge in the bleakest of circumstances."},{"Title":"Radical Hope: Ethics in the Face of Cultural Devastation","review":"In a time when any and everything can be pulled out from under one due to devastating political and cultural de-evolution, a growing and decadent mass media driven delusion and the bulk of wealth being in the hands of a small percentage of soulless idiots, this book offers an \\"a way.\\"At time when one might be tempted, like many Native American tribes were, to lament the past and vainly attempt to bring it back through the sad but hopeful ritual of the Ghost Dance (instead we listen to the Oldies Radio while media encourages us to celebrate some anniversary of some event that had meaning rather than helping us give meaning to current events).It offers a vision of how a person, a culture and humanity itself can keep what is valuable and authentic from one's past and one's culture while navigating chaotic upheaval.It's about keeping one's humanity intact in dehumanizing times and both keeping and building a personal and cultural integrity that endures.So, if you have been a victim of mortgage lenders, student loan rip-offs, downsizing, corporate greed, credit card companies or the crisis in our lack of a health care system, this book lets you know that it just something you're going through.It helps you become active rather than passive in your emotional and philosophical response. So, instead of feeling like a sitting duck, you begin to feel like someone facing challenges and helping others do the same.Enduring and radical hope eventually trumps the temporal power of any oppressive junta in a way they cannot see coming.At the same time, it builds heart, soul and culture.This book has come at a good time."},{"Title":"Radical Hope: Ethics in the Face of Cultural Devastation","review":"\\"Radical Hope: Ethics in the Face of Cultural Devastation\\" by Jonathan Lear is the title of a book that brings together the history of the collapse of Crow Indian culture and established philosophical thoughts from works by Aristotle, Freud, and Plato. In this book, Lear has achieved a melding of philosophy and history that should be fascinating to both historians of Native American history as well as students of classical psychological philosophy. The main character appears to be Plenty Coups, who helped steer the transition of the Crows from their traditional lives to the new reality that the U.S. Government had brought forth in the 19th and 20th centuries. Plenty Coups' featured contributions, however, are not the details of U.S.-Crow negotiations but certain acts and statements that the author has deemed worthy of extrapolation. These key dreams and symbolic gestures are expanded upon by Lear with the adaptation of thoughts from Aristotle (on courage) and Freud (on dreams). For example, dreams are categorized in the following manner: no-account dreams, where one merely observes; wish dreams, where a wish is realized within the dream; property dreams, where one acquires properties, e.g. a horse, that comes true while one is awake; and medicine dreams, which \\"give powerful insight\\". Dreams experienced under a dreaming ritual are shared to the rest of the tribe, and a collective interpretation of the dream ensues. In this manner, dreams, such as the medicine dream that Plenty Coups had, were \\"used . . . to struggle with the intelligibility of events [e.g. loss of land to rival tribes and the U.S.] that lay at the horizon of their ability to understand.\\"Lear has demonstrated how classical philosophy and psychology can help us understand the tumultuous transition of a culture, yet at the same time he falls short of a masterpiece. While his title suggests a framework for having hope with an example so that the reader can become a living example of Lear's ideas, the actual text appears to not go much further beyond extrapolations of pivotal symbols. It is as if Lear is the child at the seashore that finds seashells of different sizes, but that child is not yet able to figure out that equally sized clamshells fit together on clams in the ocean; and that the clam has practical value as lunch.Lear does make an effort to generate some practicality, but it falls short. For example, he tried to compare radical hope and optimism, yet he does it in a manner that is convoluted into the text. How are hope and optimism similar, and how are they different? If Lear is willing to rehash decades-old thoughts of Freud and Aristotle as a well-timed review for understanding Crow history, it doesn't seem to be too much more work to have a chart or a table entitled \\"some ways that hope and optimism are different.\\" Such key tables would probably enlighten the reader in ways that greatly augment the organizing structure provided by Plenty Coups' key statements.While the selling point was \\"how to have hope, even if you're the leader of a culture under deterioration,\\" the actual take-home message is a referral to Freud and Aristotle. Are written works by Freud and Aristotle better than Lear's book in helping the reader understand cultural transition? That is open to debate. I had a bookstore clerk search the entire bookstore, yet there were no recently published books I had not yet read on the art of having hope at a societal level. Therefore, Lear's contribution to contemporary thought with this book is significant. He would do great good to his readership if he would only use some key tables and lists. I look forward to more works by the author on his efforts to apply abstract ideas to factual history and arrive at a framework that has practical value."},{"Title":"Radical Hope: Ethics in the Face of Cultural Devastation","review":"This is not a \\"review\\" so much as a note of appreciation for something the author accomplishes in this book which may not be immediately apparent. In pointing it out, I hope to inspire other readers to a similar appreciation.We speak of \\"sounding the depths\\" but rarely is this act accomplished with sustained attention to any given utterance. But this is a singular accomplishment of Jonathan Lear in this book. Focusing attention on the utterances of the last great chief of the Crow Indians, Plenty Coups--utterances that have their focal point in the dramatic and enigmatic statement that \\"the buffalo went away...after this nothing happened\\"--Lear sounds the depths of Plenty Coup's voice through interpretive questioning both within and beyond it's crumbling cultural context as well as from the perspectives gleaned through a wide range of thought-traditions. But all of this is done while sustaining respect for the particular person in his particular life circumstances. In this sounding, then, we have the rare opportunity to witness a deep listener listening...without getting lost in his listening.Of course, detractors might point out that the author's analysis is based on reading rather than listening. But I suggest the monastic practice of lectio divina --a practice of deep reading for the sake of recovering the voice, that is, a reading that is transformed into a listening--is a closer description of the kind of receptivity Lear is engaged in here.It is this respect for the primacy of the life that is lived beyond any interpretation that can be brought to bear upon it which is a hallmark of the primary traditions out of which Lear works--philosophical anthropology and psychoanalysis. What it yields, though, is no high-brow, esoteric document but, rather, a suspenseful circling down into deepening, yet suggestive interpretations of a decisive moment in one man's life and culture that is accessible to any intelligent lay reader (no graduate degree required). The engaged reader comes away with a thoughtful consideration of an exemplar of hope and courage from which one can draw lessons for one's own life and times."},{"Title":"Radical Hope: Ethics in the Face of Cultural Devastation","review":"The analysis in this book is a bit labored at times, but the overall effect is successful.

If you are of Italian heritage (or wish you were) and love to cook or eat (and what Italian doesn't), you will appreciate the many lessons offered in the art of Italian cuisine and the language of romance.

Eccentric characters with loving hearts, doing their best and often failing as we all do; and a love story that is not at all typical, which makes it all the more believable. I found I was rationing the pages towards the end - I didn't want to have to put it down and walk out the door forever.

Nearly everyone can tell you about his scandalous doings with native women, his marriage to an ultra-Catholic Englishwoman, and the latter's destruction of the author's private papers after his death.Ever since I read Fawn Brodie's excellent biography, THE DEVIL DRIVES, I have collected some 20 different Burton books and read most of them. If you make allowances for Burton's diabolical thoroughness (involved footnotes, appendices, foreign language quotes, tables, etc.) and his Victorian circumlocutions in dealing with taboo subjects, he is a truly wonderful read.Although FIRST FOOTSTEPS is not his most famous book, it is probably the best one to start with. The action is not only more focussed, but Burton did feel he needed quite so much of a scholarly carapace to report back to the scholarly organizations back in Britain. And it finishes up with a stirring postscript about an attack on Burton's camp by Somalis in which the author barely escaped with his life.Perhaps this is a book that Presidents Bush and Clinton should have read before committing U.S. troops to the region: Burton shows us that not much has changed in the region in 150 years. He was in constant danger, and survived only because his knowledge and guts were more than an a match for his enemies.This is an exciting book and deserves to be better known."},{"Title":"First footsteps in East Africa, or, An exploration of Harar (Classics of exploration)","review":"The reviews of some of Richard Burton's books, as well as those of other 19th century explorers, strike me as hilarious. It's as if people expect that these books to be written in a style that would make for some blockbuster Hollywood movie. This is the REAL DEAL people! Burton didn't write this or other books with the idea in mind of entertaining 20th century couch potatoes starved for action. Apparently people's attention spans get seriously taxed when detailed observations about a country's people and culture are brought into play. When in fact, what could be more important in a first hand account of previously unexplored (at least by Europeans) regions? If you want action at every turn and tailor made story lines then stick with Tom Clancy novels or some such. Maybe faketion turns some would be adventurers on, but not me. This book is a truly incredible account of a larger than life adventure!"},{"Title":"First footsteps in East Africa, or, An exploration of Harar (Classics of exploration)","review":"Richard Francis Burton is one of the great unknown figures in history. And what people do know unfortuantely are the scandals of his private life. This is an account of what should have been at the time an impossible trip. Burton should never have attempted it and the odds were against him surviving it.What you get in the book is an extraordinary document of travel into one of the blank areas on the map by a true renassanice man. Its a true adventure story about how far a man can go on a combination of intellect and raw courage. This book is Burton the adventurer and explorer at his best."},{"Title":"First footsteps in East Africa, or, An exploration of Harar (Classics of exploration)","review":"Perhaps it was my high expectations before starting, or Burton's unscrupulous and merciless exposition of topics dear to him, but while he seemed lost many times during his journey, he lost me every time he made some anecdotal observation on some obscure point, now lost in total oblivion, which is perhaps where Burton rescued it from in the 1850s. Perhaps he should have left it there.Perhaps this is too harsh. There were occasions leading to his visit to Harar, the forbidden city of Somali-land, where I indulged a hearty chuckle, but this only lasted long enough to bring me upright in my sleeping chair, formerly a reading chair. Not until he reached Harar did he seize my interest and full attention, yet as he was not permitted pen and paper while there, for 10 full days the description relies on his memory. In comparison to the journey there (the entire first volume, over 200 pages), he writes with exacting prose every time his wayfarers or guides resisted the mission, and every other sundry related to the journey.The descriptions of Harar, its culture, its people and Burton's condition are excellent, but unfortunately are too brief, almost marginal in a work that contends mainly with desert travels. I enjoyed hearing about the lions visiting camp, the difficulties on the route, and other jokes made against his guides, yet I thought I was about to absorb a more entertaining exposition on the forbidden city, rather than an exhausting diary of a mission that perpetuates in a cloud between the send-off and the return.Just to show that I paid attention, I noted with disapproval that Burton repeats twice the datum that &quot;red pepper&quot; is THE condiment of East Africa (I was satisfied on this particular the first time.) Prepare for a thick shell for a core subject Burton laid on too thinly."},{"Title":"Dimensions of Job","review":"****\\"The Book of Job appears to me unhistorical because it begins about a man quite unconnected with all history or even legend, with no genealogy, living in a country of which the Bible elsewhere has hardly anything to say.\\" -- C S Lewis, Surprised by JoyWhy do we suffer?Theodicy or Why do we suffer? is an ever asked question, again and again. \\"The question of the generation,'Why do we suffer what we suffer?' had from the beginning a religious character; \\"Why?\\" here is not a philosophic interrogative asking after nature of things, but a religious concern with the acting of God.\\" -- Martin BuberThe Mystery of Job:The book of Job is considered the most ancient of bible books, yet it holds a challenge for all Old Testaments theologians, from Von Rad to W. Brueggemann. Many suggestions and insinuations were given to his original identity or its literary form; a Greek mythology, an Egyptian wisdom, or a Jewish poetry. Its reputation, perhaps earned because of its obscure Hebrew, or its poetic rendering, making its translations harder to understand, perhaps because it's topic is too painful and the answers 'Theodicy oriented'. When feeling persecuted by men, or abandoned by God, many think, \\"It has been rightly said that behind the treatment of Job's fate in this discussion lie \\"very bitter experience of a supra individual kind.\\" When the sufferer complains, \\"He hath broken me down on every side, and I am gone\\" (Job 19:10), this seems no more a complaint of a single person.\\" Martin BuberMain issues in Job:Most scholars argue that Job is a poetic apology in vindication of the justice and goodness of Adonai, Lord of Hosts. Although these divine features are evident in the narrative, its main purpose may stay obscure. Job is blameless and upright from the beginning and, although embittered, nothing is able to move his faith. He declared, \\"If He would slay me, I should argue my cause to His face.\\" Job 13:15, NEB. Satan was allowed to test Job and was unsuccessful. Job didn't he was proving God's confidence in him. The integrity of Job is thus an indicator of the greater eternal truth of the integrity of Adonai Himself. Trials came to God's children through the ages, Satan's claims proven by the faithful to be always in vain, by the power to overcome through the grace of the Victorious Lord.God's theological Dialogue:Nottingham patristic, Dr. G. Bebawi who directed the Jewish project of U. of Cambridge, wrote Under this title, \\"Do God and Satan talk? This attitude finds in the poetical character of the book the best argument that like all poetry, some parts must be taken as a parable. We will miss the message of the book if we jump into the deep end of the literal studies. It is important to realize that the Book of Job is a narrative. That is, it is arranged as a chronological account of a series of events. It is a mixture of prose and poetry, as is the Pentateuch. It tells of the experiences of an exceptionally blameless and pious individual who was also a very wealthy and prosperous person, and how he was struck down as the result of an argument in heaven between God and a subordinate being, Satan, losing his wealth, his family, his health and his self-respect and social status.\\"Job in Talmud & Midrash:In Sefer Ha Aggadah, we read the following account: A certain sage who was sitting before Rabbi Samuel bar Nahmani said: Job never was and never existed - he is no more than a paradigm. Rabbi Samuel replied: To confound such as you, Scripture says, \\"There was a man in the land of Uz, Job was his name.\\" (Job 1:1). The sage retorted: If it is as you say, what of the verse \\"The poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and reared,\\" etc.(2 Sam. 12:3)? Did such a thing really happen? Was not the tale a paradigm? So, too, Job was a paradigm. Rabbi Samuel said: But if so, why are his name and the name of his land mentioned?' Jewish traditions, confirm that Job was not a Hebrew as we read. Resh Lakish said: Job [described in Scripture] never was and never existed. What did Resh Lakish mean by saying Job never was and never existed? He meant only that the unbelievable sufferings Job underwent according to Scripture [took place]. Why then were they set down about him? Because if they had come upon him, he would have not been able to withstand them. Rabbi Hanina said: Job was a Gentile. For, Rabbi Hiyya taught, the Holy One said: One righteous Gentile rose up for Me among the nations. So I gave him [extraordinary] reward [in this world] and let him go. Who was He? Job. (Babylonian Talmud)Christians on Job:\\"The early Fathers of the church considered Job a historical person. The Book of Job was written in poetry and in prose, which opened the book for much criticism as if poetry is not good enough for God and humanity to be a way of communication. The scene in heaven, where we see almost a kind of conference where God, the Angels and Satan are assembled (1:6; 2:1) has been debated as plainly an allegory.\\" Dr. G. Bebawi While J. Danielou, E. Renan, and H. Rowley elaborate on mystery, soul's cry, and intellectually spiritual solutions. Ehrenberg concentrates on the non compassionate theology of Job's companion Elihu! Ragaz gives an ultimate clue; God Himself is the answer. The message of the suffering servant prophetically revealed by Isaiah, was fulfilled in Jesus Christ the redeemer.(Isaiah 53:1:12)\\"Thus at every step in what is called, a little misleadingly, the evolution of a story, a man, all he is and all his attitudes, are involved. And no good work is done anywhere without aid from the Father of Lights. When a series of such retellings turns a creation story which at first had almost no religious or metaphysical significance into a story which achieves the idea of true Creation and of a transcendent Creator, then nothing will make me believe that some of the re-tellers, or some one of them, has not been guided by God.\\" C. S. Lewis, Surprised by Joy (pp. 110-11)The Dimensions of Job:With Sorjen Kierkegaard I expect you to read it very carefully. why? Because Professor Glatzer got with him a marvelous band of thinkers to try to unclue the mystery of Job and his calamity. Buber, Kaufmann and Baeck relate Job to Koholet, while God hides His face, as the psalmist cried again and again.Nahum Glatzer has orchestrated some of the most controversial commentaries on Job's themes and introduced the socio-ethical background for theodicy, based on Jewish, Christian, and Humanist view points. His elaborate introduction and first three chapters masterfully guide you into the Issue of theodicy. He came to his conclusion in the last two chapters, the mysterious ways of God, and Job as a lesson in faith."},{"Title":"Acts of the Anti-slavery Apostles","review":"This is an impressive volume in size and weight. It would look impressive on any bookshelf viewed by anyone who does not know its true worth. On a windy day you can use it to secure your blanket at the beach. The author Parker Pillsbury is mentioned often in histories of the abolition and anti-slavery movements. I am yet to discover why. On page 250 he explains the reason for this book. \\"This work is Acts of the Anti-Slavery Apostles, not history of the anti-slavery enterprise.\\" He explains people who have not lived through the period of the 1830's to 1860 can only learn of the heroism of these apostles through the \\"pictures\\" taken at the time and on the spot where these brave souls did their deeds. Very true. Unfortunately this is mostly the acts of one apostle and with his style of writing we soon tire of his recollections.Pillsbury, in many words, gives a cloudy picture of the part the church in general, all the Christian faiths together, played in promoting slavery or abolition. Reading a few pamphlets of 15 to 40 pages would do a much better job enlightening the uninitiated than lowing through these 503 pages. One enlightening fact comes to light. Pillsbury was made aware of a meeting to discuss the Christianity of church structure. He tells us in great detail of the moon being bright enough and the snow being of such quality that he and a friend were able to take a horse and sleigh to another friends house where they joined this good fellow and walked the rest of the way to the meeting. Oh, I forgot to say they left the horse and sleigh at the first stopping off place. The author did not forget this point. Are you bored yet? Now comes the juicy part. At this meeting, after intolerable prayer by some preacher, another rose and read a piece form a newspaper containing a study of Wm. Garrison's head by a phrenologist. I could cite many such interesting facts and apostolic acts, but why bother. If you have nothing else to do and no better way to invest your money, you can buy this book and read it for yourself.Many books that treat the relation between the church and slavery are terrible books because of their content. But for this reason they are interesting. This book is terrible because of its lack of content, its style is that of a want-to-be orator, and is therefore boring. If I knew how I'd change the rating from three stars to two. I hope this will keep others from wasting their money and time."},{"Title":"UNIX Filesystems: Evolution, Design, and Implementation (Veritas)","review":"This book is not a filesystem design or specification book. The explainations are high level overviews of the workings of various filesystems. It explains VFS and how the kernel abstracts various filesystems, what the basic design principles of each are and nothing more. The title of this book is somewhat misleading as it sounds like a book for programmers (reason I purchased it), but is more geared towards sysadmins.A better title would have been &quot;Filesystems Explained&quot; or something of the sort. I guess &quot;Design and Implementation&quot; sounded cool...."},{"Title":"UNIX Filesystems: Evolution, Design, and Implementation (Veritas)","review":"Finally, a book that describes all the major UNIX file systems!In an eloquent writing style, Steve Pate has put together the best book on file systems. It is the first book to describe the internals of one of the most important of the commercial file systems: the Veritas File System (VxFS).The book starts out with a concise history of UNIX and UNIX variants and some file system basics before diving into programming topics. The middle chapters discuss the UNIX/File System internals in a clear and easy to read manner. My favorite chapter was Chapter 9, a detailed look at VxFS! The later chapters describe kernel locking primitives used by file systems, pseudo file systems, and finally chapters 12 and 13 do a nice job covering file system backups and cluster /distributed file systems. As an added bonus, you actually get to design a file system for gnu/linux! Steve Pate does a creditable job showing what it takes to write a simple file system.No matter if you are a programmer, system administrator or IT professional, this book as something for you. No other book even comes close to the depth that \\"UNIX Filesystems\\" provides.The only negative points I had with \\"UNIX Filesystems\\" was that it was not printed in hardback form and the paper quality is poor. Shame on you, Wiley!"},{"Title":"UNIX Filesystems: Evolution, Design, and Implementation (Veritas)","review":"Let's face it: there's a dearth of books out there about filesystems. There are plenty of journals, but if you understand them, you wouldn't need a book like this. If you're trying to get your feet wet, you're often trying to learn more without knowing what to learn and where to find it.Steve Pate's &quot;UNIX Filesystems&quot; helps fill this void. It is *not* intended for beginners; a book like &quot;Linux Filesystems&quot; (Von Hagen) would be better choice for someone who wants to start from the ground up. Once you're up, that's when the value of Pate's book kicks in.Some have accused this book of being &quot;yet another wannabe Linux filler book&quot; -- this is simply not the case. For one thing, a Linux filler book is just a collection of man pages that have been casually rewritten into a barebones outline. They don't go in-depth -- they can't, because they really have nothing specific to say. &quot;UNIX Filesystems&quot; goes into great detail -- not as much as technical papers, granted, but then this book is easier to read than your average technical paper. As for it being a &quot;Linux&quot; book: a reading of the title and table of contents confirms that this book is about UNIX, a broader category of which Linux is a part.Pate covers three major filesystems: ext2/3 (the baseline for GNU/Linux systems for years now), UFS (baseline for BSD systems), and VxFS. That's a nice spread of material: two of the most popular open filesystems plus the proprietary filesystem found on many proprietary UNIXes. (Perhaps this will annoy some diehard Linux enthusiasts, but it shouldn't. Linus Torvalds knows more about the FreeBSD kernel than most give him credit for, so learning from the competition is hardly a bad thing. And as a Linux user with no animosity toward BSD users, I'm glad to see UFS get a chance in the spotlight.)If I had a gripe about this book, it's that it doesn't cover more filesystems. (I'd like to have seen Reiserfs, among others). However, this is a patently unfair criticism -- Pate didn't set out to write the filesystems Bible -- so just take this as my two cents.This book is definitely worth looking into if you know a little something about filesystems and are ready for more."},{"Title":"UNIX Filesystems: Evolution, Design, and Implementation (Veritas)","review":"As the author claims, this book supplements other UNIX internals books, because they lack a thorough discussion on filesystems. For example, for a long time I've been puzzled by the pseudo code for read(2) system call in Maurice Bach's book. An inode lock is taken even for read() (Design of the UNIX Operating System, p.97) That doesn't sound right. ufs_inode.h on Solaris implies that ufs uses rwlock (multi-reader/single-writer lock; forget the modern concurrent direct I/O for now). Jim Mauro's \\"Solaris Internals\\" talks about rwlocks and filesystems in separate chapters but not in the same context. Here Steve's book tells us that filesystems didn't use rwlocks almost until the time SVR4 came out, and Bach's book was written before that. This is just one example of the mysteries Steve's book solved for me. I also like Steve's examples of using Solaris crash(1M). (I even collected them in a web page: rootshell.be/~yong321/computer/SolarisMdb.txt).Superb technical details aside, this book is also written in good pedagogical style. Hands-on exercises always help. (How many people have read Goodheart's \\"Magic Garden\\" book for longer than a week?) Some code examples, pseudo or real, also help. Steve's book has both. Lastly, it comes with a mini-filesystem. I didn't test it but I believe it would help CS students tremendously.Since the book is just much about Solaris as about Linux, I wish he talked more about Linux debugfs() and perhaps could use gdb to debug ext2 filesystems. I hope the new edition, if there is one, can give examples of Solaris mdb since crash is deprecated, and can expand the examples to include some new FSs, riserfs, Oracle's OCFS, etc. (Both have source code available to the public.) In chapters about cluster filesystems, the technical discussion seems to be less strong. There must be ways to debug these FSes just like using crash() and adb() to follow pointers in memory to debug UFS. It's just that cluster FSes are less understood and studied in this fashion."},{"Title":"UNIX Filesystems: Evolution, Design, and Implementation (Veritas)","review":"I bought this book right before the Christmas and planned to spend some time on it during the holidays.It turned out that I was completely absorbed in it, and spent days and nights on the book with my web-browser linked to a Linux kernel source code website. I simply couldn't stop it.Even though the general study of UNIX file system could have been a little more comprehensive than what is provided, that information could be easily found in other resources (I recommend \\" UNIX Internals: The New Frontiers by Uresh Vahalia\\"). However, this book does stand out by the way it compares different implementations of varieties of UNIX kernels (Sys-V series, Solaris, etc. ) Given the open source of old UNIX systems which could be found on ([...]), this book adds great values when you case study the file-system architecture.Another great perk you get from the book is the attached source code for a rather primitive but very instructive uxfs file system. By showing what interfaces a programmer needs to provide to Linux, the sample codes can be easily adapted to achieve your own goal smoothly and painlessly.In sum, this is a very impressive book and I'm still studying it. For anyone who's fascinated with file-system or any UNIX system-level topics, this will be a very good choice."},{"Title":"UNIX Filesystems: Evolution, Design, and Implementation (Veritas)","review":"I have to disagree with the &quot;wannabe Linux filler book&quot; another reviewer mentioned, it's a eye catching &quot;sound bite&quot; but in this instance it is not valid. The text is largely neutral with respect to specific flavours of platform and file system though obviously the author's experiences, source code availability and legal restrictions with respect to commercial products all play a part. Yes you can state that some reference texts are available from the Internet but the author has yet again made the subject accessible to a much larger audience through making the subject matter approachable in much the same way as he did with his book, &quot;UNIX Internals.&quot; The example file system is written for Linux but that is a reasonable choice as it maximises accessibility for the reader.The author obviously wants the reader to learn through experimentation and actively encourages this with a number of step by step examples that the reader can easily both repeat on their systems and use as a starting point for their own &quot;what if?&quot; experimentation on the subject matter.Perhaps including a little more information on other current filesystems would make a good book better as mentioned in another review, but only if it provided the author with a starting point for taking the reader through examples of another filesystem feature, or perhaps an opportunity to compare and contrast solutions to a given design issue.Including UNIX filesystem history was both interesting and helpful in as much as it provides a context through which the reader can understand why the introduction of features such as page cache, Sun's vnode layer etc were necessary or useful.In summary, I found the book an interesting read and I was not disappointed with my purchase."},{"Title":"UNIX Filesystems: Evolution, Design, and Implementation (Veritas)","review":"This isn't the first book I have read that covers Unix file systems. All the standard Unix implementation (e.g., Bach (SVR2), McKusick et al (BSD)) and OS design books (e.g, Tanenbaum (Minux)) have something to say about file system design. But this book is different, in that it provides a broad yet focused coverage of a large number of Unix based file systems, starting back with the AT&T; research edition as a foundation, and building upon the discussion with looks at Sun VFS, UFS, FFS, Minux, and Linux. The writing is detailed, and clear, and there is a good number of figures and code listings that help explain the concepts.The best thing about the book, however, is the source code for a Linux filesystem named uxfs. Reading the text and studying the source code (in the book, or via download) really helps make the topics discussed in the book clear. The author does a decent job of describing the uxfs source code, and shares some tips on how to approach compiling a kernel, and the filesystem source, and using gdb to set breakpoints so that one can investigate how the Linux kernel is calling into the filesystem through all the major entry points. Even if you don't give a hoot about filesystem design, its a great example of how to understand a complex system that you might not otherwise have a clue how to approach -- set breakpoints on the major entry points, look at the stack, and then read the code up the stack to see what is going on. Understanding uxfs is a great start to understanding more complicated filesystems in Linux for sure, and less directly, other Unix-based file systems as well.Along with uxfs the author provides a set of easy, and advanced exercises. The one that looks like the most fun to me is modifying uxfs to support an inode structure that uses direct, single indirect, double indirect, and triple indirect blocks (described in Maurice Bach's book and elsewhere).In summary, if your basic operating system book's coverage of Unix filesystems is not enough, or you want a gentle and complete introduction to designing a Linux filesystem, consider reading this book."},{"Title":"UNIX Filesystems: Evolution, Design, and Implementation (Veritas)","review":"This is a well-written overview of various Unix disk and network-based filesytems. It doesn't go into nearly the depth of, say, Vahalia, but it covers a great deal more, and in a more readable style. The diagrams and code snippets are usually well-chosen. I would agree with the reviewers who question the appropriateness of 'Implementation' in the title: there are better resources for that. But for this system administrator the book is very useful nonetheless."},{"Title":"UNIX Filesystems: Evolution, Design, and Implementation (Veritas)","review":"After reading the forward, I was under the impression that this book is targetting at non-kernel engineers. I thought that I had enough of a technical background on kernel concepts and the like to get a great deal out this book. I'm finishing up chapter 7 as I write this and so far I am disappointed.Maybe I don't have enough prior knowledge to be getting more out of the first half of this book. Base on what I've read so far, the title should be &quot;Unix filesystems: A background and quick overiew&quot;. Personally, I feel that a book on &quot;Unix Filesystems: Evolution, Design and Implementation&quot; should spend more than 35 pages (chap 5, 6) on the key kernel data-structures, and their respective interaction, that underpin unix filesytem internals (from the process table to file table to inodes to disk).This book provides a quick overview of the above, which in my opinion is inadequate. Maybe I'm just approaching this book in the wrong way.

It's really a manual on how to build up the skill of mental imagery brick by brick. It's quite extraordinary. This book has nothing to do with New Age nonsense (though Fezler raises some open-minded questions), but it really does feel a little bit like a manual for cabalistic magicians, in as much as it tells you exactly what to do to develop vivid pictures.

And his explanation of the basics of self hypnosis in chapter two is the best I've ever seen. However, I have reservations over his application, and some considerable concern over his interpretation of hypnotic experiences.No doubt some people will like the set protocol Fezler presents; it certainly brings to the fore the need for self-hypnosis to be a multi-sensory experience. But in my view, there is little room for the reader to become self-directive as is permitted in books like Dr Christian Godefroy's *Super Health* or Drs Alman and Lambrou's *Self Hypnosis* - both of which are less subjective and more pragmatic.My greatest concern is that Fezler arbitrarily interprets an experience of free-flow thinking on his part as a communication from the dead, but without the checks and balances that are vital. I do not contest the existence of psi phenomena, having had such experiences myself. But I do believe we must take care to differentiate between psychic experience and fantasy. At times, Fezler seems to unwittingly step over the line, and to encourage his clients to do the same.I can imagine he would be very different in a face-to-face consultation, but I still can only give his book 2 stars in comparison to others of its kind."},{"Title":"Creative Imagery","review":"I was very pleased with both the price and ship time.

Now, that's a travesty. If you have to read just one book about Watergate this book has no competitor. If you have to read just one book to show what good journalism can be, ditto. We say that journalism at best is &quot;a rough draft&quot; and we need to await &quot;the verdict of history.&quot; But Lukas put this together in a matter of months and after 30-odd years, it still stands unchallenged on the shelf.The fulcrum of this book is, of course, the &quot;third-rate burglary&quot; from which Watergate takes its name. But Lukas is far-sighted enough not to begin with that. He gives us the larger context of the early Nixon years: the internal wiretapping, the fund-raising money machine, the systematic campaign of dirty tricks against the 1972 Democratic campaign, both primary and general.Indeed, for me perhaps the true pivot point is not the burglary at all, but rather that moment in January, 1972, when Gordon Liddy launched &quot;a well-prepared thirty-minute 'show-and-tell'&quot; to introduced &quot;Project Gemstone&quot; -- intended as &quot;a vast intelligence-gathering and dirty-tricks campaign&quot; against the Democrats and (one would have to say) against the electoral process itself. Here it all is: electronic surveillance and wiretapping; breakins; kidnap squads; mugging squads; call girls; sabotage. John Dean says he found it &quot;mind-boggling.&quot; But Attorney General John Mitchell was more restrained: &quot;That's not quite what we had in mind,&quot; he said. And Jeb Magruder was more proactive: &quot;Cheer up, Gordon,&quot; he said, &quot;You just tone the plan down a little and we'll try again.&quot;For my money, that is the point at which any decent public servant would have stood up and shouted &quot;GET THIS GUY OUT OF HERE! Don't let him come within a dung-fork's distance of any public policy issue any time, anywhere, ever again.&quot; Of course we know better now: in fact, Liddy's campaign did go forward largely as he had planned it. And it was not a free-lance operation: rather, it was embedded at the very heart of the Nixon administration.From the introduction of Gemstone we move on moment by moment through the burglary, the coverup, the coverup of the coverup and finally, Nixon's resignation. By that point, almost any reader will concede that Lukas has documented his case. The denoument is the celebrated &quot;smoking gun&quot; -- the text of the tape of Nixon's conversation on June 23, 1972.&quot;What made the tape so damaging,&quot; says Lukas, &quot;was ... the plain, irrefutable language which showed that six days after the Watergate burglary the President of the United States knew a great deal about the break-in, realized that Liddy and [E. Howard] Hunt had been involved, recognized Mitchell's probable complicity, personally ordered a cover-up of the facts, and used the CIA and the FBI to protect his personal political interests.&quot;Watergate was a tragedy, of course, and any honest account is bound to make pretty sordid reading. But at the end, one can find uplift. For however many people behaved badly, quite a lot of people behaved well: famously Eliot Richardson, who resigned as Attorney General rather than fire Archibald Cox; perhaps more subtly Congressman Peter W. Rodino, Jr., who succeeded (at no small efort) in keeping the House hearings decent and honorable; more surprisingly Congressman Lawrence Hogan, conservative Republican from Maryland who upstaged some of his more liberal colleagues by declaring for impeachment (he was offended at what Nixon had done to the FBI). And I'd even save a kind word for Hugh W. Sloan, Jr., a campaign staffer who did, concededly, take part in some of the money-sloshing, but who in the end refused to go along with the coverup.Woodward and Bernstein have their place in Watergate history, if not nearly as great as their own (well--Woodward's) self-promotion would suggest. If they did not originate much in the way of real Watergate news, they did a great deal to keep the topic on the agenda. But their project also did a great deal of long-term harm, helping to facilitate the growth of a climate of &quot;client journalism&quot; where reporters get cozy with sources and manipulate the process as much as any active participant. Tony Lukas died far too young (and a suicide). As a monmument, he leaves a body of exemplary journalism, of which this is a capstone."},{"Title":"Nightmare: The underside of the Nixon years","review":"Nightmare, by J. Anthony LukasIn April 1973 J. Anthony Lukas was assigned to write an article on Watergate. This was followed by a second article; then a third. This book covers the whole story of Richard Nixon's abuse of his presidential powers. Chapter 1 starts with the 1970 election, which was not favorable to Nixon's hopes. He wanted a big victory in 1972. Attorney-General John Mitchell was a state and municipal bond lawyer who new about back-room deals. Protests in May 1971 Washington were met with Nixon's public disdain; privately he was worried (p.10). Nixon chose young men who had no independent judgment (p.8). Nixon felt threatened by the Establishment: \\"Wall Street, Cambridge, Georgetown\\" and others (p.13). A private security entity was created to investigate Nixon's enemies. [Was Nixon's problems due to an inferiority complex \\"lifelong sense of powerlessness\\" (p.18)?] Chapter 2 describes the insecurity of Nixon. The Huston Plan was killed by J. Edgar Hoover; but it seems to have gone forward (p.37). Sophisticated officials don't discuss secrets over a telephone, but in person in a private place (p.55). You never know who is listening to you.Nixon's 1972 campaign raised an unusually large amount of corporate money; often from companies that had problems in Washington (p.127). [Is creating problems for corporations a way for government to raise campaign contributions?] \\"Most contributions from the business community ... are made in response to pressure ...\\" (P.128). [The more business is regulated, the more money that can be extracted by the officials in Washington. \\"They all do it.\\"] Nixon also raised money from the wealthy who wanted to be appointed ambassadors (p.134). Page 142 shows how a company backs the twin-party system. There are no witnesses on a golf course. [Could Nixon's greediness have caused the Establishment to turn on him after the election?] Kevin Phillips' book noted that the lack of a Wallace candidacy would swell the 1972 Republican vote (p.147). Nixon tried to stop Wallace (pp.147-149), and failed. But something happened (p.150). The most famous dirty trick was on Ed Muskie (p.163). Bogus letters to newspapers and congressmen were used to create public support for Nixon, at least 50 a week (p.166). There is a report about Senator Thomas Eagleton's health (p.168). The next step was to stage break-ins (before Watergate).And so the book continues with so very many pages on the Nixon Presidency. The Note on Sources says there was a glut of information where the difficulty was finding the truth among self-serving and conflicting data. The 45 pages of index to the 569 pages of text make this a reference book on Nixon's Presidency. The Sources list the books, articles, interviews, documents, and remarks used for this book. This is a one-volume book of information this topic. Lukas watched what Nixon did, not what he said. Not much has changed since this 1975 book was published. Lukas' comment that W. Mark Felt, Jr. was believed to be the source called \\"Deep Throat\\" has been confirmed (p.273). [The pagination is from the hardcover edition.]"},{"Title":"Nightmare: The underside of the Nixon years","review":"During a recent current events/political conversation at a barbecue I was asked whether I had read this book. I am embarrassed to say I had never heard of it, which is odd - not the embarrassment - but my ignorance of this volume. Although not a Nixon or Watergate \\"expert\\" I have read many books on both the man and the scandal, yet somehow Nightmare slipped through the proverbial cracks. But better late than never, for this monumental work, at least in my humble opinion, is \\"the book\\" to read on Watergate - a statement I do not make lightly.First a note on the genesis of this book. Lukas was assigned the Watergate story as it was happening and two installments appeared in the Sunday New York Times magazine. As the author was preparing the third installment - and as Congress was weighing impeachment - Nixon resigned. The author completed the final installment, combined it with the first two, and published Nightmare in 1975. Sadly Lukas committed suicide in 1997 - and Nightmare was re-released in 1999.This is a big, dense, detailed book - yet still a page turner - even though we know the ending. The central act of Nightmare is of course the \\"third-rate burglary\\" of the Democratic National Headquarters in 1972 - and just the rehash of the incompetence and ineptitude of that little fiasco is well worth the read. Yet Lukas does not start there, but rather with Nixon's assuming office and the environment/psychology/plans and actions which led to the break-in, i.e. the release of The Pentagon Papers, the FBI wiretaps, the \\"dirty tricks\\" and Gemstone. The narrative then follows the cover-up, the investigations, trials, hearings and finally Nixon's resignation, i.e. the \\"whole story\\" and it's a complicated one.What separates this book from the others on this topic - the key to Nightmare - is its coherency. Lukas does an outstanding job in both documenting and tying together all the threads of the complicated web we now know as \\"Watergate\\" - by no means an easy task. A couple of examples for this reader include placing John Dean and his actions in the proper perspective/context as well as separating the multiple Watergate investigations.That Nightmare was written virtually as the events chronicled were happening is amazing. Add to that very few sources in the book are unnamed. And if you are concerned that this narrative may be dated - Lukas more or less names Mark Felt as \\"Deep-Throat\\".Truly an outstanding book - Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Nightmare: The underside of the Nixon years","review":"...make it this one.I first read J. Anthony Lukas' Nightmare: The Underside of the Nixon Years, a couple of decades ago. Though details faded as I aged, I retained the impression that it was just about the best book on Watergate I had come across. With my collection now inching towards a hundred volumes, I decided to revisit Lukas's tome and see how it actually stands up.This book from the two time Pulitzer Prize winning reporter and author grew out of articles which he wrote for the New York Times Magazine (two full issues consisted of only his writings on Watergate): plus a third that was commissioned but scotched when Nixon resigned the Presidency. Lukas sets the stage with the unsuccessful (for the Republicans) 1970 midterm elections and the state of civil unrest in Washington in 1971. Then he leads us into, and out of, Watergate.Lukas' comprehensive but not overwhelming look at his subject matter is well laid out, as evidenced by the chapter titles: Fear of Losing, State of Siege, Leaks and Traps, Plumbers, Dirty Money, Dirty Tricks, Break-in, Cover-up, Uncover, Houses in the Sun, Tapes, Agnew, Firestorm, Operation Candor, Impeachment and Resignation. Watergate was not simply a \`third rate burglary.' It was an event that grew out of the Nixon administration's increasing combativeness and declining respect for the law.Some books use Nixon's flawed character development to show how the operating culture of his White House evolved. And certainly, other Watergate volumes provide information and theories not included in this book. But Lukas takes a direct path approach, from point A to point B (or to Z) and it works. By the middle of Chapter 3 (Leaks and Taps, which is about the wiretapping of employees and enemies, both real and perceived), you recognize that the Nixon White House viewed governing as one hundred percent \\"us against everybody who is not with us\\" and that the end (getting our enemies) justified the means (whatever possibly or blatantly illegal methods we used). While this is serious stuff, there are some Keystone Kops type moments: such as discovering that the Secret Service (presumably at the direction of Bob Haldeman and John Erlichman) wire tapped the President's brother, Donald Nixon because he was a cause of embarrassment.But things got less amusing as the paranoia and arrogance of power grew. Egil \`Bud' Krogh Jr. (who did jail time related to the Plumbers' activities) is quoted in 1971 as saying, \\"Anyone who opposes us, we'll destroy. As a matter of fact, anyone who doesn't support us, we'll destroy.\\" As Lukas explores the Plumbers unit and campaign finance shenanigans (that's a soft word for unethical, illegal actions), it's clear that the Nixon Administration has lost both perspective and any kind of moral compass (you can argue Nixon lost that years before).Lukas' narrative leaves the reader wondering if things would have reached such critical proportions if Henry Kissinger hadn't convinced Nixon that the leaking of The Pentagon Papers by Daniel Ellsberg was devastating to national security; for Early on, Nixon realized that it was the prior administration of Lyndon Johnson which would look bad on Vietnam, not his. It is in the response to Ellsberg's actions that we see the seeds of Nixon's downfall sprout into towering trees. Though, as you dig deeper into the book, you realize Nixon's flawed personality was as fatal as Achilles' own heel.The President, the Attorney General, the White House Chief of Staff, special counsels, the Domestic Policy Advisor, staffers at all levels; all the president's men broke the law and/or acted unethically time and time again. It's shocking to read, decades later. Lukas paints a picture of all the president's men doing everything they could to make sure the truth of the Watergate break in did not come to light. And this was in large part due to all the other illicit and embarrassing activities that would be exposed to the light of day. And that includes his lack of ethics regarding his personal taxes and willingness to spend public money on his private properties.Richard Nixon had three priorities, from least to greatest: the American public, the presidency and himself. Nightmare paints a vivid picture of an administration that believed it could do anything it wanted, however it wanted. After his resignation, Nixon famously said, \\"Well, if the president does it, then it's not illegal.\\" That's a pretty good epithet for his presidency. Nixon did not have a disdain for the law: he had an utter contempt for it. And he was willing to betray his oath of office and sacrifice the office of the President for his own interests.If you buy into the misleading mantra, \\"it wasn't so much the crime, it was the cover-up,\\" you need to read this book. It was a staggering combination of both. Thirty-nine years after its first publication, Anthony Lukas' Nightmare remains perhaps the finest account of Watergate and the events surrounding it."},{"Title":"Nightmare: The underside of the Nixon years","review":"as well as being in better condition than I expected.

The story does contain a lot of violence but show you the clan lifestyle in depth, especially the &quot;true born&quot; (a gene milkshake of great warriors). This is the first Battletech book I read and I recomend it to anyone interested in, fantasy sci-fi type books"},{"Title":"Way of the Clans (Battletech)","review":"The Battletech Universe can seem a little complicated for those new to the series; there are so many books covering different historical eras and personalities, almost all of which are related in one way or another, that one hardly knows where to begin. You basically have to study Battletech history in order to fully understand each book's place in that history. I speak from personal experience here, as I'm still new to these books myself. I don't know if Way of the Clans is a good starting point in terms of the timeline, but it's certainly a good starting point in the sense that it draws the reader right into the world of Battletech with a fascinating story. Not only does Way of the Clans introduce you to the clan structure of the outer worlds of the Sphere, it takes you all the way through one young man's training to become a MechWarrior.Back in the twenty-eighth century, Aleksandr Kerensky took all of his supporters and established his own society outside the Inner Sphere; with the intention of one day returning and re-establishing the old government, Nicholas Kerensky began developing the most dangerous soldiers possible. The society is built almost solely upon the central importance of warfare, and it is the dream of every child to become a warrior. Some are bred for the task, and the highest honor a warrior can achieve is the acquisition of a Bloodname and inclusion in the genetic warrior pool. The trueborn are artificially created via genetic engineering from the bloodlines of the most accomplished warriors, and these youngsters are all raised and trained together from birth. Each sibko may only produce one or two warriors, however - only the very best succeed, while the others are killed or assigned to work among the lower castes. Freeborns, those born by natural means, also can earn warrior status, but their lower caste forbids them from fighting on the front lines.Aidan Pryde is a trueborn who wants desperately to earn warrior status in the Jade Falcon clan (which numbers among the mightiest of all the clans) to which he was born, but he is a little different from the other members of his genetic grouping, or sibko. We follow him all the way through the warrior training program, which culminates in the Trial that determines whether or not he will earn the right to lead a monstrous Battletech in battle. The way of the clans makes for an almost unendurable struggle to earn one's place among the warrior caste; here, the individual is stressed over the group mentality, and a true warrior is expected to do anything to reach his/her objectives. Alongside the story of Aidan's perilous journey into adulthood we get insightful journal entries from the camp commander enlightening us on the theory and practice of the mysterious ways of the clan. This coming of age story is bursting at the seams with action and remarkable insights into clan society, making it a truly compelling addition to the Battletech Universe. Those eager to learn what happens to Aidan Pryde following the rather remarkable events chronicled here are in luck, as this is just the first of three novels in the Legend of the Jade Phoenix Trilogy."},{"Title":"Way of the Clans (Battletech)","review":"This is a great book for veterans of the Battletech universe, or general sci-fi fans alike. The reader is introduced to a strange culture where genetic engineering is favored over natural birth, and where being a warrior is the pinnacle of existance.Unlike some Battletech novels, character interaction and development is not sacrificed for action. Aidan, Joanna, Horse, and Marthe have complex feelings and relationships that are deep enough to hold up over the sequels and other stories that they appear in. The book also is a good stand-alone read, although the whole Jade Phoenix series is reccomended. Definately one of the crown jewls of the Battletech novel series."},{"Title":"Way of the Clans (Battletech)","review":"This novel introduced me to Battletech. While I've never played the RPG, I've managed to continue collecting and reading all of the novels. This one, without a doubt, is an excellent novel. Introducing Aidan Pryde of Clan Jade Falcon, Battletech readers are introduced to the Way of the Clans. This first volume details how Clan warriors are bred and trained. We follow Aidan on his exploits through Clan space as he attempts to become a warrior for the Jade Falcons. Readers are also introduced to Marthe Pryde, who continues to play a role in the current Battletech storyline. This novel is an excellent bridge into the Battletech universe. Unfortunately, with Mechwarrior: Dark Age being released, this book is behind the times, but if you can find the Legend of the Jade Phoenix Trilogy, I thoroughly recommend it. See also Blood of Kerensky Trilogy for more about the Clans."},{"Title":"Way of the Clans (Battletech)","review":"I first came to Battletech by playing the Mechwarrior2 computer game. When I found out there were novels set in the Battletech Universe I figured this was a good place to start.What a story! Great mech action and human drama, with a nice lead to the next book(s). The characters were well developed, interesting and strong. You get a great feel of how a Clan warrior is created and what they have to go through to become warriors. It's pretty brutal stuff. I went out and purchased Bloodname and Falcon Guard right after I finished it just to make sure I had them on hand.A good book, and great place to begin the Battletech journey!db"},{"Title":"Way of the Clans (Battletech)","review":"This novel, and those of the Legend of the Jade Phoenix Trilogy, are important in the Battletech series simply because they're in universe and character looks at the quite different Clan society. It provided the first shot at seeing that, and remains quite important. Also, as a heads up, they are not written in the Clancyesqe technothriller style that come prevalent in later novels, but they give very much an science fiction epic feel that makes them very unique."},{"Title":"Way of the Clans (Battletech)","review":"Good Book - Good Story...Clan Jade Falcon is seen here with some rather interesting UnClan like happenings, but when thoroughly read 1-3 you will find that the entire series is very well worked out to the very end of the story of Aidan Pryde.Folks that do not know much about the Clans will get some insight into their world and the feelings of Clanners vs. Spheroids (Inner Sphere people); to include the Freeborn and Trueborn castes and intermingling that happens between these people. Very insightful. -Remember though the unclan like statement at the beginning - it will rise up again in the books.Good Reading to all..."},{"Title":"Way of the Clans (Battletech)","review":"I beleive that this book is the best intro to the the B-Tech universe.

However, if you have already read Journal of the Institute of Hacks, Tomfoolery, and Pranks, you'll find you've read most of this before, and in better detail, with better-reproduced photographs (in my opinion.) The good thing about Nightwork is that this is includes hacks from more recent years than the other book.For me, the time they spent on the new stuff wasn't nearly enough to justify buying a whole new book, but on its own and to someone who has never read its predecessor, it is an excellent and entertaining history."},{"Title":"Nightwork: A History of Hacks and Pranks at MIT","review":"I had a brief opportunity to read this book a while ago. There are plenty of stories about hacks that would make anyone go \\"why in the name of science these geeks wanted to do that?\\" And well, you are asking that about people that are pride of being considered geeks. But then again, with this book you will get acquainted with the all-time famous football game between Harvard and Yale where the winner was MIT (??), the 48 unit weight that \\"cracked\\" the dome and that the measure of the Harvard bridge is about 364.4 smoots + one earAnd for those of you lucky enough to have established contact with an MIT student/alum, ask them about the secret that lies within the Institute Historian T.

One of its lesser known areas of bleeding-edge innovation has been pranks and hacking. Well, Institute Historian T. F. Peterson is here to set that straight with Nightwork: A History of Hacks and Pranks at MIT.Long before the term 'hacking' was associated with computers (and pejoratively by the popular press), it was an MIT institution. MIT undergrads used the term to describe any activity that took their minds off studying and stress. In Nightwork, the best of the best of the history of MIT hacks is documented, photographed, and explained in great detail.Some of the best (and most visible) hacks at MIT involve The Great Dome. For instance, to celebrate the 2001 release of the movie The Lord of the Rings, MIT hackers made a gold ring around the dome with red Elvish script, &quot;authentically inscribed with Tolkien's text.&quot; In the same spirit in 1999, two days before the release of Star Wars: The Phantom Menace, the dome was made up to look like R2D2 (pictured below).Nightwork covers these more obvious hacks as well as the long history of pranks at MIT dating back to the 1940s: Interesting Hacks To Fascinate People. And lest the reader think this is all just mindless fun, a collection of explanitory and philosophical essays is also included.Even if you're not a hacker or a prankster yourself, hack your bookshelf with Nightwork."},{"Title":"Nightwork: A History of Hacks and Pranks at MIT","review":"Here is an informal romp through decades of MIT pranks.

The book was mailed to my house fast and in great condition."},{"Title":"What You Can Change and What You Can't","review":"Seligman focuses on what you can change and what you can't according to his \\"supposed\\" relevant and statistically correct studies. As a trained therapist, I was horrified as I read the book, but given he was sexually abused as a child and never received treatment for it (something he doesn't believe affects children, really) - it's not surprising. He has an unrealistic view of what affects a person and what doesn't and even belittles John Bradshaw and the entire inner child movement that helped a lot of people. Just take this one line, which I think sums up the falsehood of his entire theory and this book perfectly: \\"If you want to blame your parents for your own adult problems, you are entitled to blame the genes they gave you, but you are not entitled - by any facts I know - to blame the way they treated you. \\" Tell this to a child who was beaten everyday or sexually abused or whose parents fought every day or were alcoholics and caused chaos and instability in the child's household. Don't waste your money on this book, there are plenty of good psychology books out there. Anyone who has any self-respect should steer clear of this and all other books written by him. This is nothing but dribble written by someone who clearly could have used some therapy himself."},{"Title":"What You Can Change and What You Can't","review":"Seligman is the guy who electrocuted dogs without giving them a chance to find a strategy to avoid the shocks,then when they lapsed into a state equivalent to \\"depression, Seligman came up with the \\"original\\" insight that helplessness leads to despair. This sort of experimentation reminds me of those high I.Q., low emotional intelligence kids I grew up with who cut worms in half to see if they could survive. I don't rule out all psychological research, for example, the Milgram study on obedience did result in some pretty interesting findings about humans and authority,(of course today, his methods would be illegal) but Seligman's \\"insights\\" seem pretty lame and his methods were cruel as well. But of course, one needs to refute the null hypothesis, although his faith in \\"empirical research\\" is pretty naive to me. I participated in three double blind research trials for medication at \\"major\\" medical research centers. During the first, I figured out which group I was in five minutes after they administered the medicine; during the second one, the researcher forgot to give me a pre-test and had me take it after the six month study was over (saying, \\"try to think how you felt six months ago,\\" and for the third, the impartial researcher was so desperate for subjects he started screaming at me when I told him he wasn't interested.Even research findings raise a few questions. For example, he refutes Freud's view that depression is anger turned inward or that it results from childhood trauma and has largely replaced it with old fashioned trait theory--i.e., some people are more prone to depression and pessimism while he practically reifies (or is that deifies)the term \\"learned helplessness\\" as an explanatory principle for causing hopelessness and despair. Why one conceptual model refutes the other isn't quite clear to me particularly when you consider that a \\"bad childhood\\" would be caused by a lack of power and control in a dysfunctional environment, which to me sounds like learned helplessness anyway. Then, after he rambles on about how traits or genes are responsible for 40 to 50% of your mood, behavior, cognitive style, etc., he provides exercises on how to change them. Talk about having your cake and eating it too.Finally, I find it telling that Seligman researched life-insurance salespersons and discovered that those who were most persistent in the face of rejection make the most sales. Well, surprise, surprise! How about doing a study whether success among life insurance salespeople is correlated with their ability to create a sense of fear and helplessness in the perspective client to sell him or her insurance?Maybe a perspective on psychology without a grounding in moral philosophy is de rigeur but it scares the hell out of me.Now, I'm sure Dr. Seligman is a nice guy. He displays a nice, amiable smile on the jacket cover of the book. I guess he has good genes."},{"Title":"What You Can Change and What You Can't","review":"I bought the Kindle version of this book.

That is the power of persuasion. Do yourself a favor and DON\\"T order or read this book. Mine is going in the trash can. His theory of how our issues are the fault of our genes makes a nice little \\"blame it on the victim\\" story and people are eager to eat that up. Instead, it appears that the author is in need of some caring for himself. Maybe then will he be able to take off his dark glasses and realize what a false theory he has created. This book can only leave you down the wrong path. If you want to be happy - read some of Louise L. Haye's books or some books by Abraham Hicks.

If you're looking for help, you won't find it here. If you like outdated rhetoric, this is the book for you. For example, the author explains that one of the four cures \\"that work\\" for depression is electro-shock therapy. The last time I heard of someone actually receiving electro-shock therapy was forty years ago.In another section, the author spends several pages explaining that depression is more prevalent now than it was fifty years ago. Is there anyone on earth who doesn't know that?In short, please don't waste your money on this drivel! There's nothing new here, the author can't write a readable sentence, and the print is small and dark and smudgy. A difficult and useless read."},{"Title":"What You Can Change and What You Can't","review":"This is a book that everyone should own. In this book, Dr. Seligman wades through the swamp of self-help, psycho-babble,new-age gurus, common-sense ideas that &quot;everyone&quot; knows , medical thought, etc, etc in order to discover- WHAT REALLY WORKS. Not what we wish would work, not what seems like it should work, not what common wisdom believes works but what in clinical trials of real people has been demonstrated to work. What percentage has been helped, what are the side-effects and has this help been long-term or transitory. It is extremely readable, instructive and down to earth. He addresses the current state of treatment for: Anxiety, panic attacks, phobias, obsessions, depression, anger, post-traumatic stress, sex, dieting, alcohol. For most of these topics I learned more in his one chapter than in the several books which I have read on them. If you are on a diet, about to begin a diet, or considering professional help in one of the areas above - please read the chapter in this book first. You will save yourself an incredible amount of time, money and heartbreak in the long run. It will also give you the best chance of actually solving the problem since you will be directed towards the most effective treatment right from the beginning of treatment rather than (hopefully) eventually finding it by trial and error. I only hope that Dr Seligman writes an updated version of this book sometime in the near future in order to keep up with new research findings."},{"Title":"What You Can Change and What You Can't","review":"With all the authority of a long and distinguished reseach career in psychology, Martin Seligman sets out to present something like a consumer guide to self-improvement and psychotherapy. (This is not a recipe book for dealing with your problems.)The results are sobering: from the range of most frequent psychological afflictions, only a few will reliably be relieved by treatment. You can - with appropriate help from a responsible mental health professional - do something about- panic attacks- specific phobias (snakes, spiders, flying, etc.)- sexual dysfunctions.With other problems, such as depression and addiction, &quot;moderate relief&quot; is the best psychiatrists have to offer, often (when psychoactive medication is used) at a considerable price.Beyond that,- enjoy your sexual orientation,- enjoy your weight (dieting will improve it upwards, in the long run),- stop blaming unsatisfactory results of your adult life on your childhood and your parents - it won't do you any good, and there is much less of a causal relationship anyway.All this is presented clearly, with &quot;whys&quot; and &quot;hows&quot;, and with ample references. If you consider undergoing psychotherapy, or if you're stuck with a self-improvement attempt, this book may save you lots of money and trouble. (Being more or less left to your own devices may be a letdown, but it may also give you a realistic chance to cope with your situation.)If you're professionally working in the mental health field, you will find much food for thought as well, especially in Seligman's candid statements about the many relevant questions that have not yet been scientifically settled or which even have not been researched at all. And unless you're a practicioner of that method, you may be slightly amused with the author's treatment of psychoanalysis - with disorder after disorder, it doesn't have much of an effect... Given the way our culture is soaked with psychoanalytic beliefs and assumptions, this is something that can't be said often enough"},{"Title":"What You Can Change and What You Can't","review":"As a navel-gazing self-help junkie, I was surprised and a little annoyed when I discovered this book -- after all, I thought to myself, who can tell me what I can or cannot do? Never mind that I was overwhelmed with boatloads of conflicting information -- I didn't think ANYONE had the answers, and that it was necessary to try everything once. Well, thank God for Dr. Seligman. The book is a brilliantly simple yet deep exploration of the research available on treatments for various conditions -- and it turns out that there ARE answers available regarding what works and what doesn't. (And what you shouldn't even bother trying.) This book is a valuable resource for anyone trying to make sense of the self-help and treatment industries."},{"Title":"What You Can Change and What You Can't","review":"First off, this book is very good.Martin Seligman, ever the excellent research psychologist provides an overview over the big mental diseases and disorders. From everyday anxiety to panic attacks, phobias, obsessive-compulsive disorders to depression, post-traumatic stress disorder to sexual disorders, overweight and alcoholism Seligman has reviewed the literature and provides concise advice on what works for each condition and what does not. In between he mentions VERY interesting research results and historic developments in the treatment of psychological ills. These newest findings have changed his opinions as well. While in his 1993 Bestseller \\"Learned Optimism\\" he still supported the more behaviorist approaches of f.e. pessimism - the primary risk factor for later-life depression - being conditioned through \\"bad role modeling\\" by parent's dealing with adverse events (which could be UNLEARNED), he now, due to identical-twin studies, attributes virtually all mental disorders to heritability.In a fascinating account on pages 39ff. (\\"Your genes and your personality\\") a picture of the human being as an essentially inflexible biological machine emerges, whose innate mental tendencies towards for instance anger, anxiety or depression can be at most mitigated by therapy and medication, but never cured.Albeit I - as I'm sure he'd want to - stress that heritability in all twin-studies accounted for at most 50% probability that the personality trait of a parent would be present in the child. Incredible for example is the genetic link for criminal behavior in children and biological parents vs. adoptive parents.But I have two points of criticism:What I find very likeable about Seligman is that, as he pointed out in \\"Learned optimism\\" as well as this book, he is really a innate pessimist.As such, I think he, like another reviewer here, paints a too bleak of a picture of the treament efficacies.For starters I seriously question his claim that depression treatment works only in 2/3 of patients. I'd really guess it's more like .Second of all, he thinks it's a real disappointment, that drugs and therapy don't cure.Why did anybody ever think you could DISCONTINUE mental treatments after time.Why do people pray for divine help 5 times every day and incessantly go to church on Sundays.Obviously mental issues are deeply engrained into the brain physiology. These disorders are not outside invaders that could be cast out by drugs or therapy. They are construction flaws in one's mind that must be steadily contained through long-term treatment as long as there is no such thing as \\"psycho-surgery\\".Also i got the impression except for alcoholism and overweight he unduly plays down the improvements on many of the treatments. Be it OCD, depression, everyday anxiety or especially PTSD, whose improvements he describes as \\"marginal\\" these \\"marginal\\" improvements can mean the difference between suicide and a bearable, even content existence in many people. But of course he is right to point out, that whatever of these conditions you have, they're never gonna go completely away, and relapses are common. \\"But you can still manage\\", I would add to that.Bottom line is, if you got any of the above disorders this is a good book. If you want more of as the title suggests a \\"successful guide to self-improvement\\" go with \\"Three-minute therapy\\" by Michael Edelstein. He covers also less pathological issues like money problems, dealing with overeating and smoking, depression, anger, panic, (social) anxieties, chronic worrying and even procrastination. Very good self-help book.Seligman's is more like a reference book."},{"Title":"What You Can Change and What You Can't","review":"I have read this book a couple of times now. I have always been interested in this kind of subject matter and this book is one of the most informative and surprising I have come across. As far as self-help books go, I found this book inspirational which is something I wasn't expecting. I found it to also be the most realistic book about what may really help you and what probably won't. It covers psychological conditions such as phobias, depression, compulsive disorders, post traumatic stress disorder and overeating.For me personally, the most interesting part of this book was the exploration of the inner child and how it has little relevance to your life in most cases (when you control for the genes your parents gave you). People tend to take unfavorable childhood experiences and grossly overestimate the influence these experiences have on their adult lives. The author outlines childhood experiences that may impact your life in adulthood such as loss of a mother at a young age or a childhood where you were physically brutalized. If you're lucky enough to have avoided these types of childhood experiences, your childhood doesn't influence you as much as you think. It's not our childhood that influences us now rather our own decision making or lack thereof. I have heard my own friends go on and on about their childhoods and I have listened to them link unfavorable experiences to their present lives and while I sat there listening politely and attentively, I have to admit that I am also thinking in the back of my head: what does this have to do with anything in your life now? Now I realize that I bumped into this notion via complete dumb luck for I am certainly not a scholar on this subject but I was blown away when I actually read the author's synopsis on childhood and its relative lack of influence on your adult life now. It's quite a revelation to read it in writing.It's a good book and one that I have enjoyed reading more than once!"},{"Title":"What You Can Change and What You Can't","review":"It pays to focus your attention and effort on what changes will give you the biggest gain for the smallest effort. Martin Seligman tells you exactly that in this book. Seligman is the reining president of the American Psychological Association, a thorough researcher, and a damn good writer. He not only tells you what is easier and harder to change, based on the research, but gives you short, to-the-point suggestions (also based on the research) on HOW you can change those things. I'm the author of the book, Self-Help Stuff That Works, and I'm an expert on the subject, and I can tell you Seligman has written a very practical book. It is definitely worth reading and re-reading."},{"Title":"What You Can Change and What You Can't","review":"I don't even remember how I came by this book, I've had it so long. As a former self-help junkie, I can say this book did more to get my head out of my you-know-where than all the others put together. Seligman shows that human beings have a wide range of \\"normal\\" in terms of our emotions. He shows how to acknowledge who we are and why we feel the way we do, and then learn how that emotional range helps us. So reasonable, and incredibly reassuring and helpful. This guy is no flash-in-the pan busy preening for the Oprah show. He is a realist. I wish I'd had this book when I was 21. Life would have been so much easier."},{"Title":"What You Can Change and What You Can't","review":"Seligman is one of the most distinguished psychologists in America, and this attempt to have a rigorous look at the suggestions of the pioneers of self-help is very welcome.Many people are not aware of the size and the quality of a lot of the research into personal change and personal development, and this book summarizes a fair bit of it.Nobody is going to agree with everything written by ANY author, and he is overly pessimistic about the chances for helping people with weight problems and addictions. But with that caveat this book is highly recommended to anyone who wants to improve themselves and the world around them."},{"Title":"What You Can Change and What You Can't","review":"I work with &quot;at risk youth&quot;, kids in the foster care system, socially disadvantaged and many who have suffered abuse. I have often wondered how to help kids who suffer from depression, anxiety, Post Traumatic Stress, etc. This book is very helpful because it describes the world view that will give kids resiliency skills, and help them overcome the emotional difficulties they have. It also describes what can't be changed, and how to deal with those aspects of emotional disturbance, clinically. This book offers validity to what I have observed professionally. Mostly, it offers a practical means of knowing how to address the problems I encounter with the kids I work with, and how to teach the kids how to help themselves. Seligman offers a perspective that is based on science and Biological Psychiatry. It's about time psychology moved in this direction."},{"Title":"What You Can Change and What You Can't","review":"This book reads like an encyclopedia, with solid information regarding numerous topics such as anxiety, phobias, obsession, as well as sex, dieting and alcohol. A better starting point for many people might be his books, \\"Learned Optimism\\" and \\"Authentic Happiness\\". Learned Optimism summarizes many experiments and studies, and provides the sound theoretical basis for Positive Psychology. This provides the credibility you may wish before you proceed further. Authentic Happiness builds on that theory."},{"Title":"What You Can Change and What You Can't","review":"So much has already been said about Seligman's book, that I think what needs to be emphasized is that this is a book based on studies of the effectiveness of various approaches to mental illness of all sorts in an attempt to give the would be patient some guidance about what to expect in the way of \\"cure\\" from any of the available therapys. Seligman is not overly optomistic, as he adhers to a belief in the gene based origin of many disorders, but he presents an honest, if not overly optomistic assessment. In many cases, the answer is to adjust to the condition as best you can, using the medications available, and accept some measure of discomfort as in inevitable. Bottom line, accept and love yourself, and let Seligman point you toward the possible therapies available."},{"Title":"What You Can Change and What You Can't","review":"Psychologist Martin Seligman acknowledges that psychology sends us two contradictory messages about change. Psychotherapists and the self-improvement literature tout our ability to change ourselves for the better, whether with help from a trained professional or on our own. The biomedical model of psychology claims that mental illness is really a form of physical illness, emotion and mood are determined by brain chemistry, and personality is determined by genes. Neither view is true in the general sense--the things we struggle to change are either more or less changeable. The author cites research findings to help us see the difference.The author plays it straight. \\"This book walks a political tightrope. On one side is the racist segment of the right, fervently hoping that intelligence, femininity and criminality are all entirely genetic. On the other side are many aging 1960s liberals and their 'politically correct' campus heirs, condemning all who dare to speak ill of victims; failure, they say, results from poverty, racism, a bad upbringing, a malevolent system, underprivilege, deprivation--from anything but oneself.\\" Examining therapy outcome research, Seligman finds that panic and sexual dysfunction can be easily unlearned, destructive moods can be controlled, depression can be cured by conscious changes in thinking patterns, and optimism can be learned. However, it is vanishingly difficult to make dieting work, change the gender orientation of children, shortcut the natural course of recovery from alcoholism, change homosexuality into heterosexuality, or fix adult personality problems by reliving childhood trauma. Seligman takes us through these and related issues examining what research tells us about realistic possibility for change.This book is recommended for those who want to understand personal change, to attempt it when it can be achieved and avoid frustration and unrealistic expectations when it cannot. Readers may also enjoy Seligman'sThe Optimistic Child: A Proven Program to Safeguard Children Against Depression and BuildLifelong Resilience."},{"Title":"What You Can Change and What You Can't","review":"Clear, concise, and to the point.

And if it is true, what are the conditions and factors that make it so?Those are the questions that Martin Seligman, co-founder of positive psychology, attempts to answer in this book. He tackles many sensitive subjects including child abuse, sexual dysfunction, sexual orientation, and depression, all with an eye toward change - when possible.At times at seems as if he is having a fireside chat with colleagues to share fascinating research findings, refute long-held beliefs, and get a few things off of his chest; like the erroneous belief one's childhood (or parents) are legitimate reasons for mental anguish as an adult.I found his theory on why women experience depression twice as much as men to be plausible. According to Seligman, women are first conditioned (learned helplessness) to be less competitve than men, and then forced to compete with men, where they are often undervalued and undercompensated, and they tend to ruminate over stressful situations more than men, and then - if that's not enough - they are preoccupied with their appearance, weight, and underlying issues of attractiveness, every single day.This book offers great scientific insights into the phenomenon of cognitive restructuring (the process by which change occurs), and yes, it offers some tools on how you can change - if you have the dedication to do so."},{"Title":"What You Can Change and What You Can't","review":"This book was exceptional! Dr Seligman assembles what appears to be prodigious amounts of research and provides empirical evidence for a lot of discomforting human behaviors.I was shocked at the results of a few of the self-testing instruments included in the book - but they and everything else I read really opened my eyes to things I have fought with in myself, sometimes for decades.After learning that some things just aren't going to change, I feel much more at peace. And I found his explanation of the genetic experimentation of the Third Reich as a social context for the more American theory of plasticity overwhelmingly fascinating. It explained so much about our culture and the plethora of self-help books we consume as Americans...and why that may not be the best investment.Probably most people have things about themselves that they strongly wish they could change. From mood to emotions to addictions, this book adroitly guides us to realize what is likely genetically encoded and what is malleable.Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"What You Can Change and What You Can't","review":"Much better than what I expected, Seligman offers a well-informed review about hot topics in psychology. It should be a 'must' for every psychologician in the world. Topic by topic, the book confronts you with what works and what does not on therapy."},{"Title":"What You Can Change and What You Can't","review":"Why is the cost of this book What you Can Change and What you Can't more expensive on Kindle than it is in a soft covered book?"},{"Title":"What You Can Change and What You Can't","review":"\\"Lord, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.\\"But how can we know which things can be changed, and which things cannot?Read this book, and have your eyes opened! :-)"},{"Title":"What You Can Change and What You Can't","review":"You be a therapist! This book was compiled by the leading investigator of depression in the United States. You will like him and this book very much. Each treatment for psychiatric disorders gets a certain number of points for effectiveness and for side effects. This book is the best that science has to offer in relation to depression, anxiety, alcohol abuse, dieting, sexual problems, and on and on. I do believe that you would be a fool if you did not buy it. Why? Because it's the best that science has to offer. And this means &quot;outcome studies&quot;. An outcome study (a good one) is having 5,000 take a placebo for depression and 5,000 people taking thiamine. Both without knowing whether the pill is a placebo or thiamine. If 4,200 lose their depression with the thiamine and only 1,700 with the placebo, other surveys are needed for further investigations. YO! What happens if the thiamine has a temporary effect and then leaves this control group worse off than it was in 1 year? What happens if the thiamine has a &quot;feel good&quot; effect but then decreases your concentration? The standard treatment for severe depression is mainly antidepressants like Prozac. A woman just lost her spouse of 40 years 6 months ago. This would qualify her as having a &quot;major depressive disorder&quot;. As her therapist, you give her Prozac and sessions of cognitive-behavioral therapy. Which is supposed to back up the Prozac. What about trying to persuade her to get out with other people? To start a new career. THESE LAST TWO SUGGESTIONS CAN'T BE USED BY SCIENCE BECAUSE THE DATA CAN'T BE QUANTIFIED! It can't be isolated. If she meets rough people, maybe her depression will worsen. If she meets people with similar interests, her depression may dissapear. BUT BUY THE BOOK. Let's not dismiss science. Science gives us something to consult so that we don't fly back to the dark ages. Let's just put it into it's proper place. Good luck."},{"Title":"What You Can Change and What You Can't","review":"This is one of the most illuminating books I've read about how we came to be who we are and what our real prospects are for healing and change. Read it slowly, pausing to reflect on how each section might apply to you and those you know.It should be noted that this book is almost 10 years old and should be read in light of subsequent developments in therapy and pharmacology. Since it was written, for example, newer drugs have become available, and EMDR has come into wide acceptance as a potent treatment for PTSD. Nevertheless, the postulates that the self-help industry continues to recite seem to have changed very little, and I don't know of anything new that would invalidate Seligman's basic findings."},{"Title":"What You Can Change and What You Can't","review":"Some readers find this book &quot;depressing&quot; because it seems to imply that their efforts at &quot;self-improvement&quot; are doomed. I found it cheering because it confirms what I've always felt: we are what we are, and most of our life problems arise because we're led to believe that we can't or shouldn't accept ourselves as we are. For example, my family tree is full of women who, by modern standards, would be considered &quot;morbidly obese&quot; -- but they ate well, stayed physically active, and lived healthy lives well into their 80's and 90's. I have the same body type, but at age 12 I was labeled &quot;overweight,&quot; so I spent the next 25 years on the dieting roller-coaster before concluding that I hadn't been too fat in the first place (I was just too buxom to fit my doctor's idea of how a 12-year-old &quot;should&quot; look). Doctors are still nagging me about my weight today, but I lead an active life, eat a balanced diet, and am healthy as a horse ... which drives them nuts! I also totally agree with his analysis of &quot;alcoholism&quot; -- in most cases I know of, excessive drinking was either learned behavior (a type of machismo) or a response to feeling &quot;trapped&quot; by life in some way. If the drinking has become life-threatening, then something like AA can help solve the immediate problem ... but unless the long-term problem is addressed too, it's all too easy for lapses to occur. Furthermore, I've known people who became &quot;addicted&quot; to AA meetings rather than trying to fix what was wrong in their lives, and I don't see that as much of an improvement! All in all, this is a very balanced, sensible, and encouraging book, and I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"What You Can Change and What You Can't","review":"The self-improvement industry spends billions to convince people that their psychological and physical problems are fixable. The magazine covers at the checkout counter extol the latest miracle diet, but most of the people in line with you are overweight. Seasoned mental-health professional and former president of the American Psychological Association, Martin E. P. Seligman, Ph.D., has bad news for the seriously overweight: Diets don't work. Plus, he tells alcoholics and people with deep-seated emotional afflictions, there are no definitive cures for them. He notes, however, that a large minority of alcoholics do recover, though no approach is guaranteed. Seligman, whose views have generated both gratitude and controversy, details which psychological problems are treatable and which are not. His candid attitude is laudable and his advice seems well-informed, if perhaps generalized. If you've gotten thin, you've beaten the odds. Meanwhile, he recommends that people learn to live bravely with daunting emotional issues they cannot completely master - because, he says, mastery probably isn't possible. getAbstract finds this treatise about what is and isn't fixable both sobering and valuable."},{"Title":"What You Can Change and What You Can't","review":"Seligman transforms the complx to consumable. I was most taken by his approach to real issues that effect everyday folks - and things they struggle with, like weight, alcohol, anxiety and depression. What Dr. Seligman holds out is hope for the masses to know what they can overcome - what they can't, and where they should put their attention with some hope of success."},{"Title":"What You Can Change and What You Can't","review":"I applaud the authors efforts to bring scientific rigor to the fields of psychology and self-help. It's certainly better than most books in the genre!Unfortunately, the results (at least in this book) are prone to some of the same flaws that he is decrying. Much of what he writes seems to be heavily influenced by his own preconceived notions. He argues that weight cannot (even should not) be changed, but it just so happens he is overweight. He is clearly against any alchohol consumption, with no scientific basis given for that belief or its ubiquity in the chapter about alchoholism treament methods.Furthermore, the book is self-contradictory. He spends a whole chapter arguing that childhood abuse and other trauma does not have much effect on the adult that child grows into. But in the chapter on anger, he argues that parental fighting and divorce are so bad for a child long term, that all parents should consider staying together and supressing any arguments for the sake of the children.He has interesting thoughts on how the labeling of an issue (as a disease, character flaw, etc) can help or hurt the person suffering from and attempting to overcome that issue. As he says, there are pros and cons to each label. Labeling so many of these problems as incurable and genetic helps those who suffer from them feel less guilty about it. However it stunts attempts to fix the issue."},{"Title":"What You Can Change and What You Can't","review":"Dr. Seligman's book is helpful because it is balanced, covering both biological psychiatry and cognitive therapy. I like this book a lot. Anxiety, worry, depression, and unhappiness are big problems in the USA today. His suggestion that it is possible to achieve a moderate amount of progress toward happiness and better living is realistic. The only newer book in cognitive research and therapy that adds significantly to Dr. Seligman's classic overview is Dr. Norem's The Positive Power of Negative Thinking. A realistic approach to individual differences has improved my life, so I recommemd this approach to other readers."},{"Title":"What You Can Change and What You Can't","review":"Do you ever wonder if AA really works for alcoholics? Or why some studies show that homosexuals can change, but others say they can't? Or why transexuals have to undergo operations to change their outsides to match the sex they think they are? This is the book for you.Martin Seligman is so good at writing that I'd probably buy his grocery list if he published it! I really enjoy his plain, no-nonsense style. He has extensive research to back up what he says, and he makes it clear when he doesn't.In some ways, this is a hopeful book, if you've got something that can be changed. If something happened to you as a child, for example, Seligman says it doesn't have to rule your life. On the other hand, he'll let you know when you're probably banging your head against a wall: there's no evidence, for example, that dieting works and you probably are going to look like your ancestors (who admittedly were good-looking enough to breed). At least it's a relief to know that your weight isn't your fault.I loved this book and quote it often. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"What You Can Change and What You Can't","review":"Martin Seligman first came to notice for his introduction of the concept of learned helplessness, which has given birth to the practice of cognitive therapy. Here he addresses psychological problems ranging from unipolar and bipolar depression to phobias and evaluates the merits of several types of treatment for each.One might expect him always to recommend cognitive therapy for each problem, but he does not. He is consistently objective and humble. Moreover, his prose is clear, concise, and frequently witty, and this book his stimulated me to a great deal of additional thought, both about the things with which I immediately agreed and some things about which I disagree somewhat."},{"Title":"What You Can Change and What You Can't","review":"One reviewer sarcastically says that Seligman \\"came up with the 'original' insight that helplessness leads to despair.\\" It's how the despair was manifested that makes it interesting. The point of the testing was that when the subjects were given the opportunity to escape the situation that led to the despair, they do not take advantage of the opportunity. Thus, they experienced \\"learned helplessness.\\"In another part of the book he confessed that he thought it was his job as a therapist to lead people to the truth, but that many of the studies he cited showed that depressed people actually have a more accurate view of reality than happy people.He cites Swedish studies of twins raised apart to show how much of what we do is determined by our genes. It's truly fascinating.I don't think this book functioned well as a self-help book for me. However, judged simply by whether or not it was a good read, I'd put this in my top two of all time, along with \\"The Gift of Fear\\" by Gavin de Becker."},{"Title":"What You Can Change and What You Can't","review":"Unlike other so-called \\"self-help\\" books, What You Can Change and What You Can't* surfaces the root of a range of discussed problems ranging from obsessions & compulsions to alcoholism. What makes this book different and thus invaluable as a \\"self-improvement\\" book is the inherent honesty, brought about by scientific scrutiny and the author's intention to provide professional, complete and unbiased assessments on what one can change, and what one cannot.Whilst numerous other books of this category attempts to instil optimism but does nothing more than skim the surface, this book provides clear scientific details to each condition/disease discussed along with the corresponding treatments available, and how well each works.Unbiased and very specific, the author is very clear on what to conclude on and mark as definitive and what remains unclear based on the most recent studies available, and the data they yield. When the author exerts a professional opinion, he articulates the reason behind it and provides clear data to support it, which comes across as responsible and confident.For a category of reading so saturated with ideas that do not much more than skim the surface, I see What You Can Change and What You Can't* as a rare breed that gets to the core of the problem, and hence makes it truly useful in facilitating change and accepting what cannot, yet, be changed."},{"Title":"The quiet rebels;: The story of the Quakers in America ([Culture & discovery books])","review":"The history of Quakers is, in some ways, the history of America and its culture. Early forms of government, the fight against war, slavery, poverty were all influenced by the Quakers. Women's rights, many fields of science, the temperance movement were all fueled by the Quakers, who wanted not just to improve themselves but also the world. This book really helps you understand where Quakerism came from, how it has developed and where it may be going.

The characters are extremely well drawn--the reader develops real concern and care for them--and seem very representative of the times. This would be a challenging time period to write about and Monfredo does it with compassion. An excellent series best read in order but don't let that stop you from reading any of them. I can't wait for the next one."},{"Title":"North Star Conspiracy","review":"Miriam Grace Monfredo is one of the best historical mystery writers today, and her skills are well displayed in this book, the second in the Glynis Tryon series set in the upstate New York town of Seneca Falls in the middle of the 19th century. Glynis is the town librarian, with a strong belief in women's suffrage (along with her friend Elizabeth Cady Stanton). Until this story unfolds, however, she has been less supportive of the abolitionist cause which was strongly supported around Seneca Falls through participation in the Underground Railroad. Through the events linked to this murder mystery, however, Glynis is forced to rethink her position and ends up travelling as far as Richmond to fight against the Fugitive Slave Act.One of the best things about Monfredo's stories is that she shares with you an entire town, in all its complexity and liveliness. Every character in the book is lovingly and lavishly drawn, and several plots unfold simultaneously which gives the stories a feeling of authenticity that is hard to beat.You will want to rush out and buy the next story (Blackwater Spirits) immediately, to see how Glynis's friendship with the new Seneca/French constable, Jacques, turns out!"},{"Title":"North Star Conspiracy","review":"I loved this book. Though it is the second in the series, it was the first one for me, and I intend to read the rest of the series now. It rates a close second to City Of Light in the realm of historical fiction based in my part of NY State. I like that it includes real characters along with the most important issues of the time, and murder, mystery, romance and good fictional character development."},{"Title":"North Star Conspiracy","review":"Monfredo's compassionate touch and diligent research bring the painful conflict over the Fugitive Slave Laws and the struggle for women's rights alive -- while not skimping the more traditional tensions of love interests and the sleuth's search for the criminals. The story ranges from New York down to Richmond, faithful to the geography and politics of both, and never neglecting character development or the drama of human interaction in this tale of kidnapping, concubinage, and murder. Not only would I recommend this to any adult mystery fan, I'd commend it to mature high school students who are looking for insight in what it was like to live when it was a crime to be a slave or to help one in the &quot;free&quot; states of the North."},{"Title":"North Star Conspiracy","review":"This is the second Glynis Tryon Mystery, and it is even better than the first one,Seneca Falls Inheritance. It is now 1854, six years after \\"Inheritance,\\" and the abolitionist debate is going strong. The Republican Party has just been founded in Ripon, Wisconsin.Glynis strongly believes in obeying the law of the land, but she is unable to obey the Fugitive Slave Act by turning in Kiri, a lovely young girl who has escaped from a plantation in Virginia, and who is the beloved of Glynis' landlady's son, Niles. Glynis helps get Kiri to the home of Frederick Douglass, where she is hidden awaiting the opportunity to escape to Canada, where Niles plans to join her. When Niles is captured and taken to Virginia for trial, Glynis and Jeremiah Merrycoyf go to Virginia to try to save him. There ensues a fine courtroom drama, with Glynis turning up a key piece of evidence. Glynis and Merrycoyf return to Seneca Falls, and the villian, Thomas Farley, is unmasked.This is but a small sample of the plot twists of this delightful book.

Her heroine, Glynis Tryon, is a wonderful creation. She is by far one of the most intereting and realistic historical fiction characters that I have come across in quite some time. This book is an historical mystery, but it is also an expose of the American Slave Trade. Ms. Monfredo blends real-life people such as Elizabeth Stanton and Harriet Tubman into her stories, and this makes the books fascinating and truly informative. This book illustrates the powerlessness of women and slaves during the 1840's in America. And we also get a first-class mystery that kept me guessing throughout. I simply cannot wait now to read the next story in this powerful series."},{"Title":"North Star Conspiracy","review":"It appears that Ms. Monfredo's books are no longer in print, which is a true shame. I generally have no use for historical fiction, but she takes great pains to try to have the facts in a row. One of the things I like best is the encyclopedia-type entries in the back of the books detailing where history stops and where fiction begins. As somebody with a bit of a mental block where history's concerned, I appreciate not learning \\"fiction in the guise of facts\\" to get myself in trouble. LOLIn addition to this, the stories are just plain good. The publishing order is the chronological order, and I recommend reading them that way. They don't go immediately head-to-tail, but they do interconnect in ways that will make more sense if you read them in order.I have to say that, being in VA, I found a small mistake in this book where it takes place in my area. It doesn't hurt the story a bit, and, according to other locals I've talked to who wouldn't have recognized the mistake either, it doesn't seem to be all that common of knowledge.This is an EXCELLENT series, and I strongly urge people to check it out."},{"Title":"North Star Conspiracy","review":"If you haven't yet been introduced to Monfredo's Glynis Tryon series, you must--I repeat, *must*--read this author.

As a geologist, he has done a considerable amount of work on the fossil record. As he read the story of creation in the book of Genesis, he was struck by its similarity to the fossil record. In his book he gives considerable space to examining this similarity (Part 2 Chap 1). The reader is introduced to the concept of scientific creation. Because God is timeless, Philip argues our concept of a day would be quite meaningless and creation should be seen as days in the sight of God. This to me was an important insight and enabled me to make the link that explains the problem with 'days'. Philip also examines the concept of evolution as it is presently taught, and, by using examples such as the horse he challenges the widespread assumptions on the origin of life itself. This is a thought-provoking part of this book. As a Christian, Philip has sought to give a fresh interpretation to scripture. As a fellow Christian, I found his work to be thought-provoking. To a layman, his account of creation is biblically correct, and he has been able to sort out many of the problems I have encountered in studying this part of scripture. By suggesting that a species can exist before it grows because it is a bundle of information, Philip opens up a whole new perspective on some of the puzzling issues in this debate. There were many areas I found challenging and interesting. Some were his explanation of how the moon came into existence (p54-68) and the process by which carbon was laid down in the earth and today is being released. Philip makes the relevant point that God was and still is intimately involved in His creation. He is intimately involved with each one of us, and gives us a reason and purpose for living. This needs to be widely taught in our schools, churches and families. I commend this book as a serious study. As a former teacher librarian, I would recommend it be placed on library shelves and that schools should at least look at the text and not condemn it out of hand. In an era where our young generation is questioning the very basis of scientific rationalism and searching for spiritual meaning in life, this book deserves study."},{"Title":"The Tree Of Life & The Origin Of The Species","review":"If Christianity seems unreasonable and the Bible appears as a barren bed of 'Thou shalt's' and 'Thou shalt not's'then this book could reawaken your interest in both. It treats the Bible as a confirmation of all of life which can be explored and enjoyed.It is a most extraordinary integration of geological science, God and a farmer's common sense. The God of this book is sublimely transcendent yet part of every cell of matter, the ultimate, 'eternal, unchanging reference point'(p4). The book is logical and biblical without being limited by literality. For example, in relation to the question of the length of time taken for God to create the universe, it says: 'God did not work to the sun (it did not illumine the earth for the first three days!). He concluded each day when his purposes for that day were fully complete.'This is a readable, easily understood alternative to some of the extremes of the argument about the origin of the universe."},{"Title":"The Tree Of Life & The Origin Of The Species","review":"If you are at all confused about life, the universe and everything else associated with it then this is The book.This book takes your mind on a journey from God and the origin of the Earth, with geological facts, to the most modern of all technological advances through the sciences.The author offers challanges for many inquistiive minds to join a journey in support of the what I read to be a significant Biblical foundation of our world.This new model for the origin of species proposed in this book is definately as founded as any other model so far given to us.

Certainly it represents an excellent source of problem material for those who want to create an intro physics course that has relevance to future doctors and biologists.Unfortunately, most of the examples are \\"set-ups\\" in which a biological system is used as a wrapper for an equation the students are expected to have memorized. For example, when discussing gravity, the book has a problem on a diving hawk (hawks dive by essentially going into free-fall), in which the students are expected to use (1/2) a t-squared, but for which the students are not expected to estimate the effects of air resistance or assess the realism of the physical situation. I.e., the book contains standard plug-and-chug physics problems in biomedical clothing.It would be nice to see a book that helps students to learn, on their own, how to identify the relevant physics in a biomedical situation. I can't fault this book overly, since there are essentially no examples of what I am looking for, in either the physics or the bio textbook worlds, save for Steven Vogel's outstanding Biomechanics book (highly recommended)."},{"Title":"Biomedical Applications for Introductory Physics","review":"This book has a good content structure for anyone who want to study biomedical applications of physics.

It's important to understand what is meant by Pulp Gaming, as the Pulps from the were a medium on which any genre was printed, from Westerns to Futuristic. For the purposes of this source book the Pulp Era is the 1920s and 1930s, the period between the World Wars (when the Pulps themselves were popular entertainment). Within that period a number of genres can be explored for gaming purposes however. Simply for the sake of a reference point, Pulp Hero declares 1935 to be the Current Year.Chapter One - The Pulp Genre. The books starts with a discussion of just what the Pulps were; which is a reference to the paper they were printed on, and not the writing. It goes into a history of their rise in popularity and provides some authors and titles that are among the most famous.The Pulp Genre covers genre tropes and aspects. There are four major aspects of Pulp Gaming defined, Action, Shallow Characters, Melodrama, and Black And White Morality. These four aspects appeared in just about every Pulp printed. The secondary aspects that help define the genre are next, thirty-two genre conventions are looked at, from the Abducted Girl to Weird Science (and many gamers will be happy to know that in much of Pulp fiction Violence Solves Everything). There is also a section regarding the ideas of Sexism and Racism, how to treat it with historical accuracy, or how to use it sparingly or completely ignore it (keeping in mind attitudes in the twenties and thirties were vastly different than they are today).Pulp Subgenres covers different types of Pulp Games, with a note that they often share so many aspects you can easily switch from one to the other. This makes them less \\"subgenres\\" and more different sides of the same idea. It covers AIr Adventure, Crimebusting, Detective, Globe Trotting Adventure, and Weird Menace. Meta Genres covers using different styles in the Pulp Game, comedy (used sparingly), Horror (perfect for Occult Adventures), Mystery (practically a requirement in many Pulps), Romance (or the complete lack thereof), and the fact that Tragedy really has no place in Pulp, it's far too optimistic a genre most of the time. Other Genres covers using Pulp Aspects in the other major genres (Champions, Dark Champions, Fantasy, Ninja, Victorian, and Western), and it gives some extra space to Star Hero for sci-fi Pulps.Using all, or most, of the elements in this chapter one can set up a long running Pulp Game. Especially given some of the universal aspects you can have a story set in the Jungles of Africa tracking down some lost artifact or civilization, and the next story have the group in a Crimefighting story in New York shutting down a madman trying to take over the city! You can also easily bring many of these ideas into other genres, modernizing the Pulps could work well in a less gritty Dark Champions game.Chapter Two - Pulp History. This chapter is divided into two parts, both covering historical aspects of the 1920s and 1930s. First is a breakdown by year and month of major events around the world. It's divided into Politics And War, Science And Technology, Crime And Punishment, Arts And Entertainment, and Life And Times. It's done in a table format making it easy to reference, each Year is divided into Month and has a General section at the end for things that weren't tied to a specific date. The second part is a brief description of important and famous people from those times.All this can come in handy when you want some historical facts for a time frame when sending your adventurers out into the world, and for populating it with famous NPCs, which always makes for fun gaming.Chapter Three - The World Of The Pulp Era. Here we go around the world and get some geographical, political, and historical information on most of the countries that existed in the Pulp Era. Before it goes into each country it covers some other important factors of the world in the 1920s and 1930s. It covers The League Of Nations, the Great Depression, and Colonialism, with advice on how to use each in a Pulp Game. Travel And Transportation covers how people get around; Automobiles, buses, taxis, trains, airplanes and airships, ships, and riding animals. It has some helpful tables for average price ranges and distances from major ports and airports. Communications covers how people got information around the world, from the unreliable mail, to radio, telegram and the newer telephone.The rest of the chapter is dedicated to the many countries of the era, keeping in mind much of the globe is still unexplored, at least by Western Culture. The United States is a major world power and gets the most space dedicated to it. The Americas covers Canada, Mexico, Central and South America. Europe covers the fourteen most influential countries of the time. Africa is still almost completely Colonial and doesn't have near the number of countries it does today. The Near East covers Turkey, and what is called the MIddle East today. South Asia covers India and the numerous islands between the Indian and Pacific Oceans. The Far East covers the rest of Asia, China getting about as much space as the United States does. Oceana covers Australia and the South Pacific Islands. A short section at the end provides some information on the Poles as well.And with all that you should be ready to traverse the world in search of adventure. It's important to note that for the purposes of many (but not all) games historical accuracy takes a back seat to Adventurous Fun.Chapter Four - Character Creation. Before the chapter goes into building a Pulp Hero it provides a short section on the attributes your standard Pulp Hero possesses. This is an excellent guide to the qualities that embody the genre from a Character perspective. There are twenty four Package Deals presented, from the Athlete to the Wild Man. Covering Cops, (ex-)Criminals, Detectives (with five variations in type), Soldiers, and other common Pulp Heros of the time. Also included are Background Package Deals, these much smaller sets of skills can be used to explain why the Soldier might have a few science based skills (Scientific Parents Background), or why the devil-may-care Aviator mingles with the rich (Wealthy Upbringing Background). All of these Packages help define the Characters (as well as help create expectations) and are at the very least excellent places to start or get ideas from if you don't use them.Characteristics goes into ways to prevent everyone from looking them same from a Characteristics point of view (everyone buys there stats to the same levels), as well as going into each Characteristic and which archetypes it's most appropriate for. Some important bits covered in Skills include how Criminology works with the technology of the 1920s and 1930s. The importance of Disguise in the Pulps, and Transport Familiarity of the Pulps. The Follower Perk provides some suggestions on the types of Followers common to the genre. The Money Perk also covers the amount of money each level has in Era Dollars. Three new Talents are introduced that are good additions to Pulp games; Animal Friendship (that uncanny knack to get along with the wild), Hot Shot Pilot, and Inspire (good for the Two-Fisted Hero). Disadvantages provides some excellent ideas for Pulp characters foibles and quirks.Heroic Talents is the rest of the Chapter. These Talents are built using the Powers section, and represent some of the amazing feats seen in the Pulps, such as the ability to bite through nails (after training your jaw muscles!), the uncanny knack to take in a breath of air just before being pulled underwater, and any number of abilities. It's broken down into Offensive, Defensive, Movement, Sensory, Miscellaneous Abilities, and Psychic Powers (for games including that element). A total of eighty-four Heroic Talents are provided to add color and flavor to your Pulp Hero.Chapter Five - Pulp Equipment. Pulp Technology starts the chapter, providing a nice big list of what things were invented (or became common) in what years of the Pulp Era, and what technology never exists in this time frame. Weapons, because Pulp Heros used a lot of them, covers everything from Revolvers to Grenades (such as they were). Pulp Vehicles provides the important stats for a whole bunch of pulp era transportation, for when the Heroes get into a car chance or dog fight.And then there's Weird Science, because many of the Pulps made up all kinds of stuff in the name of science for their plots. So Pulp Gaming inevitably does the same a lot of the time. It covers the kinds of Weird Science from just improved known technology to making things up whole clothe. How to explain (or not explain) how it works, and using it in a game. After that it provides all kinds of examples of Weird Science to use in your games. Eighteen weapons, two Defensive gadgets, five inventions used to get around, ten Commnuciation and Sensory gadgets, and eight miscellaneous items.A giant Price List of both mundane and adventuring items ends the chapter, along with a Currency Conversion Chart for 1935. With this chapter you should have no trouble loading up your character with appropriate era equipment, and a few weird gadgets to set them above the rest.Chapter Six - Gamemastering The Pulps. This chapter covers how to take the first five chapters and turn them into a Pulp Game. Starting with what \\"Pulp Means\\" in a series of bits of how to capture the feel of the Pulps in game terms (Pulp means Bold, Perilous, Sinister, Lurid, Idealistic, Energetic, and Hopeful). There's a good piece on how to treat Mystic and Psychic Powers in a Pulp game. And how to treat the Sub-Genres introduced in Chapter One in game terms. Running The Game covers setting up the world, adding NPCs, casting the victims and villains, and all the stuff that goes on behind the GMs screen, from a Pulp Perspective in this case. There's also a some very good advice for using the Deduction Skill in a Pulp Game (advice that can be used in any game really). The side bars of this section are peppered with \\"Advice from the Masters,\\" which are some of the thoughts from the real Pulp Writers of the Era on how they constructed their stories; advice any GM can make use of.A new concept is introduced for Hero here, Heroic Action Points. These are points that Players get and can use to affect the game world a little in their favor. They're best used when the Player wants to create one of the myriad Amazing Coincidences so common in the Pulps (from finding a working torch and matches to light it, to the guards forgetting to search the Hero before tossing him in the cell).Environmental Threats covers all those things that Pulp Heroes encounter that hinder them - and create Adventure! Diseases of the times, while not Heroic to get but provide story fodder (your Heros need to rush the vaccine/cure somewhere). Quicksand gets a bit of coverage. My favorite is Rope Bridges! a whole section dedicated to using them is provided. And there's a good long section on Traps for when you reach the lost temples, including eight example Trap builds to use.Pulp Villains covers the important aspect of creating the perfect Pulp Mastermind. From their nature to the motives. Five major Villain Motivations are presented. Along with this is a section on Role Playing the Villain to the best effect. Seven classic Pulp Villain Archetypes are presented, The Crimelord, Cult Leader, Femme Fatale, Fiendish Oriental Mastermind, Mad Scientist, Unscrupulous Industrialist, and the Nazi (not so common in the actual Pulps, but irrevocably part of the modern perception of the Pulps today). The last part covers creating other NPCs for the Characters to interact with.Chapter Seven - Randall's Raiders. This is the NPC section of the book. It contains a group of Heroes (Randall's Raiders) that the GM can either use as friendly competition for the PCs, or the Player's can use for ideas on how to build a good classic Pulp Hero.Villains provides five fiends to pit against your Players. A Nazi, a selfish Archaeologist, a Mad Scientist, a Mob Boss, and an Indian Mastermind out to rule the world. Adversaries provides five quick NPC sheets that can be used as thugs, henchmen and other people the Characters interact with (Cop, Cultist, Dacoit, Gangster, and Soldier).The book doesn't end there though, the last part is a large section of Pulp Slang to add even more color to your game. If you need more information on the Pulp Genre, or want more source material there's a comprehensive Bibliography that includes Pulps themselves, books on the Pulps, and historical references.The Downside:There's almost too much focus on running a 1920s-1930s Pulp Game. For running a Buck Rogers style Pulp Game you'll need to get Star Hero as well and use both books. There's also very little space given to Pulp Games before The Great War, on the other hand those almost completely fall into different genres that deserve their own books.The Otherside:As a guide to creating a game in the Pulp Genre with a good solid Pulp Feel to it, this book is excellent. And it is useful to anyone wanting to run such a game, in the Hero System or otherwise.But it doesn't stop it's usefulness there. Superhero Comics evolved almost directly from Pulp Serials, and in fact the early comics shared a lot in plot and writing style. Anyone wanting some more advice on playing Heroic Characters to the hilt in a Superheroic Setting can get good mileage out of the advice in this book. Particularly the Characters chapter - it wouldn't take much to adapt some of the Character Archetypes (Package Deals) to a full fledged Superhero. And GMs can mine the Campaign Chapter for adventure and villain archetype ideas.Overall this is probably one of the better Genre Books put out, and worth every penny of the cover price. One nice touch on the layout of this book were the numerous quotes from actual Pulps to illustrate points (and the typeface for these was in an old type writer style)."},{"Title":"Hero System: Pulp Hero","review":"This is a great book. Anyone interested in an Role Playing Game that is based on the Pulp Genre, well, this is what you should buy. The book is THICK and full of information. Lots of examples and a great timeline for the \\"Pulp\\" era.What is \\"Pulp\\"? Think Doc Savage, The Shadow, The Spider, Tarzan, Wierd Science, Rockets to Mars....That's Pulp and More!Steve's writing shines here. You can tell he likes the era. Usually, his writing is workman-like...dry, but not here. Sample characters are included as well as villians for the GM to use. Everything you need is right here under one cover. Buy it!"},{"Title":"Hero System: Pulp Hero","review":"I found Pulp Hero a great source of information about the pulp genre. Many of the features of the old Justice Inc were there along with much new material. I thought the $35 price tag a bit steep and they reused some old Justice inc. Artwork."},{"Title":"Grimbold's other world","review":"One of my favourite books ever, this humorous and quirky collection of short stories about one boy and his relationship with the world of faery is written with intelligence and wit. Grimbold is a large black cat who guides Muffler, the foundling child raised by farmers, on many midnight adventures through the &quot;night world&quot;, where everything becomes, physically, what it is spiritually, or mentally. Cats are huge, fearsome and fast, and dogs are small, cringing things full of fear. (Great for cat people: I felt very vindicated.) I highly recommend it for bedtime reading, as it is harmless and not frightening at all, and each chapter can be read on its own. Grimbold is full of dry, sarcastic humor, and Muffler is an endearing character for children and parents alike.Nicholas Stuart Gray is a very talented, underappreciated artist who wrote other children's fantasy fiction. Notably, he wrote a story called &quot;Seventh Swan&quot;, about the last of the ! &quot;swan prince&quot; brothers from the fairy tale. The premise of the novel is, what happened to the poor prince who was left with one swan's wing at the end of the story?"},{"Title":"Grimbold's other world","review":"My Dad has told to sit down and prattle on about Grimbold and Muffler in the hope that the publishers will put Nicholas Stuart Gray books back into print again.Dad read us Grimbold's Other World,and this is what I think of it:Muffler,brought up by farmers, meets Grimbold the cat, who takes the boy into the Night World, where cats grow enormous and dogs quiver like mice,and where Sable,the merciless sorcerer, lives in Red Tower, with his mischeivous son, Gareth. Gareth always defys his father,and gets into rather serious trouble, but Muffler and Grimbold help him.Muffler also meets the Hob,who lives in the barn and is the luck of the farm,and Madam Nettleweb, Sable's scatty sister.This is a fabulous book,full of magic and mystery. I recommend it for any age from 7 and upwards."},{"Title":"Grimbold's other world","review":"I had this book read to me by my mother when I was seven, and fell in love with it... an enduring affair it seems, as I have just finished reading it. to my own seven-year-old son. He was even compelled to leave his xbox and stop slaughtering Orcs , to beg for a nightly chapter of the adventures of the not-quite-all-there goatherd, Muffler, in the world of night.The nightworld is configured in the same fashion as our own, but more mysterious, elemental, and enchanting. Cats are twice their usual size, with powers of magic some of us have always suspected they possessed. Nicholas Stuart Gray was a renowned children's writer, child actor,and playwright. His style combines sinuous story-telling with seductive wit, making the dialogue a joy to read, unlike the often leaden exchanges of fantasy fiction. Old themes are explored, the sense of being different, the yearning to belong but not conform, and , most poignantly, the pain of loss, of abandonment, separation, ageiing and death..I haven't made it sound all THAT jolly yet , have I? There is even a ring of power, and a sorcerer who, if not exactly evil, displays a fine temper and a nasty turn of phrase. Above all, this is a funny book, displaying a feline wit. The characters are gloriously drawn, and outrageous. A camp , damp ghost called Heliotrope, ineptly materialising and scaring itself silly, assorted talking horses and other friendly beasts, and the cool, glamorous Grimbold himself, the sleek ringmaster of this nocturnal circus, make this book a deep delight for the imaginative of all ages."},{"Title":"Grimbold's other world","review":"This book straddles many lines: it's a book that can be read to young children; it can be read by young adults making their first forays into book-length fiction; and it can be read and enjoyed by adults looking to recapture some of the magic of childhood. There is a lot of wisdom contained in its pages, far more than in most \\"adult\\" novels.At the same time, Grimbold is a very manageable read. The book is not long and stands alone -- this is no multi-volume series of 500+ page tomes. Further, it is divided into chapters that form an overall story in sequence yet stand alone as episodes, providing easy stopping points for daily/nightly reading. The vocabulary is not difficult, and the fact that paragraphs are short should make reading it less daunting than, say, a Harry Potter book, whether it's being read aloud or internally.The praise heaped on many \\"young adult\\" books today is that they're helping young adults accept and enjoy reading as a form of storytelling, alongside more visual forms like TV and movies. That's well and good, but Grimbold's Other World goes beyond that. It doesn't just tell an interesting story, it tells it well. It's a book that can help people learn to enjoy written stories as an art form -- it can help foster an appreciation of language in itself, rather than seeing it as just a medium to transmit stories. It's simply the most well-written, well-told young adult story I can remember reading: a classic of the genre that deeply needs to find its way back into print."},{"Title":"Grimbold's other world","review":"I've been a big fan of Nicholas Gray ever since I first borrowed 'Overhills to Fabulon'. I think that Grimbold's Other World was one of the most magical books I've read, and this is including Nicholas Gray's other books. I totally agree that this author should be reprinted and considering the popularity of the Harry Potter series, I can't understand why any publishing company doesn't undertake this sensible option."},{"Title":"Grimbold's other world","review":"An orphaned child, the realms of magic, dragons, wizards, and a large, talking cat... Grimbold's Other World has all the earmarks of an enduring fantasy novel appropriate for genre-lovers of all ages.When Muffler, hero of the tale, discovers his gift of speaking to animals both commonplace and magical, his adventures are just beginning - and his affiliation with Grimbold, a black cat with mystic powers, leads him into the wild lands of the &quot;Night Worlds&quot; to become the unwilling champion of a powerful wizard's son, the defender of dragons, and a word-magician in his own right. His journeys through the worlds of spells and incantation lead him on a hero's quest where the ultimate prize is one he did not seek - his own true identity, and his destiny in the world of men.It baffles me that this book ever fell out of print... the chapter involving dragons alone will have children of all ages howling in delight! I highly recommend it to fantasy fans of the old school, loving the old magics of CS Lewis and Tolkien."},{"Title":"Grimbold's other world","review":"Okay, it may not be perfect literature, but it is perfect childrens fantasy. The originality of the cats and other animals and the nightworld they know of has been unjustly neglected. You may have trouble finding the books, but read them if you do!"},{"Title":"Grimbold's other world","review":"This was my favorite book as a young reader. It's a charming and intelligent children's fantasy - an old fashioned book of fairy tales told with a light and sophisticated touch. Nicholas S. Gray created a moody, mystical atmosphere that will appeal to any imaginative child. I suspect that many of today's popular writers of fantasy owe a debt to Mr. Gray. His books are not easy to find now, but so worth reading if you do run across one."},{"Title":"Grimbold's other world","review":"Every kid should read this book. It was one of my favorites after the only copy was discarded from my library for 10 cents and I was lucky enough to grab it. This is quite a long review because I want everyone to take notice of this book immediately. If you landed on this page, BUY THIS BOOK. It has been forgotten on dusty shelves and sold are library yard sales to afford Lewis Carol too long.Muffler is a traditional foundling hero for that era of fantasy, but he's more accessible than almost any but Harry Potter. Compared to any single Potter book, I found Grimbold more rich, if, of course, much shorter, and better written. It is stimulating for young minds and fun for older ones. The adventures are classics, the characters are unforgettable and the Night World is tempting but also frightening. It contains many lessons kids into fantasy shouldn't forget, such as \\"Just like everything beautiful, it is dangerous\\", to evaluate deals well because of hidden costs/fine print, that not everyone ugly or frightening is actually bad (and likewise that not everything is as it seems), that adopted children are just as loved as biological children, that good people can do bad deeds and people deserve second chances, that friendship is incomparable valuable, that risks are sometimes necessary and that cats, even the heroes, are not trustworthy (ha ha).Beyond being a captivating fantasy, the poetry is just great. I still remember most of it because I liked it so much that I memorized it."},{"Title":"Grimbold's other world","review":"This book is great for children adults! when you read this book it will transport you into a world of magic."},{"Title":"Grimbold's other world","review":"The packaging for the book is great and the book arrived earlier than I expected.The book is as described and in a better condition than I thought. :)"},{"Title":"Grimbold's other world","review":"Out of all the books I read as a kid, (and I read alot), Grimbold's Other World remains my absolute favorite! I won't recap the wonderful story and writing that so many others have already done here, but I will say that the images \\"painted\\" by Nicholas Stewart Gray have deeply influenced my lifelong creativity and still leaves me with a sense of wonder! I continue to re-read this favorite book because I simply cannot get enough of the trees with tinkling glass leaves and shifting rainbow colors, the many fascinating creatures of the NightWorld and of Grimbold himself. Sinister as he may be, he and Muffler challenge me to keep my sense of amazement, always hoping to find a Gap into the NightWorld, catch a glimpse of a dragon baby or see my cats as the panthers they really are. Every child should read this book!"},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"This is a beautiful book. Opening the pages of the first edition from Amazon was a thrill. I first discovered \\"Ahab's Wife\\" in tatty paperback on a rainy day in a Cornish holiday cottage - I was hooked! What a brilliant idea to turn around the Moby Dick story and to tell it from this unique point of view.The superbly atmospheric woodcut illustrations reflect the imaginative, well researched and sensitive text. It is a work of art.After a lifetime of dedicated reading it was a shock to find this volume so near to the top of my list. I defy you not to love it!

After finishing it, I pondered it and pondered it for days. Don't read this expecting a happy jaunt through this woman's life. This is, after all, the bleak northeast, and just as the wind howls, so do her experiences. Nevertheless, in her ragged walk I found a source of strength for my own life.

Excellent read and highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"If you look at the book as a whole, with certain parts taken out, it was a wonderful narrative of the life of Ahab's wife. Unfortunately, the author put in segments that took the character out of the historical period and placed Ahab's wife into the 21st century. It was not so much the changing of historical times that was troubling, it was that the author did not evole those historical changes to make them always seemlessly &quot;fit in&quot;. It felt that in order to make it more interesting to a wider range of audience, she threw in some issues and developments of the 21st century. Some issues were given a short paragraph and life went on. Near the end of the book, I started guessing as to what the new development would be. (My guess was right!)If the historical add-ins were deleted or seemlessly meshed in, it would have been a better rated book. If you can get over those errors and LOVE the ocean - read it.P.S. Sometimes I like to pick up an old classic to read or re-read, and I know it won't be Moby Dick for a long time - the poor fellow!"},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"Comparing this work to Melville's is borderline sacrilege"},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"i reluctantly borrowed this book from a friend. i read the first paragraph and could not leave it alone. if i were writing this book, i would have eliminated some of the more earthy parts that made me squirm. still, i wish i wrote this book. i am glad i did not live this book.the first book i read [to the end] was beautiful joe...when i was in the 5th grade. the second book i read was catcher in the rye. this book was my third voyage. you know a book is great when you hate to see that you have nearly reached the end."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I enjoyed this spectacular novel so much I didn't want it to end. It was refreshing to read a sea adventure through the eyes of a woman! I wished it had been a thousand pages. A great book takes you completely outside of yourself, makes you forget what day it is, what time it is and all of your troubles and cares. Reading this book was as refreshing as a week long vacation."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"Moby Dick was a difficult book for me to read, but &quot;Ahab's Wife&quot; was written with so smoothly, so flowingly, that I was sorry to find an ending. I felt as if I was reading a novel written by a combination of Paul Bowles and Charles Dickens.I recently read a review of Doctorow's new book where the reviewer asked &quot;where's the novel?&quot;, meaning that the book contained symbolism and philosophy, but no story.&quot;Ahab's Wife&quot; is a novel of epic proportions with interweaving plot lines to keep the reader interested throughout, all the while being led along on this softly flowing chiffon scarf of a writing style."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"Having just finished \\"Ahab's Wife\\" I am left feeling empty and anxious. When I bought the book I had \\"high hopes\\" that it would offer a new window into the perplexing character of Captain Ahab. The book hooked me in within the first couple of chapters. But by the end I found it unbelievable, boring and sloppy writing. This book is empty because it forces Una to do to much. By the end of the book, I loathed Una because she was neither human or a distinguishable character with both virtues and vices.Anxiety rushes in when I consider another reader making the same mistake I made: reading \\"Ahab's Wife\\" with the hope that it could rival Moby Dick. Nay! Nay! Nay! \\"Moby-Dick or the Whale\\" remains as one of the best of American Literature. Why? The book's characters are real, pulsating with all that is good and evil in the human heart. \\"Ahab's Wife\\" is unreal. By the end of the book - when the risible and absurd meet together - all I could do is feel empty and axious for other readers.Dear reader, this book is way too long, too wordy and too incredulous for the time it will take you to finish it. Why not read or re-read \\"Moby-Dick\\"? I promise it will be a better investment in time and reflection."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I have re-read this book, just to be absolutely sure that it's as bad as I thought it was the first time. It's verbose, badly constructed, has poorly wrought characters, and touches on so many \\"issues\\" that it's downright cringe-producing. The main character, Una, is a self-righteous, self-described \\"liberal\\" whose ideas are so far ahead of her time that she would have probably been utterly shunned by society on every level.I am tired of novels written by women that become nothing more but excuses for feminist sermonizing and ranting. Obviously the author is unaware that cabin boys were not common on whaling vessels - add to that the utter and complete absurdity that a young woman could disguise herself and be a cabin boy on a whaling vessel, and you have the beginnings of the ridiculous situations that occur in this book. It is even mentioned that somehow Una managed not to have to use the bathroom while so disguised until everyone had bunked down for the night, at which point she would hang her hiney over the side of the boat, so not only is she a superwoman who can climb rigging and hunt whales, but she can keep from peeing for eighteen hours at a time!All the people the main character meets seem to be famous personalities, and they're all heartily impressed with her acumen, though she is uneducated and has been reared in isolated circumstances. She meets more celebrities than Oprah, just by chance. She is capable of \\"running up\\" a dress by hand (in the 1800's when dresses involved enormous amounts of material and endless handwork, often involving more than a hundred hours of work) in no time at all, and gives such dresses to friends all the time! She keeps running into the same midget wearing a wolf's skin in all kinds of unlikely places - such a small world! A runaway slave happens to appear just as Una is in childbirth in an isolated and snowbound Kentucky frontier cabin and not only delivers her child, but also suckles at her breasts (how naughty, what a daring author!) Best of all, she's been a cannibal (oh, how shocking, how Hannibal Lecter!) and has \\"married\\" three times without the benefit of clergy or the law - yet is a beloved member of the community of Nantucket Island, one of the most straightlaced places on the planet - where such a woman would have been branded an adulteress at best and might have ended up in jail at worst.The book comes off as an attempt by the author to be daring, and it's just embarrassing. The inaccuracies are legion, the absurdities are even more numerous. Worst of all are many chapters which are nothing more than the author moaning on and on about not very much under the guise of Una's brilliant thought processes.Pass this one up. Una is a truly barfsome \\"heroine\\" and her adventures are just insulting to the intelligence of anyone who has ever researched that era. If I could give it zeros stars, or a negative rating, I would."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"It has been a long time since I became this engrossed in a modern novel. It is heartbreaking at times, odd at others, but in the end I am more than glad that I took the time to read it. Jeter Naslund brings new life to Melville's characters as well as creating some unusual and, somoetimes, haunting characters all her own. In addition, she manages to insert quite a few historical characters into the narrative that will bring a smile to the faces of those familiar with the era."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I loved the author's courage and imagination in undertaking this amazing attempt to rustle up the humanity of one a major character in one of the world's (arguably) greatest classics. And I loved Una's courage, independence, and Point of View surrounding her life and the people within it. Una was carefully built from the ground up and certainly dissected, inside and out. I loved the idea of incorporating both real life human beings who lived during the time and fictional characters (someone has mentioned that she seemed Gumpish as a result - I disagree, I loved this idea). I loved the novel, at first, as a matter of fact. Oddly, for me, it fell apart when Una becomes involved with Ahab which, unfortunately is the crux of the book. Having created this world, and introduced Ahab to the book, the author then seems timid about letting the reader actually get beyond the Saturday night and Sunday morning aspects of this archetype. So, for me, it was a little boring and a bit unbelievable. I had an odd feeling of watching a human shape made entirely of words (Ahab) try to love a flesh and blood fictional character(Una). Nonetheless, there was enough meat in her other adventures so I stayed with the book until 'Sconset and the endless navel - I mean stargazing and sea musing. And what was the purpose of punishing Frannie, incidentally? How did that serve the plot? At any rate, this gargantuan novel has its charms, and vast (it is vast) sections of it are good reading. And as I've mentioned, what an epic undertaking!"},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"We selected this book for our December book club discussion. I am only on page 388, and at this point it has become just a chore to pick it up and make my way through it. All about Una all the time, in way way way too many words. For more detail on my one star rating, let me refer you to the review titled: Everyone Loves Una; Or, The Navel-Gazer: A Mary Sue. I couldn't agree more or say it better."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"What a stunning, beautiful novel. The first sentence, &quot;Ahab was neither my first husband nor my last,&quot; sets the stage for this grand novel - Una is a woman whose stories are vibrant, impressive, and overwhelming to imagine. At a staggering 650+ pages, this masterpiece is worth every single page because you will savor every story, every trip, every character, every adventure, and every love, and you will put it down wishing for more. Naslund has plucked Una (Captain Ahab's wife) from her honorable mention in Melville's &quot;Moby Dick&quot;, and woven a deeply satisfying portrait of a young girl who leaves her home in the hills of Kentucky because her god-fearing father cannot abide by her (her mother actually realizes that the child may be in danger because she cannot bring herself to believe what her father does so fervently), and travels to a small Island in (we assume) Long Island sound, not far from Nantucket to be raised by her aunt and uncle, a lighthouse keeper.Una goes to sea on a whaling vessel at 16 disguised as a boy, she suffers a shipwreck and an experience that drives her male companions to madness. Much of what happens to Una and her response to those experiences are such a pleasure to read, Naslund's prose is easy and her story captivating - the reader may find him/herself learning things (s)he never realized about his/her own country's history. I must resist telling all that happens although even if the reader knows, (s)he will look forward to being carried away on the wings of this novel. Someone else wrote and I agree, if you only buy one novel this year, I strongly suggest it is this one."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"Like one of the other reviewers, this novel set me off onto a personal Melville seminar. After reading Ahab's Wife, I read The Heart of the Sea, a Melville biography, and am now only a few chapters from the end of Moby-Dick. I loved Wife, because it does what all good fiction in general, and historical fiction in particular, must do, which is transport the reader to another place, another time, another frame of mind. The scenes at sea, the years at the lighthouse, the time Una spent with Ahab, were all magical, and made me wish I'd read this author earlier. And don't worry about the length of the book. So it's long, so what? It needs to be to tell this story. Yes, it takes its time, but it must do so if it is to successfully recreate the setting and time-period. If you want short, snappy books, read a formula murder mystery. One quibble, however: Naslund does what all female authors do when writing historical fiction, which is give her heroine an anachronistic 20th century sensibility which allows her to be the daring one, the only one not bound by the conventions of the historical period the author tries so hard otherwise to recreate. If you're going to write historical fiction, shouldn't ALL the characters be presented as accurately as possible, not just the chauvinistic men?"},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I was hooked from the minute I started this book--and I was compelled to read the hardcover on the subway, without a seat (very tiresome!).I agree that some of the plot is hard to believe--I initially had some trouble figuring out from what time period Una was from--but I loved the lyrical feeling to the prose. I thought the insights were very 20 (21st?) century, but I was still very fascinated by them, and I found myself trying to slow my eyes down as I read, so that I could accurately absorb all that there was to offer.As a conclution, I would like to reread Ahab's Wife, I think there is still some to gain that I failed to the first time, but I don't think I will read Moby Dick. At least not in the near future.I would not be surprised, though, to hear that in some college somewhere, Ahab's Wife and Moby Dick are taught as companion novels. Ahab's Wife is certainly worth at least one read!"},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"&quot;I want to eat the language.&quot; I replied, 'and feel it with my fingers.&quot; So said Una, about Keats. And so say I about Sena Jeter Raslund's banquet of words and ideas. Her rich, juicy prose brings to life not only her characters, but the period and places in which they lived.At once, we have the inner life of a girl, grown to woman, and a sweeping, violent story of the sea. We meet characters who lived, and some created. All seem real. We live with Una in a cabin in the wilds of Kentucky, a lighthouse isolated from land, and an elegant town home in Nantucket.Naslund, as well as Una, loves the language, searching for the one word to express what she means. In doing so, Naslund brings Una to us: ripe, vivid, and eloquent. Naslund lets us know Una, and those who surround her. The mad Kit, the escaping slave Susan, Robben the wood carver, and her beloved friend the Judge. We know Maria Mitchell and her obsession with finding a comet, Uncle Torchy and Aunt Agatha, and perhaps, surprisingly, Captain Ahab himself. We know the sea and stars and the grains of sand at 'Sconset. Before all, we know Una, a woman unafraid of herself and her feelings, who follows dreams and faces consequences.And if we are fortunate, we leave Una, knowing just a bit more about ourselves."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"Una is a classic hero in the sense that she is everyman, universally processing the larger themes of humanity within her circumstances. the details are richly told, et it would be easy to lose oneself in the superficial tale of a woman from another time et another place. But that would be missing the forest for all of the trees. Read this slowly if you need to, but do digest. Reading this book is your own journey, not a life-altering new age pseudo-experience, but that rare art of self-examination et enjoyment."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I'm not exaggerating...when I think of my \\"favorite\\" books, this one tops the list. Naslund is a wonderful writer and a pleasure to read! More than that, though, she is a masterful story teller, weaving in so many aspects of history and historical figures to keep it all interesting and evolving a rich, complex character with so many layers and such a complicated past. As I neared the final chapters, I began reading more slowly, so as to drag out the ending of the book. I was truly disappointed when the book ended--because I was no longer able to spend time with my favorite book character and my evenings would no longer spent in this wonderful, historical and fictional world Naslund created. There aren't many books that I hold on to when I'm done as I believe in passing them along to be enjoyed by others, but this one will follow me even through many downizings and moves...and I will read it again."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"A spectacularly well-written novel by someone who understands Melville thoroughly. Young woman from the backwoods of Kentucky ends up on an island with a lighthouse and disguises herself as a boy to go to sea on a whaler. 19thC New England is seen through a woman's eyes as she lives through varieties of religious experience, abolitionism, 19thC intellectuals, life on several frontiers and becomes (no surprise) Ahab's wife. A long and slow read, but worth every minute of it. The end is wrapped up in a manner befitting a student of Melville's."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"Though it was a national bestseller, I had never heard of this book or its author before coming across it at yet another of my used book sales. It won many awards so I threw it in my $5-a-brown-bag. I usually assume awards are a clear sign of good literature and this premise yet again did not fail me.Rather lengthy and at times verbose, I began reading Naslund's novel wondering if I would be able to finish. But, I quickly became engrossed and deeply committed to her main character, Una. She is married to Captain Ahab during his whaling escapades in Moby Dick, but you need not have read that tomb to appreciate this one. This story carries Una through her full and charming life, both at sea and comfortably settled on shore.Allow Una the time to you her story."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I enjoyed the first half of this story which is, as the title suggests, literally about the woman who eventually becomes the wife of the great fictional Captain Ahab. Surprisingly, he doesn't actually show up until quite late in the story. In the meantime, the author chronicles a young woman's life in the early eighteen hundreds. Ms. Naslund does a good job of fleshing out her characters and paints the stark New England landscape they call home with an artful hand. Half-way through the novel however, she begins to repeat herself. Since the story had a naturally slow-moving pace, redundant descriptions of sky, ocean, the lighthouse and a certain goat, as well as fits of random madness in one of her characters, caused me to read through ahead of the rest of my book club and create a set of Cliff Notes so the other ladies could skip directly to the pages that contained plot progression.Readers who hold themselves to a strict coda of finishing any book they start right to the last word are in for quite a chewy assignment. This would have been a lovely period piece if it had been cut by about one hundred pages!"},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"This is one of the best books I've read in a long time. The pictures it conjures up are beautiful and full. She is a master at what she does...at least with this book. I haven't read anything else of hers but plan on doing so soon!"},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"My book club read this book after hearing good thing about it and we were sorely disappointed. The prose is overwrought. The character of Una is far too good to be believed, and the events of her life are like a fairy tale -- for example, she marries Captain Ahab and all of a sudden she is incredibly rich! How convenient! She bumps into Margaret Fuller in Boston and Margaret Fuller instantly recognizes what a special person Una is and invites her to Fuller's salon! Puh-leese. The author places this novel in the early 19th century but her heroine has incredibly progressive ideas on race relations, feminism, marriage, sex and homosexuality that are simply implausible. Plus she makes surprisingly good investments! The constant parade of notable 19th century personages is tiresome as are the author's constant literary allusions. She appears to be showing off her erudition at the expense of her character's believability and the reader's patience. And the length of the book is wholly unnecessary. I recommend that you spare yourself this pseudo-feminist self-indulgent tripe and read a good biography of Maria Mitchell, the real-life Nantucket astronomer who Una befriends in the book. Your time will be far better spent."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"As a student of women's history this book was a true disappointment. I looked forward to a story about a whaling wife, a sailor,and even a lighthouse keeper, but what I found was a one dismal main character. The author has seen fit to send her character, Una, through her life with a focus on herself. Una is not a transcendentalist like Maragret Fuller, but a shellfish woman who never marries any of her men (including Ahab), betrays friends and family, but never seems to be shuned by the 19th century Quaker society. The book is more of a fantasy than something that &quot;could of happened&quot; in Nantucket. The author's use of real historical figures is appalling. She writes that Frederick Douglas was captured by a bounty hunter, but then freed. Of course, this never happened and the idea of perpetuating inaccurate history is deplorable coming from a college professor. The author also has seemed to borrow a variety of writing styles from the period, first and formost Melville's own style and book layout. In conclusion, I have given this book to many different people to read and only one could complete the volume. The rest felt is was too horrible to get past page 50!!"},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"Una has a long interesting life, some of which involves being Ahab's wife, which makes for a novel that, despite its length, I wanted more of. Who did not wonder what life had in store for Una and her third &quot;husband&quot;? The novel is flawed--too preachy (ills of slavery, religion, antifeminism, homosexuality), too flowery (the initial verse on her pregnacy loss almost lost me too), too obsessed with &quot;famous folk of the time&quot; (Emerson et al)--but she was so interesting and the novel so full of detail about whaling life in the 1800's, that I was disappointed when it ended on the cusp of her new &quot;marriage&quot;.This novel is not a true work of literature, but I did find it truly enjoying. It is not Moby Dick, but I did find this &quot;account&quot; of Ahab's wife moving and provoking.I thought it was truly an enjoyable read, despite its flaws..and I cannot say that for many novels. I look forward to the author writing again with less preaching and more focusing for a truly wonderful novel."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"It is rare that one reads a book that is so beautifully written and captivating at the same time. I will admit that I have read with a bit of built-in prejudice, for Sena Jeter and I were classmates in the early sixties at Birmingham-Southern College and were the best of friends. To say that I am proud of her accomplishments and achievements would be a gross understatement. But even if I had never heard of Ms. Naslund before reading this book, my opinion would have been the same. The literary references, the various descriptive passages, the action sequences all echo with poetry and poetry of the highest kind. It is a long book and one that needs to be savored rather than read quickly; so it was at least a two-week read for me. But I treasured every minute of it and I would recommend it highly to anyone who enjoys reading truly fine literature."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"Ahab's Wife will have you sad, chuckling, charmed, and very irritated. You can expect to experience all this at the beginning, which is actually the middle, of this marvelous, rediculous novel.The story begins with Una in the throes of a horrifying labor. She is alone and perplexed as to why her mother has not returned with the doctor and so engages in flights of fancy when she is not sleeping. I assumed she had grown slightly deranged from her ordeal but, no, Una is just enjoying a child-like mystic contemplation, as she does throughout the novel, and you come to understand Una is simply shallow. Though author Naslund attempts to give Una depth, Naslund waffles between pathos and silliness, often ending with the rediculous, as when Una is divorced by Ahab and married to Ahab- by Ahab- within a moment- and is accepted by an entire town as married.Naslund seems to have difficulty deciding whether she is writing a significant historical novel, a seedy True Romance, or fantasy. Once Una finally starts at her story's &quot;beginning&quot; you find yourself delighted with the character and her adopted family on their little island. The writing was so beautiful my toes curled with the rich imagery. Then Una does an abrupt personality change, chops her hair, and goes to sea as a boy - and the fantasy begins! Una skips from one preposterous scenario to another so fast your head spins, with Naslund working overtime to explain how she gets away with it all, while characters we have come to adore and admire are either literally or figuratively tossed into the ocean. Like Indiana Jones, Una always lands on her feet, alone, but never for long.Ahab's Wife is at it's best when,through Una eyes, we are given the opportunity to &quot;see&quot; so much of all that surrounds us in a new light. As an artist I relished the manner in which author Naslund sparked my imagination, The novel is also full of intelligent bits that are charming, from golden byssus to Augustin Fresnel to Maria Mitchell. It's great fun but, like Una, shallow."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"While many have already commented on this book, I felt compelled to add my thoughts. I didn't expect to like this novel when suggested for my book group. But then I began and was immediately hooked. I did briefly get bogged down but once passed it realized that this reflected life- sometimes it is a bit boring and monotonous. Then I was completely engaged and read nearly 400 pages in three days while caring for 3 children under age 6 round the clock!Yes, this novel does have some seemingly amazing instances of meeting/interacting with 'celebrities' but I enjoyed these, didn't find them highly unlikely in this area of country and also helpful for readers to place the time and issues better.To those who seem to disbelieve that Una could be so educated without having been 'formally schooled' I am surprised. Home schooling was the prominent education for many in those days, especially women. Why, many of our Presidents and other notable minds in the United States were homeschooled. Her mother and aunt were clearly raised on literature as they then educated Una.I enjoyed this book very much and recommend it to all."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"This author compliments Melville with her expansion of a minor character in one of America's great pieces of literature. Re-reading MOBY DICK takes on new meaning because the reader has retrospectively experienced a broad and deep view of the lives of Melville's characters.Set in the simplicity and vibrancy of Kentucky and Massachusetts, AHAB'S WIFE creates vivid, powerful scenes of a woman's journey through life's troubled waters, peaceful vistas, bitter isolation, family strife, religious doubts, physical hardships, heartfelt friendships, intellectual wonderment, broken hearts and mended spirits. Love of life prevails in this novel which inspires the reader to greater levels of strength, endurance, hope and, finally, to the peace and harmony gained through trust in a loving heart.Having lived in both Kentucky and Massachusetts, I feel as though Una's spirit touches not only my heart, but where I live and my understanding of those who have lived the history about which Sena Jeter Naslund so beautifully and accurately writes. This southern writer has an enduring Yankee spirit."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"\\"Captain Ahab was neither my first husband nor will he be my last.\\" With this sentence, Sena Jeter Naslund opens one of the most engrossing stories I have read in a long time. There is only a brief reference to Mrs. Ahab in the book Moby Dick but from this, Ms Naslund has built a complete history for a very unusual woman.Set in the mid 1800s, Una's story is that of a young woman raised in a liberal setting during a time of constrictive social mores. At the age of 12, she is sent to live with her aunt and uncle to escape her father's religious zealousness which demands acceptance of a faith she detests. She spends the next few years on an island helping her relatives maintain a light house.As she matures, she grows more and more obsessed by the sea . On a whim, she dresses as a man and follows two of her friends, Giles and Kit, onto a whaling ship where she serves as a cabin boy. After the ship wrecks , they are marooned for several weeks in a lifeboat and the three of them are the sole survivors. The events surrounding their survival are tragic and inescapable.They are taken onto the Pequod by Captain Ahab and Una marries Kit. This marriage is short lived and she then marries Captain Ahab whom she deeply loves. The background for Moby Dick is set and the story of the women left behind begins. The months and years of living independently teaches them to be resilient and resourceful. They are dependent on one another for almost everything and so are kind and considerate.Ms Naslund's paragraphs are beautifully constructed. Each sentence is as separate and yet complete as a string of beautiful pearls. She touches on the social problems of that era--from slavery to women's right to vote to homosexuality. However she really shines when she is sharing the day-to-day life of a time and place that no longer exists. \\"Life is what happens while we're waiting for something to happen\\" and this author excels in the telling of the mundane details of life."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I'll sound like a parrot here - repeating what's been said in other reviews. This book was near perfect in the first half, and then starts drowning in its own melodrama. Good god, how many people can die in 300 pages?! This book needed serious editing in the second half. Still, VERY beautifully written.However, here's the new part I want to add: If you enjoyed the subject matter, now turn to &quot;The Heart of the Sea&quot; - it's the true story of the sinking of the whaleship Essex, and it must be from the Essex that Naslund borrowed her Sussex (the ship Una went on.) It gives a marvelous (though gruesome) depiction of that event, and dovetails nicely with &quot;Ahab's Wife&quot;, confirming Naslund's details. Next, I'm on to Moby Dick to complete the trilogy..."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I haven't been this captivated by a story since reading Thomas Hardy in high school. Una Spenser is a true heroine and this parallel telling of the mighty tale of the great white whale is destined to become a companion classic next to Melville's. The writing is both real and dreamlike as the story weaves it's spell. The almost 700 pages turn easily and you feel as if this must be a true telling of history. It is a literary masterpiece and I am so much richer for having read it!"},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"This is not a book I would ever have chosen for myself. My book group is reading it for the October meeting. I found it too far fetched...i.e. she met every prominent character of the time and had too many unbelievable adventures. I think the author tried to include and comment on too many social issues in one book. It was way too long in that I had to force myself to read the last 200 pages so that I would finish it for the book club. It's not even a story that I would have finished to find out what happened if I weren't reading it for a reason!"},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"By the time I was nearing the end of Ahab's wife, I felt compelled to finish, even if it meant staying up all night or catching tears in an iced caramel macchiato.So like life, Ahab's Wife has moments of tediousness, moments of incredulity and moments of intense emotion. It is an artist who can weave these together to form a story so amazing that you must believe it, a heroine so resilient, honest and strong that you're compelled to identify with her and be inspired. Sena Jeter Naslund is gifted, and I am honored that this book was passed to me by friends, just as I am honored to pass it on to more friends.Take a few moments to read this glorious book."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I would highly recommend this novel. Jeter Naslund's prose is almost lyrical. While the book took a couple of chapters to really get into, once you're into it, it's very hard to put down. The shipwreck segment, and all that flows from it is especially powerful. I did feel that the incidents of Una interacting with famous people of the time period seemed a little contrived, however this does not take a lot away from the book's merits."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I am not sure why I so differ from so many of your other reviewers! I would not even have given it one star, had that been an option. It is tedious, WAY too long, and in my judgment an insult to Melville's giant book and characters. To me, it appeared to be the author's opportunity to celebrate her own brilliance: so much irrelevant information; so little character development; in fact, so little character. Unfortunately, Naslund chose to abandon the few interesting characters she did manage to develop and left their lives or deaths to the reader to resolve. There are so many wonderful books written about the period in which Una lived, I feel cheated for having stuggled through this trite and far too long novel."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I am, at this point, two thirds of the way through this incredible journey - I am a 47 year old lover of books and believe that any woman - or man - who does not relish and savor this journey needs to do some of their own living! Every sentence is magical in it's definition - there is so much to be felt in this novel. If ever there was a girl/woman who managed to step so much out of the comfort zone of her time...Oh how I wish to partake in her journey. I have many times...still not enough - stepped away from my safe zone - the hardest steps I have taken! But the rewards have been as magical as Una's! It can happen and it will happen to you if you are fortunate enough to devour this novel and feel it as beautifully as it has been written.Sena Jeter Naslund is a brilliant woman whom if I ever have the pleasure of meeting will be comparable to the meeting between Una and Margaret Fuller - without these women and their guts and brains the rest of us would still be knitting and cooking without a choice! Once \\"bound with invisible chains\\" women can now choose to cook, clean, manage and run the world if they choose - this is the power of Una - \\"Let them be sea captains!\\"This is my first ever review yet I read a great deal and select many of the books from other reviewers on Amazon.comI think it is a sad person who cannot relate to this character! To not walk away with more strength, resolve and intelligence than before reading it seem impossible to me.Please take the time to both be educated and happier for reading this novel."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"My God. After 300 pages, I realized that not one good thing had happened to anyone in the book. Suicide, cannibalism, miscarriages, madness, just to name a few. The author has a whimsically intense way of writing; at times she manages to capture a quaint voice of yesteryear. But the main character is not convincing and her motivation for her aberrant acts is fuzzy. I finally gave up. The book certainly did a fine job of convincing one not to go whaling- but continuing on would have just been an exercise in endurance."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"This is probably the most well-written book I've ever read. The story itself is compelling, but the language and style of the writing is what impressed me the most. Naslund delves so deeply into the psyche of her main character that I don't know how anyone can fail to see a part of him/herself in Una. This book will appeal to the contemplative, a quick read it is not. Take time and savor this one..."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I read this historical novel when it was first published 10 years ago and enjoyed it very much. The book is a spinoff of Melville's \\"Moby Dick\\" which briefly referred to Captain Ahab's wife in a few spots. From those brief mentions, Naslund weaves a great story in which she imagines what the life of Mrs. Ahab might have been like back home in the whaling town of Nantucket. Naslund writes very well and tells a very interesting story of a fascinating woman who challenges the gender stereotypes of the mid 19th century. While some readers might find the notion of a feminist in this period anachronistic, there actually was a feminist movement in America at this time that argued for a greater role of women in religion, social issues, and education. So, it is not anachronistic at all. In fact the feminist movement had its birth at Seneca Falls in upstate New York. If there could be feminists there, then why not in Nantucket?In addition to being well written and entertaining, the book has been supplemented with illustrations to make it appear as if it had been published during the 19th century when illustrations in novels were much more common than today."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"Had this book been a wedge of homemade chocolate cake, it would have been made with the finest dark chocolate, with hints of berries and butter ... rich, complex and tempting one to utter decadence.I stopped doing laundry and cooking for three days to read this - and what a glorious read it was! Interwoven with historical references, it's an interesting study on the \\"other half\\" of Captain Ahab, and the passion in his life before Moby Dick.I loved it. Every minute, every word ... I loved it."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I love the idea of rewriting Melville's _Moby-Dick_ from a woman's perspective, the more so as Melville, though the greatest American novelist ever, was writing almost entirely about a world of men. I liked Sena Naslund's book less than its underlying idea, however (and so did most of the 9 students I read it with); sharply intelligent in places, imaginative, but also sentimental, unnecessarily and willfully complicated, over-broad in reach, and at points ludicrous."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"Interesting, but far, far too long. It would have been greatly improved if it was cut by 1/3. I was put off sometimes by the &#34;old english&#34; that was spoken by the charactersJack Bryan"},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"Ahab's wife is a great book, especially for the readers who enjoyed Moby Dick. It's written in an original style, depicting the life of an ambitious women in the 18th century who dares to break the rules and traditions and think freely. Makes a great read, especially if you like long stories."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"a takeoff on moby dick. uses characters from the original to good avail. weird, unlikely backstory, with the usual fiction approach to history, which is that is covers too much territory, and too many unlikely things occur."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I am awed by this book. It is so skillfully and beautifully written that thoughts, nature, and people come to life for me. I loved her philosophical ramblings and her exquisite descriptions of nature. More about thoughts and impressions than character development the time and place are the vivid story tellers. I could feel myself sailing before the wind, trudging through the snow, exalting at the top of the lighthouse and sparrows nest, and seeking warmth and comfort in old wood cabins. I appreciate the thread of women's history that ties it all together. I tell everyone who will listen they should read this book. Her ending defines the epitome of historical writing for me: \\"like my own wind-flung confetti - words streaming from my hand. Each day and forever, by the ticking of the mantel clock and by the dark wheeling of the cosmos, we have given time a home.\\" BRAVO"},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I was a \\"star-gazer,\\" myself; I gazed at the blank stars provided for rating, unable to decide whether to give this book one or two of 'em. In the end, I felt that the sheer power of Naslund's prose, her obvious talent, merited an extra one. Had I rated the novel solely on my level of interest and enjoyment, I'd have given one (or less, were that an option).Una is one of the most humorless, unlikeable heroines in the history of fiction, surpassed only by Fanny Price in Jane Austen's *Mansfield Park* and little Rhoda Penmark in William March's *The Bad Seed*! Throughout the entire book, I felt increasing sympathy for her cardboard mean-old-daddy, straight from Central Casting (I envisaged a young Rod Steiger) who just hauled off and whacked her good. I'm no advocate of hitting people, but wow, did I ever want to slap Una myself, many times, as I yawned my way through this book!The danger, when employing a first-person narrative, is that the author is tempted to make the character too perfect, too reasoned, too---too---omniscient to be believable. The first-person POV works brilliantly when the character's \\"warts\\" show: viz: Huck Finn...Holden Caulfield...the narrators of Olive Ann Burns' *Cold Sassy Tree* and Clyde Egerton's *Raney* come to mind, as well. Nick Hornby, in almost all his works, does a dandy job of this, too.Other reviewers have taken umbrage at the relentless assault on Christianity. That didn't bother me at all---in fact, even though I am a Catholic, I found the doubting/rejection of orthodoxy to be one of the only remotely interesting aspects of the story.No, the only \\"faith\\" *Ahab's Wife* made me question was my faith (never very strong, alas) in the modern publishing industry. Apparently they will send anything to press if it stands any chance of being fawned over by mid-range-intellect ladies' book clubs."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"First, let me disclose that I'm a fan of any book that involves the ocean. The fact that this story revolves around the ocean - and the life changes it brings - is a huge plus. As for the book...it was wordy but wonderful. I've used it as \\"my\\" book selection for two different book clubs, and highly recommend it to anyone when I'm asked my favorite book."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"Basically, there is no reason to not like this book.Una, the main character is literally every woman. She's who you are, who you're afraid of being, and who you'd like to be someday. The reader goes through so much with Una; the death of a baby, leaving home after a personal disaster, and making a family of unique and likable friends.The writer is so eloquent, and the words she strings together are jarringly beautiful. She is writing a classic into the modern age.Moreover, her Una, Ahab, Margaret Fuller, and Frederick Douglass are interesting and attainable. They go through the full range of human emotions. They break and make conventions. It's this- the struggle of when and where or ever to conform that make this book a true piece of art."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"The title \\"Ahab's Wife\\" intrigued me enough to read it and I did enjoy it, but at times was confused with the author's flashbacks because in the first third of the book I could not be sure about whom she was speaking. I like to read my books at night before sleep and so can become confused if a book is not well put together on its flashbacks. I enjoyed the characters in the book, but became bored at times with the long descriptions as I did not find them particularly pertinent to the story. But I still would recommend this book to anyone who can read a novel of this length. For me, the last third of the book made the first third much clearer. Since this book, I have read Adam and Eve by Ms. Naslund and was most disappointed because it did not measure up to this one."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"This book was the equivalent of a dish I would not be able to stop eating! The writing is lush and descriptive and the story moves along so quickly that it's hard not to justify one more chapter before bed or before you end your lunch hour at work. when I finally finished this book I remembered my next door neighbor's summary of life, \\"You can't go through life without acquiring a bag of rocks.\\" In Una's case, it's how skillfully she manages to carry her bag."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"Captain Ahab is one of literature's most enigmatic characters. I found him captivating and he is, shall we say, man enough to inspire another book. Naslund, the author of Ahab's Wife read the few lines in Moby Dick that mention Ahab's wife and son and imagined what kind of woman would marry and be loved by Captain Ahab (his love for her exists even at the height of his insanity).The resulting novel is fabulous. I enjoyed it more than most books I've read recently. The character of Una is strong, intelligent, and witty. She is unhampered by the time's constraints of women and creates her own adventures. She survives life's tragedies through her own mental strength and desire. She is a perfect match for Captain Ahab.The novel is well researched and peopled with interesting characters both fictional and real. Una befriends transcendentalist Margaret Fuller and astronomer Maria Mitchell, real Nantucket and Boston women of learning. She is also present when former slave and author Frederick Douglass speaks in Nantucket and excites the abolitionist movement. Naslund accurately and beautifully depicts the early nineteenth century whaling experience, the settings of Nantucket and Kentucky and even the political, religious, and philosophical atmosphere.Most impressively, Naslund seamlessly weaves the story of Moby Dick into her own much newer work. It fits so well, that one might actually be convinced that Naslund and Melville wrote their manuscripts side by side.Quite simply, I loved Ahab's Wife. It is exactly what I expect from a novel."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"This is an excellent read and a thought-provoking story. Unfortunately, the author was not content to recreate a specific place and time in history, but added (an albeit clever) overlay of comtemporary values and issues. The story wraps up rather too quickly and glibly with the main characters &quot;finding themselves&quot; in distinctly 21st century ways. The first half of the book was wonderful, the second half less so. I was inspired to read Melville's Moby Dick after reading this, and am glad I did. If you want to learn about 18th century whaling and ponder questions of fate, divinity and madness, read Moby Dick as well."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"Whoever dubbed this book a &quot;masterpiece&quot; was right on target. I read it a month ago and find myself longing to return to Nantucket. One can almost hear the ships' bells. The author uses 19th century language, but, unlike Melville, makes it readable. The story of Una's adventures is both creative and fascinating.This book will not bog the reader down with unnecessary details of sperm whaling as MOBY DICK does.Just as THE MISTS OF AVALON was the Camelot legend told from the woman's point of view, so is this the story of whalers in the 19th century told from the woman's point of view.The interweaving of characters from MOBY DICK is beautifully done. Ahab becomes human, not simply the crazed, obsessed captain of the Pequod. A wonderful fantasy trip to the past for the reader."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"Una Spenser, widow of Captain Ahab, reflects back on her life. When Una was a child in Kentucky, her mother worried about her safety from the righteous retribution of her religious spouse against any real or imaginary transgression. To protect Una, she sends her daughter to live with relatives at a New England lighthouse. At her new home, Una learned to love the sea and even dressed as a young lad to join an ocean voyage.Though much younger than her husband, Una loved Ahab. However, her love for the Captain failed to deter him from his cause of destruction with the \\"evil\\" Moby Dick. After Ahab's death, Una finds solace in the Northeast intellectual community fighting to end slavery. Una is a willing player as she daringly rescues an escaped slave. Though her life has been filled with harshness, Una cherishes her only living child and actually finds renewed happiness with Ishmael.In the past couple of decades, authors and playwrights have written novels and plays centering on a minor character from a classic. Many add to the original tale by staying true to its characterization, content and style, but most fail because of the writer using too much literary license that contradicts the first story. Sena Jeter Naslund succeeds in her fictional autobiography based on a minor segment in Herman Melville's Moby Dick that refers to Ahab's spouse. The story line is a superb stand alone homage to Mr. Melville as well as a salute to the intrepid seafaring nineteenth century women. However, what makes the book a phenomenal companion to the original classic is that the characters borrowed from Moby Dick retain Mr. Melville's descriptions while starring in a fresh plot.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and found the time in my hectic schedule to plow through it. As with SP Somtow's &quot;The Shattered Horse&quot;, I find it intriguing that such an elaborte, well-designed and interesting story can be based only on a single line of prose from another literary work."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I have to say that when this book was recommended to me, I was a bit skeptical, as I had read Moby Dick, and didn't think anything could come up to the same standard. I even put it down after the first few chapters. I was then prompted to keep reading....I did and I wasn't sorry. It was fast moving with the plot ever changing. The characters were very interesting. The story was very believable as seen through the eye's of Una, the protagonist. I was saddened when I finished, and have pondered about the story and the characters ever since; a sure sign sign of a well written story."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"Barbara Kingsolver's Poisonwood Bible, in that the books start out beautifully. The first half to two-thirds are well thought out and written, but in the end the author trails on and on and can't seem to wrap it up? What's the problem with a sad ending. We're grown-ups, we can deal with a novel that doesn't end with Happily Ever After. Authors, rather than boring us to death, have some guts and just end the damn book."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"This book demands to be read slowly, to be savored. The main character, Una, is Ahab's perfect match--a strong, intelligent, independent woman capable of love, but not bound by the shackles of feminine servitude. Una engages in life with the same intensity as Ahab's obsession with Moby Dick. I believe this book will become part of the canon. The text enthralls with its rich, sensual, learned and luxurious language. The plot kept me riveted. Naslund has created a masterpiece--a must read! Bravo!"},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I loved the story of Una, who ultimately marries Ahab, but that is such a small portion of her life's journey, which is amazingly told in this delightful story. Una's experiences -- her childhood, her courageous sea adventure, her joy at experiencing the freedom and then her ultimate sadness and loss at sea, her emotional and educational growth and awakening, her love for Ahab and their kindred spirit and understanding of what the sea meant to both of them, her son, her friends and extended family (Susan, David, the Judge, et al); make for a truly amazing story. I thoroughly enjoyed the telling of this tale and highly recommend it to readers. Loved it."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"Great cover, enticing premise. I couldn't wait to read this book...BUT... Every one-star review before mine lays my feelings out perfectly. Let me add a couple more. Frannie grows up, decides to live with a man and writes home to tell her mother what she's going to do. What does her mother say? That's nice, dear. I trust you to make the right decision. Oh please!!! This is the 19th century after all! Then for good measure let's throw this one into the mix. After the indomitable Una shows understanding and makes decisions that earn her the admiration and accolades of every living person, famous or not, that she comes into contact with...she decides to buy into an oil well to help a friend even though everyone agrees that this is throwing money down the rat hole. An oil well! You must be kidding! Of course, she eventually recoups her money plus a bunch.I could go on and on.

When the author puts Una as saying...\\"my father ... my name\\", then I know for sure how pretentious this book really is.The author tries to create her book in the style of Melville..and it fails.. only the gorgeous engraved illustrations(reminding me of Rockwell Kent's illustrations in a earlier version of Moby Dick) are stunning..Certainly not the characters or the heart of this book..I'm going to put it down.. unless someone can convince me otherwise......."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I'm confused. Has the mark of good fiction now become brevity? I didn't find a single word in this glorious book wasted. If anything, I was sorry that the book ended when it did, as I would have willingly continued to follow Una's adventures. What an amazing character! Women in the nineteenth century lived fascinating lives, but since &quot;social&quot; history did not come into vogue until the 20th century, we are only now beginning to know about the lives of women. Novelists, drawing on the knowledge that we do have, are filling in the gaps to create fully fleshed-out characters such as Una.If you're looking for a quick read, best look elsewhere. If you love rich language, love strong female characters, love tales of the sea, then read this book. Ms. Naslund is to be congratulated for creating a truly memorable character and for allowing such a character to experience a full banquet of life experiences.Brava!"},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"Author Naslund takes up the tale of the young wife Ahab mentions but briefly in Moby Dick. It takes place during and after the loss of the Pequod during its fatal hunt for the great White Whale and is the first-person memoir of Una Spenser.This book is so literary, so well crafted for its subject that I can't believe it was written in 1999 and not in the late 1800's. Only a few anachronisms betray the modern date for Ahab's Wife. (A mention of kiwi fruit for one, they were not cultivated outside of China nor known as Kiwi until the early 1900's)Una Spenser (named for Spenser's character in the Faerie Queene) is a courageous yet imaginative heroine. She struggles against God, against slavery, against traditional women's' roles in pre-Civil War America, runs away to sea, and meets Captain Ahab after a harrowing experience aboard ship.The scope of this book is grand and it is written a bit in style that pays homage to Melville, grasping some of Melville's poetry and symbology of Nature and also the sexual ambiguity. But Naslund also stitches in a bit of Virginia Woolf and To The Lighthouse. Sections of Melville's work are patched in to form a smooth story of Ahab's soul mate, his female side, Una, whom he loved and abandoned for his destiny with Moby Dick.In fact, this book reminds me of the patchwork quilts mentioned many times in Ahab's Wife. The pieces are stitched together (12 stitches to the inch, Una can sew) in colors that blend to make a pleasing whole. Yet pieces of fabric come from many diverse sources, such as the Melville classic and Woolf as well as others.This is a brilliant achievement of a novel yet reads like a magnificent yarn. Naslund is not only a master writer but also a master storyteller. I could not put this book down until I finished every last page and I am going to re-read it immediately."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I finally made it through Ahab's Wife because I was determined to finish it. I, and not just Una, was on a journey. I was searching for a point. I found the first 200 pages very gripping but the rest of the book lost my interest because it was not the telling of one story but of many different story threads and themes, that unfortunately, never get sewn together into a beautiful Kentucky quilt. I'm not sorry I read it but Una telling her life story was not enough to captivate me through 600 pages of various side plots that ring hollow with moral righteousness.The story became far too absurd and yet took itself too seriously to revel in the absurdity. It reminded me a lot of the movie Forest Gump but at least Forest Gump appeared to have some self-awareness of how ridiculous all of the coincidences and star cameos where and by that awareness made them entertaining. The smorgasbord of famous literary figures, artists, renowned abolitionists, scientists, madmen, dwarfs, slaves, suffragists, sea captains and gays drown the story with the ridiculous. The story would have been better served with fewer exoticized characters that were more developed. The most interesting characters die off or fade from the story far too early.My sister and I used to read a lot of romance novels and joke back and forth about the various carriage accidents, sudden deaths, and tragedies that would befall the poor main characters. This book was filled with so many and such varied calamities that I felt there was a great burden put on the character Una. She was just one woman, but she was forced to represent all woman who might possibly have lived in this time period and to suffer all of their losses and rejoice in all of their successes.The book had some great moments and some beautifully written lines but in the end I felt like it was simply too many under-realized characters and story lines that rambled on for too long. I would give the first 200 pages of the book 4 stars and the rest of the book just 2 stars. Once you read every word of Ahab's Wife you become numb to how much you enjoyed the first leg of the journey, so my final rating for the entire book is 2 stars."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"Ahab's Wife suffers from being perhaps a little too long. I had to struggle to finish the final quater of the book because it seems to lack a certain dramatic impact, especially when compared to the rest of the book. However, in general, this novel is still a fabulous read. I found it epic in scope and extremely poignant. I loved Naslund's initial premise - placing a woman with 20th century morality and &quot;modern&quot; fears, desires, loathings and hopes in the middle of the 19th century just as the age of industrialisation was dawning. We are witness to not only Una's incredible adventures but also her uncanny ability to rise above the social restrictions of the day and develop a wonderfully liberal, tolerant and free thinking attitude towards life. The novel reads like an ocean going sailing ship, swaying and flowing gacefully across the sea. And the cast of characters are truly eclectic: From intelligence and sexual ambiguity of Una's fellow sailors Giles and Kit to the staunchly seaman like Captain Ahab. Naslund introduces to many memorable people. Naslund also raises some delightfully &quot;modern&quot; issues: Cannibalism, the nature of sexuality, single parenthood, feminism and the state of the man and his psyche in a time when the individual was becoming increasingly aware of his position in the universe.Although the length is an issue this is still a fine novel which certainly packs a wallop and it surely begs a sequel.Michael Leonard"},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"Several things about this book are good. The sentence-level writing is often beautiful, and the characterization overall is strong. Una is a vivid and distinctive personality. Ahab is also surprisingly well characterized.However, overall this is a book I hesitate to wholeheartedly recommend.It's whale-like in its volume -- very long and *reads* very long because the proportion of philosophizing, exposition, and musings is very high compared to the amount of story. I felt there were too many themes, too many thoughts and symbols and ideas, and would have preferred fewer and better developed. The long passages of airy stuff get boring after a while.I was disappointed that Una never really experiences a crisis or has to deal with her own actions. She does a horrible thing--which I won't spoil for new readers-- but never seems compelled to expiation. Throughout the book, Una does various things that perhaps she shouldn't do, but she never really faces the consequences. Though many bad things happen to her, she always has friends and supporters and the hard times don't last. Most unrealistic to me was the way she attracts one man after another.I found the characters overall a bit hard to believe as nineteenth-century people: abolitionist, with mixed feelings about whaling, religiously tolerant, proto-feminist, overwhelmingly intellectual and constantly talking about literature... these beliefs did exist at the time, but I don't really see Una as coming from a background where I would expect them to be current, and when they are all combined and little dissent (with the brief exception of Una's religious father) exists, it reads like an attempt to make historical people palatable to modern-day readers. Which I'm not in favor of.Lastly, while I applaud the success of a &quot;fanfic&quot; book -- one which exists as an homage to another book, using some of its characters and its world -- and feel it's a more valid literary form than it gets credit for, Ahab's Wife falls into a common fanfic trap. That's having the main character romantically involved with several characters from the original book. Ahab was a given and works fine, but there's another character Una ends up with, and that element did not work for me at all; it seems unnecessary and inappropriate somehow.The vast amount of critical praise for this book surprises me a bit. It's an interesting effort, but I can't see it as great literature."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I let &quot;Ahab's Wife&quot; sit on the shelf for months after purchasing it, worried that it would turn out to be some sort of preachy feminist pastiche. I needn't have worried. Though its protagonist is no slouch as a feminist, that wasn't among its several big flaws, and for me the flaws were comfortably outweighed by its rich rewards.Taken sentence for sentence, almost all the writing is luscious. The author's love of &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;, and her sharp-eyed fidelity to its setting, time, and characters, is evident throughout. Only during the brief part of the novel actually taking place on the Pequod does Naslund attempt to replicate Melville's voice, or rather several of his voices, in a sequence of chapters in the form of soliloquies and playlets. That effort is as successful as it is amusing, but the remaining, non-Pequod, passages are kinder on the syntax-challenged 21st century reader than Melville was.I loved the accurate period detail, on quilting and cooking and lightouse keeping, on blubber rendering and religious factions. I enjoyed the way the story flowed effortlessly along, but left plenty of Easter eggs for the alert reader to find. (What is the model in &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; for the ship Sussex? Why do the castaways throw their raincatching cups away before they are rescued? Why does Giles ask Una for her earring on the Alba Albatross?)The first two thirds of the book has a powerful narrative drive, with vivid characters, robust suspense and dire catastrophes; powerful enough that the momentum carried me through the doldrums of the last third of the book, which meanders, and reads less like a novel than like the diary entries of some pleasant, progressive young 1840s matron with a penchant for name dropping. Naslund tries too hard to stuff the kitchen sink into those later chapters. And in the meantime we learn too little about the characters we came to care about in the first half, and Una seems too blithely unmarked by her earlier travails. For most of the book, I admired her resilience, but by the end I was wondering if past a certain point resilience doesn't become a character flaw.For as long as the book maintains its fine first wind, Una emerges as a fit mate for Captain Ahab: as independent and blasphemous as he is (no accident, surely, that the novel contains exactly 666 pages!), but balancing his thundering &quot;No!&quot; to the Creator with a steadfast, sensuous &quot;Yes&quot; to the creatures. It's only in that sense that this novel takes a revisionist stance toward its great predecessor. Unfortunately, the flaccid last third of the book drains Una's &quot;yes&quot; of much of its credibility. Despite the promise of the early chapters, it fails to resonate at a mythic depth comparable to Ahab's &quot;no.&quot;Still, it's a good read, and no more competent, more pleasurable, or more slyly appreciative a spinoff on Ahab's story is likely to come along in the next hundred years."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I read this novel with great pleasure. In this age of post-modernist spareness, it is delicious to read a big thick book with a plot and many characters. I did indeed feel that I was transported into another world, and I like it when a book can do this for me. I did, however, have some difficulty with the basic premise of the novel. Although it's years since I read Moby Dick, Ahab's mythic shadow is still present in my mind. I cannot, even suspending all disbelief, imagine him as a domestic creature in any way. Ahab as a lover is beyond my imaginative capacities. Appparently, not so for Naslund. In the end, though, I just could not be convinced that Ahab would be at all interested in a hearth (even if shared with the adventurous, sensual Una) and this hampered my full enjoyment of the novel. The same goes for Ishmael--a husband? I think not. Ishmael is a wanderer and always will be for me. While the plot of Moby Dick is nowhere near fresh in my mind, its mythic imprint remains, and though Naslund's book is very pleasurable, interesting, and yes, a great deal easier to read, I can't really see it as a companion to Melville's work. I suspect many who have not read Melville will read it and enjoy it, but on a deep, spiritual level, it doesn't seem much related to the classic. Even so, I highly recommend the book. I learned lots from it and had plenty of new images created in my mind as a result of reading it. The plot can be rather pat in places, but there are lovely scenes which are quite fantastical (the protagonist's journey through the forest with a dwarf, the idyllic life at an island lighthouse, and some wonderful descriptions of food!)--these scenes, rather than the main character and her romances will remain with me."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"The good first: A beautifully written book, almost poetic in spots. I always love to read about strong women characters, and the main character, Una, is definitely ahead of her time. I liked how the characters of 'Moby Dick' were fleshed out and given more indepth personalities.The bad: I think that having read 'Moby Dick' and 'The Heart of the Sea' (book about the Essex) instilled a bias in me that could not be shaken as I read this book. 'Moby Dick' is so complex and wonderful to discover; a book with many interpretations. 'Ahab's Wife' doesn't leave any mystery. We are placed deeply within Una's own mind and travel her thoughts with her. I also didn't like how the author borrowed heavily from the true tale of the Essex when writing about Una's adventure on the Sussex. It was nearly verbatim to what I read in 'The Heart of the Sea'. What the Essex crew suffered was extraordinarily horrible. It bothered me that the author used the account of the Essex to sensationalize Una's life. I probably would've given this book higher marks if I hadn't read 'Moby Dick' and 'The Heart of the Sea', but I have, and so I recommend that the reader read them first before tackling this less satisfying novel."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"[Note: This review appeared December 2, 1999, in the Seattle Weekly ...]Ahab's wife Una has spent her first pregnancy at her mother's Kentucky cabin -Ahab is away at sea, of course, busy whaling - and though her labor starts hard it fails to progress. Her mother rides into the icy night for a doctor, and Una is oblivious with pain when a runaway woman slave creeps through the cabin door and into her bed. A gang of bounty hunters led by a dwarf cloaked in wolfskin bursts in after the runaway but, persuaded by the compassionate dwarf not to grope under the bedclothes of a woman in travail, they soon depart. The women snuggle beneath the plump quilts, Una laughing with merry affection when not gasping with birth pangs. At last the infant Liberty is born. And Liberty dies. And dawn brings news of another disaster - Una's mother has frozen to death in the snow. Una, gazing skyward beside the grave that holds both her mother and her child, wonders if the universe is punishing her, but she rallies. She outfits her new friend for a flight to freedom and sends her skipping North across the floes of the frozen river like Liza in UNCLE TOM'S CABIN. We're on page 13.And there are 650 to go, profuse in events, literary allusions, and love. For love is the answer - Una's every nerve vibrates with this truth. Thus she will never quite understand (although she'll forgive) the monomaniacal vengeance that her beloved husband later pursues against the White Whale and against the blankness of the existential void. What void? Rapt attention to each moment shows that life is full, and glorious.Naslund takes us back to Una's childhood in leisurely poetical fashion. Twelve-year-old Una is sent away from her brutal zealot of a father to live with relatives at a lighthouse overlooking the Atlantic, where she learns to love the stars and the sea. These chapters glow with painterly images of windblown landscapes and picturesque vegetarian food, e.g., a \\"sweet potato gashed richly open\\" on a plate. How glad I am when Una hits puberty and ditches her warm, wonderful family for a couple of sailors, Kit and Giles. She cuts her hair, dresses as a boy, and secretly follows the guys aboard the whaler they've shipped with. Between trysts with them (they quickly see through her disguise) Una gives us a full report on the whaling life until the ship sinks and the crew is cast adrift. She and her friends survive by eating the flesh of shipmates who succumb, and after their rescue they are haunted by memories of their cannibalism. Giles commits suicide, Kit goes mad, and Una weds the madman.Una's eventual union with her second husband Ahab is less convincing. As she wanders the Nantucket dunes during one of her dark nights of the soul, a flinty hand silently leads her to safety before its anonymous owner slips away. Was that Ahab? Must be! Later she hears him wail \\"Una! Obsession!\\" into the flames of a house that's conveniently afire at the moment. Their passion is terrific, but when Ahab gives Una money to buy furniture, readers may feel that their memory of MOBY-DICK has been handed ashore dressed in a blouse and skirt.What Naslund does best is to portray a woman who joyously accepts the universe with the same unstinting ardor with which Ahab roars his everlasting \\"No!\\" Una's bliss is irrepressible, obstreperous, steeping random moments in its wayward shimmer. But the bold feminism so many reviewers praise in our heroine is rather compromised by her tendency to drop her emotional anchor next to every eligible or fatherly male who sails into her waters - first Giles, then Kit, then Captain Fry, Ahab, Isaac Starbuck, Judge Lord, Robben Avalon, and finally Ishmael. Nor is Una particularly scrupulous in ethical quandaries; her moral reflections on deceiving her friend Charlotte are only cathartic rationalizations after the fact. Finally, as a storyteller she doesn't measure up to the narrator of MOBY-DICK. Melville's Ishmael is as whole-hearted as Una, but half-sure, too, mingling meditation, wonder, affection, and horror in an ironically multiple vision. Una has only one purpose at a time in mind, so although her purposes change like the weather, her story achieves variety merely, not ambiguity or true complexity. She just wants (and wants us) to live, love, laugh and be happy.AHAB'S WIFE will attract fans of popular fiction - a woman at last month's Northwest Bookfest told Naslund the book \\"felt comfortable the whole way.\\" But Naslund seems to be aiming at a different audience - one that's familiar with the authors she continually evokes: Chaucer, Cervantes, Spenser, Sidney, Shakespeare, Donne, Goethe, Coleridge, Shelley, Byron, Bronte, Keats, Emerson, Fuller, Hawthorne, Douglass and &#65533; Melville. Her novel's best achievement may be to return readers to its origins."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"\\"Don't you buy it -- don't you read it when it does come out, because it is by no means a sort of book for you,\\" Herman Melville wrote of Moby-Dick to a female acquaintance. \\" What is it,&quot; Ahab had cried in his last moments of reason before his chase of the White Whale, \\"what is it, what nameless, inscrutable, unearthly thing is it; what cozening, hidden lord and master, and cruel, remorseless emperor commands me; that against all natural lovings and longings, I so keep pushing, and crowding and jamming myself on all the time?\\" Melville devoted a scant 10 sentences to Ahab's wife in his chronicle of an obsessive pursuit. From this spare rib, Sena Jeter Naslund in Ahab's Wife, fashions not only a woman but an entire world and in so doing revises literature. \\"Captain Ahab was neither my first husband nor my last,\\" Una Spenser begins her story lying on her back on a Nantucket beach after Ahab's death, watching the clouds go by. One of them, she thinks, looks a bit like Ahab's face. She waves goodbye. In Una's life story, Ahab is but one player among many, and not necessarily the most important one.He was a decent person, good in bed even ... until that whale came along! In beautifully structured 19th-century-style prose, with divisions into many little Melville-ian chapters, this book is proof that the pursuit of happiness can be more rewarding than that of a whale."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I enjoyed this book despite some serious flaws. The language is rich in texture and visuals; Naslund's turn of phrase is frequently a work of art. The writing alone is worth the price of book. The story is entertaining enough to keep the reader's attention to the end.However, for me, the flaws seriously diminished the value of the book overall. It could have been improved significantly with tighter historical research. I had the distinct impression that Naslund did as much research as needed to support her plot, but she failed to really explore social and cultural mores, opting instead to stay in the shallows; that was disappointing. This book would have been a great vehicle for really exploring 19th century social relationships. When I checked the acknowledgments, I didn't see any historians credited for their research. For an example of better research and a real sense of period, check out Alias Grace by Margaret Atwood.The heroine, Una, was fairly shallow--sort of a 20th century woman in Victorian Barbie doll clothes. As passionate as she implies she is, I didn't really sense true depth of emotion. The words were there and they were often really good, but they just didn't translate into passion. As a result, I wasn't able to empathize with Una at all.Occasionally, I found the descriptions and the actions of and between certain characters disjointed--the cause and effect connections don't always synchronize with each other and it can be disconcerting.Still, Naslund grabs your attention in the first few pages and proceeds to tell an entertaining story. And that's better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. . ."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I never really liked \\"Moby Dick\\" but I had a fierce high school teacher who forced me to read to the end. Having finished it, though, I was left with a lasting impression of a unique character, an unusual narrator and a powerful story. Perhaps it was the lack of a stern prod this time around, but I didn't get past the first quarter of \\"Ahab's Wife\\" and never developed the slightest interest in the characters or their fates.It's certainly true, as other reviews have said, that the authorial \\"agenda\\" leaks through to stain the pages - a somewhat feminist or woman-centered story built on what I guess is called a 'post-modernist' worldview. But thats a worldview that I'm not altogether uncomfortable with - I don't think it was that which turned me off. And the writing is talented enough, I suppose - in a somewhat overblown way (that I thought was intended to mimic Melville.)I'd have to say that the characterizations, within the given historical context, were just plain unbelievable in the end. If this had been written as a piece of future fiction such as Atwood's \\"Handmaid's Tale\\" it might have come off better in that department. There is something peculiar about attributing some elements of 'modernism' or 'post-modernism' to peoples of the last centuries... peculiar and not especially believable. This question - of how much of modern sentiment to inject into pre-modern characters - is probably the hardest part to balance with historical fiction. I think most good historical fiction seeks to tell a story about the times. This book seemed more intent, instead on making a point within the trappings of a story."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"This is a BIG read--a fairytale for grownups.Adolescent Una is wisely sent to live with her mothers sister,in a lighthouse,to avoid the increasing possibility of abuse by her father, a religious fanatic.She spends 4 happy years with them before running away to sea,disguised as a boy with two young men to whom she is equally attracted.This book is the sory of her 3 marriages the second of which is to Captain Ahab,a whaler and declared mortal enemy of Moby Dick,the great white whale.We follow Una through tragedies,joys,the loss of 2 husbands and a baby ,to where she finally reaches true happiness and fulfillment.The book is peopled with an assortment of fascinating characters,and M/s Naslund paints incredibly beautiful and vivid word pictures of Nantucket and both the beauty and horror of living in a coastal town with all its connections with the barbarities of the whaling trade."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"This is a huge, ambitious, captivating novel that suffers from its length. After reading every word raptly for 400 pages (the sections on the lighthouse island and on board the ships were amazing) she really lost me for the final couple hundred pages. Superfluous characters abounded (Robben? David Poland? Maria Mitchell? Even Frannie had totally lost her appeal). Superfluous plot devices abounded (the move to 'Sconset, and almost all that happened there). Characters were thrown in only to be killed off before we have a chance to care. It is as if Naslund fell so in love with this story that she couldn't bear to climb out of it--but it would have benefitted from an earlier conclusion.That said, this book did that rare job of drawing me in completely to the world it created, so much so that it stayed in my head at night after I had closed the book. Vivid, beautifully political, perfectly graphic, sensual--a damn good read for the first several hundred pages.One more complaint--she didn't mention Melville in the Acknowledgments. Come on, Sena, you took the whole basis for the novel from him! Don't you think he deserves that much?"},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I am surprised by the unflagging praise for this book. Although the language and description is well-crafted, I found the character of Una, and references from her point of view, jarringly twentieth-century. I refer not to her spirit, adventurousness, and desire to follow a different drummer, but to her &quot;modern&quot; political correctness in all things, admiration of the &quot;athletic&quot; (did they have aerobics during whaling days?), and lack of an 1800's viewpoint in any discernable way."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"AHABS WIFE kept me attentively turning all 666 pages.... The book is no MOBY DICK ...though the aforesaid reviewer may not know Melville forged his own, probably deeper kind of rebellion. But I appreciated Naslund showing another dimension to the characters created by Melville, as observed by a woman. I also appreciated her ability to tell a gripping story -- at least for the first two-thirds or three-quarters of the narrative. The weaknesses: Naslund leaves strings untied; for example, we never know the manner of death of the some of the men who were adrift on the boat with Una and her two companions, though we know the creepy aftermath; therefore we are left with all that unresolved dark stuff. Then there was Kit...Another problem is that although Naslund has done ample research, and supplies rich details about the material day-to-day life of 19th Century Americans, when she gets inside the heads of the characters, she often forgets they live in that time rather than in ours... especially in the final (and weakest) sections of the novel. In those disappointing moments, she descends to the level of a 19th-Century soap opera (as Jean Auel, another conscientious researcher, did for the Stone Age), with a leviathan-sized dose of well-intentioned but artistically sterile moralizing."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"This novel will make you feel as though every cell in your body is crying out at the wonder and ecstasy and painful beauty that is earthly life. It seems as though it was not written, but spoken by an aged woman by a roaring fire, telling every detail of her young life. This is possibly my favorite book of all, although it is in competition withThe Red Tent: A Novelby Anita Diamant. Don't be deterred if you haven't read Moby Dick, you don't need to know anything about it. This story is completely sovereign. Anyone interested in complete absorption with their literature, step right up."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"This is a beautifully well written book, that tells the story of a woman's strength and courage in 19th Century America. \\"Una... so vividly portrayed that she seems real\\". This is a truly inspired homage to Melville's classic, Moby-Dick."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I earned my MA in English, and I must admit, I managed to escape without reading _Moby Dick_. But there's something alluring about _Ahab's Wife_ that kept me reading, as much as the book annoyed me because of its attempts to encompass the whole of 19th century experience. The story of the lighthouse Una (certainly she represents both \\"one\\" and \\"everywoman\\") and her ordeal on board the Sussex draws us in: she seems to have insight that comes from the double life she leads. When she emerges a woman, settles in Nantucket, and starts running into people like Margaret Fuller, though, I became a bit impatient. This is a big book, and there are some compelling threads in Naslund's tapestry, provided you ignore the overt philosophizing (which the book does much more effectively when it's not pounding you over the head with it but considering it through the eyes of the characters). I may almost need to read _Moby Dick_ for the sake of completeness."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"The language is beautiful, the rendering of intimate moments and pleasures exquisite. And yet. The novel grates because its world is benevolent well beyond credulity. I counted exactly two (mildly) unpleasant characters in close to 700 pages, and neither of these two (men, natch) earn more than several pages between them. Our protagonist is so unflaggingly comprehending and curious and forgiving that all drama is drained from the book well before its finish. The specifics of this imagined world are so fine as to wash away much of its impossibly liberal tone, but about half way through one longs for some conflict or drama. I began to dread the narrator's encounters for fear that the next stranger would prove more benevolent than the last. If either the narrator or the author had had more complexity the other one would have been tolerable. However, when both contrive to convince us that mid-19th century America was such a benign and instructive place, the mind recoils. To live in the world Naslund describes would have been a wonderful thing. Too bad she fails so badly to convince us that such a place ever existed."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"This is a very well written book that you just dont want it to end! Truly, Una seems to be so real. This is her story, her relationship with a much older captain, and her bonds. Definitely would recommend to anybody."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"Ahab's Wife is a poetic, sweeping, historical, epic novel that kept me engaged for almost 700 pages. That is no easy feat! I enjoy historical fiction so was not only interested in the lives of the characters but fascinated by the accounts of life in New England in the 1800's. Most of the characters from Moby Dick and many other historically significant people where cleverly woven into this novel about Una Spenser and her life. A well written, interesting, clever story about strong independent women and their experiences was a pleasure to read. Sena Jeter Naslund is an excellent, lyrical writer who made 19th century New England come alive."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"It took me a while to get into this ambitious book, but I was glad I stuck with it.Naslund covers the time period of \\"Moby Dick\\" from the perspective of the woman who spent part of that time as Capt. Ahab's wife. This book touches on all manner of subjects, including slavery, women's roles in the 19th century, sexuality, mental illness and religion.At times I wondered where Naslund was going with all this, and I got a bit tired of the main character's modern-day judgments on her situation. But overall this book is worth reading. At its base is a good story, and that story deals with all the peripheral issues in a way that will keep you thinking."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"This book grabs you from the beginning, but there were many parts that were not needed. The editor could've done a much better job, but you fell in love w/Una and her friends and watched their lives pass you by.Una is a very powerful woman ahead of her times. You will feel compelled to call to her and help guide her. You will need tissues.If you enjoy this book pick up Pope Joan."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I thought this book was wonderful. It may have been a little self-indulgent at times (e.g., famous people encounters), but overall I was completely addicted. I could not put this book down. Naslund is a wonderful story-teller."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"Although at times the main character seemed a bit hard to understand in her choices and ambiguity, I was committed to continue with her in her journey through her unusual life. I found I never wanted to put the book down. Naslund's rich language drew me in, placing me high in the lighthouse and crow's nest, in desperation on the raft, or wandering the beach. The relationships were complex (if sometimes a bit shallow), but I found it interesting watching the changes in the tortured Ahab - not that hard to imagine. If you read for escape, then this is indeed a yarn that will carry you away."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"This is a wonderful book--rich, complex, rewarding--a literary novel that manages to be a pageturner. Written in the style of a 19th Century novel, it invites leisurely reading, but that's hard because you won't want to put it down. As someone who regards MOBY DICK as the most boring book ever written, I wouldn't have chosen to read AHAB'S WIFE if I hadn't heard such wonderful word of mouth on it. Am I ever glad I did! Dig into this book. You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"This is a BIG read-a fairytale for grownups.Adolescent Una is wisely sent to live with her mothers sister,in a lighthouse,to avoid the increasing possibility of abuse by her father,a religious fanatic.

And Naslund pulls it off. In this book, she confidently manages to craft a historical novel with time-period-perfect voice, interlaces the Moby Dick story, and takes on social, scientific, cultural, and political developments of the eighteenth century. What one or two reviewers have described as \\"unbelievable\\" events, I see as fitting into the epic novel tradition she continues in this book. There are amazing, mythic elements, but they work within the framework of the story, and within the epic tradition. (Think Iliad, Odyssey!) Even given this mythic tradition, the characters still seem real, and true to the 18th century; never 20th-century characters placed \\"out of time\\". And her descriptions of food are great.I read this a year or so ago but still have frequent \\"flashbacks\\" . . . an opening scene of a runaway slave jumping from ice floe to ice floe was echoed in my fourth-grade son's study of the Underground Railroad; recently, I read an article about rooftop gardens similar to the one at the lighthouse; a foggy day reminds me of the harbor. Still, the intertwining of Melville's story is the most impressive thing about Naslund's story; she brings a new element, a new perspective to the classic."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"In this 663 page novel, we find that the legendary Capt. Ahab, of MOBY DICK fame, has taken a wife. Using liberal creative license, the protagonist, Una Spenser, has varied adventures. Naslund's prose is filled with imagery, both visual and non-visual, often dwelling extensively on Una's pedantic ruminations.During her travels while Ahab is at sea, Mrs. Ahab widens her social horizons, discoursing with intellectuals and writers as well as common folk. Intellectual fervor reaches a high point in the 18th C., and Una places herself, as a woman, directly in the center of what is considered exclusively male territory. Una has always possessed this independence of spirit, and some of her formative years are spent with relatives who are lighthouse custodians. From then on, she is in love with the sea, attracted to its dangers. It becomes a central theme in her story, as her adventures at sea affect the rest of her life; her first experience with the opposite sex is in the form of two young men who come from the sea.Naslund's heroine often seems less role-model than drama queen, a manipulative woman who flaunts her intellectual aptitude, yet never ceases to use womanly wiles to her advantage. The hubris of the younger Una is understandable, but reeks of arrogance as she matures. While historically accurate, some of Una's travails are extremely suspect, given the amount of detail given to each moment, save the most life-changing, which is strangely lacking in specifics. In addition, Una's Oedipal attraction to Capt. Ahab is a considerable stretch. Classic though MOBY DICK may be,I recall tortuous hours spent over Melville's book. Not to be outdone, AHAB'S WIFE is certainly as weighty and wordy a tome. 200 fewer pages would have made a livlier read."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"Overly long. I found the crux of the story to be poorly built up, and given more meaning than it deserved. On the whole, the problem felt forced and overly &#34;symbolic.&#34;There were a few moments when the book clicked, but they were few and far between."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"Naslund was trying too hard. Good story at first, but I quickly became bored. Can't copy classic style; she should have just been herself. Too bad."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I found the book to move very slowly. The author was very descriptive. I did not finish the book. I would not recommend it but maybe if I had finished it I would feel differently."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"This book really captured my attention from the first chapter. It is so beautifully written and full of surprises throughout the story. I enjoyed the way the author wove in bits of history along with the fictional characters. It was a bit coincidental at times, but still believable. I recommend it as well worth the time to read it."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I have read this book twice. It is one of the most compelling and powerful stories that I have ever read. I recommend it to all of my friends, because the story is wonderful. It is full of adventure and gives an incredible insight into the life of women in the 19th century, and in the whaling community. The story of the main character, Una, will resonate for all women. The second reading brought out details and nuances that I missed in the first reading. I do not doubt that, in years to come, I will return to this story and visit Una and Nantucket again."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I adore this book, and It's one that I reread from time to time. I love the language Naslund uses to tell the story. Not only is it beautiful, but I find it takes me back in time."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"One of my favorite novels. Looked forward to reading this every night. I had just finished Moby Dick, which added a little to my enjoyment of this book, but no need to have read Moby Dick. It's a story of a singular woman's life, with great historical detail and beautiful writing. Really great book!"},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"This writer has an incredible use of language. Interesting to read. Don't like it that more words are required for submission of review."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I was afraid, when I picked this book up and read the table of contents page, that I'd found a huge collection of wasted words meant to flesh a simple story out, to purposefully make it mirror Moby Dick in length. I was prepared to be instantly annoyed. But by the time I read the last page, I knew I'd been wrong. I love the fact that the author structured the book as a mirror to Moby Dick, in format and length as well as in plot. Some of the parallels were obvious, but I never felt they were overdone, or charmless. The author maintained an elegance with her writing that never left story feeling stilted or forced. The characterization was a bit rushed-feeling in a few instances, and there were sub-plots that felt half-thought-out and unfinished at the end of the novel. But in most cases, the writer made sure I fell in love with each new person presented. I was also pleasantly surprised -- because of the intentional mirroring of Moby Dick -- that the writing itself never became old-fashioned or bogged down. What worked for Moby Dick, I wouldn't have stood for in a modern novel. Ahab's Wife, though, proved to be an enchanting read, from cover to cover. I'd certainly recommend it to anyone who wants a new brick-of-a-book to get into."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"Gift for my Sister on her 50th.

I was transported to the world of Una Spenser as she traveled forward in her life. The book is rich with lush detail and emotion. No wonder &quot;Time Magazine&quot;, in the December 20 issue, has chosen it as one of the top 5 novels of the year!"},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I just finished this tremendous work of literary art and couldn't wait to tell someone how great it is.I've never read a book that moved and enlightened me in quite the same way as Ahab's Wife. It has everything: spirituality, adventure, intellect, social commentary, history, humanity, and even a touch of humor. In some ways, it's the intelligent woman's counterpart to the famous Melville novel (definitely a guy story). On the other hand, there's so much more to Una than simply being the wife of a whaling captain. Given that she marries Ahab halfway through the 600-plus pager, you realize this is no ordinary 19th century housewife you're dealing with. The first line tips you off, \\"Ahab was not my first husband nor my last.\\" As that marriage came to its inevitable end, (most of us know what happens to Ahab even if you haven't read Moby Dick) it becomes suspenseful as you wonder which of the fascinating men she has met becomes her 3rd spouse. Isaac Starbuck, the \\"gaoler\\"? The Judge? Rodden, the woodcarver? David, the midget bounty hunter turned abolitionist? You won't believe who it is. A surprising and deeply satisfying turn of events ends the story, but not the life, of this remarkable woman."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"The print reviews I read ranked this book so high that I was hoping for a great book. In fact the writing is so good, and the premise also so good, that it could have been a great book. But the author's agenda comes through so strongly that the book is not believable and not ultimately satisfying. I read it all the way through in a week, but the English professor friend I lent it to (a feminist who loves Moby Dick) only got a third of the way through before returning it with the same sense of disappointment I had felt and the same reasons. (Since the book's amorality actually gets stronger the more you read, it's probably good she didn't finish it.)The author is so indoctrinated with late-twentieth-century beliefs (or rather lack of belief) that she plops a heroine with a twentieth-century mindset into a twentieth-century set of family and friends. Thus, all the heroes in the book are postmodernists with no real belief in God and a very weak sense of morality, but a strong sense that slavery and racism are wrong and feminism is right. Yes, slavery is wrong--but it's hard to believe characters in that day would find it more evil than cannibalism, incestuous longings, adultery, living together outside of marriage, divorce, and homosexuality. All of these are seen as forgivable or not even needing forgiveness, and Christians are usually seen as stupid or villainous. (True Christianity, by the way, recognizes evil, as this book doesn't really do, but it offers forgiveness of the moral slime each of us is guilty of and capable of, which is much better than the sense that morality doesn't really matter.)In summary, unless you are VERY interested in Moby Dick or you believe today's culture is morally superior to Melville's, you'll probably be quite disappointed in this book."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"This carefully researched historical novel is a back story to Ahab, the obsessed whaling captain of \\"Moby Dick\\" by Herman Melville. The woman he marries is portrayed as the synthesis of what a woman in 19th century New England had to be in order to survive--tough, intuitive, persistent, loving and forgiving. Impulsive as a teenager, Una disguised herself as a cabin boy in order to sail out of Nantucket to experience life on a whaling ship, to ride the oceans from the Atlantic to the Pacific, but she had no idea of the horror to come. After the ship is overturned by a whale in the South Seas, she is adrift with half a dozen shipmates, and the experience escalates into one of the darkest places the human mind and heart can go. Two of the mates are old friends and competing for her love, but that dissolves in the aftermath--one commits suicide and the other descends into madness. And this is just the beginning."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I adored this book as it is a great tale that I was immersed in. I did not want to put it down or see the story end. The characterizations are compelling, the plot is great and the writing terrific. I thought Cold Mountain and Edgar Sawtell were in the category of this book."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"Possibly the best epic novel I have read in the past two years, protagonist Una Spenser is curious about the world, a thinker, a lover of questions - and her father wants none of it. Thus begins a marvelous journey ~ and we are blessed with the ability to live vicariously through this poetic prose. I didn't love this book for the subject matter ~ although I now have a deeper appreciation for the sea and those whose lives are touched by it ~ I adored Sena Jeter Naslund's ability to take questions most of us have about our natural world and relationships with family and others and give them a home. There are quote-worthy passages on almost every page. My favorite: \\"That's the way it is in life. You let go of what is beautiful and unique. You pursue something new and don't even know that the wind of your own running is a thief.\\" I will read it again soon."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"This is one of the most memorable and best books I have read. Apparently some people want little plot, and less character development. And why less pages, you can't tell a good story in a couple hundred pages. This is a wonderful book, and to those who did not like it, try reading some good literature instead of all the \\"fluff\\" of many best-selling authors--most of which are just the same ol' thing."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I have so much trouble finding fiction that is engaging yet meaty. I loved this book so much I was sorry that it ended! Una is a fantastic character - strong, yet very human. All the characters are wonderfully unique and multi-dimensional. I enjoyed the historical figures and references tied in."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I have not lived in a novel this profoundly since - I don't know when. Had I been her editor, I would have asked the author to eliminate the Margaret Fuller/Emerson bit. It is tangential and a little annoying. The heroine's attraction to their philosophy could have been channeled through a different character (her mother) or just an exposure to what they stand for."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"Ahab's Fictional Wife's Philosphical Musings and Deep Inner Life is a title that aptly describes this endless novel. The segments that were plot-driven, such as Una's adventures as a sailor and the mental illness of her first husband, were wonderful. Ahab, until now merely an icon, was infused with genuine humanity, and the story of their marriage was so well done. Life on Nantucket and the experience of sea captains' wives are vividly drawn. Naslund is a very good writer. It was all the stuff in between (Una's odes to her sewing needle, her effusive love affair with the seas, her genius despite her poor education, to offer just a few out of dozens of examples) that brings my rating down to 3 stars. Maybe this new writer was given a new editor. Someone should have blue pencilled about 200 pages of filler. Certainly Abundance is a much tauter production. This book might have been equally good."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"Una made me tired. Everything bad that could happen, did. She continued to revel in her own strength, her own life, her own freedom, blah, blah, blah...I was fascinated by the seafaring stories and the character of Ahab. Seems that I should have read Moby Dick instead. I guess that's why that call Mellville a classic and this one a recent \\"best-seller.\\" That tell us that we are all wasting weekends.The Christian-bashing in this book (in the name of tolerance, of course) was like fingernails on a chalkboard - just rubbed me the wrong way. Una just doesn't \\"get it.\\" Transcendentalism, Universalism, etc all get their equal kudos, but she is absolutely closed-minded where Christianity is concerned.Two stars is a generous rating. Maybe I should reconsider. Should I order the hardcover or paperback edition of Moby Dick?"},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I loved this book despite my criticisms. Naslund's use of language is beautiful. I'd read anything she writes for the sheer joy of her ability to express herself. But, she can be contriving. The plot is driven much the way \\"Forest Gump\\" was, with the protagonist being inserted into any historical or socially relevant situation manifesting itself during the time the book took place.The book starts out with a catchy line, that is irrelevant to where the story begins, but serves to evoke a curiosity about what kind of woman would have enticed and tolerated the likes of Ahab.Naslund has a great imagination, and as one can see in her later book, \\"The Four Spirits\\", an ability to write on a deeply personal level as well."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I was really apprehensive about starting this book, because I've neverread Moby Dick and have absolutely no desire to read it (sorry,Sena). Once I picked it up, though, there was no putting it down 'tilit was all over. ...I didn't think it was too long. It's an epicwork, and like all epic works, it's long and involved, requiring acommittment from the reader--one well worth it. Una's character isvividly, marvelously drawn, as are the characters she comes in contactwith, from Kit to Ahab to Ishmael and all the rest inbetween.

I regret purchasing this worthless jumble of words. These 666 pages are filled with boring reminiscences and flashbacks. By the 60th chapter, the novel has barely progressed. The \\"heroine\\" is reliant upon other characters in the novel. Una is a weakly constructed personality, less of a heroine and more of a dependent.

But it was quite severe and required two weeks of ice and elevation in the middle of winter in an empty house. So I picked up the copy of Ahab's Wife that had been at my bedside for months...and then the real pain began. The \\"Everyone Loves Una\\" reviewer has made all my points for me, so I won't restate the obvious, but just one more thing: Who else found the death of Frannie's \\"Liberty\\" beyond the pale, even for this book? And as to the you-just-didn't-like-it-because-you're-a-bible-thumper defense, I'm a Berkeley commie pinko bra burner and I hated this book.

Sent to live with her aunt and uncle on a lighthouse island to save her from her puritanical father, Una learns to love the sea, and by the age of 16 she is seeking work on a whaling ship by pretending to be a boy. Unfortunately, her search leads her to _The Essex_, a doomed real-life whaler which, in part, inspired Melville to write _Moby Dick_. Una falls into the life of a whaling boat easily, but when the boat is stove by a whale, she is forced into the most difficult situation imaginable. When she is rescued she slowly recovers and begins life anew.Una meets Ahab again (their ships had met at sea before the Essex disaster) as Nantucket is burning to the ground, and a connection is renewed. They marry and have children, and while he is away Una delves into the social, political, and intellectual world of 1800's New England. Of course, the reader knows that Ahab will be injured by a white whale and become obsessed with revenge, and therefore Una's life with him is infused with sadness. Una, however, is so strong-minded that she doesn't let circumstances bury her, and the reader grows to admire and even love her as she struggles beautifully through a difficult life. Incorporating many true events of the time and invoking other literary works, _Ahab's Wife_ is a rich, fulfilling novel which I became completely immersed in. One of the best books I have ever read."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"Yes, dear ladies and gentlemen, I truly loved this book, despite what some of our colleagues wrote. I usually read true crime novels and biographies, so this story was truly quite a different one to read.Once again, just fabulous."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"Terrific writing, stunningly embellished with vivid descriptions and details, but easy to read. Subject matter is fascinating!"},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"What awesome descriptions and captivating storyline! I couldn't put this book down! It makes me want to read \\"Moby Dick\\" again! I look forward to reading Sena Jeter Naslund's other novels. If they are half as good as the story of Una, I am hooked! I found that Una is so much like my daughter, and the author never met my daughter. Of course, this made the story even more interesting to me. The personalities are so diverse and very believable. I would recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"This novel of New England in the 19th century is a real page-turner! Naslund takes a stray reference in \\"Moby Dick\\" to the captain's wife, and turns it into a lusty, intriguing tale of Nantucket at the height of the whaling industry. The tale is told through the eyes of Una, a remarkable young woman who comes to New England at the age of 12 to live with her aunt's family to escape a crazy, abusive father, goes to sea disguised as a boy at the age of 16, survives a terrible wreck, \\"marries\\" three men in succession, and decides (at the age of 25 or so) to live out her days on the bleak tip of Nantucket known as 'Sconset.Historical characters of the time pass through--Margaret Fuller, Emerson, Hawthorne, Frederick Douglass--and the serious issues of the day--women's rights, abolition, religion--don't leave her untouched either. But the sea and whaling are the most potent influences on Una's life. Naslund obviously did a great deal of research, and I don't think I've ever read a more compelling account of the lives of these sailors as they wandered the oceans for years at a time. It was a bloody, dangerous job.The book is written with a touch of 19th century style, and the black and white illustrations reminded me of some novels of childhood--like Moby Dick. I thought this book was a smashing good read!"},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I couldn't put this book down! It's memoir style reminded me somewhat of Memoirs of a Geisha (although the stories are completely different) and was easy to read. The heroine bounces from Kentucky to an island with only one family to a whaling ship to nantucket. It was great! I would definitely reccomend this book."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"Another question comes to mind, how long is long? This novel was very long and at points quite tedious. I stuck with it for two-thirds of the way and then had to come up for air. Perhaps I'm not the best person to review it, but to those who follow my reviews I feel compelled to let you know what I think.The story is one of interest but I found that the author took too long to tell it. I personally come from the area of Massachusetts that is mentioned in the book and I have to admit I enjoyed much of the imformation imparted. I grew up near a historical whaling town and was amazed at what I learned from this book but it wasn't enough to keep me hanging on. Perhaps I'll try her next book.

The heroin in the story is strong, courageous, bold, and has enough faults to make her believable. I wished I could travel with her."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"Una Spencer grabbed my heart from her brilliant first line and hasn't let go. Ahab's Wife is both exciting and revealing, and Naslund has given us a 19th Century woman whose adventures resonate with more than self-obsessed revenge."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"Disclaimer: I didn't finish this book. I COULDN'T finish this book. It was so preposterously self-involved, so ridiculously dreary, so bloated with period-speak and crammed with philosophy, historical name dropping, heavy-handed pseudo-feminism and scientific lecturing, that I made it about a hundred pages in and gave up. A hundred pages. If a book's not going to grab me by then, it's never going to get there."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I loved this book! I did not want it to end. The novel has a different feel for each of the phases of Una's life. It has history, romance, feminism, tradgedy, horror and adventure. What more can you ask for! I have recommended it to several friends and they have all loved it as much as I did. Do not miss this one!"},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"The first line in this book is brilliant, \\"Ahab was neither my first husband nor my last.\\" It was all down hill after that. Naslund certainly likes to hear herself talk (write). She pontificates on a plethora of topics. She self-importantly weaves her \\"heroine\\" through a goodly portion of the current events of her time. Occasionally the prose tightens up and then she starts blathering again. We read this for one of my book clubs and save for one woman this was more or less the consensus. A man in our group thought the women would like it as he considered it chick lit, however, we soon set him straight on that point. Una seemed to be a user of others; a woman that sucked the life out of those around her. She was a woman without a soul on a spiritual quest. Portrayals like this do women in general a great diservice."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I was seduced into reading this book by the many positive reviews, and by a yearning to relive my joy of reading Moby Dick many years ago in high school. For the past two weeks I've gone from savoring the language and intriguing story of Ahab's Wife to skimming through the final 150 pages, impatient for it to be finally over. Ms. Naslund's blatant feminist agenda is rivaled only by that of Jean Auel, who attributed everything but the invention of the Internet to her Cromagnon heroine, Ayla. Una and her entourage are ultimately implausible as characters, standing more as icons for Ms. Naslund's beliefs. Ahab is the most human character of all, and I'll soon revisit him in his original incarnation."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I just finished reading Ahab's wife. It is a beautifully written book. Ms. Naslund's words flow across the pages. Even when she is describing a horrific event she paces the reader with her ability to describe, sometimes shock, and then return to a settled position. The historical figures woven into the narrative are a delightful way to place the story in the New England of the 1800's. I highly recommend the book."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"A gripping story with adventure after adventure. An interesting look inside the life of the fictional Una, a remarkable 19th century woman, who hobnobs with historical characters Margaret Fuller and Frederick Douglas. Her relationships with friends and lovers are beautifully described. An exciting tour of the whaling profession and New England sea-side towns. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"This book really held my attention. It was never boring or rambling. Great read for those raining days!"},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"Don't be put off if you have never read Moby Dick. It really isn't necessary at all. Also I am a male and loved this book so don't think of it as a \\"woman's book\\". This book is true literature. There are numerous ideas and philosphical debates built in and yet the narrative keeps you from putting the book down. Its refreshing to see a modern writer strive for and accomplish what we would associate with \\"great literature of the past\\". This book is a true sleeper. It is the best book I have read in several years, and recommend it to any serious readers."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I just finished rereading Moby Dick and then read, Ahab's Wife. It is a soup with too many ingredients. PLUS in the other reviews I didn't see any mention of the fact that she lifted word for word Ishmael's , &quot;Whenever I find myself growing grim...&quot; and put these words on P. 646 of her book . Obviously, something fishy here."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"Ms Naslund has taken the written word to a new level. I found the book so entertaining I considered it an indulgence. I would rank this at the top of my list of recommendations. Her writing at times would take my imagination by storm. I often found myself going back over a page to gather in even more of her words. Most of my paperbacks are given away. This one, I will keep to read again. Literature such as this is rare.Melanie"},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"Melville's Moby Dick has always been one of my favourite books, and so I picked up 'Ahab's Wife'in the library out of curiousity. Using similar language and style to Melville, Naslund has spun an adventure which is monumental is scope, incorporating the spiritual, moral and emotional struggles found in 'Moby Dick', but told from the woman's point of view. Although Una is too good to be real, her story is never dull, and I couldn't put the book aside. I loved the description of Kentucky cabin life, and the surpising relationship she makes with Susan the runnaway slave girl, and later the dwarf slave catcher who is chasing her. In a later episode Una runs away to sea, posing as a cabin boy. The reader needs to accept the impossibile, of Una remaining undiscovered by everyone on board but her two friends, Giles and Kit. The harrowing canabalism which takes place in an open whale boat after a shipwreck were deftly written, leaving the survivors with unescapable guilt for their escape from death.The story wanders back and forth in time as narratives often do, and although there were times when I felt Naslund tried to include too much in the last third of the book, such as the encounters with Mary Fuller, Emerson, and even Henry James as a young boy, I finished the book with a feeling of happiness to have shared so much with the author."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"This is a perfect book - educational, entertaining, strengthening. The main character, Una, was at times restless, at times content, but always adventerous, brave, and in the end, a survivor. It was a true page-turner, kept me entertained for weeks, and left me a more confident woman. And I learned a lot about whaling!"},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"Any book that rekindles my interest in Captain Ahab and crew, sufficiently enough to go back and read Moby Dick - this time in it's entirety - deserves praise. This is the story, told in the first person, of a girl from Kentucky whose life becomes inextricably linked with New England whaling and the legendary captain of the Pequod. Herman Mehlville briefly mentioned the existence of a partner for Ahab in his illustrious tome; Ms. Naslund takes that reference and imagines an entire life intertwined with people and events both real and literary.Naslund's heroine, Una is a strong character worthy of her fictional husband Ahab. Hers is a life that is rich and multi-textured as any you'll ever encounter. In fact, Ahab enters Una's life relatively late in the novel, long after she has been through her own whaling adventures, which include a ship that meets its demise via whale attack. This might not become the timeless classic of it's literary relation, but it's worthy of the association. It's an incredibly skillful piece of literary craftsmanship!"},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I received this book as a gift because of my known affection for Moby Dick, and I was very pleasantly surprised through most of the novel. Naslund succeeds in creating an interesting character who is plausibly matched with the man we glimpse through his monomania in the original tale. Unfortunately, while the book is compelling for a good while, it eventually collapses under the weight of over-neat conclusions, forced peripheral plotlines that seem anachronistic, and a focus on female characters that serves the idea of the story better than the story itself.Working last to first... Moby Dick is, obviously, a very male-centric book, and it's clear that Ahab's Wife was designed to be the female counterpart--but the repetition of the \\"strong female character\\" type started to strain plausibility. A week after finishing the book, I can't remember an example of anything approaching a weak woman in it; that in itself is not a flaw, but the lesson became heavy-handed.Relatedly (and hopefully without spoiling too much), the homosexuality (and homosexual activity) of several characters was a distraction--and one that seemed tossed in more for p.c. inclusiveness than for literary merit. Perhaps the first instance would have been useful on its own (it was plot-relevant), but the second did nothing to drive the story and, on further consideration, detracts from the believability of the first.Finally, the coincidences were just too much. It's probably difficult enough to construct another story inside a previously existing (and well-known) framework--everything has to fit, but still seem rough enough to be real. But Naslund succumbs to the temptation to make it all fit perfectly; you can practically see her patting herself on the back for figuring out when the sailor, the dwarf, the jailor, or the escaped slave should conveniently reappear. And I'm not even going to get started on the encounters with a few of Melville's favorite writers... It's just too self-congratulatory, and it ends up pulling you out of the story just when you should be delving into it.Overall, I'm glad I read this, but a less forced perspective would have produced better results. For Una to match Ahab, and for Ahab's Wife to match Moby Dick, Naslund would have had to let her heroine be more of an individual and less of a symbol for proto and modern feminism. Her book, then, could be a book, and not just a reply."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I bought a copy of this book last summer when my eyes suddenlycaught a glimpse of the title. Because \\"Moby Dick\\" is one of my favourites I was eager to read the narrative of the protagonist\`s forgotten wife. And I must admit that I managed to finish it, and with great pleasure too!In my opinion, the book should not primarily be judged according to adherence to historical facts or to the existence of certain grotesque elements. What it should be judged upon is the writer\`s ability to describe Una\`s imaginative powers especially when it comes to her relationship with Nature. This relationship is totally different from Ahab\`s strugge with Nature, which in the end leads to his destruction.Una worships the beauty of Nature, but also the smaller things like her daily activities of knitting and sewing. Her story illustrates how she is able to transform past traumas into a present worthy life with the help of her imagination.Compare, then, Una\`s story with the fates of Antionette in \\"Wide Sargasso Sea\\" by Jean Rhys and Charlotte in \\"John Dollar\\" by Marianne Wiggins. Both works supplement and undermineclassic narratives as \\"Jane Eyre\\" (Bronte) and \\"Lord of the Flies\\" (Golding).Conclusion: Every writer has a right and obligation to challenge the established (male) narratives by giving previoussupressed voices a chance to utter themselves!"},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"Una did face,and live, through many \`bigger than life' situations and isn't that what we look for in our fictional heroines, or heroes ? Una is one of us but like other legendary figures she becomes an ordinary person doing extraordinary things.When I was about a third of the way through my reading of Ahab,s Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer I had the good fortune to attend a reading and question/answer session featuring Ms Naslund. A point she made, in response to a question,was that the \`title: sub-title' was also in keeping with that of Moby Dick: Or, The Whale.Being Ahab's Wife is a reference that gives Una an immediately recognizable jumping off point. And it is a starting, or introductory, point as we soon find that Una is on journeys of her own.Some readers will go through the work on a start-to-finish path while others will pause to reread and relish each of the little gems that they find along the way.I read this wonderful work in the latter manner.I was already familiar with Sherlock in Love by Ms Naslund and that excellent read was one that I read straight-through. Her short stories found in Ice Skating at the North Pole are another set of little gems. An additional work, that I recommend, by the author can be found in the set of short stories - Savory Memories.I strongly recommend Ahab's Wife."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I have to agree with what many reviewers here have said about this strangely popular piece of fanfiction: the main character strains the reader's credibility to the point where it becomes comical. Una is, quitely simple, what folks in the fanfiction universe call a &quot;Mary Sue&quot;. (Google this term and have a good read if you are interested.)What is a Mary Sue? Mary Sues are hopelessly idealized characters who exists primarily as a projection of the writer's ego and fantasies. They serve a psychological need: they make their creators happy. They do not ebcome larger than that. All the important men in the novel fall in love with Una. Una is gifted and strangely well informed for a teenage girl whop never went to school and grew up in a lighthouse-- even analyzing poetry in exactly the same theory heavy way one would expect from a 20th century literature professor! Who would have thunk it? Most of what comes out of her mouth is just too precious after about page fifty, ah but of course everyone adores her for it!She takes up all of the fashionable causes (reflecting attitudes that are entirely 20th century, including Save the Whales) and serves them all heroically, flits through all kinds of extreme experiences (including cannibalism) but remains remarkably unscarred psychologically, and of course no matter how much she betrays or hurts others.... Well, nobody is every really angry with Una!Oh and she meets everyone who was famous during that time, and they all either adore her or she gets the better of them. (Her depiction of Nathaniel Hawthorne is especially preposterous in this regard.)All in all, although the quality of writing was more developed and sophisticated, the level of imagination is not much better than what one might expect from a kid writing about a character (who is very sensitive and special, just like herself!) who stumbles into Middle Earth and captures the heart of Legolas the hunky, romantic elf.Fluff reading, folks, fluff reading."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"If you were to toss Schoolhouse Rock, a pirate romance novel, the entire contents of the New Bedford Whaling Museum and the longest, droning passages of Moby Dick (the ones that made you put down the book and never finish) into a blender and push the button for &quot;grate&quot;, this book would emerge. Una, our heroine, was perky and resilient and men and women lay themselves at her feet in utter admiration throughout the book. Annoyingly, this includes famous characters from history. This stylized female heroine left no room for me, as the reader, to develop any empathy or even much interest in Una.The author is enormously talented. She demonstrates her talent over and over again but overwhelms the enjoyable passages and turns of phrase with little instructional lessons. Every metaphor or new word was invariably followed by a lesson sometimes delivered by Una herself and other times more subtly.The novel's strength is in the history lessons, not in the characters. If you read the book, read it to learn about life in the old days."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"With 166 customer reviews already posted, another one is probably the last thing Naslund's book needs. However, since I did wade through all 666 pages, perhaps a few observations may be permitted. First, please understand that I came to this book really WANTING to like it. Melville's \\"Moby Dick\\" is one of my favorite novels, one of the very few that I have reread multiple times, and I wanted more of the multi-layered symbolism and dark philosophy of an amoral universe that permeates that wonderful tome. While I did find a dark tone, that was about it.To enjoy a work of fiction, I must be able to follow Coleridge's admonition to suspend disbelief; that is, the story and the characters must appear sufficiently realistic that the reader is able to believe that everything COULD have happened just the way the book describes it. However, nearly every event throughout Naslund's book sounds contrived and highly improbable. In several instances, the reader feels that Naslund herself does not understand her characters and is unable to explain their relationships or actions. For instance, we first are led to believe that Kit's insanity is a logical result of his enforced cannibalism. Later, we feel that it may be a result of Giles' sexual assault. Finally, we are told that Kit's mother was also insane because she, too, was known to have urinated in public, so now we can conclude that the fellow inherited his insanity. If all this isn't sufficiently ambiguous, let us examine Kit and Giles' entire relationship, long before the cannibalism business. Their togetherness certainly leads the reader to conclude that they have long been lovers, yet the shock to Kit of Giles' later sexual domination throws the nature of their entire relationship into question, a question that is never resolved.Many other events come along that make the reader think he has stepped thoroughly into the Twilight Zone. I scarcely think that Una would have felt so comfortable while visiting her new business acquaintance, a washerwoman, only to have Mary strip her down, plunk her into a tub of water, and comment on her body parts! And what is this business of Isaac Starbuck, the gaoler, all about? He starts out as a Christ-like image, golden haired, good hearted, a literal savior to Pip. He is killed in the fire (we are led to believe), only to rise from the dead and walk among the living again, but never does he play a significant role in relation to Una. He marries, is widowed, and remarries, but never to our heroine. Why is he in the novel? What is his function?Then there's the name-dropping: Margaret Fuller, Emerson, Hawthorne, Alcott, Frederick Douglass, and Henry James all make appearances, but to what purpose the reader is unable to determine. The image of Una's coming upon Hawthorne on a forest path, his face obscured by a black veil, is almost too contrived to be endured. The veil may indeed be intended as a symbol of Hawthorne's dark spirit blocking the beauty of nature, but the symbol is not believable and, thus, fails to convince.Occasionally, themes come close to developing. Una seems to be both fathered and husbanded by lunatics. Nearly every good thing that comes along is followed by disaster, death, loss, hardship. However, Cormac McCarthy's \\"All the Pretty Horses\\" does a much better job of presenting the plight of a humanity that has been damned by the wrath of a vengeful Old Testament god. Una's philosophy of oneness with the universe is clearly expressed near the end of the novel but is reminiscent of Robert Heinlein's \\"We are made of star stuff,\\" thoughts published decades ago. Of her own writings, she says they are \\"but a draft of a draft,\\" directly plagiarizing Melville. And if one wishes to see the source of Naslund's inspiration for the sinking of the whaleship Sussex and subsequent events, read Philbrick's \\"In the Heart of the Sea,\\" a more graphic yet historically factual telling of the disaster.Readers of pulp romances may find Naslund's book fascinating, but its lack of well-developed themes and its population of unbelievable characters engaged in artificially contrived adventures left this reader wanting much more than the novel delivered."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I enjoyed this novel. At times, I found certain scenes/chapters to be a bit tedious; however, for the most part, it was quite enjoyable. Ms. Naslund was able to create a memorable character and story that can stand on their own. Moby Dick, what is that? Well, there did need to be the slightest mention of a wife in the original classic in order for this novel to be believable. The idea was original and the plot held true to the events of Moby Dick. I found it satisfying to hear about the events from a woman's perspective. Any lengthy discription of whaling would have put me to sleep instantly. This is a beautifully written novel and would be perfect for a book club discussion. I recommend this book for those who like historical fiction (whether or not they have read Moby Dick)."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"Being very impressed with this novel when I first started out, I read through it all with a fervent captivity that I havn't experienced in a while. I found the plot creative, much waxing philisophically, interesting developments, and a fresh uniqueness that I wouldn't have expected coming from a book loosely written around Moby Dick. I was greatly impressed, that is, until I made it about halfway through the book. From that point on, it seemed as if Naslund was running out of the proverbial steam. The writing slowly became a little less creative. The protagonist's liberal thinking got to be a literal extreme (a nod of approval from Frederick Douglas... c'mon) It seemed to be as if Naslund just slapped a conclusion together in order to just FINISH the book. It just dragged on and on... Well, in the end, I was a bit dissapointed. I found the first half of the novel extremely engrossing. It's too bad the second half didn't quite live up to it."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"When I first heard about this book via my BOMC bulletin, I was instantly put off by the hype, which heralded it as everything from &quot;the literary find of the year&quot; to &quot;the greatest thing since 'Gone With The Wind'. Thus was I challenged to find out the truth for myself, and it is that it falls somewhere in between. &quot;Ahab's Wife&quot; was better in so many ways than I was led to expect; Nusland's narrative power is so strong the reader is literally carried along, as though riding a wave in the sea. Its sense of language is wonderfully evocative of its period, and it offers a heroine as strong as any Eliot or Bronte might have turned out. Yet, despite its sweeping narrative, literary references (from Spenser's &quot;The Faerie Queen&quot; to Goethe's &quot;The Sorrows of Werther&quot;), and romantic outcome, it just misses being a great meditative twentieith century examination of a nineteenth century work, a la &quot;The French Lieutenant's Woman&quot;. The reason I think is Nusland's style never completely loses its feel of contemporaneity, whereas Foweles' work, if presented unknown, one would swear was the work of some earlier century writer. Nevertheless &quot;Ahab's Wife&quot; succeeds in satisfying on a variety of levels, and is far superior to other works of this type."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"AHAB'S WIFE is one of those books that captivates from its measured sentence to its final closing words. It draws minor inspiration from a brief quotation from Herman Melville's classic, MOBY DICK, but is a well crafted work of superb fiction. The author weaves various characters and settings together into a coherent whole, skimping neither on setting, nor on character development.The book chronicles the life of Una Spenser and her various incarnations, from daughter to lighthouse inhabitant to whaler to wife, mother and friend. The character is familiar and at the same time fresh and invigorating. The settings throughout the book propel the story forward with remarkable deft, lifting the reader to heights of imagination.I particularly enjoyed the early chapters and the lighthouse imagery. It evokes New England imagery and mood, a theme that pervades throughout, coloring even the brief sojourns to the American South. Characters are fully and carefully developed throughout the novel and the simple themes of coming-of-age and self-reliance are fully explored.I do not get much chance to read a lot of fiction, and for others in the same position, AHAB'S WIFE is a worthy exception. The author has done an excellent job and I would look forward to reading other works as they are developed or released."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"After reading the first chapter I was rubbing my hands together giddy with delight, and I believe you will too. This is a great author, this is great material! I could not touch the style and skill of just one of this author's paragraphs if I had a twenty years to do it. Honestly though, I eventually didn't enjoy the book as much as hoped. It's a little too feminine perhaps. As you continue it becomes obvious the book is somewhat of a soap box for \\"agendas\\" which wear thin and taint the prose. It was a challenge to see it through and read the whole thing."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"Rarely in one's lifetime does an incredible book come along such as this, that you want to slowly savour, prolonging it's ending, wishing it were even another 1000 pages longer. This was a beautifully written novel full of adventure, history, and wonderful characters that readers will never forget. What a grand book this was to read and reread."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"The first half (I really enjoyed it) of this long novel is much better than the second half. The story develops carefully at the beginning, with some talented writing ( if a bit over wrought)and a likeable character and a good plot. Your hopes are up. You have finally found a &quot;good read&quot; you can sink your teeth into. And then...It becomes an unbelievable roller coaster-you barely recover from one catastrophie before you are thrown into the next. Eventually, we spend too much time with a starry eyed Una watching the sea, the sky, the stars, oh my! (I am about 5o pages away from the end as I write this and am debating whether to finish or not) I think the book could do without about 4 deaths, at least 4 characters (how about that mysterious man on the foot path-Mr. Hawth---e? one dwarf, toss out one over achieving woman, pick a fourth), I'd shorten the last trip to Kentucky, and I'd like to have the characters stop confessing their innermost secrets so Una doesn't have to feel bad about &quot;the evil deed&quot;. The dialog becomes very phony and whatever realism the book had evaporates.The author should find a new editor and learn what &quot;less is more&quot; can mean to a good book. This novel could have been a really great. I only gave it 3 stars because I was having a really, really bad week at work and the first half of the book saved my sanity!"},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"While this book is a compelling and well written read, it should be produced as a ABC movie of the week or on daytime TV. This book is melodrama in pure form. The author also gives the protagonist 20th-century thoughts in a 19th-century world. Una is not written for her time, but for our time. The author name drops famous people into the story, which serves the author's research well but tended to annoy me. It is highly unlikely she would meet Nathanial Hawthorne Margaret Mead or Maria Mitchell. But the worst fault of the books is that Una never has any flaws and unfortunately never develops as a character. I found myself wanting to finish the book but unsatisfied when I finished. There are better books to spend 600+ pages on."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"In this sometimes overwhelming take on the Ahab story, using a few characters from the classic novel, Sena Jeter Naslund visits the life of Una, the wife of Captain Ahab, and the time she spends with her Captain is surprisingly gentle and romantic. The two of them don't truly find one another until about halfway through the novel, however. The beginning of Una's life is just as interesting, though in different ways. She is born in Kentucky, lives for several years with a lighthouse-keeping family, and then, most excitingly, goes to sea. Some of the things that happen to her during her time on the waves haunt her for the remainder of the novel.The beauty of AHAB'S WIFE is in the supporting characters. David Poland, Susan, Frannie, the Judge, Mary Starbuck; these are interesting and beautifully drawn people, and I loved reading about (and from) them. Some characters were unnecessary and only removed focus from the story at hand. The subplot concerning Margaret Fuller could have been dropped entirely and it would have only tightened up the narrative (much to the benefit of the book as a whole).All in all, this is a rewarding read, if it does require an investment of time and energy. Ms. Naslund does not \\"write down\\" to her audience - she writes in a style that requires the reader to pay attention and engage themselves. For those who have the time, energy and interest to delve into the pages, AHAB'S WIFE can offer many gifts."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"There are many charming stories tucked away in this very long book, but after awhile it becomes unbelieveable (even for fiction) that any character would be so calm in the face of adversity, unflinching at danger and so able to move on from one devastation after another. The writing is easily read, and draws the reader in, but the over-sappy, over-optimistic, over-done content has started to make my eyes roll... and I still have 150 pages to go! But, three stars for keeping me plodding through instead of taking it, unfinished, to the second-hand store."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I have never read Moby Dick and thus have no preconceptions about that novel, or about Melville or, most importantly, about that old sea-dog, Captain Ahab.I must say, at times I felt like chucking this book (and Una with it) into a huge vat of whale oil and lighting the whole shabamb on fire! Who on earth is Una supposed to be? She is the strangest character I have come across for some time. Other reviewers have described some of her more preposterous adventures ranging from fighting eagles, cannibalism, attending esoteric book clubs with the famous and the gifted, slave blockading, eating guava jam, to going on furniture trips to Boston. Whew! I was, at times, shattered from the effortless effort of Una careening from crisis to lovers to domestic tedium to star gazing.But, strangely, after a while, somehow I just accepted that Una had a life which is larger than life and it all made sense somehow. Instead of detesting this book, I grew to like it more!! It is all weird and mysterious, a bit like Moby Dick the whale.As for Ahab, what a guy, a hell of a dynamo. I cannot blame Una for lovin' that man. You will be frustrated that Ahab and Una will never be reunited and their final parting seemed somewhat muted. But you will revel in their story. A fine romance, a doomed ending. A child called Justice. A dog named Alpha (??!!). This book has it all."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"My first thought was that this was to be a woman's book. Was I wrong! Of course, I never dreamed that Una, a young woman in the 19th Century, would prove to be an adventuress who finds answers to her curiosities by living them out. For this reason, I would highly recommend this book to able readers who are young as well as old(er). The book is written extremely well, combining dialogue and description of another Century in a believable and fascinating style. Una's adventures describe solitary and simple living,the courage of whale boat crews, and the frightening experience of childbirth in the wilderness. If that isn't enough excitement, there are a few other events to keep you interested. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"This was a surprise book. One of those stories that grips you, not only with the beauty of the story but also by the quality of the writing. I read ALOT and this is one of my all time personal favorites. I am sending a copy to several of my closest friedns beacause I won't let my own copy out of my library. Well written, moving and a beautiful extension of the tale of Moby Dick."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"The heroine has an exciting life--enough for three lives. At first, I couldn't put it down, then, I got bored by the philosophizing in between the &quot;juicy parts.&quot; One wonders if the author is trying to be a poet in the middle of her novel.I especially liked the charcterizations, though some of them were too stock, too stereotyped. The book could've been improved by shortening it about 200 pages.Still, I would recommend it as a good story of whaling times; what it's like aboard ship; life in Nantucket; how men felt about women and visa-versa; the plight of slaves, and childbirth in the 19th C."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"Ahab's Wife: Or, The Star-Gazer: A Novel of Diet-Soda SwillSadly, Naslund's exquisitely beautiful imagery is just so much compensation for something more lacking than lack of character development. Here all potential \\"characters\\" are suborned to be one-dimensional instruments for Naslund's neediness--her need to have a world the way she wants a world to be (nice), when she doesn't like this one. This is a little girl's tea party. 203 pages in, only one character was other than, \\"kind,\\" or \\"gentle,\\" or \\"nice,\\" and of the most liberal and flavorless social attitudes. That one character is Una's father, but underneath Naslund's notion of Bible toters, he's nice too. Naslund just uses him and his mild violence to rather trivially discuss fundamentalism, but then she's done, so she has his \\"nice\\" conscience conveniently suicide himself out of the story. Simpering pap.Some Old-Testament scribe tried to tell writers that if they wanted to play god, they had to breath life into their clay. At the lighthouse, Una and her young cousin make mud pies, as Naslund makes characters that taste only of mud.Una's uncle \\"Torchy\\" has to be the singularly least developed character in all of Western literature. For a hundred pages he wanders around a lighthouse with red hair, saying kind things. Una also has a nice aunt, a nice cousin, meets two nice young men, signs on to a whaling ship that serves nice food and has nice people. This is the kind of wish-fullfillment fantasy I'd expect from someone who was desperately trying to live in a fantasy world where everyone is (gawd, I hate this word) \\"nice.\\" Such avoidance is found in abuse servivors (and if this is her case, Naslund deserves sympathy) and in those persons who are abberantly mild of nature, in which case she deserves hormone supplements. In either case, the book is more a portrayal of Naslund's wishfulness than a novel.The last line here encapsulates Naslund's wish fulfillment fantasy, and perhaps reflects some other, thinly disguised void from her family history, in which case Ahab's Wife becomes a sort of a crying in public: \\"I thought of my searching in Captain Fry's blue eyes--steady, penetrant. Kind. What had I thought I saw? All reflective in my hammock, I knew at once. I had seen the eyes of a true father.\\" The whole damn thing is Naslund's fantasy search for a father, the way she wants a father to be, a fantasy of a world of people how she wants them to be, indicating she doesn't like people how we are, and perhaps also a search for the more heavenly father she was promised by Christianity, embodied by Una's father, the insipid image she wants but is too smart to be able to believe in, so that it is not Una's father that slaps her face for not believing, but Naslund's rationality preventing her from believing the drivel she so wants and then foists upon us, her own rationality slapping Naslund with the fact that she, as her book, though flowery, will always be empty.But, paraphrased from Abe, \\"Them that like this sort of thing will like this sort of thing.\\" Not me."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"For two-thirds of its length, through the heroine's marriage to Captain Ahab, the book is a crisp, well-thought page-turner, although it merely skims the philosophical depths one would expect of a feminine revision of Melville. The last third, however--from the use of fiction's most famous opening line in casual conversation, to the conclusion that reads more like a romance novel than real literature--removes all the scope and grandeur. Finally, truly, this *is* a romance novel, and not in the classical sense--it's in the true, modern scope of basing the narrative around the heroine's love life, and finally bringing that--and only that--to a satisfactory conclusion."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"AHAB'S WIFE begins beautifully. A young girl, Una, is sent to live with her relatives in a light house because she refuses to adhere to her father's religious beliefs. She soon disguises herself as a boy to go aboard a whaling ship. The beginning sets the stage for what could be a very deep book. I was disappointed that it turned out to be a book about Una's progression of husbands. She falls in love with a man who drowns, thus she marries his best friend. Her husband goes crazy and disappears. She then marries a kindred spirit, Ahab, who leaves her in a beautiful house for years while he searches Moby Dick (who was responsible for him losing his leg). After she learns that Ahab is killed by Moby Dick, she meets and cohabitates with her new neighbor. In retrospect, the story seems to be more about the progression of men in her life than anything else. The deepness that seemed possible at the beginning of the book is never realized."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I loved the words, the story, the settings, the characters. I took my time reading Una's story and enjoyed it all the way through. I have often picked it up again just to read a few pages and be transported back to the people and places. I even bought mini white roses for my window, just like the ones that grew outside the lighthouse. The author has a way with words, they are like poetry. In the beginning it is a little difficult to get in to because it is so different from the casual writing style of most best sellers. I caution you not to look for a point, or try to anyalze the story...enjoy the story, and the main character's adventures as she journeys through life."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I appreciated the strong female characters, along with real-life heroes (Margaret Fuller), and the New England-based story. I think Naslund was overly ambitious, which contributed to some hard-to-believe coincidences (David Pollack finding Una's valise, Susan finding Una's floating trunk, two David Pollacks), most likely due to the complex nature of the book. That said, overall it was a good read that I would recommend to friends. I especially enjoyed the literary, historical, and religious mentions generously sprinkled throughout the novel. Some of my favorite reads are those such as this one that constantly send me to the encyclopedia for reference."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"Loved this book and was sad when is was over . I would recommend it to anyone but I think it would be appreciated and enjoyed more by woman. The adventures of the heroine were marvelous and all seem very possible and well tied together. I thank you, Sena, for a book that added so much pleasure to my life. I sail and I could relate to all the issues of the water and the crew. Best book I have read this year and I read alot."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I thought this book was astounding! In it's scope, and in it's ability to utterly draw the reader in...One question, though - where the heck did a previous writer get the notion she had a &quot;tryst&quot; with Frederick Douglass?????????"},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I have the good fortune to have been born and raised on Nantucket...my children are thirteenth generation natives. To finally read what is an acurate description of the women of the time....20th century be damned! The women of the whaling era were strong, self-sufficient, intelligent business women. The situations depicted in the book, from homosexuality to polygamy to children on board ships did indeed happen....we as 20th (and now 21st) century women have nothing on the women of the past! The number of women...and men...that switched from Quaker beliefs to Universalism was astounding...and the island still has an ever increasing Unitarian Universalist community today, with deep rich roots going well back to that time. This was a wonderful story...timeless as well, for strong women are timeless themselves!"},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"As with the ocean and the starry sky, &quot;Ahab's Wife&quot; displays both brilliance and doldrums. Curiously, I found Una's marriage with Ahab among the least credible and most tediously written segments, no better than the average romance; her life before Ahab was much better written. And &quot;Ahab's Wife&quot; is not the feminist version of &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;; it's a spinoff. Melville's long, informative passages and his humorous passages are missing here. &quot;Ahab's Wife&quot; is an entertaining read with beautiful and poetic passages, but the promise is inconsistently fulfilled leaving me, in the end, disappointed. Most fulfilling: Kentucky and the lighthouse. Most disappointing: a 12-year-old Quaker girl &quot;lifting her skirts&quot; for a dwarf's silver coin (!) and Ishmael as husband; good grief!"},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"The descriptions in this book are rich and are lovely to read. The adventures of the heroine are diverse, unusual,but push the boundaries of beliveability. Filled with exciting adventures. The novel would provide a rich source for a discussion of situational ethics. Worth reading, not great."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"O tempora! O mores! Una is whipped about by unseen forces. Stigmata: Ouch! God hates me because I paraphrase, says a bewildered Una, moments before her forehead streams with blood from tiny, yet appealing, woundery, gouged into her pale, white flesh by an almost invisible crown of thorns. Did Ralph Ellison cause her pain? Love stinks."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"This book might have benefited from a tough editor. It could have had at least 1/3 fewer pages. The author felt obliged to introduce every late 20th century politically correct idea into 19th century New England."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I read this book for my book club's next discussion. The plot idea and first chapter really drew me into the story. Then the book fell flat. The characters are not truly developed on their own, they float around as reflections of social issues. I lost interest quickly with the author attempts to comment on far too many issues in this book (slavery, liberalism, existentialism, feminism, etc.) If she had stuck with a few issues, we might have actually seen who Una really was. Although the writing itself is good, the novel is a poor attempt at modern literature. Not worth the 600 page read."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"This is the most amazing book and I am glad that others have recognized it as such. That opening sentence just grabbed me and pulled me in for days and days. The prose is almost hypnotizing. I could not put this book down. I also read the Wreck of the Whaleship Essex and even though Una's version of the shipwreck is fictional, to me the way they survived was written in a mystical, mystery way. To the naysayers, it is extremely plausible that Una would meet lots of famous people in Nantucket and Boston. New England is a relatively small place and in the 1800's was even more so. I myself lived on Nantucket until recently for over 10 years and crossed paths with the rich and famous daily. And New England, especially Nantucket, is a beautiful place, neither bleak nor stormy, except when one wants it to be. I just hope this does not turn into a movie starring Julia Roberts, let Una live in our imaginations."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"This book is to be savored. Naslund's delicious prose sinks into the senses and sticks to the ribs. The poetic nature of her writing mixes horrendous happenings with human elements of suffering, loving, and living in the most extreme. The story is rich on detail and character development. It's ripe with adversity and survival. It's laden with strength and determination.Finally, a book that is deserving of best-seller status."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I fell in love with this book in the beginning, the way the writing flowed and took me along. It was charming, educational and pure good reading up until Una married Ahab. Then it just dragged and became unbelievable, from Una's investment into petroleum to the 3 babes named Liberty and their ill-fated outcomes. It could have been summed up in less than 500 pages."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I, being of the male persuasion, read this book after my wife raved about it. I had a bit of trouble getting started, but I loved it in the end. It's a strong tale and the writing is glorious, in the same way that mid-19th century writing was -- somewhat overwrought in places, a bit too pretentiously lyrical in places. And yes, there were chapters -- some of the short ones -- that I skimmed. Not to everyone's taste apparently, but it was to mine.Several reviewers here have complained about various inaccuracies, and I'm sure there are some. I didn't read this as a dissertation on whaling or feminism in the 19th century, or any such thing. Inaccuracies aside the book has a wealth of detail that I found absorbing.There have been complaints about coincidences. They do astound. But then think of all the bizarre coincidences in Shakespeare -- people just happening to meet long lost siblings and the like. Would anyone dislike Twelth Night any the less because the plot is filled with silly devices? And, of course, Dickens's stories would fall apart without some of the most silly coincidences in all of literature. Get a grip -- this is a novel -- and if one can't accept a few contrivances, then one can't read most literature before 1900 or there abouts.Finally, Una's life is unrealistic? Obviously. She crams a lot (and not just husbands and lovers) into one lifetime. But anyone who has lived a spell in New England or studied the \\"under-history\\" of the region knows that there were lots of extraordinary women around and about, and people who violated moral rules, including sex only within marriage and homosexuality, fairly openly. And plenty of women who were liberal and free-thinking. Una is a symbol for all the interesting people left out of most 19th century fiction and as such is bigger than life. She's no more unreal that King Lear or David Copperfield or Baron Charlus or Captain Ahab in the orginal for goodness sake. I did mind, a bit, the absence of any immoral or otherwise bad people in the story, but then Una is proof that bad things do happen to good people.Obviosuly many of these things would be flaws in a less gifted writer and with a less interesting story to tell. Ahab's Wife is not a masterpiece, but it's one of the best books I've read in a while."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"From the moment this book began I was hooked. With an opening like, &quot;Ahab was not my first husband or my last. . .&quot; how could you not be. Moby Dick while a great work of fiction, told us nothing about the wife he so obviously loved who waited for him at home. To have her story told is brilliant. She is no longer an unknown character, but a full personality. Her story is so much more than Ahab and so fulfilling that it is something I suggest needs to be read, even if you have never read Moby Dick. It is a story that is strong enough to stand on it's own. You will get lost in this book, it is a pleasent surprise in a world so often full of mediocre literature."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I can not recommend this book highly enough. The language is beautiful. I would have to re-read sentences several times because they sound so good and conjoured up such images. I have read 3 novels since this one and while their content is ok I am bored by their style - their lack of creativity and imagery."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"A much needed tale of the Human Experience. I have to say that it was cleverly written, and a true art in literature. If you ever needed a literary experience, then reading &quot;Ahab's Wife&quot;, would grant you your need. The words flowed easily, and brought to me a wonderful insight into the history of the world back in the 1800's. I recommend this Novel to everyone interested in the written word. Especially, those who love Shakespeare and many other great writers."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"An exemplar of that rare-breed, the literary page-turner. One gets the sense that the author put everything she knows, has lived and experienced--and all that she is--into this book. &quot;Ahab's Wife&quot; is both old-fashioned and modern, and it stands--proudly and boldly--alongside Melville's masterpiece. A literary tour-de-force!"},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"My book club chose this book (they can't blame me!)Noone liked it...it's a book that's trying way too hard to be \\"important\\" that it simply ends up \\"full of itself\\". The author is clearly cultivating a haughty, superior literary attitude. If you ever have seen a woman who carries a fake Louis Vuitton purse, pulls out a fake Prada wallet and wears it with her fake Coach shoes and too tight pants while flashing her extra-large CZ ring THAT'S what this book is like. It's trying WAY TOO HARD to be something it's not.It's a combination of Super verbose and sensational sprinkled with a couple moments of overly dramatic and far-fetched. It mostly just drags on and on and on. If you suffer from insomnia, don't pick up this book since it will frustrate you. I kept wanting the characters to get real. Instead, the author conjured up increasingly far-fetched scenarios and loosely wove them into a thread-bare quilt. (The story line doesn't hang together).The main characters never get emotionally developed so they are flat and disengaged. I just felt apathetic about all of them. Yhe bizarre sprinklings of far-fetched scenarios leave you wondering if you are actually reading the same book. It is disjointed and a struggle to finish!DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME or your $$$$!Just goes to show you almost anyone can get almost anything published these days! And there are plenty of gullible lemmings waiting!"},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I started reading this book without any expectations. I found the story to be too long. Some of the story lines were very interesting, while others made the plot drag on to no real point.The main character, at one point, disguises herself as a boy, and ladns a cabin boy position on a whaling ship. I know that women have done this in the past, and some were even pirates while disguised, but I just had a difficult time believing this tale."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I loved this book. I don't usually write reviews but I wanted to add my &quot;5-star&quot; ranking to this book to help the average customer review."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"Not so much! Even the title was overdone. One or the other would have been fine.Way too much writing for what the book seemed to be trying to say. Too much descriptive effort and way too much jumping around.Sounded as if the book was trying too hard to resemble some older style of writing and just didn't make the grade.Much dedication, though, must have been put into this book from the length of it, but it was such an effort to finish reading.Sorry. Perhaps it is one of those novels that a reader has to be in a certain mood to read. There are many good books around that are that way."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"Very little research was done on this novel. The protagonist, Una, acts like a time-traveler from the present, and is completely out of place in this book. She also manages to meet nearly every real-life, famous literary figure from the late 1800s in the course of her travels. Pure fantasty, not anything like a historical novel. The writting style was also difficult to get into, and POV shifts were irritating."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"This book is just a mess, and I'm at a loss as to how it got published for mass readership. The author is sorely in need of a good, qualified editor, as she rambles on over several chapters without managing to say anything worthwhile to story development.The story of Una does manage to somewhat entertain for roughly 300 pages. (It is fictional romance, so I doubt many men would find this interesting) From about that point on, Una meets and \\"marrys\\" Ahab and the book goes downhill from there. Ms. Naslund spends a great part of the novel having Una contemplating her navel, much to the torment of her reader. She also manages to preach on every liberal agenda known to mankind, and it only gets tiresome and wearisome. Plus, while the reader might come to know every contemplative thought that enters Una head (though....why do we care??), and we are introduce to the people that cross her path as wooden space holders in time, we know no warmth of individuals, let alone Una. I didn't really feel that Una loved Ahab, despite the author telling me she did. I didn't feel that Una cared about anybody - not even her own child. And I certainly didn't care about Una.There were several examples of just plain bad writing/nuances. Ms. Naslund seems to have a pre-occupation with household china. That's all fine, but she must understand that men simply do NOT share that pre-occupation, nor do men notice such things, nor do men comment on such things! Her insistance that they do is annoying! Also, doing things such as having people call Una \\"Mrs. Captain\\"? Is Ms. Naslund serious? She is supposed to be a professor and heads up a writing department! Captain, as it applies to the character of Ahab is a title, not a name. One would not call a doctor's wife \\"Mrs. Doctor\\"! Granted, we do not know Ahab's full name, but this is known as \\"poetic license.\\" Ms. Naslund should have taken it, as it is, again, annoying.If you feel compelled for some unknown reason to read this mess, spare yourself and only read the first 300 or so pages. When it comes time for Una to marry Ahab, simply stop reading. We really already know how the story ends, anyway."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"There is accurate and interesting information in this book. Parts are intriguing, but a good editor would have been as asset."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I love this book becasue it is about the unusual life of a woman in a time when women were not seen as an individual but as part of a family or belonging to a husband. Naslund carves out a life for this woman that is extraordinary and inspiring.Aside from the 1st chapter, I couldn't get enough of this book."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I really like Sena Jeter-Naslund's writing. Her prose can be very thought provoking and poetic. I did however, have trouble with the overwrought plot that went on too long by about 300 pages. That's why I did not give this book 4 or 5 stars. The other problem I had was Una's narrative was too eloquent in places for this young woman who was not formally educated. I also had trouble with the contrivances of meeting Emerson and Hawthorne via Ms. Fuller. I did however, like the relationship between Ms. Fuller and Una.I also liked the build up between Kit and Giles in the beginning although I thought the opening exposition, which lasted 85 pages was laborious before I felt the story really began.I found the natural progression of the love Una and Ahab had for one another to be very believable, but the relationship with her third husband, Robben the sculptor was uninteresting to me and anti-climatic.In sum, Ms. Jeter-Naslund is a wonderful writer. If her original manuscript of 1,000 pages had been trimmed to 400, I think I would have loved this book even more."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"This book is exceptionally well written, with: an exciting story, historical details of the nineteenth century, interesting characters, philosophical musings, and wit. As a woman it is easy to identify with the heroine, Una, and fun to see Captain Ahab and the whaling era in a different light."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"Intelligent, well written novel with a strong female protagonist. Exciting adventure story. I loved it."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"This is a lovely story that held my attention the entire time. I think the people who disliked the book because it was too far fetched are forgetting that it is fiction. It is like being disappointed in Harry Potter because there is no such thing as a talking snake.

Somewhat \\"attached\\" to Moby Dick it doesn't require you to remember any details of that book. The characters are unusual but believable. The descriptions of 19th C life and especially life on Nantucket were fascinating. Una is a great heroine and the writing is lovely. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I recently finished reading Nathaniel Philbrick's excellent book, \\"The Heart of the Sea, the story of the Whaleship Essex\\" and realized that Sena Naslund took a major chunk of her story from real-life events. I suggest that readers of \\"Ahab's Wife\\" read Philbrick's book next--it is much more interesting and a truly fantastic read. Naslund most certainly based the seafaring section of her novel upon this true story: the whaleship Essex is stove by a white whale in the South Pacific. The men take refuge in whaleboats, and the captain is convinced by his mates to head to South America instead of Tahiti, out of fear of cannibalism, yet they eventually resort to cannibalism themselves. I had to skim parts of Naslund's book, as it got so tedious in parts. In contrast, Philbrick's book kept me riveted from start to finish."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"Ahabs Wife is one of the greatest novels I have read, it captivated me for three days and I could not stand to get up away from it , the Moby Dick plot is one I wouldn't normally read or like but I loved this book! It goes hand in hand with the red tent these are my two favorites"},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"After reading the ecstatic reviews of this book, I dutifully slogged through the first hundred pages of disjointed and melodramatic events, hoping in vain that some thread of plot or some interesting characters would turn up, but finally took out the toothpicks that were holding my eyes open and went to bed. Instead of reading the remaining 568 pages, I plan to make better use of my time by rereading Moby-Dick."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I cannot recommend this book enough to everyone I meet, so I had to write a review here. Naslund's writing is beautiful and elegant. The characters are believable and the story amazing. The book was long yes, but I did not want it to end. It was just the most amazing journey to go on- starting from Una's childhood and ends...wel I won't tell you that. Please do yourself a favor and read it right away. I don't go back and re-buy many books, but I simply must have this one in hardcover."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I was never a fan of Moby Dick but, having been an English major, I am very familiar with it. When I began reading the book, I was pretty excited to have found an interesting take on the original story. B ut then, the plot deviated, and deviated, and deviated. There are just too many plot twists and she \\"accidentally\\" meets just too many famous 19th century \\"luminaries.\\" I must say the most contrived one situation was when she \\"happened\\" to me Hawthorne in the woods surrounding Walden Pond--and he was wearinga black veil no less! Naslund has him leaving a meeting of noted Transcendentalist thinkers...too bad Hawthorne was Anti-transcendentalist! I finished the bookhoping that Naslund might salvage it but, once again she went too far. Una and Ishmael, the man named afterthe Biblical liar? I am beginning to think Naslund needs to change her nom de plume to Ishmael. It'd make her book easier to swallow."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"Cut out the wasted prose and endless descriptions and the book would be reduced by half - and the better for it. I had to force myself to finish this book."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I don't think I ever would have picked up this novel on my own, but the local book club selected it, so I plowed ahead. Although generally captivating reading, it wains at the point where Una resigns herself to Ahab's death on her roof walk. I started to tell my husband about the story line and was amazed, in the telling, to realize that it basically is a soap opera that is so tragic, it is totally comical. Even with a 600+ page story, could it possibly include:Child abuse, religious intolerance, insanity, homosexuality, adultery, husband/child abandonment, slavery, cannibalism, suicide, ship wrecks, starvation, sex toys, women's rights, murder, trained wild animals (2!), fire, obsession, revenge, discrimination, cross dressing, prostitution, divorce (of course), symbolism galore, dwarfism, gypsy travelers, bounty hunters, small pox, abolitionists, transcendentalists, drowning, war, witches, corporal punishment, mutiny,a child with HDAD? (Pip)- what have I forgotten?Oh, of course, Una crosses paths with an unbelievable number of the most famous people of the era. And don't forget all the religious symbolism - Elijah preaching on the wharf, the golden Isaac Starbuck rising from the dead - and I'm not sure what to make of a mother of a still born baby being led on a white donkey by a dwarf?However, I have to say, even though the novel was rather incredulous, it was entertaining, for the most part, and I can't wait to hear the comments from my book club brethren!"},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"This book was a gorgeously written, lyrical saga, no doubt. However, I was extremely disappointed by this book. All of the major characters aren't products of their time, but in spite of their time. Men and women from every walk of life, educated or uneducated, are extremely liberal and freethinking, not just for the time, but for today! No one bats an eye at feminism, strong and intelligent women, homosexuality, mixed-race heritage, a couple living together without marrying, and of course all are abolitionists. I'm not saying I don't agree with this viewpoint, but that it is absolutely unbelievable that no major character bats an eye at ANY of these ideas that modern people often find so hard to swallow. (Except one, but he's quickly converted.) Even Una's father, a fundamentalist Christian, is fundamentalist in a modern sense, not a historical one. Also, Una has no flaws, and so although this is the story of her growth to adulthood, I find her largely unchanged (despite the author's claim of her spiritual revelations). Although I like Una, I didn't feel that she followed the sort of character arc that would define a realistic character."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"This book was entertaining for about 300 pages, then it started to go on a little too long for me. My aversion to the length of this book was because the author was trying too hard to create a \\"complete woman\\" in the main character, Una. Una supposedly had deep thoughts about religion, liked to read, traveled had an adventerous spirit, oh - and she was an expert seamstress, valued a good scone and nice china. By the 400th page, I felt like I was reading Pride and Prejudice meets Crime and Punishment with her talk of the little flowers on fabric and the difference between Unitarians and Universalists and should she be punished for her perceived crimes.I read another book called The Red Tent where the author did a similar thing by taking a minor character from bible and developing a story around her. I felt like the author of The Red Tent did it right though. This author was trying for more than should be achieved in one book - or in a set of books. The story makes references to how much certain people valued Una's friendship, but then Una would do something like say - oh, you go do my shopping for me while I hang out with my newest friend. She just seemed too shallow for someone who was that revered by others.Some of the events in the book went a little over the top too. Toward the end of the book it all became a little nonsensical because people's reactions to their piled on tragedies didn't fit their characters. Plus the way she brought Ahab into the story seemed a little contrived. And everyone's sudden interest in astronomy and science. What was that about?All in all, I felt like the author was trying to present a deep character, but it came across to me like a woman whose life goals were either sewing or reading or maybe watching comets or something. There are definitely better books out there."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"If you are a shut-in who likes to keep one eye on the skies, this might be the book for you. Who was Ahab? You might well ask, he was a fictional character in Herman Melville's American Renaissance masterpiece Moby-Dick or The Whale, and his name has become a watchword for monomania and for obsession, particularly when lived in an all-male world of men and their pursuits. His quest to kill the white whale forms the backbone of Melville's Novel, and in Jeter Naslund's epic tale, it forms a significant subplot.You won't believe the adventures young UNA gets up to when, disguised as a teenaged boy, she sets sail on a whaler herself and becomes entangled, like Cukor's film of SYLVIA SCARLETT, with two very different men. Okay, it's a little farfetched, but it's still very romantic, and Una has a poetic voice that will remind readers with long memories of the late Elinor Wylie. Only you can tell if she was able to extend the captivating voice to cover the length of so many pages (nearly as long as Clinton's memoirs!) or if, somewhere along the way, Una becomes as shadowy as her elderly husband's plans for vengeance. In the meantime, it's a good romance for people with lots of time, and perhaps the perfect summer book for folks vacationing in Nantucket or Martha's Vineyard.No matter which, you'll enjoy it, it's a real page turner, at least for some of it."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I really enjoyed the characters and story in this book. I also thought the writing style was for the most part excellent and filled with memorable passages. I agree with some of the criticisms about it being a bit preachy in parts, but the main focus of the story was so enjoyable that it more then compensated any shortcomings. I would highly recommend this book even if you are not particularly interested in the ocean or whaling."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"This is an unfolding story of a woman's life and quest to find her authentic self. She bucks the traditional way of life of a mid 1850's female. It reminded me very much of &quot;Daughter of Fortune&quot; which was similar in that the female lead character charts her own course and blazes a trail toward redefining a woman's role in society and her search to find herself."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"To highlight one small aspect of this novel, the author does a wonderful job of portraying many positive relationships throughout the course of the novel.Although there are some relationships in the novel that have conflicts, the depiction of mother / daughter, father &quot;figure&quot; / daughter, female friendships, business partnerships, teacher / student, boss / employee, and husband / wife (or partner / partner) are generally strong, open, and powerful.Throughout the book, the compassion and devotion the character exhibits within these relationships is at times to a fault, but is generally something to be admired.Granted, this is a small component to a book with many facets. However, I found that this relationship theme was fascinating and added tremendous depth to each of the characters."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"Ahab's Wife is a work of art with characters who emcompass the full spectrum of good and evil. While Ahab looks outward and to Moby Dick to find his truth, Una searches inward for her truth and finds a spirituality worthy of our time. Una's journey to self is genuine and spontanteous, surprising and familiar. The story is rich in details (historical and fictional) which hand you a vibrant, authentic world."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"This should go on the required reading lists for schools. It's beautifully written, thought-provoking, and totally captivating, as well!"},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"Una is neither a villain nor a saint, but a human being doing the best she can in the circumstances in which she finds herself. One strength of the book is that the consequences of characters' actions do not magically go away. In many cases, those consequences last for a lifetime, although there may be some measure of healing with time and work.Once I started this book, I resented every time I had to put it down until I finished it."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"The title for my review says it all. I forced myself to finish this, reading long after it became a chore, just because I hoped it would get better. No such luck. The writing was just fair, becoming very disappointing after a good start, with recurrent episodes of shallow philosophical wandering contributing nothing. Plot unbelievable and immature in it's grandiosity. No message for anyone living in reality.

Although, I, too, found it very far-fetched that Una met so many 'famous' people from the 19th century, I decided not to be mad at the author (or her editor) for that. She, in my opinion, simply was carried away with her research. I found that I really like Una and that was enough for me to suspend my skepticism. I liked that she was so educated and liberal minded. I loved her curiosity and independence. I loved her passion and her unflinching love of life- no matter what price she paid for that life. This was a big read that lasted me more than a couple of days (a major accomplishment!). In fact, I enjoyed Una as much as I love Scout, from To Kill A Mockingbird- very likeable and plucky young ladies! I thoroughly enjoyed the book and even shared some of it with my Creative Writing students.

I understood this book...as clear as a bell. I will read it again someday, soon, just so I can have the same feeling, that glorious feeling, that there is still literary life in the universe. READ THIS BOOK. And then write and thank me."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"The prose was lovely; much of the story engrossing, but ultimately it was difficult to believe in Una as a woman of the mid-19th century. It's not very credible that she could reject or ignore the Christian belief and morality and prejudice that surrounded her. And for her to fortuitously have invested in petroleum and to have neatly met up and paired off with Ishmael to round off the story...Sorry, my belief is not that easily suspended."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I found this book very slow reading.

There are some incredible passages and the portrail of Uma's life is insightful and compelling, but untimately there was just a little too much detail and delay to keep me moving through the story and hold my interest. I had to put the novel down for several weeks before I could regain enough enthusiasm to pick it up and finish it, ultimately however I was glad I did. The earlier passages of Uma's life as a teenager and young woman are fascinating, but once she reaches full maturity the story slows to meet her slowing enthusiasm for adventure. Beautifully written but just a little too slow in the second half of the story."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I loved this book. It sweeps you away.

It gives the book a flavor with which one is familiar but the textures are all different.

I love the way the author lures you into the historical past with fictionalized accounts that bring the characters alive and make you want to actually befriend them. Una, Ahab's wife, is a headstrong, outspoken young woman who goes on adventures that would typically only be available to males. She survives through sheer will power and inner strength. The insurmountable adversities she faces make her stronger unlike her male counterparts that end in suicide and madness.

A constant &quot;bla, bla, bla&quot;, pages upon pages of lengthy conversations or monologues exploring each others or oneselves deepest &quot;feelings&quot;. One can skip entire chapters and still the story is no further along than just another pages long of Unas musings.

Trying to decifer the conversations became trying and it was only when 3/4 of the way through that I became interested in the plot. Although Una was indeed Ahab's wife, it was for a very short portion of the book. I realize that background was needed to introduce the character but this was a little rediculous. It should have had a different title."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"This book was way too long for it's own good. The main character didn't change from page 1 to page 666.

Disappointing!"},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I read this book on the glowing recommendation of a friend. But once I got started, I decided to go back at look at the reviews of this book. The reviews seem to go from one extreme to the other: 5 stars to 1 star. I'm in the 1 star camp.The first thing that annoyed me about this piece of fan fiction was the contrived use of language. It seemed to me she was trying very hard to sound like an 18th century writer, but I think she failed and she lapsed in and out of it. The story constantly comes to a halt so that we appreciate her flowery language to describe looking through a window pane or rolling a grain of sand around on my tongue - none of which moves the story forward.The next thing that assaulted me was the anti-Christian sentiments. I can deal with someone who has a different point of view than I do. But do you really expect me to believe that a 12-year old girl in this pervasively Christian time period is having these deep spiritual thoughts about the existence of God? Is willing to stand up to her Christian father and endure beatings for challenging his concept of whether God exists or Jesus is God?This is the point where I went back and read the reviews and decided I couldn't waste any more time on such a dreadfully dull and annoying book.Kindle readers ... get the sample first. You should be able to tell pretty quickly if you are in the 1 star or 5 star category."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I thought I was losing it as I wrestled to finish this book. Logged on to Amazon just to see what you all had to say about it. I was semi-smitten for the first 200 pages and since it's 666 (interesting number) long, I sincerely wanted it to be a great book.Soon I started saying &quot;what?&quot; quite often. Finally I realized that I really didn't like Una, nor did I care very much about her. One of my favorite irritating moments is the pie-baking episode with Frannie on p. 608 when it looked like it would be a &quot;touching&quot; reunion until Una bolts for the beach to begin her tome on a grain of sand. What??? Shakespeare she is not!! But she makes it back for a piece of pie.Everything reminded Una of something or someone else (Ch. 155). As someone pointed out, there were endless, poetic but often tedious ruminations of insignificant moments or scenes, while important events and happenings were glossed over and/or left incomplete. What??? Did you love her comments on Robben and the Judge's homosexual relationship? And, the needle, what's the significance of the needle as it too crops up in several strange and inappropriate places?I am disappointed. I'm wary when an author takes a snippet from a masterpiece and decides to do a spin-off. In my opinion, this book was too much, too many, too long! It had potential, it fell far short. Blame the author, blame the editor, whomever, we deserved better. I just wish my book club had selected Melville's original. Perhaps that's the answer....back to the classics!!"},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"Those who have read A HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE have probably yearned for a similar reading experience ever since they read that masterpiece. For me, AHAB'S WIFE fulfills that yearning. This ingeniously imagined book is loaded with real characters from the time of American history's greatest outpouring of literature and philosophicalthought: Emerson, Hawthorne, James, Bronson Alcott, Maria Mitchell, Frederick Douglass, and Margaret Fuller. (I don't recall that the creator of MOBY-DICK is mentioned; he was no doubt busy at his day job in New York at the time.) What we are given is a take on early nineteenth century life by one who writes of that time with such assurance and poetic beauty that one feels that Sena Jeter Naslund, too, has trafficked in the flowering of New England and she only is escaped alone to tell thee. As in Garcia-Marquez's epic, the reader--now sadder, happier, and wiser than he has any right to be--can only turn from the last page back to the first in hopes of reliving the enthralling experiences he has just experienced."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"That recent spate of imagined sequels to classics-&quot;Mrs. DeWinter,&quot; &quot;Cosette,&quot; whatever-they-were-called sequels to Jane Austen-were generally less than successful, which makes it all the more surprising that the least likely of them should be such a success. Mrs. Ahab? Are you kidding? Sena Jeter Naslund creates a very plausible relationship between her protagonist Una and Moby-Dick's pursuer, and very, very wisely makes it just one element in Una's life. &quot;Mrs. Ahab&quot; takes Una from her home in the Kentucky wilderness to a New England lighthouse, to sea on a whaling ship, to a fine home in bustling Nantucket. She deals with the hot button issues of the day in elegant detail, and makes Una's involvement in the abolitionist movement, the rise of Transcendentalist thought, and the age's fascination with the natural sciences believable and logical.Perhaps Naslund's greatest achievement is to create a protagonist who is bold, headstrong and passionate without making her seem like a 1990's woman decked out in a crinoline. Una is as modern as a woman of the 1830's and 40's would be. The author's historic research goes far beyond knowing what people wore and ate: we are shown how they regarded the remarkable advances being made in their time, and how they considered their world. Candace Siegle"},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I bought the book simply because I've read Melville and also most recently the Red Tent and thought &quot;hey this sounds as if it would be really interesting and would be along the same idea as the Red Tent&quot;. Unfortunately, the author fails to deliver a 'full-fleshed heroine' as the jacket promises. Instead you receive a detailed account of whaling and then historic leaps, contrived meetings (the heroine conveinently meets Margaret Fuller, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Henry James (as a mere child) Maria Mitchel and her father). Naslund fails to rely on her own ability to render the characters and relies heavily upon the contrived meetings of these historic personsages. She also introduces characters and has them reappear without any real purpose to the point of the story. One gets the basic premise - to thine own self be true. How could you not? It is only repeated - to the point of becoming nausating-to the reader. Una, the heroine, is her own self. All the other characters recognize this and of course tell her how wonderful it is that she is not tied down to beliefs of the time. Of course you can almost guess the ending - when it finally comes after 600 pages. Her interlude with Ahab is pitful. You never get a sense of them as a couple it is simply passed over. Una's response to Ahab's mania and to her first husband's madness is never fully addressed. She is never bothered by anything. She seems to be the Pooh, as in the Tao of Pooh, Una simply just is. No fretting or bellyaching for her. Towards the end Naslund does redeem herself with the introduction of Ishmael but it is too little too late. Her sequence from the Essex is also very amatuer. Isn't enough that Una stowes away as a cabin boy, must she also eat another sailor in order to live? Naslund was going purely for the drama, and shock value here. As I hail from Nantucket, I was not at all impressed by this work and would not recommend it unless you had not a clue about the Essex tragedy, Nantucket, the Whaling era or Melville. I was very disappointed. It had promise, it just did not deliver. I finished the book merely so I could write this review."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I truly wanted to like this book. After years of avoidance I had just finished Moby Dick and found it not only more readable than I'd feared but downright enjoyable. In addition I'd heard nothing but good things about this novel whose premise certainly intrigued me, and like its predecessor it has one of the truly great opening lines in literature: \\"Captain Ahab was neither my first husband nor my last.\\" Alas, it was all down hill from there; overall this is one of the worst books I've ever forced myself to finish.This came as quite a surprise because the author is no untalented hack. Author of two other published novels and a short story collection, director of a university level creative writing program, long-term teacher of writing, and holder of a Ph.D. in same, all to considerable critical acclaim, she should be correcting and grading (failing) garbage like this not producing it. So what went wrong? How did this novel end up so awful? The answer is brick by brick and piece by piece. There is no one great thing wrong with it but rather a lot of little things.LENGTH: If \\"brevity is the soul of wit\\", this novel's witlessness is easily explained. At 666 pages (interesting number that) this novel is about three times as long as it should have been. It would seem that, to some extent like Melville before her, Naslund confused Length with Importance, but Melville was a lot more skilled at padding than she is. IMHO this desire to fill too many pages made many of the other problems worse by allowing Naslund both to go into unnecessary detail about things no one else cares about and to repeat herself to the point of self-parody. Somewhere under the barnacle encrustations may be the finely lined hull of a short novel, but this was a manuscript desperately in need of editing... with a meat axe or a chainsaw.THE NAME DROPPING: One of the pleasures of any historical novel is the encounters between fictional characters and historical figures, but if badly handled these encounters can un-suspend disbelief and downright offend. They are badly handled here. An almost uneducated hick from the backwoods of Kentucky encounters by chance a significant number of the thoughtful elites of mid-nineteenth century New England and those she doesn't utterly charm with her brilliance and erudition she gets the better of as in her unintentionally hilarious encounter with Naslund's peculiar imagining of Nathaniel Hawthorne. One or two of these, developed at greater length could have added to the verisimilitude. As it is, it is a Zelig or a Forrest Gump without the humor (or the self-awareness).THE POLITICS: Even the most conservative readers would probably find the popular views of a majority of mid-nineteenth century New Englanders a bit disconcerting if espoused straight in a modern novel, so a certain amount of modernizing would be appropriate just to reduce the cringing. However, Naslund takes this to the opposite extreme by having Una espouse the Politically Correct view on every single controversy of the day (and some that only exist in our significantly sillier day) from slavery to whaling, from feminism to free love, from homosexuality to sensitivity towards the differently abled, all without consequence or even criticism. This latter is the most offputting because to have actually championed such views back then would have taken considerable courage whatever one thinks of the ideas themselves. Una espouses them with all the negative consequences that Naslund receives for espousing them today, which is to say: none.THE ANTI-CHRISTIAN BIGOTRY: There is nothing so very wrong with characters in a mid-nineteenth century novel exhibiting agnosticism or atheism as both views were gaining more and more credence at the time, but it is downright silly to suggest that such views would have been widely accepted. It is even sillier to portray Christianity as something confined exclusively to the foolish, the bigoted, the future apostate, or the mentally ill. It tells us more about the author than anything else that Una is openminded towards every religious and quasi-religious idea of the time EXCEPT Christianity.THE FARFETCHED SCENARIOS: I sensed the novel was in trouble during the opening scene in which Una loses both her mother and her baby but manages to withstand this blow by making friends with a runaway slave with whom she has a quasi-lesbian encounter.... After this the novel goes into flashback and becomes unrealistic. After her crazy Christian father threatens to kill her (a sentiment the reader will come to know and understand), Una is raised in a lighthouse by her ludicrously liberal-minded aunt and uncle, encounters two young men who both fall in love with her, disguises herself as a cabin boy and sails on the same whaler with them, successfully avoids detection, is sunk by a whale, survives by committing cannibalism, marries the surviving young man after he goes insane, and is abandoned by him after he goes to live with the Indians, leaving her free to \\"marry\\" Captain Ahab (Una never really \\"marries\\" anybody but of course nobody ever criticizes). Things don't get more realistic in the second half, which includes Una's clever and successful investment in the crazy newfangled idea of obtaining oil from the ground instead of from a whale. Riiiight.THE MARY SUE: However, the absolute worst thing about this novel is the fact that it is a \\"Mary Sue\\" that peculiarity of fan fiction in which a laughably idealized and practically perfect in every way alter ego of the author fulfills some basic psychological need while inducing a combination of anger and nausea in the reader. A more realistic main character might have saved it. Una never learns anything from her life's too-many-to-be-believed experiences because she already knows everything. She doesn't change because she is already perfect. She doesn't have to deal with the criticism of others because she doesn't receive any, and she doesn't have to beg the forgiveness of those she has wronged because they forgive her so easily and besides, Una had her reasons (and they were very good ones you can be sure).The only thing I can figure is that her publisher approved this book on concept alone WITHOUT anyone ever reading it. I feel like I've just waded through the inept scribbling of a delusional teenage girl who insists on rereading Moby Dick in her bedroom... with the door locked.Note: for an alternate take on Ahab's wife, I recommend Louise M. Gouge's simultaneously conceived but later published \\"Ahab's Legacy\\" trilogy:Ahab's Bride,Hannah Rose, andSon of Perdition, which IMHO are better written and MUCH more realistic."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"This is a fine entry in what's becoming an interesting little genre--imagining a character who would be 'the right woman' for some gigantic character of fiction. This may all have started with Jean Rhys's Wide Sargasso Sea, in which Rhys imagined herself into the head of Mr. Rochester's first wife, (the one who wound up locked in the attic for Jane Eyre to find). Then there's Mary Russell, the young thing who captures Sherlock Holmes in Laurie King's engaging series. Una Spenser, the heroine of this novel, is a well-imagined match for her second husband, Captain Ahab. There's a kind of high-class fictional fleshing out of a crush in these novels, where the smart little girls who sighed over these big, bad, anti-heroes, are finally getting -- through fiction -- to MARRY them. And guess what? Mrs. Holmes and Mrs. Ahab appear as women who are thoroughly atypical for the times in which the stories are set, though perfect superwomen for our 21st century feminist taste. This is a very literate novel with a good, engaging story to tell. The research behind it has been excellent and thorough. The world it covers is large--and perhaps it gets even a little out of hand in being so comprehensive. Moby Dick (the comparison is after all invited) will forever remain a far greater novel, with its furious focus on the microcosmic Pequod and the intractable mind of Captain Ahab--whom I'll bet was never imagined by Melville as either the great lover nor the frustrated impotent that Naslund makes of him, 'dismasted'. Naslund does a great job of inventing a woman to walk around and view the odd corners of Melville's world. But but the inventor of the White Whale still holds the untarnished title of great American novelist for me, and Una, attractive as she is, is still a bit of an interloper in a world that a greater mind owns. On the other hand, three cheers for the beautiful illustrations by Christopher Wormell. They are something special!"},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"Never having been much of a rebel, I fear admiting that I detested this book with a depth of passion I have rarely felt. The premise was wonderful, and Naslund certainly can craft lovely prose. However, from the dramatic beginning, each episode of the heroine's life grew increasingly implausible. I realize the intention was to place twentieth century sensibilities in a nineteenth century world, but did Una have to encounter (and nobly aid) every marginalized group in existance? Have every extreme life experience? Meet every famous person who visited Nantucket? What is the likelihood that a nineteenth century woman really would have had a handy and stereotypically male chum to accompany her on her shopping trips? Most importantly, was it necessary for Una to be so revoltingly smug? Though it does add a new dimension towards explaining why Ahab became so obsessed with that whale - anything to get out of the house is my guess.Beyond these personal issues of taste, I was annoyed by the negative stereotyping of the Christian characters. Naslund's own religious/cultural biases intruded upon the book in several important ways. To wit, I found myself wondering if Naslund had actually ever read anything by Hawthorne, or if he just served as a device for her own prejudices. The extent to which she seemed to misunderstand his writings was surprising in what appeared to be a generally well-researched book.On a more positive note, I was glad I worked my way through the entire book. What carried me through my hope that Una would fall victim to Moby Dick (or any convenient device of death). While I was doomed to be disappointed at her continual triumphs, my patience was rewarded in an unexpected way. Don't worry - there are no spoilers here! It is just that the ending is wonderfully (and, I imagine, unintentionally) hilarious, and almost justified the effort expended getting through this one."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I began page 1 of this book to see what it was like and was on about page 30 before I even thought of looking up. It had me totally engrossed in the character, her adventures, and the beautiful writing. Some of the visual images are still with me -- especially the lighthouse of her girlhood, riding with her in the lookout perch high above the whaling ship, and the winter scenes. The only thing I found a tad annoying was that the &quot;name dropping &quot; was a little heavy-handed in the last quarter of the book. But I basically reveled it the book, and have highly recommended it to several of my &quot;serious reader&quot; friends. If you want to read it for adventure alone, read just the first half. If you want something more to think about, read the whole thing. Personally, I think I'll wait a few months and read it again!"},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"Ms. Naslund has presented us with a gem ... the character of Una, a female protagonist that is unapologetically intelligent, passionate, strong and independent. The story will &quot;ring true&quot; to all who have journeyed into the valley of suffering and shaken the bony hand of the devil that resides within each of us. Moreover it is a story of redemption, of joy found in the face of adversity, of forgiveness extended from one flawed soul to another. I read the entire book in two nights, and wanted to go back to the first page almost as soon as I'd turned the last. It is without question one of the finest books I have ever read."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I accidentally received this book through my book club. I didn't order it. I knew nothing of it. But there it was. I sat down one summer evening to see if it was anything worth reading. I was immediately yanked by the collar into Una's world. The opening sentence made me grin, being one of the better opening lines I have read in awhile. This book completely enveloped me. I know I am held fast by a novel when, after I put it down, I find myself thinking and speaking in the same tone as which the book is written, taking a few minutes to shake this tone and return to self. The language is breathtaking. Images of lighthouses, trying pots, and widow's walks remain. One less star than five stars because of my feeling that the plot started getting too muddy towards the end. The first 3/4 of the book, where most of your time is spent luxuriating in the lengthy, all encompassing descriptions given by Una was much more appealing than moving the plot towards a conclusion. I am currently reading it again and carve out a special nitch in my evening to devote to this book."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"Una Spenser narrates her life from a childhood in Kentucky to an upbringing in Nantucket to life aboard a whaling ship and all of her marriages in-between. But \\"Ahab's Wife\\" is less of tale of events and more a tale of a young woman's spiritual journey. So readers should not expect a twist-turning plot or cliff-hanging suspense. Rather the reader should expect a creative tale richly told.I would have given \\"Ahab's Wife\\" 5-stars but I thought author Sena Jeter Naslund's prose was a little heavy-handed. I just feel that written prose should be like perfume where a little is intriguing but a lot becomes overpowering. I thought Ms Naslund's prose-rich writing made for a rather slow read. Enjoyable but slow. If you have the time \\"Ahab's Wife\\" would make a rewarding effort."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"The beginning of the book was a bit plodding, and the last 100 or so pages too easy and trite. But the middle 2/3 was powerful, engaging, and very moving. My breath was taken away at times by its sheer force. The writing style harkened back to the 19th century, which I found generally lent itself well to creating the appropriate atmosphere. I would highly recommend reading this book just to experience the power of the action and writing in the middle 2/3."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I thought the imagery and turn of phrase was well done and brought to mind 19th century writings. However, when I shortly thereafter read, &quot;In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex&quot;, I felt cheated. Una's sea voyage is almost a carbon copy of the Essex tragedy, down to some of the smallest details. It was disappointing to find such a huge part of the plot was so unoriginal and almost plagaristic."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I loved this book in a way I've only loved a very few books in my life. From the first sentence, I was lost in Sena Jeter Naslund's evocative language. I breathed every breath with Una for the two weeks it took me to read her story, and I didn't want it to end.Reading some of the other reviews, I wonder whether some of you read the same book I did. I did not find Una's beliefs to be at all anachronistic. Why do so many people assume that *all* people in 19th century Nantucket must necessarily have been devout Christians? That is as absurd as assuming that all modern-day people are atheists and humanists.I cannot recommend this book highly enough. The language is sublime, the characters richly drawn and believable, the story as gripping as anything else I've read. Don't deny yourself the pleasure of of meeting Una Spenser. She is a heroine for the ages."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"This is a near perfect read, save for the irritating interweaving of historic characters. It is a quilt of the history and literature of the 19th century. If only the ending had been stronger!"},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"Some reviewers claim Ahab's Wife was too long. It ended too soon for me. Great literature and I will read it again and again. Buy it. Read it."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"One of the best books I have read recently. The principle character has a depth of personality not often seen in characters, although she sometimes stretches the bounds of credibility. The scope of her travels and the description of her surroundings in each place makes this book a real treat for those who read visually."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I enjoyed 'Ahab's wife' and read it without pause. It was interesting and stimulating, well written. The main character is a very unusual woman, so unusual in her freedom of thought and behavior and so surrounded by other unusual people to appear, by the end, slightly implausible. That and the repeating pattern of coming across characters that feel compelled to confess their secrets to her are my minor criticisms to this book. 'Ahab's wife' is also interesting as an overview of an era of change in American culture, particularly in relation to religious thoughts and human rights issues (slavery and women's rights). What I found most intriguing and interesting was, in the end, the ability to engage my mind in new, different thoughts about life in general and women's lives in particular."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"In this profound work of the imagination, S. J. Naslund has created one of the most fascinating works of fiction I have ever read. Not since childhood when I spent hours curled up in a chair absorbed in the fictional worlds of Hawthorne, Steinbeck, Hemingway, and, of course, Melville, have I so lost myself to a story. For the last three weeks, I have grabbed every spare moment to visit with Una Spencer, who uses her wits and her imagination to overcome tragedy time and time again. The chapters on stargazing and needlework alone are a masterwork--parallel to the rope coiling and sea-watching in _Moby Dick_. At last, I have finished the story, but Una lives on in my mind. I will look for her on the beach the next time I visit Nantucket! Thank you, Ms. Naslund, for pursuing this heroic character till she captured you."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"As a reader and a quilter I finished Ahab's Wife with similar feelings: satisfaction, accomplishment, and a reassuring connection with tradition. This book is as modern as today's news with its frank discussions of religion, sex and homosexuality, racism, the environment, insanity, feminism, the march of technology, and, of course, love. Yet, Ms. Naslund's elegantly simple language and strong character development carry us back to the time whaling was an essential industry and America was on the brink of civil war. To those who contend that Herman Melville should not be tampered with, I would ask how they define a classic. What these well intentioned but unimaginative folk are saying is that classics are so fragile, they will be damaged by interpretation, examination, and the addition of new chapters to the story. (I, for one, am very curious about the adult Huck Finn.) A quilter takes a centuries old pattern and uses contemporary fabrics and techniques to make a new quilt. This process does not diminish the old. On the contrary, it makes both richer and more cherished. Sena Jeter Naslund offers readers the opportunity to rediscover Moby Dick, if they choose, and introduces us to a fascinating, spunky, and compelling new character and a romantic story any reader can get wonderfully lost in. I thank her."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I read this book for the first time this summer. I loved the imagery the words created and the story told from a woman's point of view. Even though there is no great adventure going on, I had a hard time putting the book down."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"BOOK WAS IN GREAT CONDITION.

Ms. Naslund should win the Pulitzer for this one!"},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"It wasn't very far into this book that it became clear it was written by a rebel child of the 1960s trying to create a historical character that would transfer the evils and selfishness that linger today in American society to origins in an earlier time. Claim the damage done by her generation already existed. Blame it on slavery, or lack of opportunities for women. The problem is, all Naslund manages to do in this book is reinforce her own generation's guilt. Almost all of Una's actions convey contempt for God and/or Christianity and a reverence for humanism. Even as she desensitizes herself to the evil acts around her, and later in her guilt over a terrible deed, she turns to blaming love and forgiveness and embracing the ways of the lost. I feel pity for the author. She writes of Una's Christian father as some sort of devil incarnate, while the rest of her 'openminded' family are written with utmost love and sympathy - justification for the author's own life of self-focus but unhappiness? I could almost feel Naslund's desperation screaming from each page. Truly sad, and even more sadly, a waste of time."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"If only the entire book could have been as captivating as the opening chapter. The author is a good writer in need of a good &amp; honest editor. There were parts that were brilliant and parts that were just padding. And this is a good example of what computer editing/spell checking can mean -- the book is littered with faux pas like using the word &quot;receipt&quot; twice when the author meant &quot;recipe.&quot; Good writers won't let those things slip, and good editors (not computers) can catch them when they do."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I just don't understand this. Ahab's wife? What? And she's been married before and since? Wow. That certainly degenerates our classic obsessor even more. What is with all these books trying to spin off other things that were better. Dune: House of Atreides? Doctor Who: Interference? Casablanca: As Time Goes By? Young Indiana Jones: Treasure of the Peacock's Eye? What's wrong with keeping the integrity of the originals by not taking revisionist approaches to that which inspired you. Why does everything need &quot;Further&quot; and &quot;Missing&quot; adventures. To make a buck? This was Moby Dick. Where will this madness end?!!"},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"To the reader from St. Louis -- there are far, far easier ways to make a buck (romances, espionage novels, mysteries) than writing AHAB'S WIFE, and to suggest that as Naslund's modus operandi is laughable!"},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"It's only protein! Get over yourselves! That was the most interesting section of the book, when Una goes on board a whaling ship, and they are sunk by a BLACK whale (Una works in the Crow's Nest and actually sees Moby Dick before she even meets Ahab). Silliness.I will say it has one of the best first lines ever: Captain Ahab was neither my first husband nor my last. Good line. Too bad the rest wasn't as engaging! Too many characters with too little characterization. And what's with that eagle at the lighthouse? I didn't believe that scene at all, and I should have stopped right there. It's a feminist treatise with some nice writing in between. The end made me want to gag.All in all it made me want to read \\"Moby Dick\\". Nice illustrations. Give it fifty pages and see what you think. Some people in our book club loved it! Go figure."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"The grostesque offspring of looney feminism and a trashy romance novel. The novel begins with the heroine, Una, lying in bliss with Ahab in the grass. Sorry- has anyone who has read Moby Dick really imagined him as the sort of chap to do such a thing? The author is entitled to taking her own spin on things, however...why must the novel be so politicized? Naslund grafts attacks on every modern social bugbear into the novel. Racism? Una fights racism and has a tryst with great black leader, Frederick Douglas. Sexism? She passes herself off as a male sailor and does just as good as the guy, thank you very much. Traditional gender roles? Heck no- Una runs away and takes up all sorts of masculine activities!Please- tell me a story, don't beat me over the head with nearly 700 pages of overheated, preachy prose."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"Ahab's Wife gives readers a fresh look at Ahab and represents the thinking of a strong American woman who survives hardship that all women face. She faces a multitude of husbands and remains a fervent feminist, with different look at sewing as something that rather empowers a woman.This is rich, powerful, stirring and every other complimentary cliche word you can think of to describe a book. There are twists without unreasonable drama and contemplation about life from a woman who is no great philosopher but who is strong, weather beaten and above all, normal.A great read. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"This book came highly recommended and got some great blurbs, but in my opinion is quite overrated. The writing isn't particularly good, and there really isn't much meat. There are actually no REAL descriptions of most of the action. For instance, we know she and her two pals hated turning to cannibalism, but that's all (compare/contrast to \\"Life of Pi\\" by Yann Martel, which if full of gory detail of being stranded at sea, but that's what makes it real!). By the way, when one starving animal eats another starving animal, they still starve to death, because of the lack of essential fatty acids. Most mainstream fiction editors appear to have little if any knowledge of science, unfortunately. I came away from this read with very little in the way of vicarious experience and only a few (repetitive) visual images. It reads like a pretentious but untalented teenager's diary."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I have read several of the other reviews here and noted that, for many, the book was over long and could have benefited from some more severe editing. Perhaps, then, for once an abridged version is an improvement.I did not read the unabridged text, but made an exception to my usual rule and listened to the abridgement (approx. 6 hours running time). I found it fascinating and beautifully written. The characters were finely drawn, despite the shortening of the content, and the book felt complete, not chopped up or episodic, as happens so often with abridged versions.The reader, Maryanne Plunkett, was excellent, making it sound as though the protagonist was actually telling the tale.I particularly enjoyed some of the \\"sideline\\" elements of the book, such as the references to Unitarianism and Universalism (I am a UUer) and to Maria Mitchell, one of my historical heroes.All in all, I enjoyed the book and think it might be just the ticket for those wanting to taste the flavor of the original without wading through all seven courses."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"Yes, this is a long book, but it is a wonderful journey that I did not want to end. I most enjoyed getting to know this character better as each chapter passed. Don't rush through this satisfying tale. It's a true delight."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"\\"Captain Ahab was neither my first husband nor my last\\" drew me to Sena Jetter Naslund's story as strongly as Herman Melville's opening line in Moby-Dick \\"Call me Ishmael.\\" Ahab's Wife is a mid-19th century tale of a \\"young girl-wife's\\" survival and growth. Mrs. Captain Una Ahab, a title earned, adventure begins when puberty and eligible young men arrive while she is isolated on a lighthouse island. Una's journey off the island forces her to ponder questions of religious fate, divinity, motherhood, madness, cannibalism, slavery, bounty hunters, revenge, chauvinism, ship mates, soul mates, infant death, grief, widows with their husbands alive at sea, sea-law marriages and divorces, widow makers -black whales, white whales, sperm whales and the joys of life even after widowhood.Instead of being fated as a spinster atop the grill work encircling the lighthouse lens, a figurehead aloft a whalers masthead or a sea wife pacing her widow-walk, Una survives on her strength of purpose. \\"I have found a way to wish till things happen\\" explains Una. \\"There was nothing abject about you,\\" states Judge Lord \\"You had your purpose, your wish. Did you get your wish? Yes. That alone saves any human from abjectness. \\"In the old fairy tales, it is the strength of the wish that transforms life. The wish is itself the magic wand.\\"While mankind struggles with the strength of will, prayer, dreams, hopes, aspirations and wishes, Naslund teaches the reader through Una, how to imagine themselves out of tragedy. That alone is worth the read."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I had a hard time starting and staying with this book, but it was well worth it! The writing is pure poetry. The thoughts are straight out of my head. The characters are very brave and very believable. The context is full of variety and veracity.Love it."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"Amazing imagery allows the reader to &quot;be there.&quot; This book is definitely a keeper as it will be one I will read again. There is simply too much to be absorbed in one reading."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I never found it. If it was there, it was lost in 600+ pages of wordiness and philosophical rambling that seem to have no purpose, other than perhaps to ensure we understand that this is &quot;literature&quot; and not mere fiction. I felt the story was contrived and full of plot twists that made no sense and an ending that was just preposterous. And in the last chapter Una says something about always wanting to be a teacher; I don't know where *that* came from, as there's no mention in any of the previous 600-odd pages about her desire to teach. I finished this because I bought it; if I'd gotten it from the library, I probably would have taken it back after about 100 pages."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"The first line in this book is brilliant, \\"Ahab was neither my first husband nor my last.\\" It was all down hill after that. Naslund certainly likes to hear herself talk (write). She pontificates on a plethora of topics. She self-importantly weaves her \\"heroine\\" through a goodly portion of the current events of her time. Occasionally the prose tightens up and then she starts blathering again. We read this for one of my book clubs and save for one woman this was more or less the consensus. A man in our group thought the women would like it as he considered it chick lit, however, we soon set him straight on that point. Una seemed to be a user of others; a woman that sucked the life out of those around her. She was a woman without a soul on a spiritual quest. Portrayals like this do women in general a great diservice."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"Ahab's Wife serves admirably as a companion book to Melville's Moby-Dick and having read both, I think I can safely say that if Herman Melville were to read Ahab's Wife, he would be more than happy with the duty and accuracy Naslund devotes to the period, the prose, and its homage to Melville's opus.This is the life story of Una, the wife of Ahab - the peg-legged determined-bordering-on-insane captain of the Pequod in search of his white whale. The cover of the book depicts a Puritan-clothed woman on a harsh beach looking out into a rough sea, while further down the beach lies the broken hulk of an old ship. It creates images and ideas of a worrying woman left at home for years at a time to tend to house and children, while her husband is out braving the sea, fighting giants monsters in his man's world. One would think this a book about her everyday actions, her chores, her repetitive characteristics, and while this is part of the book, there is so much more going on in Una's life with her triumphs and tribulations, her loves and deaths, her dangerous adventures, and her happy times at home. This is what makes Ahab's Wife a welcome companion to Moby-Dick, for while Ahab's is a story of adventure and danger, Una's is just as much so.The book begins, as all life stories should, with a birth, only Una's mother is all alone in a cabin and naturally it is a birth that almost kills her. Una's life is a harsh one in Kentucky and before she is ten, her mother sends her away to her aunt's. Una's father is a devout Christian, while Una is an atheist from a young age, choosing not to blindly believe in what her father tells her to believe. Her mother fearing for her life, sends her to the distant coast of New England to live with her aunt and uncle in a lighthouse. And so begins the next chapter in her life, with a different family, in a different place. With the arrival of two men who come to upgrade the lighthouse, she falls in love with both of them - even though she is still young - knowing that one will be her husband one day. At the age of eighteen, she leaves the island and the lighthouse for the mainland of Boston and then Nantucket getting by on simple work until she finds the same two men whom she loves on a whaling ship. Disguising herself as a young boy she joins the crew and experiences the whaling life of her future husband. It is here that she first sees The Pequod and meets Ahab, who by then is an old man but still respectable and honorable. Ahab is the one to marry Una to Kit when her existence on the ship, love for that man, and her femininity are all revealed.A whale stoves in the ship and Una spends many days on a small boat with the remaining crew reduced to cannibalism - harking to the story of Moby-Dick as well as the story of the whale ship Essex, which was the impetus for Melville's story. It is on the return journey to Nantucket that the other love of her life dies tragically and her husband Kit essentially goes insane. Upon returning to land and leaving her husband due to his condition, Una's life slows down and her relationship with Ahab begins until their marriage and happiness together. It is here that the story of Moby-Dick truly begins and the reader gets to meet the familiar characters of the classic book. But while Ahab spends years away from home, Una's life goes on with the birth of a child and the struggles of her life. It is upon the return and meeting of Ishmael that Una learns of the doomed story of Ahab, his white whale, and his death.The book could be considered technically over at this point, but this is the story of Una, who is still very much alive. The rest of her life is spent interacting with Ishmael and even meeting and interacting with the slave who fought for his freedom, Frederick Douglass. And while she never forgets her life with Ahab, she eventually finds another husband and in the waning years of her life is happy once more.What makes Ahab's Wife a truly impressive book is not just its intended mimicry with Moby-Dick with the crossing over characters, similar layout of the book with many chapters and illustrations, and actual scenes involving the same location in both books such as the church with the pulpit carved to imitate the bow of a ship which the same preacher from Moby-Dick climbs the ladder to the top and scream of hellfire and damnation; it is the prose and how Naslund writes that truly emulates the style of Melville, making this a truly important work of literature deserving a place in the shelves with Melville, James and Hawthorne.For more book reviews, and other writings, go to www.alexctelander.com"},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"I started out Ahab's Wife completely oblivious to what might have been. For nearly all of the book, I was rewarded with beautiful prose, well-spun scenes, vibrant characters and plots that pulled me right in.However, the end of the book was so preposterous, so far-fetched that I was immediately allergic to all previous text. That Naslund could take such a brilliant work to that point and give such a farciful ending left me feeling cheated.I can't pan it completely. Naslund writes with incredible description and philosophical insight. I just can't bring myself to forgive her for leaving me hanging this way."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"This is one of the best books I have read in a very long time.

I can't put it down, but am FORCING myself to, just to make it last longer! I'm enjoying the sheer beauty of her writing so much I don't want it to end. Una is one of the most remarkable heroines I've ever encountered, and this has been/still is one of the most satisfying books I've read in a long time.Follow-up after finishing the book: Well, I've changed my rating from 5 to 4 stars. The last 1/4 of the book just didn't cut it for me. It didn't have the drive and forward momentum I felt in the beginning and middle sections. It felt like random vignettes. It became tedious to finish.But all-in-all, I'm still glad I spent time with this book."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"We read this for our book club this month after doing the backgound of seeing the old movie, Moby Dick. I kept looking for Moby Dick and hoping he would end it all a lot sooner than 700 pages. Una's story was too involved to hold my interest for long periods of time. I would have enjoyed reading it as several shorter novels that didn't have me going here and there, back and forth. For those of you who are committed to whaling and interwining stories, this is an author whose novel you might enjoy."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"With a brisk pace and a stunning evocative power that ranks it up there with 'The Triumph and the Glory' and 'Blue at the Mizzen', this exceptional novel fulfilled all of my expectations from beginning to end.

I loved the book by Herman Melville and I think that this book is superb. Ahab's wife being mentioned only once in the book the author did not have alot to work with but in my oponion I think that she has created a work that is very memorable and will last. Anyone who has read Melville and enjoyed him in the slitest bit should read Ahab's Wife. It is well worth your time to read this book."},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"What a pleasure it was to read this wonderful story of a young woman, Una Spenser, whose strong spirit guides her through life, extracting all the wonders to be found. Through Una, we meet many unforgettable characters, such as Susan, the runaway slave, David, the resourceful &quot;little person&quot;, and, of course, the powerful Captain Ahab himself. Reading this book has been one of my life's treasured experiences!"},{"Title":"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer","review":"This book is perfectly dreadful. I wanted to like it because the author is from my hometown, but it is so, so bad. The worst novel I have read in many years. The protagonist, the story-- completely unbelievable. The author portrays Una as this woman with very modern sensibilities, very p.c. Where did this come from? Despite the fact that she has no formal education, she meets every possible literary and famous personage in the area, and not only that, she wows them with her erudition. The name dropping in this novel is outrageous because it serves no purpose in the story. Oh, who have we here, why it's Frederick Douglass why don't you go stand over there by Emerson and Whitman. Ridiculous.I agreed with a reviewer earlier who said this book was like Everybody loves Una, because no matter what she does, everybody likes her, understands her, there is never any reproach and she is considered brilliant and compassionate. She doesn't learn from anything that happens to her, because she is already so accomplished and right-thinking.The love story passages are very-romance novelish.The author throws in details to make the story even more dramatic which ultimately serve no purpose whatsoever and, like I said, strain the believableness of the story too much.Why this book is considered by some to be a complement to Moby Dick I could not understand at all, either.I could go on and on with the things I didn't like. I can't believe I read the whole thing. I kept thinking something had to get better because this book was well-reviewed when it first came out. But it doesn't get better, it gets worse."},{"Title":"The Bottoms: Lettered Edition","review":"I've read all of Joe Lansdale's novels, and a significant percentage of his short stories. I believe that &quot;The Bottoms&quot; may be his best book yet. This novel finds Lansdale exploring new narritive and stylistic territory while staying within many of his traditional themes. This may also be his most accesible book to date, and should gain him some new readers whose sensibilities might be too fragile for some of Joe's earlier horror novels.&quot;The Bottoms&quot; is indeed a horror novel, a genre that Lansdale has not explored for a number of years. Really though, it might be more proper to call this a hybrid of the crime/detective, horror, and traditional literary forms. There are elements of all of these, but no single aspect is overemphasized.The story is set in 1930's East Texas and centers around a family living in a small town called Marvel Creek. The narration is from the point of view of an old man, near death, telling the story from the point of view of himself as a teenager. The author's narrative execution is truly masterful. Lansdale manages to capture both the point of view of the teenage boy and the elderly man, so that we see everything through both aspects of the same person.The story itself is also constructed with a master's touch. This is a longish novel (more than 400 pages), and the gradual buildup, climax, and denouement are perfectly paced and executed. Many people are primarily familiar with Lansdale through his Hap and Leonard books, but &quot;The Bottoms&quot; is a much different animal. The pacing is much slower, and there is an innocence and wonder that pervades the whole book. As always, though, the best thing about a Joe Lansdale novel is the characters. I feel like I know these characters. It's the characters that will grab you and keep you there for the whole book.Lansdale never disappoints. It's amazing to me the variety that I always find in his novels. In recent months, I have read &quot;Freezer Burn&quot;, &quot;Waltz of Shadows&quot;, &quot;Blood Dance&quot;, and &quot;The Bottoms&quot;. Each of these books is totally different from the others, yet they all have that Lansdale quality. &quot;The Bottoms&quot; is some of Lansdale's best writing to date. Don't hesitate."},{"Title":"Los Perros Magicos de Los Volcanes / Magic Dogs of the Volcanoes","review":"i'm currently living in El Salvador and found this book online when looking for traditional Salvadorean legends on which to base a drama production. I was delighted by the story, which is accessibly presented in both English and Spanish, and which features enchanting details to make adults smile as they read to their children. The beautiful illustrations add to the enjoyment of this story - I intend to buy a copy to send to my 2 year old godson in England - he will adore it."},{"Title":"Los Perros Magicos de Los Volcanes / Magic Dogs of the Volcanoes","review":"This is an excellent story, well told with colorful illustrations. It opens children's eyes to compassion, offering a story of hope and reconciliation. Excellent for children and for adults, too - it went over well in a class in Hispanic culture at Wofford College."},{"Title":"Los Perros Magicos de Los Volcanes / Magic Dogs of the Volcanoes","review":"This book, while serving as an excellent and colorful children's fairy tale, also has some layers that are invisible to the untrained eye, but satisfying for the person with a little knowledge of modern Salvadoran history. Although the concept of the cadejo goes back a long way in Central American culture, Argueta has hidden a subtle commentary on the political history of El Salvador inside this fun-loving tale. It's no coincidence, for instance, that the number 14 occurs in the description of the landowners who send the lead soldiers to teach a lesson to those workers who have the nerve to think they should get to rest once in a while, or eat; look up the reference \\"fourteen families\\" (catorce familias in Spanish) to make the allusion emerge clearly within this charming tale.Don't get me wrong -- if you want your child simply to read this story as a fairy tale, that will be possible, even easy to accomplish. The story stands on its own two (four?) feet without any need to introduce the allegorical aspects. All the same, there's a good reason this story was excerpted for an intermediate college Spanish textbook ... there's a lot more going on here than meets the eye."},{"Title":"The Other","review":"I really liked this book. One thing I didn&#8217;t realize when I began reading it, is that it&#8217;s an older book. Originally coming out in 1971 it has a mass following. First several people I told I was reading it couldn&#8217;t stop raving about it. That was good to hear. I truly enjoyed how the author concentrated on both brothers and just didn&#8217;t tell us the gory details without how those surrounding the twins reacted and were affected by them.Seeing as how this book was originally written in the early 70&#8242;s, it was the start of authors writing about psychological issues in such a blunt narrative manner. Nowadays many authors take that route. I would suggest 90 percent of them go back and read this book to see how it&#8217;s down correctly.What makes this book so expertly written is his gift for understatement. Sure he can lay out every gory nasty detail for us to get our hands dirty. But he understands that&#8217;s no fun for us. He gives us the freedom of using our minds and work the scene out. We certainly aren&#8217;t passive readers here. This is a great read. If you haven&#8217;t picked it up, or hasn&#8217;t been handed down by friends or family, you must pick this up."},{"Title":"The Other","review":"Thomas Tryon's film version (1972) is slightly different from the novel but just as compelling. Watch it for comparision. I had a chance to meet Chris and Marty Udvarnoky soon after filming wrapped up. I'm also a twin and the same age. Their father was my music teacher and introduced us! Sadly, Chris died in October 2010."},{"Title":"The Other","review":"[...]Thomas Tryon was first a move star...and a very talented and good-looking one at that. I remember him well. \\"The Other\\", in my opinion, is truly one of the best horror books ever written. It has been some years since I read it...but I've never forgotten Mr's Tryon's ability to truly capture your attention and keep you guessing what was really going on. His artistic ability as an author is not as well-known as should be. He passed away some time ago...Sadly...for who knows what other wonderful works we may have seen by this great writer and talented actor. If you haven't read this one, and you are a horror fan, you should read it. I guarantee you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Other","review":"I gave this book four stars, instead of five, only because it did progress slowly in parts. Overall it is a great story, spooky, and kept me guessing as to the ending!"},{"Title":"The Other","review":"I read this book years ago when it was newly published. I passed it around from friend to friend until my copy disappeared. I consider it the best psychological thriller of all. Thanks,Amazon"},{"Title":"The Other","review":"For a while now I've been searching for the horror novel that would scare me witless. This is one of the books that regularly shows up on various lists and discussions of the most frightening novels. It must be said that if you're a mother or grandmother of tween boy(s), then I can imagine some nightmares resulting from this book; however, for me, it just wasn't scary.That said, the book is quite well written, and if the few first-person introductory pages look like red flags for a down-homier-than-thou slog through a painful pastiche of dialect prose, trust that it isn't. The author's style is unusual, perhaps half of the dialogue isn't in quotation marks, which is something I have little tolerance for, yet the author pulls it off quite well. The style feels like a third-person narrative with unintended first-person musings woven through, quite subtly, which is probably exactly what the author was going for.Once the story got rolling, it becomes compelling and engrossing. \\"The Other\\" is a Very Good Novel. If I hadn't been hoping so strongly for goosebumps and being afraid to sleep with the light off, I would have given it five stars.One should note that the book should be approached with lowered expectations of the ferocity and breadth of the violence: Tryon makes no attempt to be graphic or shocking. This novel is more like true crime, where a single, bloodless death is a horrific tragedy. \\"The Other\\" feels real and prosaic; it's not fantastical horror; it's not a slasher novel."},{"Title":"The Other","review":"i read this book many yeawrs ago and decided to buy it again and read it. I enjoyed it but will not read it again."},{"Title":"The Other","review":"I read this back in the mid-70s when I was 12 or 13 and it had just come out in paperback. I thoroughly enjoyed it then and again a bazillion years after I first read it."},{"Title":"The Other","review":"I read this book when it first came out about forty years ago. Beautifully, even lyrically, written, it had me guessing to its tragic conclusion. This time around--since I already knew the surprise ending--I read it more for the pleasure of the language and the superb tale-telling. This must be one of the finest horror novels of the last century."},{"Title":"The Other","review":"Tryon does everything exactly right in this novel, a classic psychological horror story. I envy anyone encountering it for the first time."},{"Title":"The Other","review":"&quot;The Other&quot; is the best horror story I have ever read. The atmosphere is chilling, austere, and creepy throughout. I read it while camping in Europe more than 20 years ago and got to the thrilling, surprise plot twist deep in the night. This twist produced an electric shudder in the gut. Written from the perspective of one of a set of young twin boys, the inner dialogue of this character feels genuine. The plot speeds you along on a can't-put-it-down read, despite much interior action."},{"Title":"The Other","review":"This book is a mystery clear to the end. Suspense keeps the pages turning and shock grips you when you discover the secret that twins Holland and Niles share. You read the book taking a very key element of the book for granted, only to find at the end that you have been living inside the mind of one of the characters rather than in the real world. I can say no more without giving the book away, but it is a wonderful read. They don't make books like this anymore!"},{"Title":"The Other","review":"When I saw the movie and realized that Thomas Tryon was the author, I read the book as soon as I could. It is a book that is hard to put down and harder to forget. I wish everyone could read this novel, they will not be disappointed. This is an excellent story and is second only to &quot;Harvest Home&quot; and &quot;Lady&quot; (also by Tryon). He is a gifted writer with an unigue style of writing that makes the reader identify emotionally with the characters. He is truly one of my favorite writers. Unfortunately he passed away while writing his last novel &quot;Night Magic&quot;, an extraordinary book as well, and soon to be a movie. I will truly miss this talented person."},{"Title":"The Other","review":"Once upon a time there was a somewhat forgettable actor named Thomas Tryon who starred in a series of very forgettable movies (\\"The Cardinal\\" and a few others). Mr. Tryon wisely decided to forget about the forgettable and sat down and wrote a spooky little Gothic novel called \\"The Other\\". The result is an absolutely superb, un-put-downable, unforgettable horror story.\\"The Other\\" tells us the story of the Perry twins, Niles and Holland, 13 years old, identical twins born on either side of midnight, who have not only different birthdays, but, in a true stroke of fictional genius, different astrological signs. Looking so alike that no one can tell them apart, they are as different as day from night, one friendly and sunny and outgoing, and the other deep, dark and diabolically evil. Their father is dead, their mother imprisoned inside her own creeping madness, and their Russian-born grandmother, Ada, blessed or cursed with the Sight, has a game she likes to play, handed down through generations: put yourself inside something or someone else, and be that person. One of her grandsons learns this game all too well, and Ada, realizing what she has set in motion, is unable to stop the horror that is about to engulf the whole family.The story takes place mostly during a long, lazy Connecticut summer in the 1930's, and as the temperature cools down, the plot heats up. Two-thirds of the way through the book, Tryon divulges the twins' secret that will literally rock the reader in his tracks. You would think the rest of the book would be an anti-climax after this; fasten your seatbelts, because now you're in for a real ride. And hang on tight: Tryon piles one horror on top of another until you wonder if he has anything left in his bag of tricks, and then he pulls it out: a climax that will knock you over. And as if all this wasn't enough, the last page of the book will leave the reader wondering if Tryon was pulling the wool over everyone's eyes and have you guessing for days.Tryon may have been a mediocre actor, but he proved to be an excellent writer as well as a great storyteller. Plot, characters, and writing are just about perfect in this book. Like Stephen King in his earliest and best books, Tryon has the gift of understatement, and he knows how to let the horror build up ever so slowly and insidiously until the reader is totally wrapped up and can't escape. He also has a delightful touch with small but telling period descriptions that set the novel firmly in its time frame (do any older readers recall Mr. Coffee Nerves and Belle Sharmeers?). \\"The Other\\" has been out of print for some time now, but it's finally being re-printed and it's about time. I've treasured mine since the year it was published. It is, quite simply, one of the best suspense/horror stories ever written.Judy Lind"},{"Title":"The Other","review":"Like many reviewers of this book, I also read it about 20 years ago, having already fallen in love with Thomas Tryon's writing in Harvest Home. From the first page of The Other, the haunting and insistent voice of the narrator grips you, and you are ineluctably drawn into his strange, isolated world. The story of the twins Niles and Holland, with its psychologically devastating twist in the tail, has haunted me ever since I first read it, and having lost my copy some time ago, I am desperate to find another so that I can read it over and over. A real classic of the genre."},{"Title":"The Other","review":"I first read this book over 20 years ago, while a high school student in Connecticut (Mr. Tryon's birthplace). I never saw the movie because I was afraid &quot;Hollywood&quot; would ruin a perfect story. I have never read a novel since that is as suspenseful or frightening. Please bring this masterpiece back so other generations may enjoy(?) it."},{"Title":"The Other","review":"The anxieties stoked by the rebellion of the baby boomers in the late Sixties (particularly after the Manson Family murders at the end of the decade) gave rise to all kinds of horror fictions and films about evil children in the early part of the next decade; this 1971 atmospheric novel by Thomas Tryon was one of the best, and most influential. You can trace many later developments in horror fiction--particularly Tryon's very flexible use of an informal and dreamlike first-person narrative--to this early book which was a huge bestseller in its day, and is still a marvel for how well it is told and for how efficiently its horrors come ticking along. It is now available in a beautiful re-issue edition from the Centipede Press.Tryon was an extremely handsome Hollywood leading man whose career largely began to bottom out at around the same time the late 60s and early 70s boom in horror was signaled by the Ira Levin novel ROSEMARY'S BABY and its subsequent film adaptation by Roman Polanski. Inspired by that film, Tryon tried his hand at writing a novel based on his childhood memories of rural Connecticut and came up with this finely constructed story of personality transference among a pair of twins living there during the Depression. (The idea of the evil doppelganger goes back to Poe and Dostoevski, of course, but seems quite relevant coming from a gay man who had been living in the public eye in the 60s as a movie star.) The 1973 Richard Mulligan film adaptation, for which Tryon himself wrote the screenplay, has perhaps become today more famous than the novel itself, but the novel is really better, as Ramsey Campbell points out in his brief introduction to this edition: the sense of the drowsy longeurs of summer are stretched out a bit more, and the crucial \\"game\\" that the twins play with their grandma and its connection to the major events of the novel are clarified. This is an excellent example of how finely and intelligently genre fiction can be crafted."},{"Title":"The Other","review":"I first read this book over 20 years ago and it is a must &quot;re-read&quot; for me annually. Each new reading produces chills: of delight, at how Tryon weaves the story; of horror, as the mystery and tragedy unfolds. Read it closely, for clues to the mysterious horror are scattered throughout the book like the &quot;blue paper-rose petals&quot; which enshroud Niles' secret. Tough to put aside, perfect for those late nights when a summer breeze gives way to a rainstorm."},{"Title":"The Other","review":"This book is a reread for me annually. And the first time I read it, I had to immediately read it again to see how Mr. Tryon did it. One of my all time favorite books; please try to get a copy any way you can. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Other","review":"It's been many many years since I first read THE OTHER. Then saw the film. Was very impressed with both. Would really like to get my hands on a copy of the book in order to re-read it. Recommend to anyone who is interested in the dichotomy of evil."},{"Title":"The Other","review":"Author Tom Tryon was a so-so pretty boy actor, mostly famous for his role as THE CARDINAL. He turned out to be a much more gifted horror novelist. THE OTHER is excellent.I read THE OTHER when it first came out in 1971. I was eleven. (I was a precocious reader.) I can't believe that THE OTHER, a very influential novel of its genre, is out of print.I write. I've still to write anything as good as THE OTHER. I enjoy well-written and intelligent horror tales to this day; they are few and far between, and THE OTHER is one of the best. A recent re-reading convinced me of that.A New England tale of twin brothers whose utterly different personalities move freely between their bodies, this novel builds its atmosphere slowly. Never lurid, it merely gives you the very, very uncomfortable feeling that you're being watched . . . by The Other mind inside your own skull.And it takes a while for that feeling to fade."},{"Title":"The Other","review":"What a classically creepy book! Reminiscent of the film, _The Bad Seed_, this story of twins, Niles and Holland, absolutely enraptured me. Despite being written in 1971, it felt modern and had such an ominous atmosphere! It wasn't terribly unpredictable, but more in the way that foreshadowing hints at events than the plot being worn or tired. And, obviously, the twins aspect was a nice twist on the \\"Bad Seed\\"-esque plot. My only real complaint came from the edition that I read - it was a first edition that had not been well cared for - it was very musty and just smelled terrible! Though I suppose that the olfactory horror rather added to the horror found within the pages themselves. I am very curious to see the film version. Honestly, I am surprised that this book isn't better known - the atmosphere, plot and characters all stand out so much from the modern psychological thrillers."},{"Title":"The Other","review":"This is your psychological story set in a small New England town.

There have been many, many similar stories since, so I don't think it impacted me as strongly as it would have had I read it then. I kept thinking, they need to get some grief counselors and pscyhologists to help these people--which of course wasn't common in the '70s, and definitely not in the '30s when this story takes place. Still, speaking from 2001, that was my reaction. Everyone seemed so unconcerned about getting to the root of the problem at hand--and allowing a kid a fantasy which few parents would consider harmless in similar circumstances today.Also, the pacing seemed very slow to me--another indication of how popular fiction has changed over the years.King and Koontz scare me more these days, but it was a good read."},{"Title":"The Other","review":"This had such good reviews I had to buy it & read it... I don't know why exactly, but I just didn't get into this book. It was good, but it wasn't great to me. Maybe I'm to young to really appreciate it. I think people my parents age would really enjoy this book more (people who grew up in the 40's-50's) & I might have too, if I read this back in the 70's or early 80's.Anyways, it's a good realistic psychological horror & VERY well written. The whole idea of identical twins being born on different days, thus having different astrological signs/personalities. I thought was good. However, I wouldn't recommend this book to people under the age of 30."},{"Title":"The Other","review":"Everyone gave this novel such rave reviews that I thought it would be amazing, but it was a disappointment to me. After reading all of these great reviews I expected to love it, but just didn't - some parts were shocking, one part in particular that I didn't expect was what happened to \\"the baby\\"; that's why I gave it 3 stars instead of two. I had a hard time getting into this book, mainly due to the pacing, imo. It just never sucked me in the way a good book usually does.However, Tryon's other novel Harvest Home was a more enjoyable horror novel, maybe give that one a try? I would recommend it over this one.I've read a fairly broad spectrum of horror (Jackson, Lovecraft, Bradbury, King, Matheson, etc etc) and just felt like this didn't quite compare."},{"Title":"The Other","review":"Greetings,My book arrived before expected and in much better condition than I expected it to be despite the age of the book.

Um, well, I assumed what the \\"TWIST\\" was about 10 pages into the book.Great idea, just overwrought prose and not nearly creepy enough."},{"Title":"The Other","review":"A mediocre story plagued by poor writing. The ending is too obvious. The gypsy game is a redundant plot element - the same effect is achieved by the fact that the boys are twins.

This is the most realistic horror novel ever written (I have read it 5 times) and I absolutely love it. There are no devils, aliens, or monsters of any kind, just two psychologicaly messed up kids(which one is the evil one? or is it both?) who play an imagination game that goes horribly out of control, awesome twist ending, this book will keep you riveted for hours on end. Mr. Tryon creates characters that are so true to life you swear you met them before or they really existed at some time. This book is intelligent horror written by a late great author who doesn't suffer from verbal diarrhea like some of the popular present day writers. Harvest Home is another novel written in the early seventies that is just as creepy with a stunning ending, I loved it! If you enjoy The Other here are a few books you might want to look up : Harvest Home-Thomas Tryon, Conjure Wife-Fritz Leiber, The Nightwalker-Thomas Tessier, The Manitou-Graham Masterson, The Godsend-Bernard Taylor, After Sundown-Randall Boyll, The Homing-Jeffrey Campbell, For Fear of the Night-Charles L.

But their lives have been touched with tragedy: their father, killed in an accident; their mother, unable to recover from the shock. Grandmother Ada, Russian-born, has become the backbone of the family. And Grandmother Ada has a game for them to play together, a solace for them in a time of grief. But it is no ordinary game, this. It is one passed down through the blood from generation to generation. And it is through this game of the mind that Ada unwittingly unleashes a psychological horror that consumes everything it touches.THE OTHER is the first of the several novels Tryon wrote before his premature death and, although the novel HARVEST HOME is perhaps more widely remembered, to my mind it is his finest. The plot has been extremely influential, and some readers may recognize various turns from having encountered them at the less talented hands of later writers who shamelessly borrowed Tyron's ideas. But it hardly matters: the prose is absolutely flawless, dreamy, languid, and seductive even as it begins to unravel into a psychological void from which there is no return. It is a rare reader who will not unravel right along with it--and immediately re-read the novel to see how Tyron has so unerringly cast his spell. Strongly recommended.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"The Other","review":"Actor-turned novelist Thomas Tryon's first book is one of the best out there. The technique the book uses to creep up on you if very unique. This book is very old (and very out of print..i'd sell my soul before giving up my 1971 first edition with dj) so I hope you can find yourslef a copy, because this is a book that you simply HAVE to read, if you want a good horror story.And now the plot (don't worry, I'm not giving any spoilers):In 1935 12-year old twin boys (Niles and Holland) live on a New England farm. The twins are both very different. Niles is more outgoing and light-hearted, while Holland is shy and hides a lot. Their Russian grandmother Ada has taught them &quot;The Game,&quot; which allows you to be (or at least see from the POV) whatever or whoever you concentrate on. Their mother always stays inside, and their father's rcent death is probably the reason for it. It doesn't take long before a series of murders take place in the peacful town, and it becomes clear that Holland is connected to each of them...to say anything else about the novel would ruin the book. Just remember:Peregrine for Perry.Also, check out the movie: It's excellent."},{"Title":"The Other","review":"I saw the movie over twenty years ago. WHile at garage sale, I picked up the book and was bowled over on its ability to scare and disturb me. Mr. Tryon wrote a masterpiece of psychological horror and a horrifying descriptive narrative on the true nature of evil. I am surprised that this work is out of print. With such junk today, works like this only look even better over time. One of the best suspense/horror stories I have read."},{"Title":"The Other","review":"My dad introduced me to the work of Thomas Tryon. A few months ago he found a handful of books up in the garage that he'd read when he was in high school, and some of Tryon's novels were among them. I cooked through Harvest Home and was very impressed with with his masterful descriptions and breathtaking plot twists/revelations. Then I read The Other... I was completely blown away. You can't miss this book. It's a masterpiece. It's not frightening in a slasher, better-look-over-your-shoulder-type way, but the concept will chill you, without a doubt. It's such a good story, and it's executed so well... It's the best book I've read in a very long time. I would recommend it to anyone who is the mood for a good, haunting, thought-provoking piece of literature. My hat is off to Thomas Tryon... I can't wait to get my hands on another one of his works."},{"Title":"The Other","review":"You absolutely must read this book. Your best bet is to obtain a copy through intra-library loan, being that it's out of print. There is not one thing wrong with this book. The narrative is pefectly written, and the story perfectly structured and developed. What kind of horror is this novel? Easy, the book is a spider: it subtly, slowly, and silently creeps upon you, first crawling on your shoulder, and then working it's way down your arm, and before you know it, it's there in your lap, and you shriek as you discover it...too late. I believe the two best horror novels of the 20th century were either The Other, or Blatty's The Exorcist. The Exorcist is more explicit, perverse, and gruesome; The Other is more more quite. It's just a matter of preference as to which you rank the best. Also, be sure to see the film, which was written by Thomas Tryon. The one problem with the film, though is a slow first twenty minutes, but stay with it. It's an injustice to the literary world that this book is out of print. Not only is it probaby the best horror novel ever written, but also one of the all-time best novels. A genuine masterpiece. You must find a copy of it! Period."},{"Title":"The Other","review":"I first read this book when I was in High School and was chilled to the bone! That was nearly 20 years ago and I've not read another like it since. Mr. Tryon pulls you into the twisted hearts and minds of what first appears to be a normal family with twin sons and a loving nanny. Not so! Once I started I couldn't put it down-which left me quite fatigued at school. I have been looking for another copy of the book since, with no luck. If you are fortunate enough to find one-hang on to it and hang on to your spine, what a tingling ride!"},{"Title":"The Other","review":"Thomas Tryon began his career as a novelist after having a fairly successful run as an actor in Hollywood.Tryon is a better author than actor. For that I am truly grateful!The Other (1971) is a gothic horror story that tells the story of twin boys, Niles and Holland Perry, who live on a farm in New England some time during the Depression.Niles and Holland are inseparable. Holland is particularly attached to his Russian-born grandmother who has been forced to helm their family in the aftermath of the twins' father's death and their mother's incapacitation due to shock over trauma she endured. The boys' grandmother is very loving and doting, but Niles isn't as loving as Holland. He likes to play pranks.Tryon broke new ground with The Other. Subsequent authors have come forward and regurgitated and reworked material that Tryon created. None of the others have managed to create the actual horror that Tryon managed.This novel was so wildly popular - an immediate best seller - that it spawned a film of the same name in 1972.It would be unfair and cheating to tell you any more about the plot of this fine book. Rest assured the time you spend reading this will not be time wasted."},{"Title":"The Other","review":"Go to a used bookstore. Search the internet. Scour the newsgroups. And find this book. I have never read a novel before nor since that has the power to terrify the way the late Tryon does here. His mastery of sentence structure alone puts him above the vast majority of horror novelists. Simply a sensational piece of work -- and a travesty that it's out of print."},{"Title":"Communism and the Conscience of the West","review":"Then Monsignor Sheen, the well-known Catholic prelate, took on the growing threat of Communism not from a economic perspective but from a a spiritual one. He says that every book should have at least one idea. \\"The one idea in this book is that the philosophy of communism and to some extent the Revolution of communism are on the conscience of the Western world.\\"You quickly get the understanding this is a subject he is well read on. He quotes from the leading Protestant and Catholic theologians of the day to show that these issues have transcendent ramifications.Put simply in his own words : \\"communism is seen as the de-humanization of man by making him a social animal for whom an economic machine is the total meaning of existence.\\" Weather protestant or Catholic the book is a worthy read. Communism is still alive just as it was in 1948. Of note is the dedication of the book to Mary and the conversion of Russia, one of the secrets of Fatima."},{"Title":"Japan: A Short Cultural History, Revised Edition","review":"Among several thousand books in my home library, including, of course, the Short Cultural History and 3-volume A History of Japan by George B. Sansom (1883-1965), perhaps the last great comprehensive historian of Japan writing in English, his The Western World of Japan: A Study in the Interaction of European and Asiatic Cultures is one of my all-time favorites. Part of the reason is surely because I can think of no other work quite like it on the subject. I cannot describe it any more eloquently or accurately than the flyleaf blurb of my 1965 Fifth Printing edition:.....This masterwork is not only an account of the cultural influence of the West upon Japan; it is also a study of the way in which cultures interact. It reveals the process by which the intrusive civilizations of the West, since even before the Christian era, have affected the Asiatic peoples in general and the Japanese in particular, first only slightly and spasmodically, and then with increasing power......The first part of the book traces the early cultural relations between Europe and Asia. Against this historical background the second part shows how Japan reacted to Western influence from the days of her first contact with Europeans down to the time of her entry into international life in the nineteenth century......Historians will recognize instantly in this method the challenge both to Japan's own mystical and myth-ridden historiography, and to the West's narrow and self-centered preconceptions, which have prevented its historians from seeing that the institutions finally adopted were, if Western in shape, thoroughly Japanese in color and substance......And philosophers will recognize instantly the challenge thrown at Toynbee and Spengler when the author offers evidence of the way in which a society can decay and renew itself without changing its essence. He questions whether any of the chief civilizations of Asia will, even if they voluntarily follow a Western economic pattern, submit to Western precept in political, social, or religious life.*** This is a great book by a great scholar and you will enjoy it.

It is hard to call them novels when they are so faithful to historical events and the personalities of the historical characters. Like Mc Donald's Travis Magee series, you can reread them every few years with relish. I have read the \\"Corp\\" series at least three times. I also love the feedback I have gotten from friends I've introduced to W.E.B. Griffen."},{"Title":"Retreat, Hell!","review":"I have all of WEB Griffins books and rate him along with Wilbur Smith as my all time favorite author. His sagas span several different action themes, but they are all either military, police or intelligence services. The author has residence both in Texas and Argentina and has spent a great deal of time with our military so he uses his familiarity with these settings and people to cast a very nice spell in his work. My wife also enjoys the books so I would say they are suitable for all readers."},{"Title":"Retreat, Hell!","review":"Reviews on this one are mixed to say the least. After reading (intensely) the preceeding six or so novels in the series over a couple months I just ran out of steam on this one. It seemed a bit of a stretch to pull together the whole cast of characters again five years later. I gave up after the first couple of chapters. Maybe I'll try it again during another deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan."},{"Title":"Retreat, Hell!","review":"The book was sent to my son. He enjoys W.E.B. Griffin very much and wants to read all of the different series he has written. So far, he has completed Brotherhood of War and this book was the last in The Corps series.

We are all very happy with all the orders we have placed with you."},{"Title":"Retreat, Hell!","review":"1. I'm not going to judge this book to harshly because it is a decent book. But more importantly, this is my first Griffin book. I'm going to assume that anyone with this guy's staying power has to have some substance behind all of his books.2. The main problem I had with this book (which can be taken as a complement) was that it ended abruptly. I wanted to learn more about subsequent events etc... Just in case there was another book to pick up after this one, I checked WEB Griffin's website--> it appears that this is the latest or last book in the USMC series.3. Anyway, with all of the books this guy has written as well his reputation, I'll at least try 1-2 more books, but this one was average from my point of view."},{"Title":"Retreat, Hell!","review":"I think W.E.B Griffin(his real name is William E.

Griffin is a master at combining historic facts and fully fleshed out fictional characters."},{"Title":"Retreat, Hell!","review":"Mr.Griffin did the superb job creating the characters who are very likable and well put idiots/villains for couter effect.I always enjoyed the good war novels, especially stories based on the WWII.However, rarely there are any books with stories so gripping that make me want to follow through continuing saga of any kind though, this series proved to be an exception. It is definitely well worth reading the entire series.The only flaw in the otherwise perfect series is the discrepancy in naming Lt. Hon Song Do who is Korean and, to my knowledge there is no surname Hon anywhere in the history books or documentary of any kind in Korea. It should have been named Hong instead.I should know that well since I am a Korean born and always have been an avid reader of many different books, either in Korean or English.Though seemingly minor mishaps in naming other korean characters as well as places in other parts of the books though, it's rather discomfitting to see such uncharacteristic oversight in an author of Mr. Griffin's status.Over all, this is definitely one of the best war stories I have ever read and am very much looking forward to the continuing stories of the \\"Killer\\" McCoy and gravity defying stories of \\"Pick\\" Pickering, etc....Just for a thought, my husband thinks I am definitely too crazy to read such a thing and even crazier to write random thoughts of this knid..."},{"Title":"Retreat, Hell!","review":"A major improvement over the mediocre Under Fire, Griffin returns to form with Retreat, Hell! He shows his usual impeccable attention to detail and histoical accuracy, which was sadly lacking in Under Fire.This novel covers the peiod in the Korean War in which the situation turned around for the UN forces and the overextended North Koreans were chased back across the 38th Parallel with the US Army and its allies in full pursuit. The Pick Pickering-is-MIA situation is resolved in an imaginative way I didn't see coming; a couple of new characters are introduced who seem very interesting (and don't I just wish Griffin could rewrite the Brotherhood of War series to integrate them into it!); and a character is killed off in a way that is utterly consistent and tragic, with the potential for serious impact on others in the next book. Good writing.I have to admit that I find what Griffin is doing with Ken McCoy a little disconcerting. He seems to think McCoy's name is Mac MacMillan and that he is running Task Force Able. However, as Griffin seem to have no intention of crossing any Brotherhood of War characters over to The Corps (given what he has his characters doing, I would have expected at least passing references to the activities of MacMillan and Mouse Felter, if not to Duke Lowell and his panzers), I suppose there are no grounds for complaint.The timeline is heading into the final confrontation between Truman and MacArthur. The one thing that surprised and disappointed me, given El Supremo's frequent appearances and conversations with Brigadier General Pickering, is that there is no sign of the animosity that was building, not even at the Wake Island Conference (or 'summit') between Truman and MacArthur; at which he has Pickering present at Truman's orders. Both men commented extensively on it in their autobiographies, but their dislike for each other is absent here. Griffin usually has a better feel for interpersonal relations between major real people than that.Griffin also, which earned him my respect, addresses the issue of medals for valor that are awarded for other than the type of actions for which they are supposed to be presented. The problem was epidemic in Vietnam, but I didn't realize its roots went back to Korea. This subplot, involving Ken McCoy, Billy Dunn, Pick Pickering and General Clyde Dawkins (and I wish we saw more of The Dawk), offers an informative look not merely at the process by which medals are awarded, but also at the warrior ethos which permits warriors to accept them - or not.The bottom line: While I wish W.E.B. Griffin would go back and finish the World War II portion and the interbellum part of this series (in particular the sections dealing with McCoy's time at the Command &amp; General Staff College, how and why he was reduced in grade from major to captain when by time in grade he would have been in the zone for promotion to lieutenant colonel, how on earth the cowardly, self-serving Macklin was promoted and why he wasn't run out of the service, and whatever happened to a number of characters I care about), this book is a page-turner I gulped down in one afternoon. The tempo is fast and the visual melody sharp and clear. It's well worth reading, and more than once.The trouble is, now I have to wait impatiently for the next one!"},{"Title":"Retreat, Hell!","review":"By late September 1950, sent by General Douglas \\"El Supreme\\" MacArthur, the marines make a key landing on the Korean Peninsular. The General plans to send his forces across the 38th parallel in order to repel the North Koreans beyond the Yalu River. Though he expects no Chinese forces, he has USMC Major Ken \\"Killer\\" McCoy and his \\"lost\\" patrol seek enemy information.Meanwhile BG Pickering earns frequent flyer miles as he struggles to lessen the growing dispute between Commander-in-Chief Truman and ex facto supreme commander of the United Nation's forces MacArthur. Pickering also has a personal concern with his son \\"Pick\\" missing in action beyond enemy lines. Pick knows if the Commies capture him, they will execute him. He has survived fifty-eight days due to luck, some local help, and by constantly moving about, but staying near his downed plane. Killer finds evidence that Pick still lives, but cannot search for the MIA as he and his men have captured an apparent Intel Officer with information that massive Chinese forces await the Americans.No one does American military history novels better than W.E.B. Griffin does as he shows with this deep look at the early stages of the Korean Conflict. The story line grips the audience from the moment Pick struggles to survive and never lets up. The key as always to the Corps novels (this is the tenth) is the support cast that brings out real events so that the audience feels the battle as much as the political intrigue at home. Genre fans will once again salute the Five Star General for his wonderfully exhilarating book.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Retreat, Hell!","review":"After _Under Fire_ I felt the _Corps_ series was at a bit of a crossroads. We'd skipped the end of WWII, deactivated a number of great characters, and had a mostly combat-free book. What was coming next?Now that I know (thanks to a bookstore that was casual about release dates), I like the direction it's going. In this installment of the _Corps_, the Korean conflict is under way. The old warhorses are summoned to the colours again, or at least those Griffin has kept.Griffin has always portrayed military and naval culture superbly; I think he could do it in his sleep if he cared to. He is the Gale Sayers of the genre; like the Kansas Comet in his own field of fame, there just isn't anyone who can catch him. The strength of the story lies in some fairly vicious twists that left the ending very much in doubt: might this character die? Would Griffin kill him off? I am a veteran of every Griffin military book, and I could not predict the story's outcome. It clamped on--and held, to the end.I have never really let up on Griffin over the years with regard to the instant defloration of virgins and speedy bed-jumps, and fair's fair: he's improved this to where I think we can let it go. I can't say that it's gone--and it remains just about the only area in which his stories are quite predictable--but it does not dominate this story. There is also decreased dependency upon rich smartalecks with trust funds: the book takes that shortcut less than I've seen from Griffin for a long time.In my mind there is little question: while we might not have in Korea a backdrop as rich and desperate and high-stakes as World War II, we have a great story going on here. I hope that we'll see Stecker and Rickabee again, from the old _Corps_ books, but even if we don't, Griffin has revitalized one of the best military fiction series there is. I hope it continues for a long time."},{"Title":"Retreat, Hell!","review":"W.E.B. Griffin fans will love RETREAT, HELL! It is a real page turner. After receiving an advance copy from Putman in early December I immediately began reading and couldn't put down until the very end.

Action is nonstop with twists and surpises throughout. I could tell you what some of these are but don't want to spoil readers enjoyment. It will go down as one of Griffin's best.Ed Evanhoe, Author: DARKMOON: Eighth Army Special Operations in the Korean War"},{"Title":"Retreat, Hell!","review":"Over the years, Griffin's Marine Corps books, which had been an very entertaining diversion, have become more and more slapdash. Poor character and plot development, silly dialog (especially the 5% that come from the mouths of females), mistakes, errors, and oversights.This one needs to be recalled by the publisher. At a minimum it requires more thought and better editing - from a grammatical and cultural standpoint. (Hey Mr/Ms Editor!! Learn the proper use of commas, semicolons, and, above all, apostrophes - they are NOT there for decoration!)But, we dumb bunnies continue to buy Griffin's books, so why should he care what he's writing?

That is, something like, &quot;we'll attack Pyongyang because (a) it's the enemy capital and (b) it just feels right&quot;. A little of the (a) and (b) treatment, you will see, goes an awfully long way.And one other bothersome thing - other than too many Ernies - is that he forgot Patricia Pickering's name and refers to her as Patricia Fleming. All that aside, it was a very readable W.E.B. Griffin novel and it seems to leave room for a sequel."},{"Title":"Retreat, Hell!","review":"W.E.B. Griffin is a legendary storyteller. His characters not only live, but grow. They are not supermen or superwoman, but ordinary people thrown into the maelstrom of war. They possess virtues despised by many now: a love of their country, a sense of duty and a willingness to surrender their lives for something they believe in.And Griffin, like Shakespeare, does not shrink from seeing good people meet bad ends. He tells of life as it is in war: people, good people, are grievously injured and sometimes die.But a Griffin novel is an uplifting experience. He does not glorify war nor does he mask or enhance its brutality. He simply tells a story, deeply moving stories.In &quot;Retreat, Hell!&quot; many of the charcters from his previous novels are with us, older now, more experienced. It is a story of the Korean Conflict from June through Novermber, 1950. Mistakes at high level abound --- such as the failure of MacArthur's intelligence to detect the threats of North Korean invasion and Chinese intervention. But the ingenuity of the American soldier, so often a civilian just weeks before, is well described. Not unlike the sargeant who in a French field improvised a blade to plow through the hedgerows, Griffin's main characters adapt to the circumstances. A few high-level officers subtly avoid the bureaucracy and let the real soldiers fight their war.By the end of the day, the main points of history are still intact: General MacArthur made grievous mistakes as did the CIA and the politicians. The soldiers, however, anonymous and unsung do their job and fight beyond the call of duty. No glorious heros these; just ordinary men doing extraordinary things, as one Marine said.Griffin's genius is being able to tell such a story naturally, simply and utterly compellingly.Jerry"},{"Title":"Retreat, Hell!","review":"Griffin rarely disappoints, and this most recent offering is the reason why.Once again, the author tells a well-told story about the officer corps of the U.S. armed forces in wartime. He illustrates the unfortunate fact that politicians aren't the only people that practice the arcane, dark art of politics, but that our military leaders did it (and still do it) every bit as much.Reading about Ken McCoy and the others is a comfort, to be sure. It is sort of like a visit from old friends, but I would like to see some of the supporting characters fleshed out a bit more.Having made the criticism above, I will end by saying that despite a few very minor things, I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Retreat, Hell!","review":".Anything W.E.B.

The book is also about which officer hates which other officer for mostly unexplained reasons and who trusts someone else because they served in War Two (or One) together; and how to misappropriate the best material for your unit. The author treats everyone with respect by giving their full military titles over and over (probably could have saved 10 pages by cutting these back to Maj. McCoy or the like) except for Capt. Al Haig - who deserved similar respect since he was a four-star general and U.S. Secretary of State later in his career. One of the characters has the nickname \\"Killer\\" which is never explained except that he hates to be called that name."},{"Title":"Retreat, Hell!","review":"Griffin seems to be getting worse regarding the language used by the women in his books. I'm aware that men use this offensive language at times (maybe frequently) but have been spared its use by females, gratefully. In my experience, it's not realistic."},{"Title":"Retreat, Hell!","review":"The Corps series is the first series that I have read of W.E.B. Griffin, but it certainly won't be the last. Griffin is a marvellous writer who mixes actual people in with his fictional people. His stories are epics and the plots are larger than life as war so often is. This book is set around the beginning of the Korean War in the latter part of 1950. Most of the action takes place behind the lines in North Korea. Major Ken (Killer) McCoy takes a lead role in this one as he mounts a series of behind-the-lines surveillance teams. Their main job is to monitor the Chinese border to determine whether of not the Red Chinese are going to enter the war. We have a lot of the original characters from World War II such as General Fleming Pickering, Colonel Ed Banning, Major Malcom Pickering and Master Gunnery Sergeant Zimmerman, as well as some new names and people. The book is so realistic that it took my breath away. I am very sorry to reach the end of this stupendous series. I will next tackle The Badge of Honor series. If I get half as much enjoyment out of that as I did with this one, I will be happy."},{"Title":"Retreat, Hell!","review":"Trying to be literary, all I can say is &quot;Wow!&quot; Reading W.E.B. Griffin for the past 20 plus years is what pressed me into writing my book. His style is clean and easy to believe. With 20 years in the military I feel that I have served with some of the characters he develops. I have lived in Korea a total of 15 years since the late 60's. The scenes he develops in this book are clear and accurate. I could almost go looking for the house he describes. All I can say is, &quot;save me a copy of the next book in this series... I am ready right now to read it!&quot;"},{"Title":"Retreat, Hell!","review":"An outstanding Facual-Fiction of The Marines in the Korean War."},{"Title":"Retreat, Hell!","review":"Griffin's latest entry in his WWII/Korean War series is a good read, but it's by no means his best book in that series. The earlier books, the USMC war novels, are better. The later books have an OSS/CIA slant, which Griffin doesn't handle as well.From the title, one would expect a sweeping war novel, but it's really about field intelligence operations in the early days of the CIA. McCoy is back in action, behind the lines, and as competent as ever. Pick Pickering gets himself into trouble, and this time it's serious. Really, though, by now all the major characters are too senior to be doing what they're doing.A previous book in this series, &quot;Behind the Lines&quot; is being made into a movie, &quot;They Fought Alone&quot;, starring Brad Pitt. &quot;Behind the Lines&quot; is a better book than &quot;Retreat, Hell&quot;. Read it first if you haven't read Griffin before."},{"Title":"Retreat, Hell!","review":"It's obvious from this and the last book that Griffin is getting bored with the Marines. I'll be surprised if there is another book in this series. Looks like a new series \\"The CIA\\" or \\"The Spies\\" will be launched soon.Retreat Hell was a disappointment when placed alongside the rest of the Corps series. Little plot, mostly filler. Easily the weakest of the Corps series.If W.E.B wants to really make us loyal The Corps readers happy go back and write the book that belongs in-between In Danger's Path and Under Fire"},{"Title":"Retreat, Hell!","review":"I read the first 7 or 8 of Griffin's books on the Corps, but this one leaves me flat. Griffin's goes into great detail on his characters but there is no real plot. In many parts of the book there is page after page of meaningless descriptions and dialogue. I get the feeling that Mr. Griffin is only filling pages. After skipping some of his later books, I wanted to try him again. &quot;Retreat Hell!&quot; just doesn't do it for me."},{"Title":"Retreat, Hell!","review":"Absolutely nothing occurs in this novel: the Chinese don't invade, MacArthur doesn't get fired, no one gets laid, no one gets heroically killed. Just lots of Griffin type pedantic prose. He either gets paid by the pound, or by the word - how many times do you need to be advised that McCoy is a Major, USMCR?Griffin cranks one of these out every 18 months or so. Good market timing - I usually forget what little content there is and, as a simple ex-Marine, have high hopes for a great story of the Corps. The first two in this series were pretty good and offered some potential. Very little action since; fooled again, and again, and again ...In the early sixties, I trained and served under men who fought at the Frozen Chosin. They were common men , but heros all. This was the greatest instant of our (USMC) history. Griffin simply doesn't do the Korean conflict justice.Don't buy this book. Check it out from you library, borrow it from a foolish friend, or wait and lift the reject from Good Will for 50 cents.Semper Fi........"},{"Title":"Retreat, Hell!","review":"As it happens, I have not yet read any of Griffen's other &quot;Brotherhood of War&quot; novels, so this review may be less insightful than those written by persons who are more familiar with the series. I picked this one up because the Korean War has always interested me, and I am always up for a rousing novel about the courage of the US Marines!This novel was not what I expected, not meaning to be critical. First of all, virtually the whole novel takes place during what amounts to a slow point in the Korean War--where the US/UN forces have the North Koreans on the run after the brilliant Inchon landing, and before the Red Chinese intervention. The story is essentially centered on the interaction between President Truman and MacArthur during this period, and the stupidity of MacArthur's intelligence staff in failing to predict the Chinese entry into the war.The story dwells on small personal and intricate political matters within the American command in Korea. Evidently some of the characters hail from earlier (and later?) &quot;Brotherhood of War&quot; novels, and possibly readers of these books will appreciate the sub-plots involving these characters more than I did. One thing Griffen does exceedingly well is to create the atmosphere of what it might have been like to be in Korea during this time. The author writes with an authenticity that is indisputedly real. The reader feels transported to the early days of the Korean War.My overall evaluation is that this novel never quite takes off, although it does make for an entertaining read. First of all, I expected a story dealing with the first desperate days when the Chinese caught the American forces unprepared for their onslaught. Not at all. This novel deals almost entirely with the period before this, where the possibility of Chinese involvement was being hotly debated. There are no &quot;Retreat--Hell&quot; scenarios in this novel. Instead, this book sets the stage for possibly a later story along these lines. Griffen does a good enough job here that I'll probably be up for it."},{"Title":"Retreat, Hell!","review":"First of all, don't read this book without having read the entire Corps series. It won't make as much sense, and you'll flounder around wondering what you've missed. Go back and read the other books IN ORDER.Second, don't review this book without having read the entire Corps series. Griffin is the master of the add-on series, perpetually developing and enriching his characters while telling a story that could (???) have really happened, so well mixed with facts that it is.I must admit that I was looking forward to a new, yet old, experience with the swaggering generals who joust back and forth. Griffin actually made me mad at Willoughby and wanting to read ahead to see if he got his! He is the master of putting the pictures in your mind of what El Supremo might have actually said to Almond. Or getting you to wonder if there really was someone like Pickering really running the show behind the scenes.Great book. Can't wait for the next in the series."},{"Title":"Retreat, Hell!","review":"I have read all of his books and couldn't wait for this one. What a dissapointment. I have about 50 pages left and haven't seen any fighting action at all or even a plot or story. Most of it is people making introductions. You'll read about thier uniforms, boats and planes - descriptions only. In the beginning they capture a prisoner, but they don't play any role in the book. May give up on Griffin after this. It's time for Pick, Killer and the gang to retire and sell timeshares."},{"Title":"Retreat, Hell!","review":"I cannot believe the 5 star reviews. Did someone from McArthur's staff prepare them? While the basic story is entertaining there are severe problems with this entire series.Once again the author leaves the reader dead on the beach. This series of 10 books brings the reader to the brink - and then drops him off with no story. The end of World War II is sub-standard and mostly an afterthought. The author then brings the reader into Korea and when the most significant part of the story is about to start (the Chinese invasion) poof, the story ends. We never learn what happens to the main characters we are simply led to the precipace and then left to wonder while the author starts another series.This is the second time this author has pulled this. In the Brotherhood of War we are simply given a ten second ending and then later he tries to add other books simply to get more money, not to advance the story.Don't get me wrong. I liked the stories he told. They have furthered my historical reading to get more of the facts behind the fiction, but this is very poor story telling and has caused me to abandon this author. There is no point in looking at any of his other works only to find out 10 books in that there is no ending, just some brief ramblings.Almost wish someone would have picked up where he left off and finished the Korean and Vietnam wars. While I am ex-Army I really think the Marines deserve more of their proud history to be told."},{"Title":"Retreat, Hell!","review":"I have always enjoyed reading W.E.B GRIFFIN'S books. His books about the Marine Corps during WWII especially hit home because our family had a Marine that fought on Iwo Jima. He survived but it was so horrible that he wouldn't speak of it. This book is about the Korean War and all the horrible fights such as the Chosin Reservoir. My grandfather was blown up in his tank. His entire crew lost their lives and he was in a coma for 2 weeks.The hero of this book is \\"Killer\\" McCoy, the main character that survives despite all.This Griffin book is a good story of the Koran War. Since I was not there, I learned about thisparticular war and did not know that the Chinese entered the fray."},{"Title":"Retreat, Hell!","review":"I especially like the stories about \\"Killer\\" McCoy in the Corps series and Cletus Frade in Argentina. Now what has happened to them?What happened to McCoy at the end of WWII and st the start of the Vietnam conflict?Apparently Butterworth is now picking up some storymaking skills from his father W.E.B. Griffin. Time for extention of those series."},{"Title":"Retreat, Hell!","review":"I read the entire the series of WEB Griffin and like all his books.This one is another great read."},{"Title":"Retreat, Hell!","review":"I have read everything in the Corps series and loved the first few. Griffin came up with a unique style that educates the reader on the details of military life through the stories of a number of interesting and heroic characters with comic relief provided by an occasional cowardly and/or incompetant martinet. Griffin should go back to WWII where there is much left to be told. The Korea books are not up to standard and make the personalities of the heroes redundant, boring, ridiculous, and parodies of themselves. Has anybody ever considered the similarities of Griffin's books to Star Trek? The main characters never die, just the ones new to the current episode! Or are they like Buck Rogers in which the hero goes off on harrowing missions every week and ends up back at headquarters lauded as the conquering hero once again? The funniest thing of all is that Griffin still has me hooked and I will buy the next installment (in paperback, of course)!"},{"Title":"Retreat, Hell!","review":"Why would any supposed writer/historian have, as his cover jacket picture, a Marine PFC, from 1st MarDiv, sprinting across &quot;Death Valley&quot; in Okinawa, in the Spring of 1945?Wrong war........wrong location."},{"Title":"Retreat, Hell!","review":"I have read all of his previous publications. I enjoyed all of them. However, this one was lacking something. His caliber of writing seems to be lacking. The quality of this book, in relation to his others, is ordinary."},{"Title":"Retreat, Hell!","review":"This is the 10th in Griffin's Marine Corps series and I've read them all along with another 10 or so of Griffin's other military novels. In portraying U.S. military culture, folkways, and technology he's unmatched.\\"Retreat Hell\\" tells the story of the Korean War in the couple of months of 1950 while the North Koreans were on the run and it looked like the U.S. would have its troops \\"home for Christmas.\\" The surprising intervention of hundreds of thousands of Communist Chinese soldiers was to set the US troops back on their heels and force a bitter, bloody winter retreat. This book tells the story of a CIA unit gathering evidence that the Chinese are going to intervene and the unwillingness of \\"El Supremo\\" (General Douglas MacArthur) to believe the evidence.That sounds interesting and it is, but \\"Retreat Hell\\" is crowded with too much minutiae and too little story. Much of the book describes the preparation, distribution, and reading of memoranda, eating and drinking, and military machinations to steal men and material from each other. Endless and tiresome accolades are showered on the omnipotent hero, Major Kenneth \\"Killer\\" McCoy. Calling this a book about the Marine Corps is a stretch, as most of the book is about a CIA unit, politicians, and generals, including Harry S. Truman and the aforementioned El Supremo.I like Griffin's books and this one has some nuggets of interest, but \\"Retreat Hell\\" doesn't have much of substance or story to recommend it.Smallchief"},{"Title":"Retreat, Hell!","review":"iT WAS AN ORDER FOR MY HUSBAND AND THE LAST BOOK IN THE SERIES THAT HE HAD NOT READ AND COULDN'TFIND SO IT WAS GREAT."},{"Title":"Retreat, Hell!","review":"While I was sadly disappointed with his \\"Under Fire\\", especially because of the miserable, maybe not even existent, editing...well, that is past. Old friend WEB is back in harness and in fine fettle, indeed.There are a couple of warts, but aren't they in any book? Jeanette Priestley of the Chicago Trib, is a brunette in \\"Under Fire\\", and a sexy blonde in the new book. So what! Even my wife is sometimes known to use the industrial version.This book is truly a return to the old masterhood in military story telling. Buy the book, it is worth to be in your personal library.PS: Is that a Cuban cigar he is smoking in the picture of the book jacket? UUUUUUUH! Dat's a nono!Tsk, tsk, tsk!"},{"Title":"Retreat, Hell!","review":"I have read hundreds of books on warfare, both fiction and nonfiction, and this one is definately the worst. Hundreds of pages long, many unnecessary digressions and almost no action. Also, some parts are in questionable taste, particularly where a \\"hero\\" while actually viewing the casket of his fiancee who had been killed in Korea, falls in love (lust?) with a woman who had, the day before, attended the funeral of her Marine flyer husband. This subject actually closed the book."},{"Title":"Retreat, Hell!","review":"Ok, I'm giving this two stars because it is slightly entertaining, especially the historical references but the authors writing style got so obnoxious I threw the book on the donation pile after finishing about half of it.Problems:1) Black and White character development. The protagonists are all pretty and wealthy (or destined to be wealthy) and of good moral fiber. No shades of grey whatsoever.2) Repetition. Sequence of events and factoids are repeated ad nausem. I can't count how many times a reference was made to the rice paddies of Korea being fertilized with human feces. Interesting fact? Maybe, but after mentioning it three times one would think the author made his point. Another example; Character entrances for the military characters are always listed them by their title and status, eg Private Peter Rabbit USMCR. It just feels like the author was trying to pad the word count.Such a shame as this book had potential. I hope the other books by Griffin deviate from this pattern. I will avoid any of his other works unless someone tells me otherwise."},{"Title":"Retreat, Hell!","review":"One of the best War novelists I have ever read. Always enjoy every one of Griffin's books. Great attention to detail which is woven seamlessly into every book. Extremely entertaining and historically accurate. These comments apply to every Griffin book I have read (At least 25)."},{"Title":"Retreat, Hell!","review":"This is the 10th book in WEB Griffin's fictional series involving the US Marine Corps. I almost always enjoy Griffin's work, especially the historical tidbits that make it all interesting. He takes ordinary people and thrusts them into extraordinary historical circumstances, a technique which alows us to go along for the ride and see perspectives on events that you wouldn't normally experience in history textbooks.This particular entry in the series was one of the best of the entire Corps series. It follows the series regulars as they interact in Korea in 1950. We get to experience events surrounding the Inchon landing all the way up to the final confrontation between MacArthur and Truman. An interesting subplot involves the issue of medals for valor being awarded like candy, often to those who don't deserve them. I was happy to see the protagonists of the story fight against this practice and attempt to turn them down. I believe this is the last book in his \\"Corps\\" series as most of the loose ends were tied up and it ends on a happy note. It's been a good run."},{"Title":"Retreat, Hell!","review":"Good action book, however title doesn't reflect book, since the story ends around 5 Nov, about 3 to 4weeks before the Chosin campaign. ONLY mention of the Chosin campaignis is the AFTERWORD, in which Griffin completly underestimates the numer of Chinese that attacked 8th Army, X Corps &amp; 1st Marine Division by over 290.000 men. He ought to have checked the official records, rather than using &quot;El Supremo's' figures. In addition, the cover art is of the late Marine Paul Ison of Florida, and his dash through the 'Valley of Death' on OKINOWA in 1945! What does this have to do with Korea, except Mr. Ison was a Marine. Other than poor facts, book was good. He had the Chinese estimates better in the fiction part of the book."}]`),H={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},R={class:"card-container"},W=["disabled"],x={key:0},D={key:1};function M(s,e,n,c,r,i){const m=f("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",R,[(t(!0),a(g,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,y)=>(t(),b(m,{key:y,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",D,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",x,"See more"))],8,W)):p("",!0)])}const j=u(H,[["render",M],["__scopeId","data-v-32a8f990"]]),N=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/3.md","filePath":"glossary/3.md"}'),B={name:"glossary/3.md"},q=Object.assign(B,{setup(s){return(e,n)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(j)]))}});export{N as __pageData,q as default};
