Most of her writing is done on the &quot;stream of consciousness&quot; level. I first read &quot;menia zovut zhenshina&quot; about a year ago. I have re-read it since. It is a lovely collection of stories, all true-to-life accounts of what life was really like for millions of Russian women, from abortions to clothes queues. My favourite is the last story of Natalia Goncharova. Very delicately written."},{"Title":"Menia zovut zhenshchina (Russian Edition)","review":"&quot;Menia zovut zhenshchina&quot; is a collection of essays; as the greater part of Arbatova's writings, they are largely autobiographical. Arbatova differs favorably from a number of other Russian women authors in that she criticizes the system (the title essay is a strong presentation of how female patients are treated in the state-owned health institutions), yet, at the same time, manages to find sources of strength in unexpected places. Not all essays in the book are equally impressive, but there are valuable observations - and humorous passages. For a student of Russian, Arbatova is a good author to read; she writes a language that is easy to understand, and in current use. She comes out strong and optimistic, an inspiration for young women."},{"Title":"Menia zovut zhenshchina (Russian Edition)","review":"This book is a pathetic attempt of Maria Arbatova to add her name to the list of Russian classics. Oh, well... If Maghomet doesn't go to the mountain... The book is full of family pictures and the ego of the author. It could be fun for the audience that knows so little about the life in the Soviet Union, that is ready to swallow the first stereotypical and one-dimensional picture. All characters (except for the author - the book is autobiographical) are villains, morons and degenerates. The judgements are categorical and what Arbatova just failed to understand is depicted as grotesque caricature, regardless whether she writes about the Soviet Union or European countries she had the chance to visit. The book can be recommended to the Russian immigrants who curse the day they left their country to themselves, but curse their former country outloud. Or to those nostalgic loosers who are ready to read any quality of literature provided it's connecting them to the bad/good old days."},{"Title":"Pursued (Left Behind: The Young Trib Force)","review":"I have always enjoyed the adult series of Left Behind books. The kids books are just as good. The kids interact with the characters from the adult series, experience the same events, etc. However, since the main characters are teens, these books can appeal to younger readers. So far, the stories haven't had the ups and downs that the adult series has had. The adult series has books that are a lot more boring than others. The kids series seems to be good in every book. These are not for really young kids, but would be appropriate for young teens. I enjoy them and I am an adult."},{"Title":"Pursued (Left Behind: The Young Trib Force)","review":"Christian books are not my usual genre, but one day i picked up the first book in the Left Behind series and i was hooked. The authors are brilliant, the characters are realistic. Honestly these books don't read like the typical Christian book. They don't 'push' religion on you at all. Of course they talk about religion and the christian characters try to help the non-christians to try to save themselves, but everything is presented as action books. There's danger, guns, heros, mysteries being solved, love, and 'thank god', none of those sex scenes that are constantly taking too much space in most of the books I enjoy reading. I'm pretty open-minded on religion, I believe that all things are possible. These books are entertaining, well written and engaging, with enough excitement and drama that even Non-Christians would get a lot of enjoyment out of reading them."},{"Title":"Pursued (Left Behind: The Young Trib Force)","review":"great easy reading. keeps you interested. will give to pre teen daughter after finished.

Even thought this is only the begining, it just keeps on getting better every time you read the next books. it is very easy to connect to the characters and get emotional attached to the characters, which are only fiction.

Highly recommended.Rainy Mountain, a &quot;single knoll [that] rises out of the plain in Oklahoma,&quot; is an old landmark for the Kiowa people. It is a land of bitter cold, searing heat, summer drought, and &quot;great green and yellow grasshoppers.&quot; It is a land of loneliness, where the Kiowa were drawn after a long journey from the northwest through many types of lands.The Way to Rainy Mountain is about the journey-in myth, in drawings by Momaday's father Al, in reminiscences, and in historical snippets. All reveal aspects of Kiowa culture, life, philosophy, outlook, spirituality, and sense of self-the beauty and the desolation, how the introduction of the horse revolutionized Kiowa life, the story of Tai-me, and the richness of the word and the past. It is a literal journey as well; Momaday, in Yellowstone, writes, &quot;The Kiowas reckoned their stature by the distance they could see, and they were bent and blind in the wilderness.&quot;This is a small gem of a book, beautifully written, illustrated, and designed. It has moments of insight, beauty, and sadness, as the ending of the Sun Dance, telling as the sun is at the heart of the Kiowa's soul-a soul that survives in every word and drawing of The Way to Rainy Mountain.Diane L. Schirf, 3 March 2002."},{"Title":"The Way to Rainy Mountain","review":"THE WAY TO RAINY MOUNTAIN is a fscinating account of the Kiowa spirit's core through the poet N Scott Momaday's three voices: the collective tribal story-telling voice, the historic voice (based on historical documentation), and the poet's own experiential voice (Momaday retraced the migratory route of his ancestors from Montana to Oklahoma). These three voices work on the reader's imagination to produce a fourth voice on the stage of the reader's mind. THE WAY TO RAINY MOUNTAIN depicts an epic journey of the Kiowa people through space (Montana southward) and time (mythological to modern). The ancient Kiowa's psyche fuses with primal nature be it with dog persons, antelope beings, or the mythological (but very real) creature called Taime.Once in Oklahoma the Kiowa mastered the horse and became among the best of hunters on the Great Plains. Brave in spirit, sharing in heart, they became a proud people. But European civilization closed in and all but crushed them by killing off the buffalo, killing herds of horses and turning hunters into farmers. Yet the Kiowa people held their vital contact with the land in today's hectic world: &quot;Once in his life a man ought to concentrate his mind upon the remembered earth, I believe,&quot; writes Momaday. &quot;He ought to give himself up to a particular landscape in his experience, to look at it from as many angles as he can, to wonder about it, to dwell upon it. He ought to imagine that he touches it with his hands at every season and listens to the sounds that are made upon it.&quot; Momaday helps the reader do just that--gain an appreciation for the multi-dimensional land of North America"},{"Title":"The Way to Rainy Mountain","review":"Momaday's narrative comprises an elegy for Kiowa culture, drawn from his memories of his grandmother and other family members and from their memories of a culture now lost. And the book ends with a stunning poem, the likes of which one rarely finds in contemporary poetry. It's that closing poem that lifts this humble book into the realm of masterpiece. As Chaucer's Pandarus says, &quot;Th'ende is every tale's strengthe.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Way to Rainy Mountain","review":"This book is deceptively short: it can be read in about an hour, but you find yourself going back and reading its various passages and thinking about them long afterwards. Momaday tells a story of the Kiowa Indians by tying in three aspects: folklore, actual historical events and his own family history. The book's format underscores this, with the first, folkloric item printed on one page, and the historical and personal reflections in separate paragraphs on the facing page, all set in different fonts. Not meant to be a comprehensive account of the Kiowas, it is rather an attempt to express the author's own feelings and his own view of his heritage. In this he largely succeeds, as he writes poetry in a simple yet powerful prose form. The only shortcoming for me were the illustrations (done by Momaday's father), which seemed to add little to the overall narrative. Otherwise, \\"The Way to Rainy Moutain\\" is a very unique and worthwhile book."},{"Title":"The Way to Rainy Mountain","review":"In his writing, Momaday creates a vibrant sense of how stories are expressed through living words within vital communities. His brillant blending of mythology, folktales, oral history, historical descriptions, and personal reflections all connect in a fascinating story about finding one's way in life's journeys. The writing is so vivid and the book is so animated that patient readers will connect with what Momaday presents, provided that they choose to share in the reflective silence that he offers on the way to Rainy Mountain."},{"Title":"The Way to Rainy Mountain","review":"The Way to Rainy Mountain is one of those rare books that changed my whole persepective of the world. The beauty of his style and simplicity of his stories show what a firm grasp and love of the language Dr. Momaday has. I had the priviledge of hearing Dr. Momaday speak recently. Much to my joy, he speaks much the same way he writes--in clear, simple phrases. He doesn't take language for granted. Instead he cherishes every syllable, every sound. But not only did this book teach me about the language, but about a culture. The way Dr. Momaday views the world, nature, and other people is truly fascinating and insightful. He is a spokesman for a rapidly diminishing world of orators and storytellers. This book will live in the hallowed halls of literature for countless generations."},{"Title":"The Way to Rainy Mountain","review":"The Way to Rainy Mountain is poetry for people who don't usually ready poetry. Personally, I really like the way *very* short stories are interspersed throughout - it's like something you'd hear coming out of the mouth of your grandparents (or great grandparents) as they talk about stuff they remember doing or seeing. There's all sorts of articles written about this poem, and you can see synopsis of them at:http://users.mwci.net/~lapoz/Momaday.html"},{"Title":"The Way to Rainy Mountain","review":"Momaday spins together pieces of Kiowa myth and image interweaved with tales he heard as a boy. Poetic, tragic, unforgettable."},{"Title":"The Way to Rainy Mountain","review":"Mr. Momaday's voice in his collection of stories is priceless. He tells of the Kiowa's legends, follows them up with facts, and includes his own reflections on what it means to be Kiowa, Indian/Native American, human. The inclusion of his father's artwork makes this an even more impressive volume.I was fortunate enough to meet Mr. Momaday at a Western Writers Conference where he gave readings from this collection. And, not being a writer myself I felt out of place. It was Mr. Momaday's voice (think James Earl Jones), and his notice of me (the only other Indian/Native American in the auditorium) that mesmerized me. I've been a fan ever since."},{"Title":"The Way to Rainy Mountain","review":"What I love about this book is trying to figure out how the 3 stories on each page connect to each other. I bought it for a \\"Contemporary Native American Literature\\" class and it really complemented other books in the class. Definitely recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Way to Rainy Mountain","review":"I enjoyed the book. I especially like the way Momaday wrote the book as if it had been written by three people. Not only did I learn about Momaday's journey to Rainy Mountain, but I also learned about Kiowa myths and legends. It showed the last years of the Kiowas as a people. The book was simple to read, although when thought about, I realized it was more complex. I would reccommend this book to people who like to learn about cultures and their myths."},{"Title":"The Way to Rainy Mountain","review":"This book was a requirement for World Literature II. I will say this... Even if this had not been required for us to read in that class, I would have picked this book up and read it on my own time. Momaday eloquently incorporates the traditions of the Kiowa people in a way that draws you into each story that his poems tell. Though characteristically, it is a quick read, it is worth it to take your time and absorb every stanza within this book."},{"Title":"The Way to Rainy Mountain","review":"I was introduced to N. Scott Momaday's unique book in a class this semester where we discussed the overlying themes and message of The Way to Rainy Mountain.Told in a three part process through myth, historical, and personal journey, Momaday relates the oral traditions and his own connection to the Kiowa people. They journeyed from Montana to their final settlement in Oklahoma over centuries of time, and in three sections (not counting the beautiful introduction and epilogue), he recounts their origin stories, the passing movement of the tribe, and finally the narrowing of the culture as it was eliminated through the diecide of the Tai-me.This is a deceptively small book, filled with quite a bit of white space, but do not let it fool you. It's rich in message, history, and myth - recording oral tradition that, before, was just one generation away from dying. And even then, it's a fragment of what could, if not already has been, be lost.I've read this book three times, the first in a linear fashion - myth to myth, historical to historical, personal to personal. The second in the way it is written, horizontally. And the last way thoughtfully, drawing connections throughout the book, tracing themes, investigating ideas, researching as I went. I recommend all of these ways in order to attempt to understand all of the importance of Momaday's message."},{"Title":"The Way to Rainy Mountain","review":"Excellent.

The English-to-Hebrew section is particularly well-done, and contains a great deal of slang, medical and technical terminology, etc. My one critique is that the English-to-Hebrew section doesn't have nekudot (vowel markings) for the words it gives -- if you can't derive them from context (which is usually possible), you need to hunt in the Hebrew-English section to find the proper pronunciation.

It will not provide any more insight into growing, use, or culture than what you could find on either of the two large online cannabis forums.There is much missing in this book, and many inaccuracies.

Check ... for genuine readers reviews (and of the other novels in the series) but here's a story from me about this, my fourth satirical crime novel. The book is about what happens when the grave of King Arthur and Queen Guinevere is found in the West COuntry in England (theme park selling Excaliburgers etc, heritage centre - oh and several murders). I'd just started writing it when my publishers asked me for some idea of the content so they could plan the cover. My books always have some odd things happening with animals (no, not THAT odd) so after I'd told them there would be knights in armour, jousting, all that medieval stuff, they asked me which animal would feature. Off the top of my head I said it would be a hedgehog, then forgot about the conversation. IN the course of writing the book I dropped the hedgehog idea. I'm two chapters from the end of the novel when I get the proof for the cover from my publisher. The only thing on there, aside from the title and my name, is ... a hedgehog. I had to rewrite the book so that it would match the cover. Don't tell me I'm not a professional. But the funniest writer in the world? Of course not, though The Good Book Guide in the UK regards my novels as &quot;essential reading&quot;. Happy reading."},{"Title":"Once and Future Con","review":"I decided to borrow this book from our library because of it's interesting cover... and I found myself reading something that was as interesting as the cover (well, we have to judge a book on something, don't we?).I'd never heard of Peter Guttridge before, but now I've read as many of his books as I could get my hands on!This book is about Nick and Bridgit who go to stay where some of their old friend's live, which is also supposedly the site of King Authur &amp; Guinevere's grave. Nick digs up a couple of other bodies too... but that's not the point of the book (as I see it). The book actually has a lot of references to real-life-fact... it confused me at times. For example: is there really a type of yoga that involves people putting milk-soaked gauze in their mouth? And were all those Authur trivia pieces fact or fiction?Hell, I'm not from England, so I don't even know if it was set in a real place, although I know the Cornwell Eclipse existed, as does Venice.

His books are excruciatingly funny, rich with plot and wit... and always keep me sniggering to my self in an alarm-your-neighbour type way on the train to work.

In this one, the pair are drawn into investigating a series of deaths relating to the rediscovery of the supposed tomb of Arthur and Guinevere, stolen from Glastonbury Abbey after the Dissolution. Conveniently, it's located on the property of a Somerset lordling who plans to build an Arthurian theme park on the investments of old college chums and with the assistance of a heavily clich&eacute;d American PR man. While Guttridge has a nice, dry wit, and while he has some deservedly acerbic things to say about the distinction between real history and the \\"heritage industry\\" in Britain, the mystery plot itself is pretty lame, pretty thin, and wasn't able to hold my attention past the halfway point. Maybe if I had begun with the first volume, I'd get it -- though a series author ought not to rely on such consideration by the reader, and most successful ones don't."},{"Title":"Crown Me!","review":"I LOVED the book!

To watch it grow beneath your fingers and become something new and different. To have it molded and shaped by a variety of editors, friends, and advisors. To have it published by a big ole publisher like Holiday House. Then, finally, to watch it ripped into tiny shreds at the hands of some two-bit Amazon.com reviewer who probably wouldn't know the next great kid's book if it came up and bit them on the ... well, you get the idea. After reading the first half of \\"Crown Me!\\", these were my thoughts. I found myself worrying. How was I going to write a review of this book when it so obviously still needed work? To my utter relief, however, the second half of the story more than made up for the first. So while this is not the best children's book of 2004, and while the author probably has a ways to go before she can be said to be the next great voice in kiddie lit, there's promise here. Real promise.Some kids want run for President when they grow up. Then there's Justin Davies. He doesn't want to just run for President. He wants to BE President. And now, thanks to his history teacher Mr. Bailey, he has a chance to be the next best thing. King. When Justin and his rival Andrea Carey are pronounced King and Queen for two weeks, they're both delighted. Sure Mr. Bailey keeps saying that this'll teach some kind of a lesson to them all, but all Justin can think is that this is the perfect way to get the attention he needs for an eventual run as fifth-grade student council president. Problem is, being a king isn't all it's cracked up to be. His friends keep getting mad at him when he won't favor them, he keeps making impossible promises that he can't keep, and now the school bully, Badger, is challenging him to a joust. It ain't easy being king, but somebody's gotta do it. Justin just needs to learn how.When I first began reading, I felt I recognized the author's voice in this book. It sounded oddly familiar. After a couple more pages, I realized that lay is a dead ringer for Bruce Hale (author of the oh-so popular \\"Chet Gecko\\" series for younger folks). Take out a couple of Gecko's bad puns (and give them all to \\"Crown Me!\\"'s bully villain) and you've got a mighty similar writer on your hands. Lay is a bit too prone towards putting bad or corny jokes in the mouths of her characters. The bully spouts overused phrases like, \\"I'm going to punch you into next week\\" and \\"I'd be just as happy to squash two wimps for the price of one\\". When you begin the book, things like this are particularly prominent. Justin, our hero, is not especially likable and his friends are even less so. It's mighty difficult to believe that he would still want to be friends with them when they repeatedly betray him, get mad at truly tiny slights, and cowardly abandon him at the worst times. The first few chapters of the book were so depressing, in fact, that I had to make myself keep reading.Then it got better. Once Lay's really into the story, the writing becomes crisper and the satire sharper. By the time Justin's campaign for fifth-grade presidency is in full swing, Lay somehow manages to give the book the thrill of an actual election. Kids reading this book will honestly be on the edges of their seats as they wait to hear the final verdict. I also loved the character of Willie, Justin's unwanted knight errant and remarkably adept campaign manager. Any scene in which a kid shows his love of presidential advisors by keeping a picture of Orville Freeman (Kennedy's secretary of agriculture) on his desk has my instant love. There are still loose ends left dangling by the story's close (we never learn what happens to the ficus that Justin and his dad continually forget to water) but these are small enough that they shouldn't distract from what ends up being a truly satisfying close.The obvious pairing of this book would be with, \\"The Kid Who Ran For President\\" by Dan Gutman. Also consider giving it out with fellow first-time novel, \\"Donuthead\\", by Sue Stauffacher for another look at a kid dealing with dangers and insecurities. \\"Crown Me!\\" isn't going to garner too much attention, but it's bound to be adored by those kids who sympathize with Justin and his quest. Lay has an accessible voice and a fun plot here. She's bound to win some fans with this book."},{"Title":"An Introduction To Comparative Philosophy: A Travel Guide to Philosophical Space","review":"This book has the potential to change the way you understand the world around you.

Just think of the title -- \\"To live within\\" -- the title conveys what is contained in this book.In a world that seems filled with self-help and new age materials of quick-fixes and easy-answers -- this is the Real Deal. This is not a book written to prey on the searching spirits of people who want to be given answers. ... This book is about going on the journey -- \\"To live within\\" There are a few books that I find I have to inhabit for quite awhile and return to again and again... this is one of them.Madame Reymond writes: \\"Seated around Shri Anirvan one day or another were Hindus, Buddhists, Christians, Moslems -- believers and unbelievers -each one carried by his own discipline, his own effort, his own ideal; each one receiving the food he was in need of. We were learning, day after day, how to live within...\\"AND as one of many examples that I value in this book --\\"About your personal discipline, you are following the right course. What you get through intuition can never fail you. The whole attitude can be summed up in a short sentence: 'I know it, I feel it, I am it.' Let the powers work deep within you. The pain that results is that of a new birth. If inclination for inner work lessens, do not worry. Creation starts in darkness. Out of nothing, Shakti comes.

Like with true, real insight it is necessary to participate in it personally. One of the few pearls that achieved an incredible balance. Balance between the explanation level based on incredible knowledge and emotional journey to an inner self."},{"Title":"To live within","review":"The reappearance of this out-of-print book by Anirvan/Reymond is perhaps unfortunate, though no doubt inevitable, since it has been used (effectively, for the naive New Ager) for a purpose contrary to its main theme: the relationship of a disciple to a guru, in an Indian context. On that level, who can say. It describes a world of its own. Unfortunately the stray comments of this Indian disciple on Gurdjieff, excessively servile and excessively laudatory, with some completely false promotional passages on the enneagram, Ouspensky, spiritual submission, completely beyond the range of his knowledge and experience, produce a message that can, and has, been used to confuse and lure innocent Westerners into the dangerous exploitations of the bogus fourth way rackets now current. This Anirvan's comments on the enneagram are the usual nonsense, and his musings about Indian gurus, transferred to a deviating sufistic context like that created by Gurdjieff, are highly misleading. The most objectionable and dangerous part of the book is the apologetics for guru domination, to the point of denying the human rights of disciples. This sophistical adherent actually declares that gurus have the right to kill their disciples. At that point, enough's enough, and one must sound the alarm. These gurus are empty will to power types, and have no such rights. There is absolutely no spiritual hierarchy in the gross distortion of meaning produced by these two fawning observers of Indian spirituality, so ignorant of the pickpockets in pseudo-sufism, glad for the free advertising.Those who are looking into Gurdjieff, confused and nervous about their place in some 'work', should beware of this propaganda for gurus. There is no legitimate basis for guruism, apart form the 'friendship among equals'. These medieval hangover notions of divine gurus and bhakti yogis is complete nonsense transferred to world of 'intelligent devils' like the rogue sufi Gurdjieff. Beware of the whole racket. In fact, this book is a kind of shill for that figure of the last century. Anirvan has a problem with Ouspensky. Not surprising, Ouspensky blew the whistle on what was really going on with Gurdjieff. These interlopers from the Indian tradition should not be used or abused as free legitimation for the sordid slavery tactics of a figure so superficially impressive as Gurdjieff. To those susceptible to the illusions being sold in this book, one should say beware indeed of wolves in sheep's clothing."},{"Title":"My Joy, My Sorrow: Karen Ann's Mother Remembers","review":"For those unfamiliar with the story of Karen Ann Quinlan, the best place to begin this book is Appendix A, \\"The Legal Battle: A Chronology,\\" which outlines the family's struggle to have their daughter weaned from her respirator, even though that act was likely to hasten her death. You will see that in 1975 Karen Ann was ruled to be in a persistent vegetative state with no hope of recovery, that her parents' efforts to minimize what they saw as her suffering were blocked by physicians and hospital administrators, and that their wishes were followed only after a ruling by the New Jersey Supreme Court.In the pages preceding the appendix, we meet Joe and Julia Quinlan, devout Catholics, who married in 1946 and by 1957 had three children. They adopted their first child, Karen Ann, and Julia gave birth to Ellen and John. We learn about their early family life, with children attending Catholic schools and parents taking an active role in their lives. Joe and Julia embarked on a \\"new normal\\" on April 15, 1975, when they were called to the hospital where 21-yeaer-old Karen lay in a coma, which was shortly ruled to be irreversible.Though Julia's story involves legal battles to have the respirator removed, its real significance is the family's strength and faith and the support they received from others, including clergy and law enforcement officers, who helped the family protect Karen's privacy from the press and public, some of whom were making threats.As the book closes, we see the tight family bond and strong faith in action. After Karen's death in 1985, in appreciation for the nursing home care she received for those 10 years, and to honor her memory, Joe and Julia got involved in hospice work. Eventually Karen's brother and sister also devoted time to the cause. From 10 years of \\"waiting for Karen's time\\" to their subsequent efforts to ease the final days of others, this family is truly inspirational in part because they seem not to think of themselves as heroes."},{"Title":"My Joy, My Sorrow: Karen Ann's Mother Remembers","review":"This is a beautifully written book about a family of seemingly ordinary people who, each in their own way, proved to be great human beings.They were thrust into an incredible nightmare when their Karen Ann went into an irreversible coma.The family's only concerns were to do what they thought was right and what they knew Karen Ann would have wanted them to do.

Published in 2005 by St. Anthony Messenger Press, it includes a forward by the bishop emeritus of the Diocese of Patterson, New Jersey. Because of those associations, one should be able to assume that this book is theologically complete with regard to end of life issues. Unfortunately, that does not appear to be the case.Karen Ann Quinlan and Terri Schiavo were born less than a decade apart; they grew up only 75 miles apart. Both were the eldest of intact, Catholic families of three children (Two girls and a boy, in both cases). Both families were drawn into media and legal frenzies, as the result of medical decisions. Yet, there was a major, major difference. In one case, the decision was about \\"extraordinary treatment.\\" In the other, the decision was about \\"ordinary care.\\" There is an enormously relevant distinction between these two, which hospice advocate Julia Duane Quinlan fails to explore. It is unfortunate that Bishop Rodimer graced this book with a foreward. It is unfortunate that St. anthony Messenger Press chose to publish it.In 2005, it would have been a safe assumption by St. Anthony Messenger Press that \\"My Joy, My Sorrow\\" could capitalize on that year's frenzy about end of life issues, resulting from Terri Schiavo's tragic situation. Terri Schiavo died on March 31, 2005, when Michael Schiavo prevailed in a legal battle with her parents and siblings. As the result of Michael's \\"victory,\\" the \\"ordinary care\\" of nutrition and hydration (i.e., food and water) were discontinued from Terri. In light of this timing, as well as the hospice advocacy work of Karen Ann's mom & her prominence as a speaker on end of life issues, it is more than odd that \\"My Joy, My Sorrow\\" makes absolutely no mention of Terri Schiavo or a 2004 statement by Paul John Paul II. Hence, I believe \\"My Joy, My Sorrow\\" to be theologically incomplete and potentially misleading.As per his 3/20/2004 address to the International Congress, \\"Life-Sustaining Treatments and Vegetative State: Scientific Advances and Ethical Dilemmas,\\" Pope John Paul II stated:* \\"The sick person in a vegetative state, awaiting recovery or a natural end, still has the right to basic health care (nutrition, hydration, cleanliness, warmth, etc.), and to the prevention of complications related to his confinement to bed. He also has the right to appropriate rehabilitative care and to be monitored for clinical signs of eventual recovery.* \\"I should like particularly to underline how the administration of water and food, even when provided by artificial means, always represents a natural means of preserving life, not a medical act. Its use, furthermore, should be considered, in principle, ordinary and proportionate, and as such morally obligatory, insofar as and until it is seen to have attained its proper finality, which in the present case consists in providing nourishment to the patient and alleviation of his suffering....* \\"The evaluation of probabilities, founded on waning hopes for recovery when the vegetative state is prolonged beyond a year, cannot ethically justify the cessation or interruption of minimal care for the patient, including nutrition and hydration. Death by starvation or dehydration is, in fact, the only possible outcome as a result of their withdrawal. In this sense it ends up becoming, if done knowingly and willingly, true and proper euthanasia by omission.\\"In 2006, Karen Ann's mom was paired with Michael Schiavo at a bioethics symposium at the University of Pennsylvania.

This is something I had trouble doing for several years after accepting Christ as my Savior. I always had the nagging voice of the enemy telling me I could never be totally free of my past wrongs.Chapter by chapter the book points out so many scriptures of how much God loves us and what He promises and tells us. There are short comments from other women too. I was finally able to break free of that past and truly receive His love without a doubt left.This book will is great for great group study or individual study.

Of special merit is his challenge to those interested in understanding human organizations as complex adaptive systems to remember that these organizations are comprised of humans, not computer agents or ants. He asks us to be wary of simplistic transfers of complexity principles into the management domain. He then offers the theory of &quot;relationship psychology&quot; as an alternative and explores its implications for understanding the mind and healthy, creative organizational dynamics, putting the human back in the complex adaptive, or as he suggests, responsive, system.Ralph Stacey has done more than any other management theorist to examine the intersection of complexity science and organizational thinking. He has been intelligently, provocative and challenging all along and has helped this intersection advance. You'll always want to stay in touch with what he is saying."},{"Title":"Strategic Management and Organisational Dynamics: The Challenge of Complexity","review":"I came to b-school from an academic background (I was pursuing a Ph.D. in another field) and I believe that this book is highly underappreciated by many business-types. It is arguably more dense and more abstract than what most b-school students are (and want to be) comfortable with, but given the turmoil in the business world as of late, it is high time that business practitioners re-think how they approach their work and the understanding that they have of their work and their organization.Stacey introduces many abstract theories on how to THINK about what we do as business practitioners. If you want a book that tells you step-by-step exactly what to do in your job, then this is not the book for you. Stacey's point is that if you want a step-by-step guide to tell you exactly what to do in your job, you are likely taking the wrong approach to your job. The take-away is that in order to be the best at our jobs we all must understand our own assumptions and biases and also decypher, uncover, and question the assumptions and biases of those around us - yes, even your boss'. Stacey does a pretty good job of trying to make his underlying assumptions clear, which allows to reader to better understand where he is coming from in the advice that he presents.Altough the material will no doubt make many b-school students and business practitioners uncomfortable this book should be required reading for all first-semester MBAs."},{"Title":"Strategic Management and Organisational Dynamics: The Challenge of Complexity","review":"This text has great information but it is like reading an instruction manual or phone book.

She asks her co-worker and best friend Josh Weber to masquerade as her beau in front of her family.Josh has mixed feelings about playing this role temporarily. Though he still dates, none of the women compare favorably in his mind to Piper. The three day weekend with her is the opportunity he seeks to expand their friendship into a permanent loving relationship, but to succeed in front of her family will be difficult. What he did not expect is the Jamison brood to root for him as he uses kisses to show Piper how much he cherishes her, but will she get the message that he wants caffeine not decaf?Though the plot device has been used so often, it should feel trite, Tanya Michaels makes her fine contemporary tale feel fresh and lively due to a strong cast. The lead couple is a delightful pair as Josh has his chance, but knows how the odds stack up against him with his stubborn beloved. Piper is the classic example of why love is blind as she cannot see what every else knows. Still she is likable as her eyes become aware of Josh even when she sleeps.

But Hero begins withdrawing from her like he usually does with his past lovers. How will heroine respond to his withdrawal?This was a fast read for me. Michaels' wrote this book with some humour, good emotional pull, exciting sexual chemistry, & hot sex scenes. I liked that how the main characters established a solid & comfortable platonic friendship before they became lovers. And their r/s change came somewhat gradually, with both finding themselves thinking more of each other sexually but fighting it b/c they didn't want to ruin a good friendship. I liked both main characters. Independent & hard-working heroine didn't let other's opinions stop her from going after her goals. She was a strong woman & it took guts for her to fight back Hero's rejection with asserting her love for him & how he loves her back too. She feared being controlled by the man in her life & lumped this with marriage & family in general. Playboy Hero acted like he was shallow on the outside but he was deliberate about hiding his fears.

Now he is back with a slightly different suspense novel. This one features two brothers from New York who go to Ireland to investigate the kidnapping of a man and his young daughter. The title of his new novel is A Second Chance and was published by Writer's Advantage, an imprint of iUniverse.Joe Luanturco and his brother Frank have had a career change. After a heart attack, Frank is looking to do something different in his life. Joe is looking for an adventure, or at least something different from his dead end job. An uncle of theirs loans them money to start a private investigation firm. The brothers start out slow with a few tailing jobs that end up with finding sad things out for their clients.Now the brothers have an all-new case. Thomas Sullivan and his daughter Tiffany are over in Ireland. They seemed to have been kidnapped. Thomas' mother hires Joe and Frank to go over to Ireland and find her son and granddaughter.What the guys encounter when getting to Ireland is a culture that is a lot different than their own. The Irish have small cars and like to drink a lot. Some of them are really friendly and others not so. Joe and Frank find a quick friend in a young man named Shamus who helps them in their quest to find Thomas and Tiffany.Another person involved in the case is a psychic back in the U.S. She seems to be having visions about where Tiffany and her father are being held. Joe and Frank rely on her visions to help them with clues to the kidnappers. There is also a young woman named Gerty who is special to Shamus and becomes invaluable to both Joe and Frank.The novel has some humorous moments in amongst the drama. There is not a lot of sex and violence in the book. We read about the guys getting shot at and having a fight with someone involved with the kidnappers. Frank is happily married and Joe has a serious girlfriend, so there isn't any bed hopping to be found here. As a matter of fact, the guys try to call home often to speak to their loved ones.A Second Chance was not too bad for a detective novel. Joe and Frank are definitely out of their element when coming to the Emerald Isle. They aren't the world's best investigators, nor are they great adventurers. But the two brothers really want to succeed and get Thomas and Tiffany back safe and sound.A Second Chance is an easy read and an entertaining mystery. Having to rely on information from a psychic is not investigative traits I would consider an asset, but it works good as a plot device here."},{"Title":"Dangerous Drawings: Interviews with Comix and Graphix Artists","review":"This book contains a whole bunch of interviews with a whole bunch of artist, mostly comic-book artists working outside of the mainstream. The interviews themselves are quite interesting, but for me the best thing was getting a look at some work by cartoonists that I was not very familiar with. The book is filled with samples of each creator's work.The interview with Chris Ware made me go out and buy all the issues of &quot;Acme Novelty Library&quot; that I could find. In fact, a single excerpt from his work (printed on page 51 of this book) made me decide. He draws in about 12 square inches what takes Scott McCloud 100 pages to describe in Understanding Comics.The one complaint that I have is that a few of the subjects don't seem to fit. Three out of the 14 interviewees don't work in comics. While they are interesting interviews (I remember the Eli Langer case, so his interview was fascinating), they don't feel like they belong in this book. Either they should have been cut, or we should have had *more* of them. Because as it is, 11 of the 14 interviewees work in comics. And that makes the other 3 stand out oddly.In any case, this is a great read, and it makes a good gift to people interested in cutting edge art who *aren't* into comics. It will let them know how cool some comics really are."},{"Title":"Dangerous Drawings: Interviews with Comix and Graphix Artists","review":"A nice addition to the post RE/Search works, and follows heavily in the steps laid by RE/Search. This is a collection of interviews with 14 artists, along with a single essay by Art Spiegelman that gives an alternate view of comics history than the one related in Scott McCloud's Understanding Comics. It seems to be a primer for non-initiates to the world of underground pop-art, especially comics.Some of those interviewed are independent comic &quot;gods&quot;- Art Spiegelman, in particular, has won a Pulitzer Prize for his work Maus. Other artists, like G.B. Jones and Emiko Shimoda, expose the new reader to a world they probably had never thought about, let alone see in print. All of the artists chosen are, while working within the confines of pop-art, outside of the mainstream. Looking at familiar motifs, like comics, album covers, or even gay art (for those familiar with tom of Finland), in new and different ways is what this is all about.Andrea's interviewing style is good; these aren't antagonistic interviews, nor are they rigid- they are open ended, to allow the artists to expound and expand on a subject. While some of the artists fall a little flat and come across as dull, there are some gems. The Chris Ware interview in particular is a great read, and will convert most who read it into Ware fans.So, why only three stars?Like another reviewer stated, the fact that the majority of the interviewees are comic artists makes the ones who aren't stick out like a sore thumb. Eli Langer's inclusion is especially offsetting. While his status as an &quot;edgy&quot; artist merits inclusion under this book's broad title, he has little in common with the other artists. His pseudo-child-porn drawings, while not appealing to a pedophile and not pornographic, also show little artistic merit. (One picture of a man holding a baby above a baying dog reminds me of a Gary Larson &quot;Far Side&quot; cartoon.)The inclusion of Keith Mayerson as an interview subject- although shoved to the back of the book- seems somewhat self-serving, as Juno Books had just published his Horror Hospital Unplugged graphic novel (his first published work).The paltry number of essays- only one- is disappointing, considering how reference-quality earlier RE/Search books have been. A collection of interviews, while interesting, does not demand rereading and reference.Some of the interviews, especially the potentially intriguing Matt Reid one (grafitti/hip hop artist), are too short and convey no real message beyond a pedestrian view of currently published works. In other interviews, where Andrea obviously is acquainted with the interviewee, much time is spent talking about inside knowledge or incidents- for a book that aims to be an introduction to avant-garde pop art, it's a mistake to assume readers will understand what is going on. Finally, while some of the interviews were interesting, they never really got beyond anything that the Comics Journal is capable of.This isn't being said to ward off potential readers- in fact, for people unfamiliar with &quot;comix&quot;, the rating should probably be higher. But, I'm familiar both with &quot;comix&quot; and with RE/Search books, and while the book is a worthwhile and readable book, it doesn't quite come up to my heightened expectations, and comes across as a good- if average- book with occasional bursts of excellence."},{"Title":"Dangerous Drawings: Interviews with Comix and Graphix Artists","review":"I have owned this book for years, and I still find myself picking it back up and re-inspiring myself to be more devious in my own comic-writing.Personally, Julie Doucet is my favorite comic book artist, and I learned about her first through this book. Eli Langer has pushed the limits so much & gotten away with it. I love his story. It's also nice to be able to put a \\"face to the name\\" and get to see the artists' mugs- which are often also quite amusing.All that I have to suggest is that if you are not willing to expose yourself to the whole \\"bloody-pedophelic-rape-abused\\" experience, I would say don't buy this book.

I only wish it was priced lower."},{"Title":"Trail to Vicksburg (Leisure Western)","review":"This book contains two novellas. The first one is a reprint from a 1953 Western pulp magazine. They used to cost a quarter, so for thirty cents you could read a novella and several short stories about the old West and still have enough money left over for a large root beer. It made for a great summer day. The first story, &quot;The Golden Magnet,&quot; is wall-to-wall action. The ending is quite rushed, as though Patten had to reach a certain word count and not exceed it. Regardless, it's fun. The second story is much better. It's a Civil War tale that was originally rejected because of the Civil War theme, then found years later among Patten's papers. Today, of course, Westerns are a quiet corner of the market and Civil War fiction is on fire. In the 1950s, though, a drug store book rack was usually about 30% Westerns with flashy cover pictures of trail drives and gun battles in the streets. It was great! Reading Patten is like reading L'Amour. Smooth, with lots of action and entertainment and memories of another era. I read many of his novels in the 1970s and it's great to see him back in print."},{"Title":"Screen Smarts: Raising Media-Literate Kids","review":"Have you ever wondered what the effects of a media-centered world can have on a child? Gloria De Gaetano tells us her ideas in her book called Screen Smarts. Childhood is a fundamental time of development for the human brain. In our formative years we learn the necessary thinking skills to function in life, ie: problem solving, eye-hand coordination, critical thinking, etc. We develop these skills through everyday things that children do in play. However, things are changing. A lot of children's spare time is spent watching TV, playing video games, or using the computer. This means less time is spent exercising ( children today are more out of shape than ever before) or creative activities. The less time spent in tactile exploration of the sensory world ( real life), the harder it is for the brain to develop certain areas. Looking at two-dimensional screen images is much different than actually experiencing 3-D activities, which is what the brain needs. Gloria encourages parents to turn off the TV a little more and to do something like read a book with their children.All of this may seem some-what depressing to the average parent living in today's world. Time and energy is not easy to come by. So Gloria also suggests some ways to make TV viewing more beneficial to a small, developing brain. Treat a TV program as you would a book. Ask the child what they think the show will be about at the beginning. When something important is about to happen, mention the music or something else pertaining to the event. Ask the child what they think is going to happen next. At the end of a program, go back to what they thought it was going to be about at the beginning of the show. Discuss the differences and the similarities, even talk about what the outcome might have been if something happened differently. Of course different kinds of questions would be asked and discussed with different age groups. This thoughtful discussion helps the child to actually think, analyze, and predict what they are watching.I suggest Gloria's book to anyone. It is very interesting and you can learn so much from it. Becoming media literate is a smart thing to do...Control your environment or it will control you!"},{"Title":"Screen Smarts: Raising Media-Literate Kids","review":"An easily readable documentation on the problems and solutions involving video and screen technologies.

Sam's mother Philippa wants to return to her native New England, so she and Sam leave Indiana and Sam's paternal grandparents and the farm Sam where Sam grew up. Once in New England, Philippa throws herself into restoring the old house they live in and inspiring a love of literature to Sam and area youth.Sam's first friend is an elderly ornithologist named Gus Early who has carved out a career photographing eagles. Gus tells Sam of the terrible floods during the 1920s that have wiped out four small communities. This in turn has caused a reservoir and many families were forced to relocate. Sam researches these communities along with the help of Philippa, who supports the boy's interest.As expected, Sam becomes fascinated with the eagles, the environment and their safety. He confronts Gus' impending death and sadly accepts the inevitable. He also has some other issues to contend with, including Lucy. He meets Lucy while she is out on a nature walk with a group of children from the town's Home for the Homeless (what a depressing name for a place)! She exhibits behavior that fits the classic profile of Kanner's or infantile autism. She does not speak; make eye contact or interact in any way others can find meaningful. Sam is drawn to the \\"mysterious girl\\" and visits her at the Home. One thing that I had trouble buying was how the staff openly disclosed Lucy's diagnosis and history with Sam who himself was a minor and in no way related to Lucy. Also, the definition of autism that was provided is incorrect - autism is NOT a \\"mental disorder;\\" it IS a neurobiological condition that affects sensory processing and communication to varying degrees, based on the individual. I also did not like the way the staff talked to the girl and moved her about as if she were an object. Whatever happened to client confidentiality? For Pete's Sake!In time, the pair bond and Lucy takes Sam through the world of the eagles, the mystical, magical, mysterious \\"time traveling\\" through their bond with the eagles. Although it made for a fairly interesting premise and the descriptions and information about the eagles was first rate, I thought this was a rather weird story. Time and space were fluid and not clearly defined; the way the time travel sequence was portrayed was a tad confusing and did not quite blend as well with the other parts of the story. The other objection I had was that it was never really clear which time frame Lucy originated and the way her life history seemed to change on a dime. I also did not like the fact that Lucy was \\"cured\\" of autism and showed no traces of the condition and how she was predictably adopted by Philippa. That made for too predictable an outcome.The book was tediously written in parts and what weakened an otherwise good effort was the fantasy element. That dragged in places and the fluid boundaries that time was given (a property that time really does NOT have - time is rigid and immutable) and the death and reinstatement of life in some of the characters made for a bizarre and somewhat confusing story. I loved the factual information about the eagles and the author's notes about the New England area and its history.This book made me think of the 1976 Steve Miller Band classic \\"Fly Like an Eagle.\\" Very a propos indeed."},{"Title":"Pigment of the Imagination: A History of Phytochrome Research","review":"Hold the phone fellow Phytonerds!.... Here is your definitive skip along the Aqua/Teal Brick Road leading to the Oz of plant photobiology. Ms. Sage has done one heckuva job here in compiling the story of Phytochrome, the Wondercule. She has traveled the world to interview the living major players of phytochrome research in an effort to drain their brains of the scientific and anecdotal information regarding the story of this fascinating photoreceptor first discovered in plants. Phytochrome is immensely important to normal plant development. With both Pr and Pfr playing center stage, you are treated to one of plant biology's finest sagas of ongoing discovery. Flowering, seed germination, gene regulation, and lots more fill these pages with text and data that just itch to grab at your own photoreceptors. However, this field is clearly hitting the ground with its feet running, since this text is now already way out of date.

But in this work I found him drifting outside his traditional strength, an encyclopedic understanding of Western American history, into the role of social commentator. That's a shame because in this role he sheds his strength and becomes like everyone else, a holder of an opinion. That is OK I guess, everyone is entitled to his or her opinion, but David's opinions on social inequality are not why people will buy this book. They will buy it, as I did, because the author is known for being decidedly unbiased in his historic analysis.I found a whites-are-bad type of bias, an apology of a sort or an admission of guilt because of the behaviors of people who lived as long as 175 years ago. While Lavender has always held fresh and quite strong opinions, I found this type of apologia approach somewhat disconcerting, pulling him away from what I thought was the focus of this book, the history of the Southwest.As far as the history itself goes this book provides a topical brief with the usual cast of characters, the Spaniards and the Indians, the Mexicans and the Americans and the Indians and the Americans. As always, Lavender is in command of his topic with the Spanish period being particularly well done. If you are unfamiliar with America's Southwest you will find this work useful in understanding the unique historic events and participants specific to this remarkable area of the United States. However, if you are already quite familiar with what occurred in the Southwest and how it unfolded over time, there is surprisingly little that is new except for the bias mentioned earlier."},{"Title":"...Winter in Taos","review":"This book, Winter in Taos, along with its counterpart, Edge of Taos Desert are treasures in my library. I never lend them out and they have a special place in my home where I keep my favorate books. I first learned of Mabel many, many years ago through my mother, who was a niece, or great-niece of Antonio Lujan, Mabel's last husband. She told me that Mabel was an author and wrote of Taos and many people of the area, including people she knew or was related to. As an adult, I discovered these books in a library and later purchased them through Amazon to learn more about this intriguing woman. Regretfully, I never knew her, although my mother did. This is the type of book that makes you want to make a cup of hot tea, curl up on a cold winter afternoon and immerse yourself in her storytelling; and since I know the areas about which she writes, I also try to visualize what it must have been like during the 1920's, when she walked the paths and trails, before Taos became widely known to the outside world. Whenever I'm in Taos, I visit her grave and say my silent hellos, and wish again that I could have known her."},{"Title":"...Winter in Taos","review":"There were two books I was delighted to come across this month. One was Winter in Taos - over 200 pages of absorbing essay, sprinkled with a dozen or so full-page b & w photos of the Mabel Dodge Luhan house and its environs. First published in 1935, when the writer, Mabel Dodge Luhan was 56, Winter in Taos is an elegant study of passing the seasons hour by hour in a landscape unequaled by the most beautifully wrought architecture of any city in the world. A good deal occurs, but in timeworn (inimitable) New Mexican fashion. The cycles of the seasons may not vary a good deal from decade to decade, but the details of daily life are nuanced and divergent. Ms. Luhan is a bit self-absorbed and uber-contemplative (not unlike her neighbor D.H. Lawrence, or contemporary F. Scott Fitzgerald), but she realizes it, indulges it (for a second or two) and moves on (almost immediately)."},{"Title":"...Winter in Taos","review":"If you love Taos then this book is for you!

Tarot Keys, is significant for a number of reasons. This was one of the first works in which several Occult secrets about the Tarot-- secrets which, until then, had been closely-guarded by a handful of reclusive Orders and Fraternities-- were revealed to the general public for the first time.Perhaps most importantly, this was the first book that openly published the correct Hebrew letter attributions of each Key-- publicly linking Qabala and Tarot for the first time. Previous books on the subject had either employed blinds or blatant falsehoods to conceal the correct attributions. Publishing these correct Hebrew letter attributions was a bold step, and although it's hard to imagine today, Case's decision to go public with this information was extremely controversial among Occultists at the time.This book also revealed the Tarot tableau, a pattern for laying out all of the Tarot Keys which reveals certain relationships and dissimilarities between them-- relationships which might not otherwise be apparent to the casual reader. This tableau was used by the American branch of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn when Case was Praemonstrator of that Order, and like the correct Hebrew letter attributions of each Key, it had never been openly published before.Last, but certainly not least, this was the first published book to reveal ALMOST ALL of the Tarot attributions on the Qabalistic \\"Cube of Space\\" diagram. Until the publication of this book, most Occultists had never even heard of the Cube of Space, had no idea what its attributions were, and couldn't have guessed about how it related to the much better-known \\"Tree of Life\\" diagram. (To give you an idea about just how esoteric this subject really is, consider that until the mid-1990's there were almost no other books in print that even mentioned the Cube of Space!)One of the things that I really like about this book is that it includes Paul Foster Case's only public commentary about his own \\"Pattern on the Trestleboard,\\" which is sort of like a Qabalistic catechism. Granted, Case's comments are pointedly brief, but they also place \\"The Pattern on the Trestleboard\\" firmly in the public domain, where they can be openly discussed with people who aren't members of Case's organization, Builders of the Adytum (B.O.T.A.).Older editions of this work also include the B.O.T.A. method for Tarot divination-- something that many of its members would be surprised to learn about, since B.O.T.A. repeatedly emphasizes that Tarot is primarily a tool for meditation, not divination! The truth is that Tarot works rather well in either capacity, but using the Keys for divination might distract from a beginning student's more important task of discovering his or her own \\"Inner Self\\" through meditation. Case's method of divination is similar in many respects to various Golden Dawn and Crowleyan methods that I've seen printed elsewhere-- but with some interesting, and perhaps not insignificant, differences.As if this weren't enough to entice the serious Occultist, however, Case's analysis of each of the twenty-two Tarot Keys is nothing short of masterly. This is really the one area in which Paul Foster Case's book towers above almost any other book about the Tarot! Each Key is considered in light of its imagery, the Hebrew letter to which it is assigned, that letter's attribution of the Tree of Life, that letter's mode of Intelligence from the BOOK OF FORMATION, that letter's numerological significance, the Key's astrological associations... and on and on and on. This isn't the sort of book that can be lightly read once and then set it aside-- this is a reference work which should be consulted frequently!The Keys themselves are lovely. Although B.O.T.A. as an organization resisted printing colored versions of these Keys for many years (Paul Foster Case insisted that coloring your own Keys was an important step in memorizing their exact details), newer editions of this book depict each Key in full glorious color! Even the black and white editions of this book are lovely, however, emphasizing details which might be missed in colorized versions. Based rather closely on A.E. Waite's Tarot, the B.O.T.A. deck departs radically from Waite's designs on a few of the Keys.If Qabala is the Key to Western Occultism, Tarot is surely the Key to Qabala! This is one of the best available works on Tarot, and Paul Foster Case's masterly analysis of the Tarot Keys can't lead you in the wrong direction. Highly recommended for any Tarot enthusiast![...]SHALOM!"},{"Title":"The Tarot - A Key To The Wisdom Of The Ages","review":"If you take a delight in the esoteric, cryptic, and seemingly irrelevant, pay attention to this book. Case puts every card in its context; he invariably begins by describing its Hebrew origins, its diverse associations, and its symbolic place in the tarot. As with any real tarot book, it is useless without considerable meditation and tarot-work outside of the book; slowly the perspective that he communicates will enrich your understanding of the cards.This book will be useless to any who haven't gotten the basic gist of tarot already. You see, it is simply a combination of the elements and numerology; numerology is, I think, the richer aspect of the two. Once you have a basic understanding of it, this book has the information to refine that understanding. It can also help to introduce you to the Caballah through the Tarot.If you aren't too used to tarot cards yet, try buying a book that addresses numerology directly, but very straightforwardly--Case is more straightforward than the old guarde of esoterists, but that won't mean much to a newcomer.Also, some newfangled Tarot decks don't (I believe) really pay all that much attention to numerology. If that is the type of deck you are reading, this book will be useless to you. Some fairly orthodox decks are the Rider/Waite deck, the Golden Dawn Tarot, and the Thoth deck.Yet another thing: Case comes at it from the Hebrew side, but the Egyptian side is also extremely relevant. I don't know much about astrology, but word is that side is also suitable..especially for a deck such as Thoth, which has astrological symbols all over the place. Case addresses a bit of astrology.This book has taught me a great deal and continues to do so.

He was a leading Adept of the Rosicrucian Order of the Alpha et Omega headed by S. L. MacGregor Mathers. Case joined the A..O.. in 1918 after an invitation from the Cancellarius of Thoth-Hermes Lodge, Michael Whitty. Case's fraternal motto in the Order was Frater Perserverantia {perseverance}. Frater Perserverantia advanced through the outer grades, culminating in his initiation into the Rosae Rubeae et Aureae Crucis in 1920. Case corresponded with Dr. John William Brodie-Innes {Fr. Sub Spe} and Dr. Israel Regardie {Frater Ad Majorem Adonai Gloriam} about the Cabala, politics of the Golden Dawn lineal succession, Tarot, and overlooked dangers of Enochian magic. Case later established the Builders of the Adytum (B.O.T.A), which continues to exist as an international Order providing comprehensive training in the Western Mystery Tradition, Tarot, Cabala, and Alchemy. Paul Foster Case was a prolific writer and some of his books include: An Introduction to the Study of the Tarot (1920), A Brief Analysis of the Tarot (1927), The True and Invisible Rosicrucian Order (1927), The Book of Tokens (1934), The Great Seal of the United States (1935), The Open Door (1938), and The Tarot: A Key to the Wisdom of the Ages (1947). Tarot: A Key to the Wisdom of the Ages is an exquisite work of Tarot allegory, Cabalistic symbolism, astrology, and meditation of the Arcana. All students of the Western Mystery Tradition, whether working as Hermits or within the confines of an established Fraternal Order, will find the meditations and astrological correspondences of the Trumps invaluable.Tarot, published in 1947 is an instant occult classic for students of the interlocking systems of the Invisible Colleges. This classic offers definitive explanations on the arcane alignment of Tarot and numerology, the construction of the Major Arcana, and their attribution to the Hebrew alphabet. Using clear and precise language for an audience of Adepti and Neophytes alike, Case expounds Tarot history and technique for Students of the Arte to apply the principles of Tarot-and the correspondences of symbol, tone, color, musical correspondences, and zodiac to their lives. Case delves deep into the Cabalistic significance of the Major Arcana and does not linger on divinatory practice. The book is most useful for those initiates or practitioners who have an understanding of the esoteric significance of the cards. Frater Case elucidates the symbolism mostly of each Major Arcana card, deepening the students understanding of not only astrological and Cabalistic connotations, but of musical correspondences as well. Music indeed would enrich the meditations behind each Trump, supported by Adept interpretations of the interplay between Zodiac & Tarot. This book, issued for the first time in 1947 by Case's Builders of the Adytum, is the first to use the correct alignment of the Hebrew alphabet with the 22 Trumps. This alignment corrected previous miscalculations, and also was the first thesis to offer the \\"Cube of Space\\" tableau, a system almost unheard by Adepti of the Golden Dawn lineages. Case writes on the Tarot: \\"Tarot divination is not fortune-telling. The practice of fortune-telling is based on the false notion that human life is governed by luck, chance, or fate - by obscure powers at work outside the personality. True divination rests upon the occult truth that the causes of all events in human life are really internal, proceeding from the Cause of Causes, - the Universal Intelligent Energy or Life-power which is the Source, Mover, and Knower behind all the phenomena of the universe.\\" His wisdom and esoteric teaching in this book indicates a true Teacher and pioneer in this purgatorial world."},{"Title":"The Tarot - A Key To The Wisdom Of The Ages","review":"If you are a Tarot reader, new or old, this is a must have book.

A renowned expert on the Tarot and Kabbalah, he was the author of 13 books on occult matters and the founder of the mystery school the Builders of the Adytum. Perhaps his best-known work was his 1947 book The Tarot, which purports to lay clear a system of divination with these eponymous scrying cards. But with accurate scholarship on the real history, meaning, and purpose of the Tarot as neoplatonic emblems intended to serve as mnemonic devices for spiritual concepts, there is no need to read Case's pseudo-Hebraic babble, save perhaps as a historical curiosity. (Christophe Poncet's recent work tracing the Tarot back to Marsilio Ficino, for instance, is far more illuminating.)''Peruse this book if you will but be warned of its shortcomings. Case elaborates upon and continues the historical misunderstanding of the Tarot. Yet, at the same time, he is the one responsible for our modern conception of this magical tool. This makes his book at once valuable and misleading: It is the source from which many other Tarot books have been drawn, yet his scholarship is, to put it mildly, questionable. The Tarot is thus worth owning but not for its original purposes.--Ken MondscheinMysteries Magazine issue #20"},{"Title":"The Tarot - A Key To The Wisdom Of The Ages","review":"The book was printed in black and white.

Prepared by the Group for the Renewal of Worship, the guide is lavishly illustrated and written in a friendly tone, trying its best to convince conservative clergy and parishioners of the efficacy of the new materials.The book begins with a view of the various forms of worship used in England over the last 1500 years. With a somewhat new look nearly every century, it is quickly evident that continual change in liturgy is a major part of the CoE's tradition. It then discusses what exactly worship is and the nature of the God we Anglicans worship. The latter half of the book is dedicated to the Common Worship materials, explaining its various service forms, including prayer meetings and special events. It clearly explains the origins of each part of the prayer book, showing in what era each tradition entered the liturgy. Those who disliked the Alternate Services Book and mistrust Common Worship may be quite surprised to see how much of the current liturgy is still derived from the time of Cranmer or the Church Fathers. It is not all newfangled innovation, says COMMON WORSHIP TODAY.This book can be useful for many people, not only the conservative pastor who sticks to the Book of Common Prayer, but also Anglicans who simply need a larger view of the traditions of their church. What I thought was the most admirable aspect of the book is that it would also offer a fine presentation of the Church of England to other Christian denominations. I would recommend COMMON WORSHIP TODAY as essential reading for all Anglicans."},{"Title":"The Maestro","review":"T. Davis Bunn is one of the best Christian fiction authors alive today. I have enjoyed all of his books, and been challenged by many of them, but the Maestro is one of his best. Telling the story of God's calling a very gifted musician to Himself, almost against the musician's will. One of the issues this book raises is how we, as Christians, view &quot;our&quot; gifts. Do we consider them our's or God's? If you can get this book then do so, it took me three months (well, it took Amazon three months -- I just sat back and let them do the searching) but it was worth it. God Bless."},{"Title":"The Maestro","review":"As a musician I found this book very insightful and touching...

A great read!"},{"Title":"Devil on my shoulder","review":"I recently saw this book on someone's \`wish-list' and I noted it had no reviews. I read it about 1979/80 and for some reason quite a few details stick in my mind, so with that in mind I'll review it as best I can.Becker joined the artillery branch of the German army, primarily because it had the best uniform and he thought it would help him impress girls. With this training behind him he was assigned to the 13th Panzer Division as a tank gunner. He writes of his tank crew and several of the actions they fought in. I remember very clearly that prior to their final battle, their own tank was unavailable but they begged to take out a replacement one. They did not have time though to paint their \`score' on the gun barrel and they thought this might be unlucky. So it proved and they are hit. I can't recall precisely whether this is where Becker is captured but at one point his earlier good-will to a Russian soldier is repaid. In any case the second and larger part of the book covers Becker's time as a POW.I can't recall the treatment he encountered while the war still continued but Becker ends up spending quite a few years in a Soviet mine. He seemed to be treated reasonably decently and there always seemed to be many more Russian prisoners than German. A quota system operated where-by each inmate was to mine a particular amount of ore. To give himself something to do, Becker perversely often mined more, one time managing to produce four times his quota. The Russians thought him mad but it was a way to keep himself sane. It was interesting reading of the various ways that the Germans (and others) filled in time. In the end he is freed, I think during the major 1950 release.Given I can remember these things from 30 years ago, I'm inclined to think it was a well written and interesting book. I hope the elements that I've outlined might be useful to future readers."},{"Title":"Devil on my shoulder","review":"Accidentally I bumped on to the Russian edition of this book which had taken me completely (\\"Na voine I v plenu\\", Moscow 2012).Lively written but not about the war, rather of author\`s experience in captivity.Interesting testimony of the German soldier in Soviet land, which he failed to invade."},{"Title":"Saddam's Secrets: The Hunt for Iraq's Hidden Weapons","review":"Hidden behind a seemingly specialised subject, Saddam's Secrets, lies the extraordinary story of one of this centuries greatest political transformations - that of the United Nations evolving from a forum of bitter rivalries into an arbiter of morals with the power and will to punish wrongdoers on a global scale. By setting up UNSCOM and appropriating a military force under its light blue banner, the United Nations (UN) heralded a new era from which it roared a resonant political focus. The events that led to this are detailed and analysed with Tim Trevan's aquiline eye and hawkish wit. The author unfolds the unique and bizarre story of the multi-faceted battle of two determined and abstractly united foes in a fragile world...The premise is quite simple, as was my understating through CNN and the BBC that Saddam and his evil regime had lost the Gulf war and would be divested of the weapons of mass destruction it had accumulated and would not be capable of threatening its neighbours ever again.The organ tasked to deliver this mission and the hopes of a \`new world order' was UNSCOM. It would have to find out how much weaponry the Iraqis ever had, where the remaining arms were concealed and then destroy any that were warranted as offensive.

In what I admittedly would fess up to be a bit of a stereotype, the author is British thus the book is a bit on the dry side and full of detail. So much detail that at times it gets in the way of the main story. The author not only covers the story of how the Iraqi's hid the weapons or hindered the inspectors, but he also covers the formation of the weapons inspection team and process. He also covers many of the people involved and if you watched the lead up to the latest Iraqi war then you know all the names involved in this book. It seams like the years change, but the main experts are all the same.The most interesting parts of the book for me covered the inspection process. I expected and heard a lot of about how difficult the Iraqi's made it for the inspectors. A constant peaty and nagging version of a cat and mouse game that would make even the most patent man scream in frustration. What I had not read before was the different ways the Iraqi's made it dangerous or how often the implied physical harm was around each corner. I kept wondering just how much these guys got paid given all the difficulties of their jobs, was it really worth it? The author also gives us a good review of the success the UN had in uncovering weapons in the first few years. The Iraqi's did seem to be somewhat cagey in their hiding of the weapons, but to be fair some of the discoveries were almost embarrassing for the Iraqi's. My toddler could have hidden some of the information and weapons better then these guys. It left one with the impression that the Iraqi's were in part a military organization filled up with incompetent relatives of Saddam that merely did as they were told with very little thinking.Overall the book was interesting if not a bit long winded. The author could have cut out about 25% of the book and still got his point across, but in a much more readable fashion. He slipped into minutia of detail that was dull and not needed. I half expected his meal menu's and bathroom break details. It was also a bit humorous, given what we know today, with the last section of the book that was devoted to the breathless urgency of the Saddam threat. As we have seen, Saddam's only weapon of mass destruction was famine and poverty. At the end of the day the unstated story up to this point is that in the realm of removing weapons from Iraq, the UN did it's job. The book is interesting, but do not be surprised if you find yourself skipping a page here and there."},{"Title":"Saddam's Secrets: The Hunt for Iraq's Hidden Weapons","review":"I thought this book was excellent and well written. Published in 99, it came out before the invasion. Goes into deep discussion about how Iraq prevented proper inspections of its weapons programs. After reading this book, it was hard not to believe that either Iraq was trying to build biological weapons or at least trying to convince investigators that they were. What is interesting about the inspections is that you would expect there to be some huge us military force rampaging through the country when in reality it was David Kay and handful of assistants staying in hotels and scheduling visits, well in advance, to suspected weapons sites. Reality is always so much simpler and less interesting than one expects."},{"Title":"Saddam's Secrets: The Hunt for Iraq's Hidden Weapons","review":"Hidden behind a seemingly specialised subject, Saddam's Secrets, lies the extraordinary story of one of this centuries greatest political transformations - that of the United Nations evolving from a forum of bitter rivalries into an arbiter of morals with the power and will to punish wrongdoers on a global scale.

I came across the book quite by accident from a lot of old paperbacks from the 1960's. Apparently, the author was quite well-known in his time and even collaborated with Booth Tarkington on some work. This story, published in 1915 might best be described as an American version of a Jeeves and Bertram Wooster novel (P.G. Wodehouse) only with Bertie turning the tables on Jeeves. The premise is that an English manservant is won in a hand of cards by a wealthy family of the American West from the second in line to an English Earldom: The heir needs money and the Americans need polish, or so thinks its matriarch. Of course, nothing goes to plan and we soon find that the butler, his former 'charge' and the Earl himself are all easily won over to the American way of seeing things, much to the consternation and despair of those Americans back home striving to be blue bloods in their own right. The comedy, of course, is in the events which bring about this conversion and finally to the ironic and humorous 'crowning' event. For fear of ruining the plot and the outcome, suffice it to say that parts of this book will doubtless have you laughing aloud as the author throws every possible twist and turn he can into the road that leads to our erstwhile butler becoming a successful entrepreneur and one of Red Gap's (\\"the fastest growing city in the state if not the entire country\\") finest, and a true blue American citizen.This story is especially interesting in light of recent world-wide events, what with the new climate of distrust and fear here in the United States and our recent pre-emptive military invasions of foreign countries, because the point the author makes in his story is a moral one: That it is the traditional American values of egalitarianism, hospitality, unpretentiousness, hardwork, friendship and friendliness which make America great and these are what cause foreigners to strive to adopt American ways and even to wish to become American. Fortunately, this comedy of manners come morality play doesn't become preachy or self-righteous as it exalts America to the world; however, it does have a somewhat disturbing amount of racially charged language which, although perhaps common to the time, is a bit unnerving to the modern, non-bigot reader. Furthermore, about one fifth of the book drags in places where the plot contrivances become a bit much but, having said that, the many delightful passages in the book which have the reader laughing out loud for prolonged periods more than make up for the rough edges and dodgy bits. This book is highly recommended to anyone who enjoys a good, smart farce and even more to those who are fascinated by snap shot literary glimpses into a bygone civilization and culture as certainly turn-of-the-century America is."},{"Title":"Ruggles of Red Gap (Armed Services edition)","review":"I stumbled upon this title when searching for Charles Laughton movies. Laughton starred in a 1935 movie of the same name. Since I couldn't find the movie, I searched to see if the movie was based on a novel. So, that's kind of a backward way to find this great read! Great satire contrasting social structure England vs America, with Ruggles, a 'proper' English butler finds himself lost in poker game to a brash lot of social climbers from America.Ruggles is to provide status to Cousin Egbert and clan so they can one up everyone in Red Gap by having an English butler. Ruggles narrates his adventures as he eventually \\"embraces\\" the American ideals of equality, but continues to struggle with 'the ideal of knowing who is your superior,in order to know who is your inferior'. Very tongue in cheek, witty, like nothing being written today.Since reading the book, I've found I can now order the DVD (Amazon Exclusive). It's great to find these hidden treasures."},{"Title":"Ruggles of Red Gap (Armed Services edition)","review":"I found an original copy of this book in a Deerfield, Massachusetts, bookstore and bought it for $2.00 (a steal). Reading it is like returning to those glorious days when novels were light, sophisticated, and enriching. The language is a bit dated but perfect for the character (Ruggles) and the time. It is a great lesson in the pretentions of our democracy. The satire cannot be lost on anyone who reads it. After reading it I picked up a modern day paperback and the difference was shocking. Maybe I'll limit myself to reading only early-twentieth century books for a time. Pick it up and return to those glorious days when society was literate and sat by the fire on cold nights to read about Ruggles's adventures in the Great West."},{"Title":"Ruggles of Red Gap (Armed Services edition)","review":"it takes a bit to get into the \\"old fashioned\\" writing, but when you do you are rewarded with a great read. i love how some things dont change, no matter what age it is. i especially love how America is portrayed. the equality that we have here is so different from what \\"Ruggles\\" is used too, yet he finds himself getting into the spirit of the west."},{"Title":"Ruggles of Red Gap (Armed Services edition)","review":"I thought I was purchasing a Western.

Only a bit more than 1/3 of the way through it. While I'm enjoying it, it's still not quite up to the Jeeves stories by Wodehouse.Looking at Americans from the standpoint of a very proper (in his estimation) English Gentleman's Man is entertaining. There are many misconceptions on his part,as well as by the Americans who he is living and traveling with. The misunderstanding of various phrases and euphamisms on both sides is also funny. However, since it is set in the West, in a different time frame, it is sometimes hard for me to appreciate the meaning or to find it as funny as it probably was when written. Perhaps I'd find it funnier if I was as familiar with the time and locale as I am with the Jeeves stories."},{"Title":"Smile if You Have Parkinson's","review":"It took a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease for Michael Beetner to finally realize his youthful ambition: to write an opinion column. Such a circumstance is unfortunate to say the least, but the resulting essays are informative, inspiring and downright funny.Beetner's writing style combines pointed humor and plain common sense in the best American story-telling tradition of Will Rogers and Mark Twain. There's a lot to be learned in this deceptively thin paperback. Fortunately, the reading experience is sufficiently pleasant to repeat as often as needed.I look forward to more work by Michael Beetner in the future."},{"Title":"Smile if You Have Parkinson's","review":"Because Parkinson's is a chronic disease--no cure as yet--those who have it--and their families & friends--must learn to live with it. Mr. Beetner offers the solace of wry wisdom and a good sense of humor to help smooth the road. The book is short and can be read PRN as a supplement to the usual assortment of pills the Parkie must take daily. Highly recommended, for new or long-time Parkinson's patients."},{"Title":"Smile if You Have Parkinson's","review":"In a series of short, funny essays (reprints of articles from a newsletter on Parkinson's disease) Mr. Beetner lets a little humor into the humorless world of Parkinson's.

Similar to the way that Minnesota informs all of Garrison Keillor's writings, Iowa figures prominently here. Funny and at times very poignant this quick read will surely buoy the spirits of a Parkinson's patient or provide many \\"it's funny because it's true\\" moments for patients and caregivers both.

Stupidity at its finest."},{"Title":"The Vast Left Wing Conspiracy: How Democratic Operatives Tried to Bring Down a President","review":"Actually this book is very soft on the failing democrat party. It is way too soft on charlatans like Michael Moore, Al Fracken.Really exposes the truth about Fahrenhyte 911 and why it wasn't the blockbuster movie that Moore claimed it to be. Virtually every other movie from the summer of '04 had better openings than Fahrenhyte 911. Even Alien vs Predator beat it. A nielsen type rating for movies indicated that Moore's fake-u-mentary did not really do that well, or as well as the left wing would have liked to pretend it did.The book discloses secret meeting with George Soros, Michael Moore and democrats in Washington and how they coined the term; \\"We must win.\\"You willr ead how the democrat party has become a very weak party in less than a decade and the bitternesss they hold because of that. The author feels that the right wing is even more dangerous now than ever. Shows how they tried but failed to topple a sitting president and will try harder next time. I don't see these guys as being anything but a bunch of impotent failures who will lie, cheat and try to win by all means...and still lose. I believe that the left wing has lost too much power and have zero credibility. Notice that even with Bush's ratings down to their lowest levels ever, the democrats are also at their lowest level ever and Americans still prefer Bush to Kerry by a 75/25 margin.In less than a decade the right wing has lost the house, the senate, the congress, the presidency and ALL CREDIBILITY!Overall good book."},{"Title":"The Vast Left Wing Conspiracy: How Democratic Operatives Tried to Bring Down a President","review":"At first glance the title may seem a bit over the top, but as the author explores the network on these pages, it becomes clear that his warning is as apt now as when the book was first published. Each chapter examines a leftwing group and its modus operandi. The real action started after the Democratic defeat of 2002 and York shows how the strange coalition of leftist operatives tried to circumvent the McCain-Feingold Reform Bill through the use of 527 organizations. They had much more money, but mercifully these far-left 527s only reinforced the beliefs of the converted and if anything, alienated centrist voters.Another failed tactic was the Michael Moore mockumentary Fahrenheit 9/11. York examines the income it generated and comes to the conclusion that it had high attendance figures only in the liberal urban areas. In the rest of the country it was a monumental flop. Its rival at the time, The Passion Of The Christ, was far more successful and will stand the test of time. And then there was Talk Radio. By now everybody knows that the leftist Air America has gone belly up. It has disappeared off the radar even in places like New York City.The people behind this cultish coalition includes eccentric billionaires likeGeorge Soros, hosts of Democratic Party operatives and politicians, groups like MoveOn and America Coming Together, academics, Hollywood celebrities and think tanks like The Center for American Progress. Of course, they had no clear policies or original ideas. A trenchant quote from a disillusioned activist sums it up: \\"Just getting larger amplifiers doesn't make the music any better.\\" Exactly!York tries to make sense out of Soros' behaviour from many interesting angles. Ultimately the weirdo billionaire gave away $27 million for nothing. Serves him right. This might even have helped stimulate the economy in a minor way so let's be grateful for small mercies. The most fascinating part of the book is where York examines the psychological motives behind this leftwing network. It is mainly hatred of President Bush and it functions very much like a mind-control cult. But impotent rage does not win elections and instead alienates decent people.This book illuminates the deepest recesses of the leftwing swamp and it does so in a most measured, intelligent and entertaining way. The Vast Left Wing Conspiracy is a very valuable guide and reference work to a dangerous and sinister force in American politics. For more information on various aspects of the Left, I highly recommend Sinisterism by Bruce Walker, Godless: The Church Of Liberalism by Ann Coulter,Liberal Fascismby Jonah Goldberg, The Professors andUnholy Alliance: Radical Islam and the American Leftby David Horowitz, Unhinged by Michelle Malkin and The Death Of Right And Wrong by Tammy Bruce. It is of cardinal importance that all people of goodwill become informed of both the external and internal dangers facing America."},{"Title":"The Vast Left Wing Conspiracy: How Democratic Operatives Tried to Bring Down a President","review":"In his eagerness to dismiss Byron York's book, the reviewer below inadvertently backs up one of York's points: that there does exist a network of blogs and e-mail reports that provide liberals with their talking points. Or perhaps it is just a coincidence that Gary's comment about the book's cover is lifted VERBATIM from the left-wing blog the Daily Kos (another name listed on the book's jacket).In any case, I'll echo the point that others have made: Why don't you read the book before you review it? And yes, I have read it. It's quite good; York's original reporting is especially impressive.If they bothered to read it, those so eager to trash the book might actually find some useful information about where Democrats went wrong in 2004."},{"Title":"The Vast Left Wing Conspiracy: How Democratic Operatives Tried to Bring Down a President","review":"I finally had time to finish this book. It's obvious to me that the lefties who dismissed it are really missing the boat. It's quite an objective chronicle and analysis of the left's campaign to unseat George Bush--what went wrong and what went right. I'll bet that this book is being pored over by democrat campaign strategists, but they are unlikely to admit it. The main message is that the left succeeded only in preaching to the converted. They could not persuade \\"everyday\\" people because of their elitism and disdain for regular folks.One point that I found fascinating concerns the continued failure of left-wing talk radio. The left claims to be trying to counter conservative talk radio, but instead, they are actually countering their own looney stereotype of conservative talk radio. As a result, they come off as nasty and strident.***********************************************It's amazing how lefties have negative \\"reviews\\" on this site the instant any book that's even remotely conservative appears. Having watched these reviews of books by Coulter, Levin, Hannity, Stossel, Lowry, and others, the usual leftie \\"review\\" warns anyone and everyone that they shouldn't read the book.Then there's the thinly disguised notion that perhaps no one should even be allowed to read the book. So much for free speech as practiced by the peace 'n love left who of course are for diversity of ideas and freedom of speech--as long as it's their ideas and their speech.Some more-generous lefties just question the writer's intelligence, literacy, or sanity. Seldom is any book of conservative thought and ideas critiqued on its points, but is just called a screed or a right-wing rant. No conservative book ever has enough research, footnotes, bibliography, or fact checking to satisfy the left. It's as if every other word has to be justified by a detailed argument, or the book is unworthy of being opened.Byron York is a writer for National Review, probably the preeminent journal of conservative thought. When the left is suggesting that everyone to the right of George Soros is a pinhead Bible-thumper, I wonder who they think reads National Review. Well, that's my lying, illiterate, right-wing, rant for today, folks."},{"Title":"The Vast Left Wing Conspiracy: How Democratic Operatives Tried to Bring Down a President","review":"The title of the book \\"The Vast Left Wing Conspiracy\\" is a sarcastic play-off Hillary's whole \\"Vast Right Wing Conspiracy\\" which she claimed when she was defending Bill's inability to be honest with the American people.

There is nothing absolutely groundbreaking and shocking here.

We knew the big election strategy of 2004 was to tell the nation Bush Must Go, and don't concentrate on who would replace him. This book makes many good talking points for a conservative who wants to deepen and refine their arguments, and illustrate the absurdity of most Democrat strategy and philosophy."},{"Title":"The Vast Left Wing Conspiracy: How Democratic Operatives Tried to Bring Down a President","review":"Will Rogers once famously joked that he did not belong to any organized political party. He was a Democrat. The 2004 presidential election was one time when the Democrats did try to get organized. And to a right-wing journalist, that idea is down right un-American.Byron York in the Vast Left Wing Conspiracy says that Democrats tried to organize in 2004 not just to win an election but, as his subtitle put it, \\"to Bring Down a President.\\" How dare they try to get George Bush out of office just because his term was up?Using similar rhetorical tricks throughout his book, York tries to make something sinister out of the new organizations and tactics that grew up to support the Democratic ticket in the last presidential election - groups like moveon.org, the Center for American Progress, Air America radio network, and America Coming Together, and tactics such as voter registration, guerilla documentaries, and Michael Moore movies. York's main storyline is that Democrats in 18 months copied the array of think-tanks, media, and so on that make up the Republican echo-chamber, which Senator Clinton labeled a \\"vast right-wing conspiracy.\\" York's story, of course, loses some of its sinister sheen since the Democratic effort did not succeed. But he uses Kerry's loss to show his other point - that the Democratic groups were only the radical fringe preaching to the choir and never appealed to the mainstream. Well, 59 million voters is a pretty big fringe group.The big bogeyman behind the operation in York's story is George Soros, who contributed some $27 million to Democratic causes prior to the 2004 elections. Big bucks in anybody's book, but far less than the millions that Richard Mellon Scaife has bestowed on the vast right wing conspiracy over the past two years -- $21.4 million to the Heritage Foundation, $7.7 million to Judicial Watch, $5.7 million to American Enterprise Institute, and of course, $2.4 million to American Spectator magazine for the Arkansas Project, to dig up dirt on President Clinton.York did mention Scaife's funding of the Arkansas Project, but I kept wondering why he never got around to any sort of meaningful comparison of Soros and Scaife. The reason was hidden in a footnote. York worked at the magazine during the Troopergate period, not on that project, but he still benefited from the increased circulation the mudslinging brought to the magazine. The other reason is that York is not at all interested in any sort of comparison between the two sets of organizations, only in discrediting the Democratic ones.That is obvious from the way York uses evidence. York appears to have done a lot of research to disprove Michael Moore's claim that Fahrenheit 9/11 \\"was the number-one movie in every single red state in America\\" right after it opened in June 2004. Unfortunately, most of the research is irrelevant. Instead of giving the reader stats on how the movie performed on its opening weekend, York presents an elaborate analysis of how the movie \\"underperformed\\" during its run in the states Bush carried in 2000. Then he does the same analysis with Mel Gibson's \\"Passion of Christ\\" to show how it \\"overperformed\\" in those states. What does that have to do with Moore's claim that his movie opened strong in those states? Nothing. York implies that Moore lied about how well his movie did, but instead of proving it, he delivers a classic snow job - a blizzard of facts that miss the point but covers everything up as a distraction.York does the same thing with Al Franken and Air America. Its first month on the air, Franken said ratings showed him beating Rush Limbaugh in New York City. York digs up ratings for the first three months to show Franken is wrong. Franken never said he beat Limbaugh for three months, only the first month. York also goes on for pages about a dispute with Franken over something York wrote about him, trying to make Franken seem petty for refusing to be interviewed.York devotes an entire chapter to Outfoxed, the movie on Fox News that got the News Hounds into the media monitoring business. Ellen already has dissected the chapter accurately in another post, pointing out the errors York made both in his interview of her and the way the movie was made. He criticizes the media monitors for being all white and all female, for example. Even though we News Hounds are all white and all female, the original monitors were not. Other monitors included at least one man and one Asian (it's hard to tell someone's race and gender, based on a conference call). But we eight were the ones who were able to stick it out.York also faults Outfoxed producer Robert Greenwald for not presenting a \\"more complex\\" picture of Fox by including clips of Fox not being biased. I suppose the prosecutor in the Michael Jackson case could present cases of children it says Jackson did not molest. But isn't that the job of the defense? And if a network says it is \\"fair and balanced,\\" shouldn't it be \\"fair and balanced\\" all the time, not just some of the time? He also confines the impact of Outfoxed to its box office take, ignoring the thousands who saw it on DVD's and the buzz created through the hundreds of reviews and newspaper articles on the film. Imagine if someone tried to confine the impact of the Slime Boat Veterans for Truth to the number of television ads it ran. The alternative method of film distribution pioneered by Greenwald and Moveon has immense potential.The goofiest chapter in York's book is the last, which has nothing to do with any new Democratic organizations or tactics. It deals with some off-Broadway show about a right-wing effort to turn the U.S. into a theocracy with laws based on the first five books of the Bible. York extrapolates from that show to charge that Democrats who use the word \\"theocracy\\" to describe Republican efforts to impose Christian morality on all America believe some sort of coup is in the works. By setting up and knocking down that strawman, York thinks he has proved there is nothing wrong with the 10 commandments in court houses, prayer in schools, and Congress intervening in the Terri Schiavo case.York's writing is not polemical, nor passionate. It is subtle and cool, but still biased. Instead of Democratic activists or Democratic groups, there are \\"anti-Bush activists\\" and \\"anti-Bush groups\\" - which makes what they do seem wrong, rather than just part of the political process. These groups are radical (no quotation marks) but they accuse Bush of having a \\"radical\\" agenda (with quotation marks, so the reader knows that York is questioning that characterization). And the phrase \\"bring down a president\\"? It's the same phrase York uses to describe what Troopergate was all about during the Clinton years.Lucky for those of us in the Vast Left Wing Conspiracy, York totally missed what really happened in the last election, how Democrats set aside special interests and worked for one overriding goal: defeating Bush and electing a Democrat. Democrats took some beginning steps toward setting up the framework that can articulate a broad agenda. York is right, however, that it was only a beginning, that came together very quickly, and that it will try harder next time."},{"Title":"The Vast Left Wing Conspiracy: How Democratic Operatives Tried to Bring Down a President","review":"York writes an interesting book and a worthwhile read if you are into the whole battle of the 'left' vs. the 'right'. York believes that the left will continue to get stronger in the future as it plots to take down the right. If York believes that the right is winning in spite of some vast left-wing conspiracy however, he is simply flattering his target audience. Overall I would recommend this to someone who is a strong Republican supporter but all others will probably be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Vast Left Wing Conspiracy: How Democratic Operatives Tried to Bring Down a President","review":"\\"And as National Review investigative writer Byron York reveals in this stunning, meticulously reported book, liberal activists have harnessed that anger to build the biggest, richest, and best organized political movement in American history.\\" Very obviously this claim can't possibly be true, because \\"liberal activists\\" have been steadily losing since 1980, with the Clinton administration looking more and more like a defensive blip against the forward march of partisan Republicanism. Could the 2004 liberal movement aiming to defeat President Bush be the \\"biggest, richest, and best organized political movement in American history\\"? Not if conservative activists have a bigger, richer, and better organized political movement that consistently wins on all levels of American politics, I would propose. The Bush administration is pushing transformative reforms at home and abroad and conservatives are the ones winning. There are so many examples of this bigger, richer, better organized Republican partisan movement that citing the Republican tendency to win elections and the Democratic tendency to lose elections isn't even really necessary [though it is sufficient]. Fox News has better ratings [and a stronger ideological compass] than any other 24-hour news network. Cato, Heritage, and AEI are bigger, more effective, and have longer histories than the relatively new Center for American Progress and the DLC's Progressive Policy Institute. And so on and so forth. The point is that the idea that today's liberal movement is the greatest political movement in American history is just ridiculous.So why write this book? The Republicans who dominate Washington DC got there by running against government and the very concept of public service. Now, even though they control everything, they need to pretend that they don't to keep getting elected."},{"Title":"The Vast Left Wing Conspiracy: How Democratic Operatives Tried to Bring Down a President","review":"When any organization fails or falls on hard times there are those who possess the intellectual agility and moral courage to examine the organization for structural flaws. There are also those who lack that mental agility and strength of character, and whose sole response is to repeat organizational dogma with an unthinking desperation.Byron York's book should be required reading for those who identify as members of the American political Left who fall into the former category. The contribution of those in the latter category can be summarized nicely by a perusal of the one star reviews associated with this title here at Amazon -- generally lacking in thought, generally clinging to the holy writ, and generally betraying the fact that they have not, in fact, read this book at all, but are jerking those knees as fast as they can at the notion that anyone dare accuse the Left of a conspiracy (the title, as anyone who has read the book will be aware, is used in a modestly tongue in cheek fashion and was borrowed by the author from left-wing political activists who were, likewise, playing on words).The reason I advocate this book for those on the left is that I do think it serves to foster discussion about what is presently wrong with the American Left. Now if your response on reading that last sentence is to mumble some hasty affirmation to yourself about Republican noise machines, \\"we're the real majority,\\" rigged/stolen elections, Bible thumping fascists or whatever other mantra MoveOn is pushing this week, this book is simply not for you, as you obviously lack those qualities of mind and character I noted above as being prerequisites for appreciating this book.But, if your response as a political liberal to the 2000, and even more so the 2004, election is to wonder if something may have gone wrong within your own political tent besides whatever perfidious efforts the Republicans may have managed, then I would think you will benefit from reading this book.I would be rather surprised if it makes anyone question their core political beliefs -- it is not that sort of book at all. It is not a screed attacking the political agenda of the Left, though it does attack aspects of the dogma surrounding that agenda (i.e. the \\"we're the real majority\\" echo chamber trope that either political party accepts unreflexively as true only at its own peril).It is, at its heart, an analysis of political tactics and strategy, and how errors at both levels hamstrung attempts by the Democratic party and its various PACs, wealthy supporters, and the like to make maximum and most efficient use of their unprecedented war chest. Again, those whose reponse to such concepts is to snidely kill the messenger will learn nothing from this book. Those who possess the maturity and sophistication to rise above the rather low benchmark may find it to be a very illuminating read, and suggestive of a great many reconfigurations and reconceptualizations that would benefit the American Left in its quest to regain at least some semblance of electoral power.Sadly, I suspect that learning from York's book will ultimately prove too challenging and threatening to a great many sacred cows for people on the Left at the Big Picture level. Instead of critically examining and reorganizing internally, this will mean the Democratic party will just continue to flail looking for some oppositional position to seize on against the Bush administration as its salvation, instead of internal reform, which calls to mind Machiavelli's warning that \\"men of little prudence will do a thing for some immediate gain, never recognizing the poison it bears for their future.\\"Ultimately, \\"The Vast Left Wing Conspiracy\\" is not a brilliant book, but a very good one, and one of far more value to the American Left than the Right."},{"Title":"The Vast Left Wing Conspiracy: How Democratic Operatives Tried to Bring Down a President","review":"Ok, so the title is more than a mouthful! I really enjoyed reading this book. It's written as fairly straight forward journalism, and in the sometimes hysterical world of conservative books, it's refreshing. Reading this book is a bit like watching the nightly news. You know that there is a slight liberal slant to the news, but if you're listening for it, you can hear it and take it with a grain of salt. The same goes with this book. Yes, this is a slight right slant, but if you're keeping an eye out for it, you don't have to be swayed by it. This book has some excellent points about how politics have changed since the institution of 527 groups, and I will be watching the November elections and the upcoming 2008 presidential race with these thoughts in mind. York makes an excellent point in his book. Liberals think that conservatives control everything and can make several points to prove it. Conservatives think exactly the same way. The truth lies in that the country is more evenly split with a few hardcore believers on either side. Very well written, very interesting reading."},{"Title":"The Vast Left Wing Conspiracy: How Democratic Operatives Tried to Bring Down a President","review":"at how non-partisan this book was. Don't get me wrong, this guy is not a Democratic cheerleader but it's not the polemic I was expecting from the title. The author is wise enough to realize that the left thinks the media has a conservative bias and the right thinks the media has a liberal bias - everybody wants to be a victim I guess. He occasionally admits problems within the GOP and except for the Patriot Act off-Broadway play, he is not overly vitriolic.The book concentrates on the goings on of the left just before the 2004 presidential election. So writing a review just after the 2008 presidential election definitely gives a different perspective on the book. Ironically, McCain's campaign finance reform put the Democrats in worse shape than the Republicans and this book chronicles how liberals decided to advance their ideology through new means. He informs the reader of the creation of various entities that could receive funding as long as they were non-partisan (yeah, really). He discusses Michael Moore's 9/11 movie, George Soros' patronage of moveon.org, Air America Radio, and Fox News criticisms. There is one chapter on a left wing fringe play that accuses Bush of desiring to establish a theocracy. I thought this chapter would have been better left out as it detracted from the book because the Patriot Act was not so much a media movement as a strange conspiracy.His thesis in all this is that liberals were preaching to the choir in all this and hence made little difference in the 2004 election. For example Farhenheit 9/11 was mainly viewed by people already sympathetic to its ideas and hence few minds were changed because of it.Somewhat prophetically (this book was written in 2005), the author warns that the failures of Democrats in 2004 may be successes in 2008 if their marketing continued (which I guess it did). He points out that the Kerry campaign was dominated by whites and did not tap into the large Democratic sympathetic black populace.Another edition of this book would be interesting to see how the liberal media push affected the results of 2008. Possibly all the 'closed loop' campaigning of 2004 seeped out into a larger audience."},{"Title":"The Vast Left Wing Conspiracy: How Democratic Operatives Tried to Bring Down a President","review":"...if they're not \\"brought down,\\" you call it a monarchy or a dictatorship, not a democracy.

Yes, billionaire George Soros is on our side -- of course, the GOP has most of the rest of them!OF COURSE we will try to build on our very successful efforts the next time around -- 49% was close, but 2nd place is not good enough.

This quick and disturbing read is well written and informative. He is able to get up close and personal by attending the Democrat/left wing rallies and functions. At times, fought to gain an interview with people such as Podesta and Franken. Byron also clears up some of the conspiracy theories made up by Moore and others. Gossip: \\"Do not spread slanderous gossip\\"--Leviticus 19:16This is the new movement funded by George Sorros and \\"move on\\". A new Democrat party is fashioned. Why question Sorros when he has the money. Keep in mind what the beliefs of the big Democrat money supporter are.Byron also covers the 527 loopholes and abuses, (the do anything to win campaign.) He concentrates on a small group of individuals. Hillary, Dean, Kerry and Moore are also hit upon. He expounds on the Competition between conservative talk shows, and why liberal shows don't work. I don't put NPR in this same category, hence recommend tuning in on occasion, especially PBS. Even though they are biased, PBS does not tend be slanderous. I don't agree with the federal funding of stations, but that is for another time.Instead of putting their full effort into the election of John Kerry, they focussed more on taking down Bush. The party for the poor? Where is the funding coming from? Support campaign finance?Byron may spend a little too much time filling pages with movie statistics, but here is an interesting factoid: \\"Fahrenheit 9/11 and the passion of Christ were remarkable indicators of how Americans would vote.\\"Liberalism--Apostasy: \\"Do not be carried away by error\\"--2 Peter 3:17"},{"Title":"The Vast Left Wing Conspiracy: How Democratic Operatives Tried to Bring Down a President","review":"It was Hillary who started this (now deservedly mocked) idiocy about \\"vast\\" conspiracies.

This book is no exception. While I still doubt that the left-wing conspiracy is as coordinated as York implies, he highlights a mindset and concerted action that should trouble everyone who considers themselves pro-democracy. Much of this will not be new to anyone who already suspects America is not fed the whole story--i.e., that the left-wing network is very real and very alive and very much despises mainstream America and the things it values.

It's sad though because the liberal bashes on these books aren't even clever anymore. What I have noticed though is the \\" We Hate Liberals\\" books have gone from passing us off as \\"crazy tree-huggers that can safely be ignored as the minority\\" to \\"the liberals that are close to taking back the White House with their vast left-wing conspiracy.\\" If there is one thing to learn from the plethora of liberal bashing books published in the past few years it's that the authors are starting to get scared now because they realize their party is falling apart from the corruption, religous value competition, and the continuing failure of the economy.

The result was the unedifying spectacle of turkeys voting for Christmas. Most of the gonzo pundits currently working this street get their self-righteous appeal by promoting this travesty. However, this was a lie - and it really isn't good enough for Byron and the rest to take this at face value. Similarly, the pompous reviewers on this site offering advice to the Democratic party wouldn't know a left-wing standpoint if it bit them on the you-know-what. For that matter, I doubt that they would know a right-wing view either. William F. Buckley Jr. provides a fairly succinct definition of the main tenets of a right-wing world view, which he describes as \\"the basic postulates of successful free systems\\". In essence \\"...you reward industry with low taxes and minimum regulations, and you encourage education, strike out against sclerosis in labor markets, and welcome free trade.\\" That's the theory. The reality? Let's have a look...Now, I'm not American, but if George Soros is using some of his billions to bring about a left-wing coup in the US, I feel that I have a legitimate right to comment on this. Some of this money was mine! George Soros made billions in sterling in a period of about eight hours on September 16th 1992 - or \\"Black Wednesday\\" as it came to be called - when the UK was ejected from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM). There was no special genius involved in this - he simply knew what every market trader on the planet and my four year old daughter knew - namely, that the ludicrous position taken by the British Treasury was doomed and that they would be forced to devalue sooner or later (but probably sooner). Guided by the sacred tenets of their \\"supply side\\" economic gurus, our idiotic right wing \\"leaders\\" flushed away billions in an attempt to hold back the financial tsunami unleashed by Soros and several thousand smaller traders in financial centres around the globe. The memory of that day still generates a warm glow, much laughter, and even more head shaking among the, now ageing, yuppies who simply couldn't believe the idiocy of these right-wing clowns. Unfortunately, it is regarded less warmly by the majority of the British electorate, and the events of that day explain why the British Conservative Party have now been unelectable for a generation. If you doubt this, read the words of the latest in a long line of Conservative leaders. Speaking in December 2005, a few days after gaining leadership of the Tory party, David Cameron under the heading \\"Cameron Relives Black Wednesday\\" is in no doubt about the reason why the party once regarded as the \\"natural\\" party of government is now unelectable (http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4528766.stm) Neither was this a peculiarly British phenomenon. In America, this right wing lunacy manifested itself in, amongst other things, the Savings and Loan scandals - a DIRECT outcome of Regan's deregulation of financial markets. On the right, any regulation is regarded as \\"nanny state\\" interference by the state in the free working of the market. In fact, the technically correct term in the American context should be \\"daddy state\\". If Byron York is interested in \\"untold stories\\" - here's a good one... I have a memory of someone named Neil Bush who became a director of the Silverado Savings and Loan Association three years before the outfit went bust at a cost to taxpayers of at least $1.6 billion. I may be wrong but, didn't he lend over $100 million to his business partner - in the process signing a statement that there were no conflicts of interest involved in approving this loan? In fact, the title of this review (\\"Now this may sound fishy...\\") uses the words by which Neil Bush prefaced his \\"explanation\\" of one very unusual feature of this $100 million loan. It only had to be repaid if the business venture it financed was successful - which it wasn't!! To demonstrate that justice is blind, Neil Bush was required to \\"...desist from any acts, omissions or practices involving any conflicts of interest, unsafe or unsound practices or breaches of fiduciary duty.\\" In other words, he was obliged to obey the law like the rest of us. If you think I'm making this rubbish up - just Google it for yourself! This is certainly socialism in America. Unfortunately, it is a socialism of the rich - the rest get free market discipline.These are the REAL policies of the right wing. In Britain, Margaret Thatcher's deregulated, supply-side world vision led to a spivs paradise where, in the newly deregulated market for financial products, people were induced to swap rock solid state or company pensions for speculative ventures based on the promise that share prices only ever rose. Large sections of the British electorate were technically bankrupt when the sharp deflation made necessary by the insanity of the Thatcher years led to massive falls in house prices. For years, people had been encouraged to borrow against rising house prices for current consumption. The result was widespread \\"negative equity\\" - people couldn't even sell their houses because the value of the loan against the house was greater than the value of the house itself. They did drive to the bankruptcy courts in some very classy vehicles though.Free Markets? Never underestimate the self-pity of the rich. They bleat on about free markets then hold out their begging bowls. There is no free market. In his book \\"Perverse Subsidies\\" published in 2001, Professor Norman Myers estimates that when you add the direct payments US corporations receive to the wider costs they oblige society to carry, you come up with a figure of $2.6 trillion, or roughly five times as much as the profits they make. The energy policy bill the Bush administration drove through Congress this summer handed a further $2.9bn to the coal industry, $4.3bn to nuclear power and $1.5bn to oil and gas firms. According to the Democratic congressman Henry Waxman, the oil subsidy \\"was mysteriously inserted in the final energy legislation after the legislation was closed to further amendment ...\\". Most of this money will be administered by a private consortium located in the district of majority leader Tom DeLay. The leading contender for the contract appears to be the \\"Research Partnership to Secure Energy for America Consortium\\", whose board members include Marathon Oil and Halliburton. In fact, there is no conceivable economic logic to these subsidies. ALL of these sectors are realising the highest profits in their history! William Buckley spoke about \\"sclerosis in labor markets\\". In fact, I'd almost be willing to concede on this point - in the UK, unionism had lost contact with reality. But how the hell do you convince unions to be more responsible in the face of this kind of robber baron economics?Speaking of Tom DeLay, don't Byron York's claims all sound a little bit bit petty in the light of the DeLay case? He'll be telling us that Woody Allen mugged Mike Tyson next. The DeLay case is presented in America as just of a bit of over-zealous fund-raising by a basically honourable politician. In fact, for sheer, unabashed political animus, it is unlike anything else ever witnessed in an advanced democracy. Politicians fight their political foes by fair means or foul, but trying to exterminate them is new territory altogether. American politicians need ever more money to fight campaigns and to gerrymander their constituencies. DeLay's K Street Project is about ensuring that the only palms to be greased in the line from lobbyist to legislator are Republican ones. Last year, in a classic operation, House Republicans let the Motion Picture Association of America (the film industry lobby group) know that appointing a Democrat, Dan Glickman, as its head would mean $1.5 billion of tax relief for the film industry was now in peril. Glickman staffed up the MPAA with Republicans, but the threat remains. For God's sake - they are using your tax dollars to turn America into a one-party state!Huey Long, the Governor of Louisiana until his assasination in 1935 once made a prophesy. Though this was 70 years ago, it should haunt America to this day. He said \\"Of course we will have fascism in America, but we will call it democracy\\".

Liberal reviewers denounce the book, and some conservative reviewers are gloating about it. Did we read the same book?Byron York's \\"The Vast Left Wing Conspiracy\\" is a detailed political analysis of the Left's unprecedented organization in the 2004 election. The most committed elements of the American Left came together like never before to defeat George W. Bush. Independent activists like George Soros, Michael Moore, MoveOn.org, America Coming Together, Air America, and the Center for American Progress emerged and circumvented the traditional party structure in order to ensure Bush's defeat.In spite of the money and effort poured into the cause, Bush, of course, won the race by 3 percent. York's diagnosis is that the new players -- MoveOn, ACT, etc. -- essentially were preaching to the choir, while the whole time thinking they were forging a broad, national, anti-Bush consensus.Drawing from interviews with key operatives, York documents the inside story of the 527s and other new groups that emerged in 2004. He demonstrates how MoveOn.org grew from an idea into a powerhouse of the Left; how America Coming Together grew out of MoveOn; how George Soros became interested, got involved, and legitimated MoveOn and ACT; and how these fringe groups found themselves at the center of the Democrats' run for the presidency. He also documents how these groups stretched the campaign finance law that they had so vigorously supported.But the scary part is this: York, a columnist for National Review, notes that in the wake of conservative icon Barry Goldwater's landslide defeat to Lyndon Johnson, conservatives took decades to build the institutions of the conservative movement that we know and love today (a network of think tanks, grassroots issue-based groups, talk radio shows, etc.). Now, the 2004 election could be for liberals what that 1964 election was for conservatives: a turning point. But conservatives took decades to overcome the Democratic majority (at least in Congress). Conservatives today don't have that big a majority and the Dems are nevertheless organizing to re-establish a sizeable political majority of their own. Just today (8/7/05), there was a Washington Post story about rich liberals pouring money into creating new \\"progressive\\" think tanks.\\"The Vast Left Wing Conspiracy\\" is a warning for conservatives, one which they would be wise to take seriously."},{"Title":"The Vast Left Wing Conspiracy: How Democratic Operatives Tried to Bring Down a President","review":"This book is a fascinating look behind the scenes look at the Democratic Party's efforts to unseat President Bush in the 2004 election. But, the slightly hysterical title aside, the book is as objective as one could hope. It discusses how the Democratics, frustrated with being out of power in Congress, the White House, their anger at the Clinton impeachment and the 2000 election results attempted to regroup. Using a copy of Karl Rove's \\"get out the vote\\" plan they attempted to regroup and energize the American voter to their way of thinking. What they came up with was the Moveon.Org internet site, 527's (several of which, the author argues, ignored campaign finance laws), the movie Fahrenheit 9/11, Liberal talk radio and think tanks. What I found especially interesting was the author's contention that when all was said and done the people behind it all were talking to the choir and made little impact on anyone outside their \\"loop\\". For example, the hype (and the box office) indicated that Fahrenheit 9/11 was a phenomenal success and it was expected to go a long way to defeat President Bush. But by breaking down the by region box office York is able to show that the film was really only popular in the areas (and with audiences) that weren't going to go for the President anyway. It made no impact in the swing states. During the election Moveon.org was so popular that they people behind it thought they were touching the average American. It turns out they weren't and were, in fact, only talking with other similar minded people. (Interesting, this same \\"talking for the average American\\" is something Richard Poe talks about in his book \\"Hillary's Secret War: The Clinton Conspiracy to Muzzle Internet Journalists\\". I wondered as I read this if both sides are wrong and they are both talking to their respective choirs. But I digress). The think tanks started were very limited in scope (seemingly dedicated to only defeating the President instead of developing new strategies that aren't necessarily tied to any particular political party -as the more successful Conservative think tanks have done and what the Democratics were trying to duplicate). While they raised unprecedented sums of money in a losing effort, they've changed the way they're looking at political campaigns and will attempt to strengthen and sharpen these new tools for future elections. Republicans should be prepared."},{"Title":"The Vast Left Wing Conspiracy: How Democratic Operatives Tried to Bring Down a President","review":"I'm someone who is fascinated by the human capacity for nonrational thinking, mob behavior, self-delusion, and the success of well-engineered social movements.

The title of the book is more provocative than the material inside, which is well-researched and not particularly inflammatory (except to the most thin-skinned among us). The book chronicles how the American Left is re-making itself to become competitive in today's highly communicated and regulated political world. It could be viewed as diagnostic and prescriptive for both Left and Right, in the great competition for hearts and minds that defines modern American politics. My favorite chapter was the one the author almost left out: \\"From Fringe to Mainstream.\\" This chapter captures how unimportant and irrelevant actual evidence is in demonizing one's political enemies, showing how accusations are virtually as good as evidence when denigrating the other side. \\"If it might possibly be true, then it most probably is true,\\" seems to be the creedo of the modern viralized ideologue. Also fascinating is how humans feel they can plumb their opponent's inner psychology--in the absence of any formal training--discovering that the opposition is perpetually driven by sickness and evil impulse, while the motives of \\"my side\\" are pure and honest and moral. This book is certain to increase the cynicism of all readers, whether from Left or Right. And that's not a bad thing. Our republic depends upon our citizens' ability to recognize and resist emotional manipulation, which this book chronicles in fascinating and informed detail."},{"Title":"The Vast Left Wing Conspiracy: How Democratic Operatives Tried to Bring Down a President","review":"It's written from a critical, conservative perspective, but despite its sensationalist title, it's clever, well researched, and doesn't drastically trash anyone. Get a grip, guys. Read the thing before you start shrieking. Otherwise you look....well....dumb. There are LOTs of books and authors out there worth attacking. (Books by, say, Ann Coulter, John E. O'Neill, Brent Bozell and Mark Levin, to name a few.)This isn't one of them."},{"Title":"The Vast Left Wing Conspiracy: How Democratic Operatives Tried to Bring Down a President","review":"Note to reviewers - the title of the book was a play on Hillary claiming that there was a \\"vast right wing conspiracy\\" against her husband in the Monica scandal - she and others stridently argued that the attacks on her husband were due to a right wing conspiracy (right up until the stains on the little black dress ruined everything).This is an excellent non-polemical book that sets out the steps taken by the left to unseat Bush. I watched from Canada and monthly visits to the US (business) and the book accurately reflects what was going on (rightly or wrongly) at the time.It describes how a loose linkage of the media, Hollywood, pop stars, MoveOn.org (Soros), academia, Kerry spinmeisters and the intelligentsia on the left and right coasts self organized to bring down Bush and the GOP.It is a good read and ties together many of the disparate threads into a reasonably accurate picture. Perhaps the book can be faulted - hence only 4 stars - because there certainly was strident activity on the right too. Limbaugh, Hannity and O'Reilly, of course, doing their thing although not with the power of the mainstream media and Hollywood behind them.For me the interesting theme he points out is the self organizing nature of the endeavour driven by an almost irrational loathing of Bush. Recall many Hollywood gliterrati threatening to move to Canada if Bush was elected.I'm editorializing here - but it does seem strange that some reviewers - notably one from the UK - use this site as a platform for gross anti-US, anti-Bush remarks rather than taking the time to actually critique the book in question."},{"Title":"The Vast Left Wing Conspiracy: How Democratic Operatives Tried to Bring Down a President","review":"Byron York in his book The Vast Left Wing Conspiracy gives an account of the measures the Far Left took to defeat George W. Bush in the 2004 election. York spends a chapter discussing each of the major outlets of what he describes as \\"The Vast Left-Wing Conspiracy\\", a play on Hillary Rodham Clinton's famous \\"Right-Wing Conspiracy\\" statement. There are chapters on George Soros, MoveOn.org, America Coming Together, Air America Radio, and, of course, Fahrenheit 9/11. The book is a good read for both conservatives and liberals, who will find it interesting how the Right views the above-mentioned institutions.One would expect York to dedicate much of the book to argue with the ideas presented by these groups, and he does spend one chapter doing this, where he debunks the myth that the Republicans want to turn the US into a theocracy. Most of the book, however, deals with how these organizations got started and the mistakes they made in how they marketed themselves to the people.The purpose of the book is not merely a way for conservatives to gloat over their win in 2004. Rather, York wants to make the reader aware of how much the Left accomplished in just 18 months and that given four years to prepare for the next election, they will be far more organized will be in a better position to affect the results. The book loses its fifth star for me since it spends too much time with some of the minor elements of the \\"Conspiracy\\", such as the documentaries \\"Outfoxed\\" and \\"Uncovered\\" and not enough time on the things the reader might be more interested in, such as Fahrenheit 9/11. His concluding chapter, which contains one of the key points of the book, is way too short."},{"Title":"The Vast Left Wing Conspiracy: How Democratic Operatives Tried to Bring Down a President","review":"Byron York is a masterful writer. The subject matter that he has written about is one that I find rather banal. When I started the book I thought I won't finish this, why bother, this won't keep my attention. But guess what, the material didn't the writer did.I am not saying the material was wrong or incorrect, heavens no. I was just more enamored at how the pages flew by with this young man's prose. Given a topic that I enjoyed and I would become a raving fanatical fan of this writer.Anyhow, the book is scary showing how the left wing has gone from the organized academia and intelligentsia to today being THE billionaire and millionaire boys funding club.The left's organized use of 527's and the fact that 92% of all donations of $ 1 million dollars or larger go to democratic causes should shout loud and clear just who is the party of the elites and money. I'll give you a hint - it ain't the republicans.You also get a look at how the media portrays their darlings like Michael Moore and Robert Greenwald- movies that were basically unwatched yet received glowing reviews, and more press pre gross dollar sales than any movie in history.One of the greatest chapters is Mr. Yorks analysis of John Podesta. Mr. York has summed up the current Democratic Party's main problem in one sentence many other people have said the same thing myself included but nobody is listening. I find it mystifying that the Republicans are actually telling the Democrats what their problem is over and over and over again and yet they never hear it. Well I will quote Mr. York one more time\\"The bottom line was that Podesta was arguing that his party's problems were mostly related to communications, not content.\\"\\"Podesta keeps saying, What's our bumper sticker?\\" (referring to a quick idea that simple to communicate)\\"The problem is not the bumper sticker. The problem is the car.\\"Amen Mr. York, you preach it.The saddest chapter of the book is Chapter Eight where Mr. York talks about the strange life of the Theocratic Conspiracy theorist. If you have never met one of these people you are lucky. Envision the most radical preacher you can multiply them by ten but they are now a anti-preacher, filled with hatred against any Christian. These people exist and they are growing quickly, they seem to have some sort of metaphysical hatred against anybody whom might call themselves a Christian and right wing. All you need to do is search Amazon for book about right wing and religion and you will be shocked. These people would burn the late Mother Theresa at the stake if the could.A highly enjoyable author with magnificent penmanship skills; I highly recommend this book and will look forward for more of Mr. Yorks work."},{"Title":"The Vast Left Wing Conspiracy: How Democratic Operatives Tried to Bring Down a President","review":"This book does an excellent job at looking how the Democratic Party attempted to win the 2004 election.The only thing I fault this book for is the title.The Democrats in no way carried out a conspiracy.They took on the task of winning and tried everything they could.In both the book and some reviews a few felt that the Democrats had no right to even try,but that is nothing but sour grapes and in no way suggested by the author or anyone responsible in either party.A good,no-holds-barred fight ,using any legal tactic or approach,is what should be attempted and the voters should expect nothing less.I don't think the author suggested anything else really took place by either side.What the author does show is what the Democrats tried and in spite of a Hurculean effort and on top of feeling they had done enough and had even convinced themselves they were going to win and easily; they lost the Congress,the Senate and the White House.This time there was no debate other than in spite of all their effort,the big question is why did they fail so badly.This book covers every aspect of the campaigns but mainly deals with the fight for the White House and I think the author shows that Kerry vs Bush ended up being what the whole election was about.The Dems didn't lose due to a lack of Money,they had plenty.The Author didn't talk about the Debates.Just about everybody feels Kerry did better,is probably a better debater,but winning an Election is about a lot more than winning a Debate.The author did a terrific job on Michael Moore's movie Fahrenheit 9/11.He convinced me that this movie was not the great asset that the Left Wingers had convinced themselves it was.He shows it mainly had an impact on the already converted and little impact on the swing vote,and even that may have been a negative factor to the Democrats.He gives excellent numbers on performance on from all over North America.It was interesting to see that several of the best numbers came from Canadian cities and most of the other best results came from the more heavily left wing populated areas.In other words the already converted.I don't doubt that Kerry would have easily beaten Bush if the countries in Europe and Canada could have voted.That anti America and anti Bush dribble the Democrats take such great comfort in, has no impact on election day,except a negative impact to voters of the center.The author talks a lot about the Attack on 9/11.He shows how the Democrats and Soros in particular,didn't see it as all that devastating and that Bush's reaction was an irresponsible reaction.The voters felt otherwise and showed it on Election Day.The nastiness of portraying Bush as stupid,comparable to Nazis and Hitler probably cost them a lot of votes from the center and clearly seen as 'beyond of the pale'.The party's excuse that it \\"slipped through our screening process\\" didn't hold any water.Calling Conservative press \\"digital brownshirts\\" was another Leftist masterpiece.The author covers it all in this book and in the end only confirms what more than a majority of the voters had decided after the long detailed and partisian campaign by both parties.They believed that Bush and his party ,rather than Kerry and his party were the ones they preferred to handle the Nations security and more closely reflected their views.There are probably a lot of Democrats who disagree with the author,but facts speak for themselves."},{"Title":"The Vast Left Wing Conspiracy: How Democratic Operatives Tried to Bring Down a President","review":"Devoted entirely to coming to Amazon to trash conservative books? I see the same names here I saw for Kate O'Bierne's book, Tony Blankley's book, Michelle Malkin's books, David Limbaugh's books...you get the idea. And most of your reviews say almost the exact same thing, too. You'd think SOME of you would aim for creativity, especially when you're accusing Republicans of being mindless automatons.That said, York's research is impeccable, and anyone who paid attention to the last Presidential election knows EXACTLY how hard George Soros, Hollywood, et al. worked to push Kerry through, from Cameron Diaz's teary \\"If you want rape to be legal, don't vote\\" lunacy on Oprah to the dollars moveon.org spent demonizing the Swiftboat vets. No one works harder than the Left to silence dissenting opinion and hide the truth. It's because of books like this one, conservative talk radio, and Fox News that conservatives finally have a voice in this country, and the left hasn't had to debate for so long, they've forgotten how.To anyone looking for truthful, incisive commentary on how far the Left has gone to demonize and destroy Bush, how much time, money, and effort they've wasted to obstruct him at every turn, regardless of whether the policy in question would benefit the country, this is an excellent book. If you're a mind-numbed leftist automaton that opposes everything purely on unquestioning ideological grounds--well, I guess I'll be seeing your reviews on the next conservative bestseller, won't I?"},{"Title":"The Vast Left Wing Conspiracy: How Democratic Operatives Tried to Bring Down a President","review":"Byron York is one of my favorite writers because he reports. No diatribes. No insults. No hysterics. He just reports facts and when he gives his opinions, they are never overstated. There is no name-calling (The title is a quote from the liberal activists who are the subject of the book.) and no conclusions without supporting facts. In fact, York respects his readers enough to let them draw their own conclusions most of the time.If you think that the campaign reform laws took money out of politics, you really need to read this book. Unfortunately, most of what they did was take political parties out of politics and make them more politically beholden to groups who now control most of the money spent in campaigns and can therefore dictate the policies of the parties, who have heretofore made their own policies and run on them. Having positions and platforms imposed by big money donors was supposed to be why campaign finance reform was needed, but expecting politicians to support such laws without a loophole in reserve shows incredible naivete. The loophole the Democrats were counting on may end up turning into a sinkhole that consumes them or imprisons them for years to come.I have found plenty of authors and radio and TV hosts all across the political spectrum who will shout accusations, hurl epithets and insults and state opinions as facts, but it is a rare one who can simply report details in as clear and cogent a manner as Mr. York. I wish all political books were as well written and reasonable as this one."},{"Title":"The Vast Left Wing Conspiracy: How Democratic Operatives Tried to Bring Down a President","review":"In this book, Byron York only promises to present the evidence of a vast Left-Wing conspiracy - and that is all he presents. The discussion here is limited to what left-leaning money has done. Primarily, this amounts to a muckraking castigation of George Soros for pointing out the fascistic tendencies inherent in Bush Administration policies and a denigration of Soros' concerns that the US is now, currently, moving in the same direction as NAZI Germany in the period between the World Wars.There is no discussion here of any sort of moneyed conspiracy on the other side of the aisle: no reference to the vast amounts of AmWay (DeVoss family) money available to smear Democrats and moderate Republicans; no reference to the vast amounts of WalMart (Walton family) or Timkin (Timkin family) money available to do away with a justified and justifiable estate transference tax; and absolutely no reference to the extremely close, and extremely profitable, relationships between George Bush and Ken Lay (Enron) or between George Bush and Jack Abramoff (Republican corruption and treason)."},{"Title":"The Vast Left Wing Conspiracy: How Democratic Operatives Tried to Bring Down a President","review":"It's basically just a bunch of vitriolic hate speech.

Some of Grace's books are better than others, but they all share certain things in common. Her storylines are often rather contrived, but still interesting and entertaining; her books are Christian and usually have a lot of talk about Christ and Christianity; and there's always a romance in there somewhere. Since her ideas are old-fashioned and quaint, she's an acquired taste for most people, in any of her books. This one concerns a bride who, as she's about to leave for the church, discovers that her bridegroom is in love with another woman. She manages to put the wedding dress on the other girl (they just happen to be the same size) and marries her off to the groom. There are a lot of difficulties to overcome, due to the substitution of the bride, but it all works out eventually. For myself, I enjoyed the story, but found myself wondering why she didn't just call off the wedding. But, there wouldn't have been a story, then, I suppose.

No dragons, just real people with situations that could happen in the future so as not to be so unthinkable. the book is about 2 people who meet on a space flight whose destination is a &quot;retirement resort&quot; but come to find out that this is a forced vision which comes to be incorrect.

As he states, he uses five mathematical theorems that were proven in the 20th Century and shows how they relate to general theory and application. He gives a reasonable set of criteria to show the reader how these five theorems emerge out of the millions of theorems that mathematicians have proven in the mathematical literature of the 20th Century.He also explains why all the theorems were developed in the first half of the century. Basically, it takes time for the impact and value of a theorem to take effect. While there may be many theorems developed in the later half of the century that will eventually prove to be more valuable than some of the five golden rules, we may not know this clearly for some time.There seems to be a preference for theorems related to operations research. For example the Brouwer fixed point theorem from topology has applications to game theory. Von Neumann's minimax theorem was developed for game theory and its application to military strategy and economic problems. This one also falls into the realm of operations research. Finally Dantzig's simplex method provides an algorithm to solve linear programming problems and some extensions. This is also clearly in the realm of optimization problems in operations research.Turing's halting theorem is also presented. This deals with important questions about the limitation of computing machines as it relates to mimicking human intelligence.Many of the ideas are difficult to present in lay terms and there is a lot of development to try to make the theory understandable to the reader. But it is difficult to do these subjects justice. Casti's emphasis is clearly in applied mathematics and he excels at showing the impact of the results on our society."},{"Title":"Five Golden Rules : Great Theories of 20th-Century Mathematics -and Why They Matter","review":"There are many important theorems in mathematics, and a great number of them were discovered in the twentieth century. To whittle these down to the five most important ones is no easy feat, but this is exactly what Casti has done. He admits that there is no group of five which are clearly more important than the others (after all, he has written a sequel, Five More Golden Rules!), and that this selection is no doubt very subjective, with any other prominent mathematician likely coming up with a very different selection.Casti is primarily an applied mathematician, and his choice in theorems reflects this. Because of his expertise, he has been able to see the bounty that each theorem has created, as far as new ideas is concerned. While some of these theorems may seem rather abstract and not terribly useful, it is all of the follow-up work that these theorems created and inspired that makes them so special.I found this book difficult in places to follow, and I'm no beginner in mathematics. This is probably no fault on the part of Casti, who has done a great job of making these theorems as accessible as possible to the layman. I believe that it is the difficult nature of some of the theorems that makes it difficult to understand. For instance, 40 pages is very little in which to distill the basics of topology, and explain the relevance of Brouwer's Theorem. And given that a large portion of the information in \`Godel, Escher, Bach' has been compressed into the 40 pages covering Turing's Halting Problem, it is no surprise that the going is not easy. However, for a good insight into some important areas of twentieth century mathematics, this book is hard to beat."},{"Title":"Five Golden Rules : Great Theories of 20th-Century Mathematics -and Why They Matter","review":"Casti's text focuses on five key mathematical theories from the 20th century; this is actually somewhat misleading, since 4 of them are actually proved theorems. It's an interesting survey of applied mathematics; a number of sub-disciplines are covered here.He does an excellent job of bringing the math down to a reasonable level without dumbing it down. Most of the book can be understood with simple logic and algebra; truly understanding a few of the theorems (not just appreciating them) does take a little calculus. Knowing some more advanced math (like topology) helps, but a reasonably mathematically-inclined person with less formal education will be able to follow it just fine. I'd like to see more popular math books at this level; this is somewhere between the level of Paulos' series of books (\\"Innumeracy\\" et al) and an undergrad maths textbook.It's interesting to see a side of mathematics not often covered in high school maths courses. I really recommend this book to anyone with more than a passing interest in mathematics; it may even rejuvenate your interest to a more active level."},{"Title":"Five Golden Rules : Great Theories of 20th-Century Mathematics -and Why They Matter","review":"Mathematics is a discipline that has an essential niche in modern society. From the early days of civilization where the plotting of fields for taxation required geometry to the modern international interconnection of computers, mathematics has been essential. People also constantly bet their lives on the accuracy of mathematical models. When we climb into an airplane, we are entrusting our lives to the accuracy of the mathematical models used to design that plane. And yet hardly a day goes by in the life of this reviewer without someone commenting in some way on the limited worth of mathematics. A combination of fear, insecurity and uncertainly lead to common misconceptions concerning the value of mathematics. All mathematicians have a professional duty to counter these problems any way they can. In doing this, we are not just engaging in activities to boost our job security, but in every real sense helping to insure the survival of civilization as we know it.In this book, Casti chooses five of the most significant modern developments in mathematics and gives detailed explanations as to why they make a difference in our lives. The topics are:1. The Maximum Theorem of Game Theory.2. The Brouwer Fixed-Point Theorem of Topology.3. Morse's Theorem of Singularity Theory.4. The Halting Problem of Computer Science.5. The Simplex Method of Optimization Theory.Targeted at the general reader, formulas and theorems are kept to a minimum. Applications, some literally life and death, are used to emphasize the value of these concepts. As someone who experienced the apparent irrationality of the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, it is comforting to see it reduced to a simple \\"game\\" matrix.With this volume, Casti has done more than his share of the professional duty of mathematicians. It is one more brick to be used in the construction of a mathematics that is cherished by all people.Published in Journal of Recreational Mathematics, reprinted with permission."},{"Title":"Five Golden Rules : Great Theories of 20th-Century Mathematics -and Why They Matter","review":"I am in violent disagreement with the previous reviewer from Australia. I also love math, and I found Casti's presentation and style engaging. Few books on fundamental mathematics are as accessible to the thoughtful reader, and Casti's book strikes just the right balance between precision and comprehension.For that reason, I put this book in the same category as Feynman's classic monograph QED, which explains the essence of quantum electrodynamics without ever descending into the esoterica of the formal mathematical underpinnings. Casti does the same for (arguably) the five most significant mathematical results of this century."},{"Title":"Five Golden Rules : Great Theories of 20th-Century Mathematics -and Why They Matter","review":"It is probably impossible to make the topics accessible to readers without mathematical training. This is a brave attempt, however the exposition contains many mathematical mistakes in the form of claims that are false. A example of this is the pervasive confusion between closed and compact, a mistake which makes the relevant theorems wrong as stated. A less damaging problem is the tangental to disconnected material in each section. These tangents are hardly related to the topic."},{"Title":"Five Golden Rules : Great Theories of 20th-Century Mathematics -and Why They Matter","review":"I personally haven't completed this book but it is actually a great text for mathematicians: either ones that are just starting out, ones that have been in the field for a while, or ones that are out of practice. His presentation of real world applications of some of the more abstract rules of mathematics is rather interesting.On a warning note, though, if you are not at least conversant with modern mathematical theory, you may get very lost. It's been a while since I've studied mathematics seriously and occasionally I lose track of the thread of the topic.Still, it's a good read and very informatative."},{"Title":"Five Golden Rules : Great Theories of 20th-Century Mathematics -and Why They Matter","review":"Neat idea, but look elsewhere. I love maths, and I didn't like the book. Other books on modern maths are better. A good example is &quot;Strategic Thinking&quot; - by Dixit and Nalebuff. Dixit's book analysed the same concepts as those in the first chapter of this book. Dixit's book is clearer, more exciting, and better explained. On these dimensions Casti's book fails, badly. Don't buy."},{"Title":"Five Golden Rules : Great Theories of 20th-Century Mathematics -and Why They Matter","review":"While I think that this is one of the best introductory texts with regard to twentieth century mathematics, a person has to be willing to spend some significant time studying some of the chapters in order to make any sense out of it. I understood the Minimax and Halting Theorem chapters because I'm familiar with the material, but the rest of it was a little over my head for the amount of time I was willing to invest. I think that if you are really into math, this book will seem too simple, and if you aren't, it won't seem valuable. Three stars because the effort was there."},{"Title":"Five Golden Rules : Great Theories of 20th-Century Mathematics -and Why They Matter","review":"I found the text an inspiration. On one level, the material is fascinating. At another, you have to be impressed with Casti's ability to compress complex subjects into short essays. I've never seen anything comparable. Casti's presentation of game theory and topology are audacious. I've spent a lot of time with the 'Halting Problem' and disagree with a variety of conclusions Casti draws, but the clarity of presentation makes it a 'must read'."},{"Title":"Five Golden Rules : Great Theories of 20th-Century Mathematics -and Why They Matter","review":"This is a good book for those that have a degree of mathematical curiousity. Not necessarily expertise, just a decent interest in it.The reading is easy. The presentation is great, as I have come to expect from the publisher (Wiley).The content is very good. Note that these are from applied mathematics rather than pure mathematics. The author also makes this clear in the preface. This is an approach that I (sometimes) prefer, but just be forewarned that it is not the best of both worlds. Each topic is well explained and has many modern-day examples (e.g., Cuban Missile Crisis) worked into the text, making it all the more interesting.Good reading and recommended."},{"Title":"Five Golden Rules : Great Theories of 20th-Century Mathematics -and Why They Matter","review":"this book has a lot to offer. i have gone through it several times and even discussed the ideas with family."},{"Title":"Five Golden Rules : Great Theories of 20th-Century Mathematics -and Why They Matter","review":"I think in designing the book he should have switched the weakest section ( the last) with the first. The middle section on Thom's theory is probably the worst done, but the Simplex Method is probably why modern mathematicsis almost universally despised. The men who scheduled Jews into ovens totheir \\"Final Solution\\" used math in this sort of way. The Gropiuscheap housing solution gave rise to the notorious human failurecalled \\"The Projects\\" where crime fights poverty in dragging down lives.I think that ethics and humanity have to find a place in modern mathematicswhich still suffers from a preindustrial class structure and sexual bias.There is more to modern mathematics than great theorems."},{"Title":"Five Golden Rules : Great Theories of 20th-Century Mathematics -and Why They Matter","review":"My problem with this book lies not with the writing, but with the printing: missing fifty pages, the book repeats the first quarto. Happily, the publisher graciously sent me a new copy, but prospective readers should be forwarned."},{"Title":"Understanding Philosophy of Science","review":"James Ladyman's book is an excellent introduction to philosophy of science, though at times (especially in the latter part of the book) it becomes too sophisticated for a lower division course. Still, Ladyman covers the basics and then some using a clear style that engages the reader, bringing her gradually closer to some deep questions about the nature of science. The book starts with the standard topics of induction (and the corresponding problem pointed out by David Hume), moving to Popper's falsificationism, originally proposed as a solution to the problem of justification of inductive inference. After having explained why falsificationism in turn didn't work very well, Ladyman proceeds to Kuhn and the idea of paradigm shifts in the history of science. The difficult part comes in the second section, which is entirely devoted to the still ongoing debate between realists and antirealists in science. The reader is slowly but surely walked through increasingly complex rebuttals and counter-rebuttals articulated by major players in this high-level intellectual dispute, encountering fundamental concepts in modern philosophy of science throughout the ride. We learn about the underdetermination of theories by data, inference to the best explanation, constructive empiricism, the Duhem-Quine thesis and theories of explanation. The reader never gets to a final answer, which of course is not the point, but with a bit of effort it should be possible to follow Ladyman all the way to the end. The last two short sections, on idealisation and structural realism, are a bit too short to be effective; they should be either cut out or expanded in future editions. Still, I'm planning to use this book next semester in a 300-level class on philosophy of science, and I'm looking forward to the puzzled reactions of my students when they'll begin to appreciate how little we understand about how science works."},{"Title":"Understanding Philosophy of Science","review":"This is an introductory book, and as to be evaluated as such. Thus it is nonsense to say \\"Don't read this; read Popper, Duhem, etc. instead\\". And as an introduction to the philosophy of science this book is great, because it does what it is supposed to do: it covers most of the main issues, and it discusses the main theories in a very clear and structured way."},{"Title":"Understanding Philosophy of Science","review":"This is a more than adequate introduction to the subject, clearly written, sensibly structured and highly enjoyable. Philosophers frequently underestimate the degree to which the subject can be daunting even to the bright and enthusiastic beginner, and any introductory text must find a balance between thoroughness and accessibility. Ladyman's book does just that."},{"Title":"Understanding Philosophy of Science","review":"First things first: This is not a bad book. It approaches the philosophy of science in very general terms: Ladyman's terms are the layman's term, and I mean this as a compliment. But the book has also some serious flaws: It doesn't go into nearly enough detail to make it a useful textbook at university level; it is probably aimed at first-year students or high-school seniors who aren't quite sure what all this buzz about philosophy of science is about. It is difficult to imagine this book as the basis of a solid course in philosophy of science -- partly because the presentation is heavily biased by the author's main (research) interests. There are some original elements, but even those do not convince me that this book is better than any of the -- mostly excellent! -- introductions available, e.g. by Bird or Rosenberg. Also, the suggestions for &quot;further reading&quot; are of marginal usefulness, which after reading the book leaves one at a bit of a loss where to continue. Any serious reader would be better off investing into a good anthology, such as the Curd/Cover anthology &quot;Philosophy of Science: The Central Issues&quot;, which also includes many good introductory chapters. Finally, there should be a ban on (supposedly funny or enlightening) dialogues with marginal relevance to the argument -- and more specifically a ban on calling the fictional discussants &quot;Alice&quot; and &quot;Thomas&quot; (for obvious reasons...)"},{"Title":"Understanding Philosophy of Science","review":"This is not a book for leisure, but it makes an excellent textbook for an introduction course on philosophy of science. In a nutshell, Ladyman can be a bit wordy, but this book accomplishes its goal of making philosophy of science easier to understand without simplifying anything. If I were a professor teaching a course of philosophy of science, I would definitely make this a required text."},{"Title":"Understanding Philosophy of Science","review":"I liked Ladyman's book. The clarity of its chapters are worth the price. Not many books written for the purpose of introducing the reader to a complex subject matter succeed in their task. This one does. Those that expect it to be a definitive treatment of whatever subject it touches on are reading it wrongly. Ladyman brings the reader through the foggy marshes of Bas van Fraasen's anti-realism, Putnam's 'no-miracles' argument, Hume's hang ups with induction, and Lipton's love for 'lovely' explanations being guides to likely explanations. The chapters come in at a reasonable length, and end with a helpful 'further reading' section anyone with a good library can use to their advantage. Much of the book is dedicated to the realist v. anti-realist problem, but that is a key problem in philosophy of science. Those who have their minds made up about this ought to look elsewhere, but that does not detract from the value of reading this clearly written book."},{"Title":"Understanding Philosophy of Science","review":"I had to get this book for a class. I gave it two stars rather than one because there were a handful of great sections, including those about Popper and Khuntz. However, some of the more conceptual sections (the problem of symmetry argument against the covering law model) left me scratching my head. Ladyman seriously misses the mark on demonstrating the significance of most of the concepts in what feels like a scramble to cover a certain body of topics."},{"Title":"Understanding Philosophy of Science","review":"This is great introduction to the key issues that bother philosophers of science today - Ladyman has managed to really bring the subject alive."},{"Title":"Understanding Philosophy of Science","review":"There is no shortage of introductory philosophy books, and over the last ten years or so numerous books for undergraduates / beginning grad-school students have appeared, all of which claim to offer 'the' definitive survey of philosophy of language, metaphysics, epistemology... Well then, here is another introduction to philosophy of science -- no more, no less. Just like all other introductory texts, there are some omissions (some more serious than others), some errors and some unbalanced passages. However, the core problems are presented in a clear, though rather conventional way. If anyone with a serious interest in studying philosophy of science is reading this (let's call him 'Student' or, since analytic philosophers seem to enjoy abbreviations, 'S'), please let me say the following words: 'Dear S. Thank you for your interest in philosophy of science and in this book. Please don't waste your time reading *another* introductory textbooks. Go to your library, check out that Reichenbach, Duhem, Popper, Feyerabend, Hempel, Salmon, Achinstein, and *read the classics!*' They are infinitely more rewarding than this (or any other introductory) book. But if you feel you must add this book to your shopping cart -- who am I to stop you??"},{"Title":"Understanding Philosophy of Science","review":"At first sight, Ladyman's book looks like a solid introductory book -- nothing exciting, no brilliant new ideas, but at least a good survey of the field. On closer inspection, however, there are numerous omissions, not least when it comes to problems of apportioning credit for good ideas... Old examples get recycled (fair enough), but their original authors don't even get credit (intolerable). The author seems not to care about related work in history and sociology of science, which renders the book useless for anyone with a broader interest in science."},{"Title":"Understanding Philosophy of Science","review":"This text is hardly a survey of the philosophy of science. There is much inconsistency and personal bias in the presentation of ideas in philosophy of science which leads me to think it was written by graduate students. In particular, Ladymans presentation of Kuhns philosophy is problematic.I hope the second edition shows more open mindedness."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Macromedia Dreamweaver 8 in 24 Hours","review":"This is a great book for beginners that want to create amateur-decent websites. Any knowledge beyond the intermediate level will have to be sought elsewhere.The book is broken down into chapters, each chapter refered to as \\"one hour.\\" The first few hours are easy-to-follow, but as you advance the chapters, the author's wear and tear becomes more and more evident. The instructions and descriptions start becoming sloppy and lackluster.Some chapters - particularly the early ones - cover simple concepts comprehensively with unnecessarily meticulous description, while the later chapters are skimmed and vague. For instance, the author doesn't bother to explain the real difference between table layout, table cells and layers - the advantages, disadvantages, etc. If you're not familiar with these concepts, you will be baffled and left out in the cold. She also doesn't expand further than merely teaching you how to make a table, cell or layer, which is a shame because these tools are pivotal designing tools for professional webdesigners (what the book promises to make of you at its completion). Another tragic mistake by the author was skipping another crucial designing method called floating and failing to spend sufficient time on CSS. Instead she spends a whole chapter on frames, a primitive designing feature that has long been abandoned with stone tires.The book is also misleading because every \\"hour\\" takes closer to two hours. Some even three. This is not because the chapters are so long, but because it takes time to consume the material and process the information into your cerebral registry. It takes time to apply the instructions and practice to perfect the chapters. And that could easily mean more than one hour per chapter. Plus, there are a lot of times you just don't understand what some of the poor descriptions are talking about and spend 30 minutes easy trying to figure out what's happening on your own. Sooner or later you start drifting into space and the next thing you know, an hour has flown by in lala land.Don't get me wrong. For a newbie, the book is excellent at acquainting you with Dreamweaver 8, but if you're looking to be designing professional websites afterward as the book asserts, I recommend you do a lot of research online, as few books on DW cover beyond the basics."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Macromedia Dreamweaver 8 in 24 Hours","review":"In the computer world, things change in the blink of an eye.

Concepts are delivered in units that are designed to be completed within 1 hour per unit. Betsy Bruce's Teach Yourself Macromedia Dreamweaver 8 in 24 Hours is no exception.Teach Yourself Macromedia Dreamweaver 8 in 24 Hours is written for a reader new to building websites and to Dreamweaver or a reader who is somewhat familiar with those topics but not Dreamweaver. The structure of the book begins with a quick tour of Dreamweaver 8 then takes the reader through basic HTML and images and beyond to more advanced topics such as Dynamic HTML (DHTML) and form handling.Due to reader request and because many new Dreamweaver users also have Macromedia Fireworks (as part of Macromedia Studio , there is a \\"bonus\\" lesson on the use of Fireworks to optimize images for the web.Dreamweaver how-tos and HTML concepts are introduced in a logical progression; for example, readers are taught basic layout using tables and frames then are introduced to the use of layers and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).As with all books in the in 24 Hours series, each lesson concludes with a Q&A; section to reinforce the key concepts presented and a Workshop section which contains a simple quiz to test understanding and a hands-on \\"lab\\" that asks the reader to perform certain tasks that were explained in the lesson.As a training aid targeted at getting new Dreamweaver users up and running quickly, the book covers static pages only, leaving database connections, server-side scripting options, and other advanced topics for other books such as Teach Yourself PHP in 24 Hours (ISBN 0-672-32619-1) or Macromedia Dreamweaver 8 Unleashed (ISBN 0-672-32760-0), part of Sams Publishing's Unleashed series.Betsy Bruce's writing is clear and easily digestible. She gives enough explanation with some background information where applicable without meandering through unnecessary or confusing information. Where beneficial to understanding the use of a Dreamweaver feature or capability, she gives examples of how she uses that feature or capability in her own work.Macromedia Dreamweaver 8 in 24 Hours is an excellent aid for the new Dreamweaver user who has a need to hit the ground running. Those who have used Dreamweaver MX or Dreamweaver MX 2004 or are a new Dreamweaver 8 user who can afford a more leisurely pace may be better off taking a look at thepreviously mentioned Macromedia Dreamweaver 8 Unleashed.Reviewer: Robert SaucierMember, D-MAG.org"},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Macromedia Dreamweaver 8 in 24 Hours","review":"Of important note: The back of the book states that its a BEGINNER level book.

I was quite wrong! So I bought two books--Sams Teach Yourself Macromedia Dreamweaver 8 in 24 hours and Dreamweaver 8 The Missing Manual. First, as you may be well aware, Dreamweaver was purchased from Macromedia and incorporated into the Adobe software line fairly recently. Adobe has incorporated some of the desktop look and feel of their other products into Dreamweaver 8 but the program is not that intuitive for a new user. The book, that is the subject of this review, helps some but is dense reading. It is set up as a series of one hour lessons and this format makes it hard to skip around and find out how to handle a specific problem you may wish to address. The Missing Manual book is somewhat more thorough (and almost 400 pages longer) in covering the intricacies of Dreamweaver but is no less dense. If you are looking for a \\"How do I design a web page?\\" book, you may find these books overly technical and without many easy to understand screen shots. The screen shots in Sams Teach Yourself Macromedia Dreamweaver 8 in 24 hours are all B&W (same in The Missing Manual) and the details are small.

That would have been a more honest title. The reader can make his own judgements concerning the motives that prompted the name change.This book has almost nothing useful to do with incense at all. It is nothing more than a book of &quot;spells&quot; and other such ridiculous nonsense. About the only thing of any use I got from it was an answer to why the incense I buy at Ren Faire have such idiotic names.If you are looking for a book on making incense, without all the superstitious mumbo-jumbo, I'd suggest &quot;Potpourri, Incense and Other Fragrant Concoctions&quot; by Ann Tucker Fettner.

Anyone can do make these recipes, and I mean anyone. He even teaches you how to empower everything you make. Of sourse I knew how do do this for many years now, but for the beginner this is crucial. There is so many oils, sachets, potions, powders, incenses, soaps and tinctures to make here. If you want to know how to make any type of astrological oil its in here. If you want to know how to make Pele incense or Isis incense its in here! For those of you who want to learn how to make your own incenses and such or for those of you who are looking for more recipes, do not pass up this book. This is a true gem.

Cunningham offers something more than a delightful compendium of recipes for everything from incense to ritual soaps to sachets--he tickles the imagination to come up with ideas even better than what he presents.

This book also features lots of correspondences for all the stuff that's enlisted in this awesome book.

Here shortly , I will begin experimenting with both the non combustional incense and the more difficult to make combustional incense. The combustional incense type can be really messy and some of the constituents are difficult to obtain from what I gathered in this book. The author does state that one must have perserverence when attempting to make the combustional type of incense from scratch. If you just want to experiment and have fun with different scents and aromas , this book would be of value to you because it has so many different combinations of ideas and mixtures concerning incense , oils and brews. It also has an interesting topic about homemade soaps as well."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Incense, Oils and Brews","review":"This is a fabulous book for the beginning witch, and one that you can grow with. It contains recipes for all purposes a beginner would want/need, and numerous recipes that I consider intermediate to advanced.

Even though I am a relative beginner, my book is already dog-eared and well-worn from use."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Incense, Oils and Brews","review":"Whether you are a novice in the field or a master you will enjoy Cunningham's book. He wrote a concise book that details how one can make incense, oils and assundry odds and ends for oneself.

He put tables of substitution in the back of the book but if one is really serious about this field a good companion book would be _Cunningham's Encyclopedia of Magical Herbs_ which contains more detailed tables.

In fact, I just wish I could afford to have them all!"},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Incense, Oils and Brews","review":"I absolutely adore most of Mr. Cunningham's work, and was very impressed with Incense, Oils & Brews. The incense section of the book alone is worth buying, even if you aren't very much into oils (I'm not). There are many, MANY recipes for an oil or incense mixture, and most of the ingredients are easily obtainable. I much prefer to make herbal sachets and incenses over oils, as these can be messy and expensive, but to each their own.This should be in your library right next to his herbal and gem encyclopedias, as it is a book that you will refer to often."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Incense, Oils and Brews","review":"This was one of my first aromatherapy books.

I love the substitution section of the book and the astrological and element references to the herbs and oils is so great, especially for making Full Moon tea with the right elements (while avoiding the poisinous herbs).

This one gives me just about everything I need to know to do what I want to do. I think you will find it very useful as well in your blending and incense making tasks even if they are more for personal use than for ritual use."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Incense, Oils and Brews","review":"This book was written before much was known about incense making. The recipes contain Salt Peter which is never used by makers of quality incense. It creates Nitrous Oxides when burned."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Incense, Oils and Brews","review":"This is one great book! Very helpful, lots of reference tools available inside and appendices that show you where to get more information. I love Scott Cunningham's books. I only recently discovered the wealth of information he has provided to the world on Wicca and Wiccan traditions - as well as natural healing, practical magic (magick), and \\"Incense, Oils, and Brews\\" - and I was thrilled to see in the foreword where the author reads letters from fans/readers, and quickly as equally disappointed to soon after learn that he had since passed away.Buy any of Scott Cunningham's books on anything Wicca-related, and I guarantee you, you can't go wrong. Full of helpful information, and written in a way that is not only easy to understand but actually also a pleasure to read. This is not an easy statement to make about most reference-type books, but it is true of Scott Cunningham's works. He was not only a great practitioner of Wicca, but honestly, a great writer as well. I am so glad that he decided to pass on his personal information that he learned from dedicating most of his lifetime to the craft - to the rest of us, for our day-to-day use, life enrichment, and for the betterment of our health, love, work, and every aspect of our daily living.I am currently diving in to TEN of his books right now. If practicing Herbal Magick, Wicca, or creating your own incenses interests you in any way, this book is a MUST HAVE for your personal library. I prefer the physical version to the Kindle app - as you can highlight, make notes, and easily flip back and forth through ear-marked pages as needed. Before long, I'm sure I'll have every book available in his name - and I know that I will not only read them all, but will USE them all in many of my day-to-day workings as a solitary practitioner of the Wiccan craft."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Incense, Oils and Brews","review":"The Complete Book of Incense, Oils and Brews by Scott Cunningham is a phenomenal book about the magical and physical properties of Incense, oils, and many other mixtures including tinctures and bath salts. The book is divided into three sections. The first on an introduction to the magical properties, proportions of ingredients, and creating your own recipes.The first section is phenomenally put together. Cunningham discusses everything you will need to know about the ingredients used in the recipes, the basics of making incense, oils and other formulas, and the magical side of making your own incense to use in rituals, the home, and aromatherapy. One of the most beneficial sections of this part is the ingredients section. Cunningham talks about the types or plants, resins, and gums to use, the most common ingredients, and where to buy, grow, or find the ingredients. The second part contains the recipes.The bulk of the recipes are of incense and oil concoctions. However, Cunningham also delves into the mixing of bath salts, brews and teas, herb baths, powders, tinctures, and a few other small items such as inks, and ritual soaps. The only thing I wish that Cunningham had written in more detail about, are the smaller recipes, such as the ritual soaps. However, the supplied recipes are richly developed, and have a broad array of products. With each section, a description of how to make the recipes is written, followed by the recipes.The two most thorough and valuable sections are the incense and oil tutorials. Cunningham gives you all the information you will need, but not too much to where you feel overwhelmed, and don't know where to start. The most valuable part in my opinion is the third.The third part makes this book not only valuable to those who are new to making incense, but also to experienced incense makers. Cunningham lists substitutions you can use in the case you don't having an ingredient, are allergic to an ingredient, or any other reason you can think of for needing to replace an item. This section also includes the scents to use in recipes for the four elements, planetary, magical, and astrological purposes."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Incense, Oils and Brews","review":"Like all Cunningham books you'll wear this book out referring to it again and again for your rituals and magick.

The recipe's are great but the oil recipe's are only usefull if your making a dram size bottle. Eventually you'll beable to improve his recipes and change things when you get a better idea about plants and their uses in magic and healing.

Each section is informative and full of recipies, explanations, suggestions, and warnings. The chapter on substitution is excellent and the charts and appendixes are helpful as well. The book's tone is more instructional rather than spiritual, especially compared to Cunningham's other books. If you are looking for in-depth information about magical herbs and oils, I highly recommend reading Cunningham's Encyclopedia of Magical Herbs and The Magic of Aromatherapy in addition to The Complete Book of Incense, Oils, and Brews."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Incense, Oils and Brews","review":"This book is designed for those with little experience with paganism, or at least with pagan herbalism. It does a great job at explaining the basics of pagan herbalism. It explains the uses of incense, oils, and brews in pagan life and ritual and the ways they are constructed and charged. Most importantly it desbribes the attributes of each common herb and provides complete and informative charts organized by element, by planetary influence, and by area (protection, love, healing, etc.).It covers incenses, oils, soaps, tincintures, sachets, and brews. The major drawback of this broad coverage is that no one area is covered as fully as possible. The recipes in particular are barely adequate. Each chapter gives dozens of recipes, but most have only a sentence or two of explaination. And they merely rehash the information given by the the charts.The information is useful, but not significantly different than that found in many other pagan herbalism books. If you do not own such books I recommend this book. It is as direct and useful a beginner text as exists. If you do, don't expect to learn much more from this. Happy Brewing!"},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Incense, Oils and Brews","review":"If you are looking for a book on Incenses, oils, inks, soaps and more this is an absolute MUST HAVE!!! I couldn't say enough positive things about this book, an excelent addition to any witchcraft library, and FULL of benificial advise. Clear directions on how to make an entire book full of incense, oils ointments,inks, tinctures, herb baths, bath salts, brews, ritual soaps (solid & liquid), Sachets or herbal charms, powders, and there are chapters on substitutions and the considerations for making those substitutions. A chapter on empowering rites, on propotions, on creating your own recipes....Just an all around wonderful reference book, and not a bad read either. All in all a real 10!! You finish reading a chapter and wish there was more, this book is an essential part of my library, and if you are a serious practitioner, I recomend it as an essential buy for yours...enjoy!!

I doubt I can (or should) add anything in addition to what's already been said by the many other reviewers. All I need to say is that this is the ONE book I turn to time and time again without fail. My copy is dog-eared, stained, wrinkled, spotted, written in, tabbed and highlighted; well worn from many years of loving use. It's truly a master work by one of the best in the business, if not THE best. If you don't have this, you're doing yourself a dissatisfaction. Get it, read it, learn it, love it and keep it close to your heart and your Craft, you won't be sorry."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Incense, Oils and Brews","review":"This book belongs in every occultist's library. Cunningham has left no stone unturned in his presentation of correspondences and substitutions. The book consists of several sections, each devoted to a specific topic, i.e., incenses, soaps, oils, brews, etc. Each section is alphabetically subdivided by purpose, astrological and plantetary influences, etc. Included for the adventurous are some recipies from older grimoires, along with safer modern blends aimed at the same goals. The incense chapter alone is worth the price of the book. After reading it, you'll never be dependent upon headshop joss sticks and cones again. Also included is a listing of sources for materials. In short, this book is an invaluable reference work, and belongs on every practicing magicians's bookshelf."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Incense, Oils and Brews","review":"The reason why I feel that this book doesn't deserve five stars is because some of the recipes are too weird. Some of the recipes are supposedly ancient, and I quote...(Scott Cunningham)&gt;&gt;&gt;SPIRIT INCENSE # 2 (caution!)root of the weedy herb Sagapen(?), juice of the Hemlock*, juice of the Henbane*, Tapsus barbatus(?), Red sandalwood, Black Poppy seed,Fume to make spirits and strange shapes appear. To make them flee, add parsley to this mixture, as this chases away all spirits and destroys all visions (which seems to contradict Spirit Incense #1 above!) This 50O-year-old formula is virtually impossible to compound. I included this recipe as an example of an authentic, ancient herbal incense. Most of these are as difficult to make as this one. What is the &quot;weedy herb Sagapen&quot;? I haven't the slightest idea!He puts stupid recipes such as this one in his book to make Wicca look 'mysterious' and 'ancient.' The practices in Wicca are natural and don't call for 'ancient' herbs such as the weedy herb Sagapen (which I am pretty sure never existed). Most of the tools in Wicca can be found in your backyard. Don't get me wrong here. This book is full of *terrific* recipes. But don't be fooled by some of the 'ancient' herbal recipes that he included in this book.In Part 1, this book tells you the Basics...* On Magick * On Proportions * Empowering Rites * Ingredients * Creating Your Own RecipesIn Part 2, it gets into the actual Recipes for...* Incense * Oils * Ointments * Inks * Tinctures * Herb Baths * Bath Salts * Brews * Ritual Soaps * Sachets or Herbal Charms * Powders * A Miscellany of RecipesIn Part 3, they have Substitutions...* Specific Substitutions * Magickal Goals * Planetary Substitutions * Elemental Substitutions * Astrological SubstitutionsBuy this book!

You won't go wrong buying this book."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Incense, Oils and Brews","review":"This is the first book I read about Wicca and of Scott Cunningham. He is thorough with his explainations on each recipe - the substitution list alone is worth the price of the book. If you are new to wicca, exploring wicca or have been practicing for many years, this book is a constant you will return to again and again. The references contain good information to assist you in further exploration. I especially appreciate his openness. He is not at all pretentious as I have read in other books. Scott encourages you to be creative, free thinking and not to be constantly worrying about &quot;getting it right&quot;. A very down to earth writer who knows his subject well and communicates it in such a way to get your &quot;magical kitchen&quot; started. May all who read this book find the &quot;magic&quot; in everyday things!"},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Incense, Oils and Brews","review":"Cunningham has compiled an excellent reference book for anyone interested in Aromatherapy, Homeopathy, Wicca, Paganism, Kitchen-Witchery, or just plain do-it-yourselfers that find store bought products either too expensive or lacking in their ability to suit a specific need. The substitution tables in the back of the book alone are worth the price of the book, but the recipies he offers are also quite a delight for the mind and the senses. The feeling of accomplishment one recieves from creating their own products is wonderful, and they make great gifts as well, with that honest, heartfelt touch people love. If you are thinking of toying with herbal blends, this is the perfect place to start. If you don't have what is called for, plenty of other choices are offered, and, once you begin to build up a good supply of herbs, this book offers options for all sorts of different conditions. If it weren't for this book, I would never have started making incense. Now people are asking me to teach them! I owe it all to this wonderful book!"},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Incense, Oils and Brews","review":"I've work with this book soooooo many times, that any other book on the subject seems..well...small.

No one single book is going to answer all your oils, incents, or brew questions.

It contains a whole lot of recipies, but the information on the ingredients is a lot too skimpy. One major fault is the failure to clearly note the oils which can be unsafe to use on skin.Also note that he didn't sufficiently stress that a mixture destined to be used on skin should NEVER be used full strength!I bought it hoping for clear advice on massage oils and was certainly disappointed. I'll definately find the correspondences useful but overall, I don't consider it to be on a leve with his herbal books."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Incense, Oils and Brews","review":"Another staple in any Witch's library (an excellent companion to Cunningham's book, \\"The Encyclopedia of Magical Herbs\\") that is well worth the money.

The only thing i don't like is that it wasn't specific on what alcohal to use for oils and all that. It says everclear but i hear that's illegal in most places. It's looking like 90 percent or above alchohal but some books say at least 75 percent and up. So you really don't know which \\"beverage\\" to use to make oils and perfumes.

It's a collection of mixtures for oils, brews, and incense. A great resource for anyone who would like to make their own supplies. One thing to know before you buy is that his book is intended to be used in correspondence with his herbals. While there are some mixtures for incenses and etc. in here, if you do not have your own knowledge about the magickal properties of herbs or know how his systems differs from yours these books are helpful to look at to find out why rosemary or whatever is in that blend. Sure they smell nice (mostly) but there isn't a lot of information on magickal herbalism. I would also recommend his herbals, especially for those just getting started.Cunningham's Encyclopedia of Magical Herbs (Cunningham's Encyclopedia Series)Magical Herbalism: The Secret Craft of the Wise (Llewellyn's Practical Magick Series)"},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Incense, Oils and Brews","review":"If you are building your own collection of books on herbs, oils, etc., this is an excellent book for that collection.I'll use it to create herbal gifts and I'll use it to guide the plantings in my own herb garden.

Besides showing us how to create our own inceses, oils, and brews, he also explains how to make tinctures, powders, bath salts, soaps, sachets, and inks. There are tons of different recipes available, especially for incenses, for all sorts of magickal purposes.Substitutions are also treated. Several pages are broken down by plants, purposes, planets, and astrological signs which are very, very useful is you have a particular goal in mind. For me, these are the best parts of the book. If I need to know which oils to use or herbs to burn for a healing spell, they're all right there. If I need to attract some more lunar energy in an esbat ritual, I can very quickly find that I can use lemon oil on my candles if there's no myrrh or jasmine around.Overall, it's a great book and Cunningham's Encyclopedia of Magical Herbs is the perfect companion for it. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Incense, Oils and Brews","review":"As soon as I started reading this book I realized that it is perfect. It is simple and easy to follow his instructions. I read a few books similar to this one and none of them come close to compare to it. After reading each section I couldn't wait to try it for myself.

I think another author should have a go...It's better than the similar ones on herbs and gems, though!"},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Incense, Oils and Brews","review":"This book is awesome. Not only a big book of receipes, but also a wonderful primer on why and how to make and use all types of brews. Again, Scott Cunningham gives you so many resources there is no reason why you cannot start making your own incenses and oils right away. What really puts this book ahead of other is that he cautions you on using certain things and tells you why(like one of the flying potions), but he also encourages you to make up your own brews, and not just follow the receipes he gives you in the book.

It's an easy read if you are intending to read it cover to cover, but it's also great just to use as a reference.

I intended to just find a simple recipe, but ended up reading almost the whole book in one sitting. He also lists substitutions for herbs you may not have on hand or that may be difficult to find. I find that list very useful and reference it often when using other recipes as well. I'm a beginner to this sort of thing and i found it very easy to follow and very inspiring.

His scholarship is really second-to-none. The only small issue I have is that they are beginning to show their age just a little because they were written before the international marketplace of the Internet had emerged. Things that he thought difficult to get are now fairly easy and even inexpensive with the opening of international trade online and some things that he relied on are near extinction and almost impossible to find.

That in its own makes it a very commendable book on scholarly magical research. It is a very good source book for any kind of magic practitioner. A word of warning though: I believe this book is effective in the hands of people who know how to work magic, whatever their approach, tradition, paradigm or school. Yet the book is not a course in magic in its own, and even if it gives SKETCHES of how to charge the preparations magically, additional training is needed to do this effectively. I would recommend prospective buyers that do not know how to magically charge inanimate objects to learn this Craft elsewhere, or to expand the indications given in this book with other techniques and practices, perhaps extracted from other books as well."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Incense, Oils and Brews","review":"This is a great book for the beginner and the Crafty Wiccan alike. As always, Cunningham shows his great talent for writing a wonderful \\"how to\\" guide, and the reader discovers that he has many forms of spellcraft at his disposal. Describing everything from the making of different kinds of incense (combustible vs. non-combustible), soaps (solid vs. liquid), sachets (for the bath or otherwise), ointments, oils, powders, tinctures, inks, and salts, Cunningham covers every imaginable base. From which form of magical herb combination works best towards which purposes (uses of incenses vs. uses of ritual baths, for example), to notations about traditional use vs. modern use, to cautions against poison or bad-smelling combinations, to recipes for a wealth of different purposes. For anyone who likes doing it all themselves, this book is a godsend. I use this book quite frequently as a starting point for ideas and as a general reference. I strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Incense, Oils and Brews","review":"The first book I ever bought pertaining to the Pagan tradition. I still have that copy, even though it is almost completely worn out. I use it regularly.

I wish Cunningham was still alive so that he could write more great books."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Incense, Oils and Brews","review":"An excellent book that is well worth having in your library.

This is very enjoyable!"},{"Title":"Agent of Chaos","review":"Norman Spinrad is certainly not a household name. Matter-of-fact, his name is not even listed in the alphabetical reference for Sci-Fi authors. Imagine my surprise when I looked up his name so I could review \\"Agent of Chaos\\" and found dozens of his novels listed, many with 5 star ratings!\\"Agent of Chaos\\" was published in 1970, and I have no idea how this novel became part of my Sci-Fi collection. It is yellowed and brittle now, and I picked it out one afternoon just because I was curious. No, this novel wasn't \`the find of the century', by any means, although it was an engaging and quick read (half a day).It is a story of a group of rebels trying to assassinate the leader of the Hegemonic Council that rule the solar system with absolute tyranny. Spinrad uses many clever ideas, and the world of the Hegemony is fleshed out nicely. Center to the plot is an enigmatic group called \`The Brotherhood of Assassins' who thwart the rebels at every turn, yet, also create havoc within the Hegemony. It is this group that heightens the reader's interest. Unfortunately, the protagonist (Johnson), who is suppose to be a great fighter and leader, turns out to be rather naive, and is easily duped (too easily). This may or may not have been the author's intent, but in either case, it frustrated this reader. Also absent was any hint of a love interest, leaving the reader with a fairly shallow story.Long out of print, \\"Agent of Chaos\\" does many things well, but when I finished the novel, it left no lingering memories. It's just a quick, enjoyable read for a Saturday afternoon. No depth here. Between 1 and 10, \\"Agent of Chaos\\" gets a 5. I'm more curious about the author, but it looks like if I want to read anymore of his work I'll need to look through used book stores."},{"Title":"Agent of Chaos","review":"When I was only thirteen I think my Father handed this book to me to read. This book is an early work of SF that takes place in a dystopian future. The book itself touches on the nature of power and freedom. Though I don't agree with Spinrad's ideas entirely, his book contains ideas about individualism that resonate even today. This book has been a major influence on my thoughts and beliefs and the story is still remembered by me to this day. I would suggest this to anyone who has some time on their hands."},{"Title":"Agent of Chaos","review":"Only a few of the previous reviews for this obscure old sci-fi chestnut really tackle its actual themes and points of view. This was Spinrad's second novel and he was still a few releases away from wide recognition, but here he shows some real ambition and creativity. While the book does get a little full of itself at times, and the rather wooden characters show the golden age sci-fi weakness of talking way too much, Spinrad spun a surprisingly unique and effective political focus into an otherwise typical little space opera. The story revolves around a quite fascinating philosophy of chaos as the natural state of the universe (and its inhabitants), with the order imposed by leaders as antithetical to the destiny of mankind. It's a rather anarchist political outlook presented in cosmological terms. Spinrad does well with this premise, plotting out some intricate political shenanigans as three different parties exploit each other while trying to impose their vision of humanity, with dueling strategies for creating order or chaos. In the process, Spinrad delivers some insightful ruminations on power, tyranny, and freedom - and what those seemingly cut-and-dried terms mean on a cosmic scale. While parts of this book are pretty outdated and it shows many of the minor weaknesses of its genre at the time, Spinrad delivered what might be the most ambitious sci-fi political exploration this side of Frank Herbert or Anthony Burgess. The fact that this ambition actually leads to readable results is all the reason to pick up this old lost classic if you come across it.

Norman Spinrad writes a novel that cuts to the heart of modern existence and is a complete guide on how and why to live."},{"Title":"Agent of Chaos","review":"Norman Spinrad is one of the best writers of the 1970's. His novel Bug Jack Barron is considered one of the 100 best SF books of all time. This is one of his first novels and as such is a precursor of the technique and themes appearing in later books. I would buy this book. But then again, I know a book with Spinrad's name on it will not be a waste of time or money."},{"Title":"Agent of Chaos","review":"The author opened each Chapter with a verse from George Markowitz, fictive author of the Theory of Social Empathy. He draws his characters in this story to produce conflict between the theory of social order and of that of social chaos. Sprinrad presents human emotions as random factors serving the forces of chaos. This is a very good job of using his characters to teach his anti-utopian ideal. Basically he is telling his reader to stop fighting the entropic degradation of the universe--just lay back and enjoy it. That one group committed suicide, as the Brotherhood of Assassins did, in order to accomplish their mission of universal planetary exploration was a paradox that enthralled the author. Thus he labeled victory by suicide as the Ultimate Chaotic Act."},{"Title":"Agent of Chaos","review":"I've now read this book, and to be honest, don't find it to be worth a lengthy review. Spinrad proposes three social forces in conflict - the Hegemony, the Democratic League, and the \\"chaotic\\" Brotherhood of Assassins - and populates each with two-dimensional stick-figure heroes and villains. It's ok if you are into lasgun assaults under plasteel domes on Mercury, but it's not the philosophical conflict of ideas that it pretends to be. No way it was \\"the great science-fiction novel now an underground classic in colleges all across America\\".At times it can be just ridiculous; for example, when the first intersteller probe comes back from Cygnus 61, everyone sits around waiting for the film to come back from the lab. And a secret agent travels to Mercury under cover as a business man deciding whether to relocate his desk calculator manufacturing plant there, as if that makes economic sense. Sheesh."},{"Title":"Agent of Chaos","review":"No, this is not a Get Smart adventure. Norman Spinrad's book is about one man's choice with regards to political systems.

I read Agent of Chaos after I stole it from a local bookstore (that will go nameless from the get-go) and I must say I enjoyed the time I spent reading it. In fact, I made a great event out of it. What I did was this: I bought me a bottle of Bacardi Rum; walked on over to Stromboli's Wash N' Shop Laundromat with a full sack of quarters; got high off of some University District MaryJane, and read that thar book while I lost at every video game, including the Star Wars pinball machine."},{"Title":"Agent of Chaos","review":"&quot;Perfecto!&quot"},{"Title":"Agent of Chaos","review":"It's a little known fact that Norman Spinrad wrote one of the most beloved, yet dunder-headed Star Trek episodes of its second season on NBC. This episode was called &quot;The Doomsday Machine.&quot; I know you're probably standing there right now, arms folded, tapping your space-booted toe, and looking down on me for remembering such an obscure piece of ****. I don't blame you. I'm ashamed and sorry. I promise it won't happen again. However, I did read &quot;Agent of Chaos,&quot; and I found that it lived up to the description of its contents printed across its colorful, and hilariously chaotic front cover. It promised to be An Agonizing Science Fiction Adventure, and man o man was it ever. This book made me physically and mentally ill. By the end of chapter one, I got this sick, chalky taste in my mouth. Then, I rushed to my bathroom mirror to find my face had grown fat with three double chins covered with zits. By the end of chapter two, my brains had turned into puree.... And by the final chapter, I felt the uncontrollable urge to shave my eyebrows off. In conclusion, Norman Spinrad's &quot;Agent Of Chaos&quot; is a fat, gum-chewing sci-fi novel, and it gets five stars for being so, and for delivering just what its jacket advertises:-AN AGONIZING SCIENCE FICTION ADVENTURE."},{"Title":"Agent of Chaos","review":"Wasn't that line in Star Trek somewhere along the way? I enjoyed reading it but I wondered offhand whether the Hegemony sought to diminish chaos by eliminating women? Except, men and women were herded to see the initial speech and then after that...? I can see a novel without a main female character but I would still expect to see a female pronoun along the way, a technician, a specific mention among the crowds, something?The unclimactic climactic ending, the rather commonplace (today)Ultimate Chaotic Act, dated it heavily in light of 911-01, Palestinian and Iraqi suicide bombers, etc."},{"Title":"Agent of Chaos","review":"The publisher is crazy.

I would have liked to see more applications of the theory than this book provides, but this book contains the most readable development of the theory that I have ever seen."},{"Title":"Drums,","review":"Drums by Boyd has been called the best novel ever written about the Revolutionary War. Narrated from the viewpoint of a North Carolina Tory gentleman's adolescent son, it's unique outlook soon draws the reader into the drama of colonial unrest and the emotional battle men fought within themselves whether to cede from England or not. However, this is no psychological melodrama. Some of the most superb scenes in the novel are the depictions of a local horse race and a John Paul Jones sea battle. So why isn't Drums read more widely? It would seem Boyd's own excellent writing has gotten him into trouble for today's reader. Not only are his fight scenes realistic, but his cooly penetrating description of the early entrenchment of southern slavery, with all crudities of language and social class structure, is too graphic for our modern tastes. In short, he uses the &quot;N&quot; word too liberally. Reading this novel reminded me of reading HUCKLEBERRY FINN. It also reminded me of Olasky's FIGHTING FOR LIBERTY AND VIRTUE. Personally, I think it should be put back on high school reading lists. I think it would help in revealing why slavery was not addressed at the time of the Revolution as well as why it took a war to settle the matter."},{"Title":"Drums,","review":"I had never heard of James Boyd or his 1925 novel Drums until listening to historian David McCullough's speech, The Course of Human Events, wherein McCullough cited Drums as a historical novel he'd read as a child and helped inspire him to become a historian. That was enough for me to give it a look myself.Drums starts out set in North Carolina and features Johnny Fraser as the main character. Johnny is the son of a well-to-do Scottish immigrant with expectations of becoming a gentleman and dreams of adventure. The story begins when Johnny is a boy, and depicts his growth into a young man during the time of the American Revolution.While I was expecting the protagonist of a novel about the Revolutionary war to sign up for the Continental Army the moment shots are fired at Lexington, this turns out not to be the case in Drums. Instead, what we see is Johnny's struggle to determine the right course of action, torn between loyalty to the King and pride in his country. Meanwhile, we also get to see how Johnny's family, friends, and neighbors respond to the choice before them between loyalty and patriotismThis conflict is actually the central struggle of the drama. While there is action and we do eventually get to see some of the war, the focus is definitely on the civilian side of things, and the look at how civilians lived, and how they fared and the choices they had to make is very interesting.Since a large portion of the book is set in Revolutionary North Carolina, slavery is very present. Boyd doesn't shy away from the ugliness of the situation. It's presented much as it must have been, and as a simple fact that none question. While I certainly didn't enjoy reading those parts, per se, I appreciated Boyd's willingness to depict things honestly. There's no overt condemnation of slavery or the treatment of African-Americans, but in this case, showing things as they were and how even our protagonist doesn't give it a thought can in itself be powerful.One aspect that was a pleasant surprise was a historical connection between Drums and Robert Louis Stevenson's 1886 novel, Kidnapped. Kidnapped is set in Scotland of the 1750's, and given that Johnny's father is a Scottish immigrant, some of the major historical events of that time affect each novel. I'll say no more to avoid spoiling either book.I read an edition of Drums illustrated by N.C. Wyeth. Wyeth is a favorite of mine, having illustrated many young men's adventure stories of the era. His work here is again excellent. Wyeth contributes nine full color, full page illustration, as well as a small black and white drawing at the opening of each of the 47 chapters.Overall, I would have liked a novel about the Revolutionary War to have a bit more action, but Drums does an excellent job of depicting the rest of the Revolution, which often gets less attention, and the action it does include is quite good. If you're a fan of the American Revolution or historical fiction, Drums will probably appeal to you."},{"Title":"Drums,","review":"I first saw the Scribner Illustrated Classics series in a Museum in Chicago. I believe Treasure Island was the first that I purchased. The Wyeth paintings were reproduced for this book and many others. The artwork is fabulous. I visited the Brandywine River Museum in Chadds Ford, PA to see many of the original Wyeth illustrations. The titles in this series are still classics and every bit as riviting as when I first read them. I have read some to children and they are great fun for all. I have collected the whole series, they will be passed on to children and grandchldren."},{"Title":"Drums,","review":"The book arrived in very good time and was in the condition as shown by the seller.

It may include a clergyman sleuth or a church setting, but the Christian faith has no bearing on anyone's conduct. Happily, that is not true here.A new 'tec for me is Fr. Mark Townsend, the creation of Jesuit priest Brad Reynolds. In A RITUAL DEATH, he has taken some vacation time to visit his grandparents in LaConner, Washington. LaConner is a beautiful retirement community on land rented from the Swinomish Indians.The Swinomishes' long-standing resentment of their more prosperous white tenants appears to have boiled over into murder. The victim is Fr. Mark's grandfather's best friend. The prime suspect is the husband of Grandmother Townsend's cleaning woman. The family and the races are divided over the guilt of Greg Patsy, a salmon fisherman and Swinomish activist. The Patsy family, especially daughter Jesse, engage Fr. Mark's sympathies, particularly since he senses the motives for this murder are more complex than a dispute between two fishermen.Against his father's wishes (and those of his his associate pastor holding the fort back home), Fr. Mark and his new-found Swinomish allies discover the smuggling history of the Skagit Valley continues with new forms of contraband.Guided by the words of St. Ignatius and his own heart, Fr. Mark believably fumbles his way to a surprising solution. The supporting characters are vivid, as is the setting. I welcome Fr. Reynolds to the band of authors whose new titles I eagerly anticipate.We may never face murder, but this Christian &quot;detective&quot; can teach us how to apply our faith in situations of stress and fear. Not bad for &quot;light&quot; reading!Kathleen T. Choi HAWAII CATHOLIC HERALD"},{"Title":"RITUAL DEATH (FATHER MARK TOWNSEND)","review":"A Jesuit priest visitiing a Northwest Indian Reservation? The opportunites for an interesting and compelling background to this novel are clear: a cultural diversity, a mysterious Indian clan and its death and adulhood rituals, the economic tenuousness of a commercial fishing reservation, and the prejudices and distances of the inhabitants of smalltown America.No matter how exotic the background, the plot of the novel contains some comfortingly familiar techniques: murder, greed and economic pillage, drugs, smuggling, hidden treasure, a precocious child, mistaken identity, and successful unravelling of the mystery through common sense and deductive reasoning.It all combines in an interesting way to spend your mystery-reading time: A Ritual Death is well written and set in a fascinating place and culture.

It is amazing that a substance that breaks down into only air and water can really replace many of the more toxic mood elevating agents in our culture. It's traces are gone after an hour and it's also unimaginably safer, and more valuable, than you think after hearing the lies the media tells about it.

That definitely sucks that people get raped but when in a place where your drink is vulnerable to being contaminated you need to keep a careful eye on it if it is exposed or most definitely do not return to it after you have walked away. That is why experimenting with any substance is much more safe and fun in a good and known environment based on fully informed decisions with trusted people. It is much better to be in total control of the situation unlike at a BAR or a CLUB. I cannot believe the ignorance of some people who after a tragic experience, direct all of their anger over something that could have been prevented, towards a completely uninformed judgement. GHB SHOULD NEVER EVER BE COMBINED WITH ALCOHOL. WHEN USED BY ITSELF IT HAS MANY POSITIVE EFFECTS IF USED UNDER 3 SPECIFIC GUIDELINES.1. You must know how much GHB you are taking.2.

Not only is GHB a mood enhancer, it also helps others who have trouble sleeping get a full nights rest, due to it putting you into a deep REM stage of sleep, REM (Rapid Eye Movement - deepest stage of sleep, AKA a dream stage), but if you are also athletic, it causes the pituitary gland in the brain to secrete HGH (Human Growth Hormone), which has a variety of benefits, including but not limited to, a younger appearance, fat loss, and if you happen to have thinning hair, or hair loss, it will thicken it's growth.However, because of mean spirited people in this world, they end up ruining it for everyone else. People, I happen to have sleeping problems, and now that GHB has been removed from health food stores (which, at one time you could purchase it under many different names, such as Blue Nitro, Renewtrient, Solar Water, etc.), I, along with others, now have to do without, and suffer, because this natural, organic, zero calorie substance is now considered a 'date rape drug'. I have been to a sleep specialist, and under current laws, GHB (now only marketed as Xyrem by Orphan Medical) is a Schedule III substance (only available with a prescription) is now only approved for people who happen to suffer from Cataplexy. People with Narcolepsy are only approved drugs such as Ambien, Lunesta, or stimulants such as Provigil, which I have tried all of the mentioned and they do nothing for me.To all of the mean spirited people who decided to use this substance as a 'date rape drug', you should be ashamed of yourselves, but I know you are not.

I have personally seen people freak out unessecarily and go to the ER when someone can't be woken after ingesting GHB. Sure, safety is important, but it's also important not to waste the time of paramedics with false alarms that can be prevented through education.One other reference to this terribly misguided post:&quot;Ugly starts looking pretty good after a capful of GHB.&quot; Also not true. At a certain dose, GHB makes you feel drunk, but does not affect judgement and perception centers quite like alcohol. The buzz leaves you with more cognitive abilites than alcohol until you're ready to pass out. Everything seems like more fun, including sex, but I've never seen it influence someone to have sex with someone they normally wouldn't.I know what I'm talking about because over a liter of the stuff has been consumed by myself and my friends over the course of a couple of years, and the only people that have had problems with it were the ones not educated about it.1. Only do it with the right setting (no driving, period, and be near a bed),2. the right dosing (it's all about body weight, and women in particular should start with half or less of a regular dose),3. and the right people (understanding, open minded and educated on the effects).As with all substances, this is not for everyone, but it shouldn't be banned from everyone."},{"Title":"GHB: The Natural Mood Enhancer","review":"My perspective on the reviewers and the book. Can GHB be used in rape - yes. Does it cause people to rape other people - no. Can any CNS depressant be used for that purpose? Yes. Are they? Yes. Are they used much more frequently than GHB? Yes. Which is used most frequently for such egregious purposes? Alcohol. Is there anything novel about GHB in this capacity? No.Here is my analogy, should we remove flashlights from the world because someone can hit people with them? No. Flashlights have their appropriate uses. Flashlights don't make people hit other people with flashlights.Is the drug a miracle cure for everything? No. Is it a mood enhancer? That has never been established so the title is misleading. Does the drug have potential benefit for other conditions? Yes. Should those conditions be evaluated before others say it works for that condition? Yes. Just because it \`worked' for someone doesn't mean that it could hurt someone else with the same condition. The drug has been shown to be very beneficial and safe for people with narcolepsy.There is some decent review of the science history of GHB in this book but the conclusions are speculative. My conclusions, if you want to get \\"drunk\\" - go have some good tequila. If you want to sleep better, work on your sleep hygiene. If you want to rape someone, go to hell and stay there.

I have incorporated GHB into my life and have been using it for years. It has immensly increased my quality of health in ways that are too many to list. You only know second or third party accounts of GHB related incidents; just like any other drug there are contraindications for taking it.

(And I verified it was long before I fooled with it)I made it, used it and then watched the media frenzy & the BS reports in the news years later.I have no doubt that GHB is very, very safe when used responsibly.The problem is out of control teenagers who are already drunk taking 5 x the normal dosage. And, they pass out.I guess so. Drink a quart of whiskey when you are already drunk and you will pass out too.Were it not illegal, I would probably still use it occasionally. Its a good relaxant. And it can put you to sleep if you have insomina like I do. The problem is it puts you out for 4 hours and then you wake up. I want/need more than 4 hours sleep so I would have to take another dose to get 4 more hours.So for those worried that if your teenager took GHB, if its going to kill them. Its not.The biggest danger is not GHB, its from the police who think anyone who uses it is a date rapist.Oh and another thing. Its not odorless or tasteless and nobody can slip it into your drink without you knowing except maybe with a REALLY, REALLY salty type drink.Is it addicitive ? I think it probably could be just as beer could be if you drink enough of it every day for months on end.The bottom line for me is its not worth risking going to jail over it but its something that I strongly believe shouldnt be a crime for adults.Thats a war that will never be won though.

I think GHB is as safe as the authors maintain, and that highly diluted solutions of pure GBL are also ok to consume (but I haven't had good similar experiences with BD). The reason I think this book is dated and hopeless is because GHB has been far too demonized in the US to ever safely be restored to anything resembling legality. It will never even make it as a prescription drug in the US because it's too easy to make, and no American pharmaceutical company will pioneer distribution of something they can't trademark as their own. The FDA operate in unison with the pharmaceutical giants who spend 60% of their monetary resources purely on market research. Modern day market research has an air of respectability that will not acknowledge a drug (or substance) that has been so blighted in the media. The FDA know this and are on too much of a bureaucratic budget to investigate any drug with potential only as a generic prescription item. The only time the FDA act fast is when their star-chambers outlaw something, or giant corporate pied pipers knock at the door.

This book is a great read. I had trouble putting it down! The author is a professor of literature and makes an apology for stepping outside her field (of literature) to write a book about plastic surgery, but it is PRECISELY her background that makes this book so wonderful.The topic is well-researched and yet presented in layman's terms and the stats and facts are nothing but mind blowing. She makes references to Frankenstein, which prompted me to go read THAT classic and she's right; we're now formed by society's impressions of our physical appearance (which is the link to Victor Frankenstein's monster).If you think about this, it's rather insane. When people's appearance is improved, they're treated better by society and that gives them more self-confidence and inner peace.

Blum takes the reader into the minds of the individuals influenced by cosmetic surgery. Blum is an English Professor at the University of Kentucky and she became a victim of the cosmetic surgery craze when she was a teenager. Blum writes a very intriguing book about how cosmetic surgery captivates the interests of patients. She points out that society has taken to the fascination of cosmetic surgery, due to the fixation on celebrities. Celebrities stand as a two-dimensional image, where society looks to celebrities for body images. Celebrities are also looking elsewhere for body images too. Society is slowly turning into a unified body mold. Basically society is going to one day be seperated by groups of body types. Society is losing the individual identity that has supported our cultures for years. Flesh Wounds contributes to an understanding of why society is so focused on the outter appearences. Today, society is based on two negative aspects, that is whether a person is attractive or unattractive. Beauty does not make a person more intelligent, nor does not being beautify make a person less intelligent.

In one poem (not in this collection) Barth refers to the epigram as the guerilla's small arms fire, and Barth is an accomplished marksman. As is true of his earlier work, these poems are humane, anti-establishment, ironic, sometimes bitter, and witty.

Though these drawings were a bit dated - Jean's dad wears horn rimmed glasses, Jean and the other girls wear long skirts and saddle oxfords to school - so is the book! Keeping these 1950s-esque illustrations would just seem appropriate for a book that is so quintessentially 1950s. Without these illustrations, a first-time reader would think that this book was about Jehovah's witnesses, what with Jean and her sister making their own clothes, the high school sewing class for girls and the lavishness of going out for Cokes. With the recent return of retro, it's amazing that the publishers didn't opt with including the old illustrations. The same goes for the new editions of \\"Fifteen\\" and \\"Sister of the Bride\\" - both Beverly Cleary books that were given the same treatment.

It all started when Johnny asked her to dance at a local school party. Jean was amazed that he had actually asked her. Jean found out that Johnny went to the same school as her and they started hanging out together. Johnny would wait for Jean after classes and go out to lunch with her. Jean started liking him and asked him to the dance. He canceled because, supposedly, his grandmother was very sick. Jean knew that he didn't want to go with her, so she asked his best friend. Johnny ended up going to the dance with another girl and Jean felt that his friend was much better than he was.I liked this book because it shows what a real teenager goes through when they like a boy. It shows how they get nervous whenever a phone rings. It shows that they cringe when their father talks about a specific boy. I like the way it shows her perspective of how life works and goes into detail about what she's thinkning.This book is a great way to learn how other people think and feel.My favorite part of the book is when Jean dumps Johnny for Homer. Even though Homer is the best looking and is really shy, Jean looks past that. She doesn't go only looks and she likes his personality. Also, when they are at the dance and she tells Johnny, \\"Wonder drugs? Im so glad your grandmother is feeling better.\\" I think it takes a lot of pride to say that and that's why I admire Jean."},{"Title":"Jean and Johnny.","review":"I'm 35, &amp; have read this book many times since childhood. I loved Jean's likable awkwardness, her loving and supportive family, her tight relationship with an even more awkward best friend.

There's a definite edginess to the writing that I haven't seen elsewhere: Johnny is portrayed as a vain, shallow jerk...but in the end not only does he go unpunished &amp; unguilty for his selfishness, but Jean still carries a torch!

I noticed that even an adult reader would be wondering whether the gorgeous Johnny really &quot;liked&quot; Jean, or was merely one with a big ego. (I'll not spoil the story by saying which was the case.) I smiled in nostalgic, if bittersweet, recognition when, for example, Jean searched the dictionary for the definition of &quot;cute.&quot;Fortunately, the book was written in the last days of when a conceited type could be taken at face value.

Sadly, she can't place her finger on it, all she can say is that she can feel that something nice will happen. And it does. Jean is simply accompanying her best friend, Elaine Mundy, and her mother to the local country club to drop off holiday decorations, when Jean is picked out of the crowd by a tall, handsome boy and asked to dance. And so kicks off a whirlwind adventure. While Jean does not get the boy's name, Elaine is determined to find him again, and seeks him out at school where he begins speaking to Jean on a regular basis, and making her feel special. Jean absolutely adores the attention that she's receiving, but she can't help but question it at times. After all, Johnny is a seventeen-year-old senior who is tall and handsome, and could easily have his pick of any girl at Northgate High, yet he seems genuinely interested in Jean. Short, ungraceful, glasses-wearing Jean, who can't sew a skirt together evenly, and spends her Friday and Saturday nights fantasizing about the slightly musically inept TV star, Kip Laddish, and writing to her pen pals across the world. However, as the school year progresses, Johnny seems to pay even more attention to Jean. He goes out of his way to meat her in the school hallways, calls on her to go to the drive-in for a Coke, invites her to hang out with him and his friends during lunch, and even attempts to come around to her house on the weekends to hang out with her and her folks. Jean can't help but believe that Johnny really does like her, but Jean's older sister, Sue, seems slightly skeptical. Jean is sure that Sue is simply jealous because no boys ever come calling for her. But, as Jean continues to learn more about Johnny, she begins to wonder if Sue isn't correct. Maybe Johnny doesn't feel as strongly towards her as she thought. But as long as he's spending time pursuing her, Jean feels inclined to savor each and every moment with Johnny.With the amount of racy books on the market nowadays, it's a wonderful feeling to have the opportunity to go back to basics, and relive the nostalgia and innocence of a simpler time, when girls spent their afternoons sewing and baking, and going out to eat at a restaurant was a big deal that happened on very rare occasions. And that is what readers are treated to with Beverly Cleary's JEAN AND JOHNNY. Jean is such an adorable character, whose awkwardness is charming, and really brings her tale to life. The tight-knit relationship she experiences with her parents, and her older sister, Sue, is adorable, and is such a pleasure to read about in a sea of novels filled with teenagers who do nothing but bicker with their parents, and share rivalries with their siblings. The hard-time's that seem to plague Jean's family, while bittersweet, are also quite enjoyable to read about, as they illustrate the meaning of a penny, and the hardships that people fell upon during this particular era, when scrimping and saving was a way of life. Johnny is perfect as the cad-like big man on campus, whose ego is large, and love of himself is slightly laughable. Even as the hunk-esque character, however, Johnny is likable, in a slightly obnoxious way, who will appeal to readers of all ages. A throwback to a simpler time that bridges the gap between generations.Erika SoroccoFreelance Reviewer"},{"Title":"Jean and Johnny.","review":"Beverly Cleary is a giant in Children's Literature, & has been for the past few generations. Whether a person has read her Runaway Ralph series, grew up with Ramona, or delved into her teen romances such as the one I'm about to review, it's no mistake that her fiction has a timeless quality. Of course, some may be put off from reading this book because of the title itself, Jean & Johnny are two names which aren't quite so common anymore, couple that with details relating to Jean's economic background e.g. having to sew her own clothes, prices at the stores & drive-in, & it obviously dates itself a bit.What makes it timeless is how Cleary keeps you engaged with the character, one many young girls can remember being. They were all fifteen once, or at one point felt very unsure of themselves. They were interested in boys, but didn't have the confidence, or felt themselves appealing at all to the opposite sex.* Pop stars were their idols, & this shared interest was a great way to bond with their friends.In Jean's case, she's an awkward young girl, who has a best friend name Elaine & they share each other's company. But after sneaking into a dance, Jean is invited, to her surprise, to dance with the most popular, handsomest boy in the school, Johnny. This changes her entire outlook of herself, because she doesn't see why a boy like Johnny would pay any attention to her. So, Elaine & she begin their efforts to make Jean noticed by Johnny to find out why he likes her, if he does at all.What I liked most about the book is how it teaches you that you must value yourself & not depend upon the attention of others for self-esteem, how you should listen to your elders, especially in this case her sister Sue who is a little older & wiser, & how you should remember who has always been there for you, such as your dear friends, even after you start dating. Most importantly, it teaches a young reader that the exterior is only one aspect of a human, that they must pay attention to the behavior of a person to tell their true character & feelings.*I'm not intending this to be heterosexist."},{"Title":"Jean and Johnny.","review":"I love this book!

Jean would be the Molly Ringwald character, the studly Johnny would be the guy played by Andrew Mccarthy or Rob Lowe or Emilio Estevez, and johnny's cute-in-a-dorky-way pal would be the character played by someone like Matthew Broderick or Jon Cryer, or, most likely, Anthony Michael Hall"},{"Title":"The tenth man;: The great joke (which made Lazarus laugh)","review":"The author's cryptic, aphoristic style in short expositions and dialogues of not longer than several pages at a time will challenge and then stop the mind. I can only describe the state induced as one of tension...a feeling that there is just a thin veil separating one from Profound Understanding that, while thin, is very difficult to penetrate. However, with perseverence, intuition may reveal to you what words can never convey. But words can point you in the right direction and few authors I have come across do this as skillfully. I regard all his books as classics that are at the top of my shelf, so to speak. Fans of Douglas Harding, Tony Parsons, zen, advaita, Ramana Maharshi, taoism will probably agree with me. But if they don't, that's fine too."},{"Title":"The tenth man;: The great joke (which made Lazarus laugh)","review":"It might be a little more immediate to get hit in the head with certain shamanic herbs...but if language can do damage to the matrix's sleep, this book should do it for you.

If you get it and it isn't, hey...what have you lost? lol Be warned: &quot;Heavy Deconstruction.&quot;"},{"Title":"The tenth man;: The great joke (which made Lazarus laugh)","review":"The Tenth Man (like the superior Ask the Awakened) is a collection of short essays, poetry and dialogues expressing Wei Wu Wei's profound understanding of Ch'an, Taoist and Advaita philosophies.The writing is abstruse, uncompromising and very challenging at times.For sure there is insight to be found. But too often the cleverness gets in the way."},{"Title":"The tenth man;: The great joke (which made Lazarus laugh)","review":"This book by Wei Wu Wei is one of those abstract writing from this famous author and student of Advaita,Tao and Buddhism that should be read and contemplated upon very slowly.He draws heavily from Bhagavan Ramana of Thiruvannamalai or Thiru and for those familiar with Ramana's teaching, this book refreshes their memory/understanding.If you are not familiar with Ramana's teaching, read some other books [such as those by Paul Brunton or Arthur Osborne] before touching this book.If you have specific doubts on Ramana's methods [such as \\"who am I \\" enquiry] this book can help to clarify such doubts....For casual reading , who knows, one line in this book may trigger deep thoughts.An essential book for those deeply involved in Advaita----either classical Indian tradition or \\"satsangh\\" circuit neo-advaitins!"},{"Title":"The tenth man;: The great joke (which made Lazarus laugh)","review":"Five stars pretty much says it all.

To be sure the insights in this book may seem difficult to get at, but insights are not the point of Wei Wu Wei's books.

Whether you think you have it all figured or not, this book is sure to open your eyes."},{"Title":"Leaves from the notebook of a tamed cynic","review":"Reinhold Niebuhr's small book, Leaves from the Notebook of a Tamed Cynic, is perhaps his most famous and popular book. It has informed and helped to shape the lives and ministries of seminarians, educators, ministers and other prophetic and ethical people since it was first published early in this century. Niebuhr recounts with astonishing honesty the difficulties facing those who would do ministry, and act ethically, in the church today. His criticism is not held back from any sacred topics.\`I make no apology for being critical of what I love. No one wants a love which is based upon illusions, and there is no reason why we should not love a profession and yet be critical of it.'Niebuhr talks about the shock of coming to realise the limitations of his ministry, going from being a fresh-from-seminary full-of-grace minister to a person confronting another person in the 'real world'. He talks about\`...the difficulty of acting as priest. It is not in your power to determine the use of a symbol. Whether it is a blessing or a bit of superstition rests altogether with the recipient.'This real world also presents problems. Parishioners tend to ask practical questions, rather than theoretical ones. They ask, Why won't Jesus heal me? Didn't he heal others? It is in the Bible, after all.\`I do believe that Jesus healed people. I can't help but note, however, that a large proportion of his cures were among the demented.'He talks about the practical limitations of doing ethical ministry and prophesy for the average pulpit preacher.\`I am not surprised that most prophets are itinerants. Critics of the church think we preachers are afraid to tell the truth because we are economically dependent upon the people of our church. There is something in that....'Finally, Niebuhr comes to have realistic expectations of the church and his own ministry in it.\`The church is like the Red Cross service in war time. It keeps life from degenerating into a consistent inhumanity, but it does not materially alter the fact of the struggle itself. The Red Cross neither wins the war nor abolishes it.'Niebuhr in this small work has given great insight. Barely 150 short pages of his journal from 1915-1928 as a parish minister--although he became much better known as a philosopher in later years, this book is most likely his best seller, and the one with the most profound day-to-day impact for his readers.A must-read for anyone with a calling to ministry; a should-read for anyone in a helping and caring profession. It gives insight into how to remain human and fallible in the face of a congregation's (and one's own!) expectations of holiness and godly perfection."},{"Title":"Leaves from the notebook of a tamed cynic","review":"It's too easy for us young ministers to dismiss a book that was originally published in 1929. This book drove from me the tendency to do so-forever, I hope.A series of journal entries dating from 1915 through 1928, &quot;Leaves From the Notebook of a Tamed Cynic&quot; details a young minister's struggles, both inward and outward. Although there is some material that is somewhat irrelevant (mostly due to the fact that we are not experiencing the Great War at the moment), the vast majority of this little book hit home for me, a 22 year-old pastor just starting in ministry.You are likely to lose count of the number of times you think, &quot;I know that feeling!&quot; while reading &quot;Leaves.&quot; Join Niebuhr as he analyzes denominational systems, his parishoners, and ultimately...himself. Empathize with the cynicism of a young pastor struggling to make a difference. Come to realize that we have more in common with our older counterparts than we think.Perhaps the most important of the many lessons found in &quot;Leaves&quot; is that as he grew in experience and age, he came to know himself, his people, and his God better. Reading this book was a step on that same road for me."},{"Title":"Leaves from the notebook of a tamed cynic","review":"This little gem was probably my favorite book from seminary. Niebuhr takes you with him on the difficult journey through the first years of his parish ministry and teaches you how to think theologically about really practical dilemmas that arise as a clergyperson. My favorite thing about the book is that it is not written as a memoir, but in the moment, so you don't have an old, brilliant theologian reflecting on his years in ministry, but rather a young, brilliant pastor who doesn't know all the answers and doesn't pretend to. I feel like Reinhold has become a close friend though the end of seminary and my first year working in the church, because he gives words to and insight into many of the struggles I have had."},{"Title":"Leaves from the notebook of a tamed cynic","review":"In this marvelous book, which has graced my library for more than forty years, Professor Niebuhr shows himself as a young pastor who grows into his Detroit working &quot;man's&quot; parish. He courageously confronts his struggles, inward and outward.He writes with a wit that I didn't always find in his more explicitly theological writings. I particularly identified with an early observation, &quot;It is easier to speak sagely from the pulpit than to act wisely in the detailed tasks of the parish.&quot;Another early observation shows him realizing what most of us must experience in our youthful ministries, when he speaks of repeating himself in the pulpit, noting, &quot;A prophet speaks only when he is inspired. The parish preacher mus speak whether he he is inspired or not. I wonder whether it is possible to live on a high enough plane to do that without sinning against the Holy Spirit.&quot;I would whole-heartedly recommend this book for any young pastor."},{"Title":"Leaves from the notebook of a tamed cynic","review":"This is a collection of Neibuhrs short essays. Each one stands on its own as a reflection of reality as applicable today as it was decades ago. I like it so much I am rationing it, reading one or two essays a day and stopping to think about the lesson in each one. These are sermons that are not \\"preachy\\" recognizing the human frailities and what should be expected of us. A book for the ages in my opinion"},{"Title":"Leaves from the notebook of a tamed cynic","review":"I am a HUGE Niebuhr fan, and I strong suggest that anyone interested in politics, economics, social philosophy and/or theology should pick up as many of his works as possible. This book was a real treat for me, to get into peer into his mind in those oh so important formative years as a pastor in Detroit, WOW!Even when he's just writing random thoughts on the passing scene, he's a fantastic writer. Here you have a demonstration of Bonhoeffer's views of the true Christian life which must \\"share in the problems of secular life, and teach all men what it means to live in Christ\\". You see the greater and greater emphasis on the role of repentence and the way Christ's oh so rigorous ethic acts as a judgment on all human behavior as time goes on. This will all become so important as he turns his mind to writing his great theological and social works in the 30's and 40's.This book is a fairly easy read, none to technical, and relatively short, you can probably read it in 3 or 4 sittings. Pay attention to the way Niebuhr's doubts about his own position become theological fare, informing the way he thinks about theology and life in toto."},{"Title":"Leaves from the notebook of a tamed cynic","review":"This book gave me hope when I had almost lost it. I came to the end of my seminary education and I was ready to throw in the towel. Once you're on the inside of the church, once you necessarily lose all those false illusions about what ministry is really about, you may find you don't have the stomach for it. I look at the church, and how slow things change, and I wonder if there is any hope at all. Niebuhr honestly lays out his own transition from green seminarian to seasoned pastor of hope and grace, radical, but real. It was a breath of grace and peace...just what I needed."},{"Title":"Leaves from the notebook of a tamed cynic","review":"This is the most accessible Niebuhr you're going to find.

Ausmus,The Pragmatic God (American University Studies. Series VII. Theology and Religion), a book that, strangely, has been universally ignored by scholars in history, philosophy, and religion. Ausmus contends that the logical consequence of Niebuhr's thought is nihilism, a rather serious charge to lodge against a Christian theologian and preacher.Why has this work, published in 1990, been ignored?I suspect that Niebuhr scholars and others fear that accepting the challenge to examine Ausmus' thesis may just disclose some nihilism in their thought."},{"Title":"Leaves from the notebook of a tamed cynic","review":"I enjoyed this title very much.

Not for a quick, easy read."},{"Title":"Forensic Neuropathology and Neurology","review":"I bought this book primarily to use as a reference textbook. After reading the first few pages, I had to finish reading it from cover to cover. It is a fascinating, up to date textbook on practical issues faced by the forensic neuropathologist/neurologist. Every page exudes the vast experience of the authors, e.g. identifying the victim, process of dying,German theories of causation. To boast, it is copiously illustrated with color figures and Tables. The Tables are loaded with practical information, e.g. handling different types of tissue specimens. It is an edifying books that makes you feel proud of your chosen profession."},{"Title":"Forensic Neuropathology and Neurology","review":"I and three of my colleagues have purchased this book through Amazon.

But in concentrating on touchy-feely journalism, Boetig has uncovered important points about human relationships within writing in general. Knowing what an editor is likely to want, what is going to fire her excitement or rouse her anger, is a vital component for a jobbing writer, and one which so many ignore. As an editor, I have been reduced to abject rage by writers who give no thought to the needs of the magazine or of the reader, and dumbfounded by their inability to learn from what is done to their pieces in the editing process. Boetig, on the other hand, places great emphasis on the editor's mind-set, the target audience of a piece, and learning from one's mistakes. Her 39 Things Editors Like should be set in stone, and her comments on phone etiquette, interview technique and fact-checking would have saved many a writer (myself included) a few blushes. Although at times she is reinventing the wheel (why have an epilogue, when you can have a \\"postlude\\"...?), sometimes revisiting old favourites can pay off - there are quite a few professional foreheads to which I would dearly love to staple Boetig's simple guidelines on structuring a feature, no matter what the genre."},{"Title":"Feminine Wiles: Creative Techniques for Writing Women's Feature Stories that Sell","review":"I'm a frequent reader of non-fiction writing how-to books, but this one is far and away the best I've read in YEARS. The author writes in an intimate, tell-all tone that makes you feel as if you are sitting at a coffee shop, and discussing the secret &quot;ins&quot; of writing for the women's magazine market with a mentor who has not only climbed, but reached the top of the feature writing rope. She offers invaluable information I've found no where else, and she explores her topics with entertaining anecdotes culled from her own 20 years of experience as a top women's mag. freelancer. As a reader/student, I felt privy to this author's most hard-won advice. I don't consider myself a beginning writer, and this book offers far more than most writing texts provide. It's a bridge for the intermediate, or more experienced freelancer who may have published pieces in some smaller mags, but wants to cross the line and make it into the &quot;big time&quot; better paying markets. I can't recommend it highly enough. Wish I could personally meet and thank the author."},{"Title":"Feminine Wiles: Creative Techniques for Writing Women's Feature Stories that Sell","review":"I've read tons of books on the craft and business of writing, but this is by far the best.

The typeface is almost painful to read, typos occur on just about every other page, and the layout is amateurish, as if this were a beginning designer's first experience with QuarkXpress.

While his opinions may be viewed as somewhat eurocentric, much of the history of the western method of war is europian based, and this historical perspective is necessary in order to understand the invariate human reaction to combat tactics.His findings in this book are less contraversial than those of &quot;Civil War Battle Tactics&quot;, but both books display brilliant insight and are well worth reading."},{"Title":"Forward into Battle: Fighting Tactics from Waterloo to the Near Future","review":"Paddy Griffith spent a decade and a half lecturing officer cadets at Sandhurst on tactics, and this book shows why.After a brief introduction, an outdated narrative with the USSR attacking NATO, the book settles into four case studies.The first study is that of firepower vs shock in the period 1808-1815, the Napoleonic wars, including the War of 1812. Griffith shows that earlier theories about the British lining up and pouring massed musketry into the French were wrong. Instead the British would use fire to disrupt the French long enough for a charge to be delivered. As an addition, Griffith studies a failure of the British system at New Orleans, showing that the rifle made effectively no contribution on the American side beyond sniping a single Colonel.The second study covers the period 1815-1915 and asks whether the empty battlefield was a new phenmemon. In particular there are studies of whether the rifle caused a revolution in warfare during the American Civil War (later expanded into his book \\"Battle Tactics of the Civil War\\") and the French Army in 1914.The third covers the relationship between Armour and Infantry, making a forceful argument that Armour did not replace Infantry. Parts of this chapter were later expanded into \\"Battle Tactics of the Western Front\\".The fourth covers the Vietnam War and make another forceful argument that the Vietnamese simply outfought the allies on the ground, and achieved their objectives much more frequently than the allies. It is generally scathing of the US reliance on technology, and points out that the North Vietnamese were generally the tactical initiators and held the initiative. It also makes a forceful argument that what the allies needed was more tanks and heavy weapons to support the infantry instead of inaccurate artillery and airpower.The final chapter deals with various changes in war since Vietnam.In general the book is easy to follow, and it's arguments persuesive, and fully referenced. It is a book about the tactics adopted by a few scared men under fire rather and how the nature of war at a personal level has changed rather than a book on grand strategy.If the Commandant General requires all his Majors to read this book who am I to argue?"},{"Title":"Forward into Battle: Fighting Tactics from Waterloo to the Near Future","review":"Paddy Griffith argues that the importance of firepower has been overestimated relative to shock action. For instance, Griffith contends that Wellington's army was successful not simply because of its volley fire but more importantly from the subsequent charge. He argues that at New Orleans poor troops lacking discipline failed to take a fortified line that good troops could have taken. He details the rise of light infantry through the 1800s. Then he shows that the shock action of brief artillery bombardments and stormtrooper tactics broke through the trenches of World War I. With every technological advance and increase in firepower, people have prophesied an \\"empty battlefield\\" and neglected shock at their peril."},{"Title":"Forward into Battle: Fighting Tactics from Waterloo to the Near Future","review":"This is an incredibly bad book.Paddy Griffith has a universal theory of tactics: you charge straight at the enemy, displaying your bravery. This causes the people on the other side get scared and run away. He also has a historical agenda: to convince people that British generals of the First World War such as Field Marshall Sir Douglas, Earl Haig, were not incompetent butchers, madmen, and liars.Alas, the theory of tactics isn't true, and neither is the agenda. People in combat only get scared when they think they might get hurt. Even when they're scared, they frequently stick around and fight. As a result, a lot of people get hurt, or killed. As for WWI generalship, most British commanders were unfit to command anything.But if Griffith dealt with these facts in a straightforward way, he'd have to explain that hundreds of thousands of British soldiers in WWI were REPEATEDLY ordered to march slowly toward the the enemy, creating not fear but just a large target, dying for nothing. Apparently this truth is too painful for him to acknowledge.So instead, we get fantasy. In chapter two, for example, Griffith tells us that Wellington's troops typically fired their muskets at the enemy for the sole purpose of making a loud noise, did one volley only, then walked forward shouting and waving their bayonets in the air. Supposedly,this display panicked their opponents, despite the fact that no one had actually been hurt (Well, after all, they were only frenchmen, what would you expect?).As evidence of this, Griffith shows the British officers arguing over what ammunition was the most effective (p42), but discounting mere noise as ineffective (p 25 & 27); presents data from 19 battles, in which AT LEAST 74% (14/19) featured more than one musket volley (p39); quotes eyewitnesses saying British musketry \\"carried destruction into the heart of the French line (p36),\\" or \\"produced a commencement of carnage and destruction (p18);\\" and by showing several cases where muskets alone broke the French (p23 & 25), but none where the redcoats used noise and swagger alone.What, you say that evidence completely contradicts Griffith's claim of harmless scare tactics? Congratulations, you can read! Apparently, Griffith can't.Such nonsense continues throughout the book. In Ch. 3, Griffith claims that battlefields from 1808 to 1915 were really much like WWII, with soldiers trying to be invisible, and anonymous firefights the order of the day. Thus, everyone could reasonably expect that the tactics of WWI would be rather like the tactics of the Napoleonic Wars. Aside from the fact that it completely contradicts the claims of Ch. 2, it's also false. In Ch. 4 we find out that tanks are almost harmless, and that what was really important in WWI was the new infantry tactics developed by all armies 'after the begining of the Battle of the Somme.' This contradicts ch. 3, and is also inaccurate (the new tactics were developed by the Germans in 1915, with the Allies acting later; tanks were what won the war for the Allies). In ch. 5, we hear how ineffective USAmerican technology was in Viet Nam, compared to N. Vietnamese guts. This undoubtedly explains why the U.S. won every battle, the Viet Cong guerillas were wiped out, and S. Viet Nam was conquered in 1975 by an armored force with more tanks than Hitler used to invade Russia.And btw, although Griffith frequently cites original sources, he does so unreliably. When I checked some of them, they often said quite different things then Griffith wants you to believe they said. But that's not surprising, considering how often the evidence he reprints contradicts his own judgements.We've only scratched the surface of Griffith's misrepresentations, but I don't have space to refute every page of the book. It's a pity, really. Griffith has read, or at least looked at, a great deal of material on tactics and combat. There are times it looks like he might have very interesting and important things to say about men in battle, if he allowed himself to think clearly. As it is, the only useful part of the book is the notes and bibliography. You can learn some truths about tactics from the information there. Pity that Griffith didn't."},{"Title":"Forward into Battle: Fighting Tactics from Waterloo to the Near Future","review":"The content lives up to the cover review & genuinely covers material not readily found elsewhere.Four more words no not now."},{"Title":"Forward into Battle: Fighting Tactics from Waterloo to the Near Future","review":"Following the techniques originated by John Keegan in \\"The Face of Battle: A Study of Agincourt, Waterloo, and the Somme\\", Paddy Griffith analyzes a series of battles from Waterloo to Vietnam to determine what really happened as opposed to what was reported to have happened. Seldom do the two agree. He concludes that despite 150 years of technological development, it is the willingness of the individual soldier to close with the enemy that determines the final outcome of most engagements. The tool for this risky business in the past was the bayonet; in recent times, it has become the grenade. Mr. Griffith has much to say, unfortunately, the book is not well known and seldom read by professional warriors."},{"Title":"The Horse Soldier","review":"I really liked this book. It was just a plain, good story as well as a non-typical romance. It is even somewhat unusual for a historical western romance. It takes place a few years after the end of Civil War at a fort in the upper Midwest plains.Major Andrew Garrett was a Union soldier sent undercover to New Orleans during the Civil War. While in New Orleans, he met and married Julia Robichard. Within days of their marriage, Andrew departed New Orleans to report his findings and planned to return for his bride. Instead, his identity is discovered and he is eventually sent to a Confederate prison camp. Meanwhile, Julia's uncle has their marriage annulled and she is banished and sent away. When Julia reaches her new home with a broken heart - believing Andrew used her for his Union activities - she meets a man and marries quickly. Now years later, she is looking for her husband who has proven to be a gambler and has gone west seeking fortune. She and her eight-year-old daughter are penniless and have nowhere to turn. So they head west as well and end up at an Army fort in Montana Territory.Major Garrett now is second in command at the Montana fort. He believes that is still married to Julia. Andrew has no knowledge of the annulment and believes Julia betrayed him as well. Their reunion is bitter but both soon discover that neither betrayed the other. They also realize their love for each other has not died. This is a precious story of a wonderful man who takes care of a seemingly helpless woman and her daughter under harsh living conditions. Although a portion of the story hinges on finding Julia's husband, a larger part of the story concerns the daughter and her initial rejection of Andrew. She wants her father and believes Andrew is somehow in the way. It is heart rending to read of her actions towards him and his attempts to gain her acceptance. But the most action in the book is the love relationship between Andrew and Julia. It is a mature relationship that recognizes responsibility. Although both leads are hardheads and a bit belligerent, they also have very tender moments. Both the hero and heroine are well-written and likable characters. Lovelace doesn't have to resort to the usual romance misunderstanding ploys. Her characters relate to each other truthfully.The realism of frontier life is very well written. Even as a history buff, I learned many things about 19th century Army life and recalled some of the sadder facts of the Indian uprisings. Actual famous Native Americans and white men are included in the background of the story. While this book is well written, romantic, and historically interesting, it also contains some good sexual chemistry. The sensual scenes rate about a 4.0 out of 5.0 (see More About Me for rating guidelines).This is my first Lovelace book and it certainly will not be my last. At this very moment, I am going to visit Amazon and conduct a search for more of her books."},{"Title":"The Horse Soldier","review":"In 1867, Major Andrew Garrett and his troops just return to their home station at Fort Laramie, Dakota Territory after a dangerous patrol. Upon his arrival, Andrew hears the ruckus going on between a wagonmaster and his wife over a single woman traveling with them, accompanied only by her five-year-old daughter. To his shock, Andrew sees his wife Julia Robichard, &quot;the Belle of New Orleans&quot; causing the friction.Upon noticing Andrew, Julia faints. She thought he died when her uncle shot him for spying for the North. Andrew learns that Julia remarried and is heading to the Montana Territory to find Philip Bonneaux, her spouse and father of her child. However, Julia is stranded by the wagon train and relies on Andrew for help. In spite of his knowing she betrayed him to her uncle and he deceived her about his Northern interests, their love remains strong, but with no hopes for the future.THE HORSE SOLDIER is a powerful western romance staring two interesting characters. The story line provides the audience a taste of Army life on the frontier from the varying perspectives of the soldiers and their wives. Merline Lovelace, known for her entertaining and insightful contemporary military romances gracefully goes historical with her expertise and flourishes by providing fans with an invigorating Americana novel.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Horse Soldier","review":"After looking at the other reviews of this book, I'm wondering if I read the same story!Things I liked about this book:1) Lovelace obviously did some research into the lives and conditions of frontier soldiers/fort life and it shows in the interesting facts woven into the story.2) The plotting was superb. Things moved along at a good pace.Things I DIDN'T like about this tome:1) During this era, an annulment or a divorce was a major humiliation for anyone involved. The fact that Andrew didn't know about the annulment (at some point) is ludicrous. Men held all the cards in these actions; there was no way he would not have been notified during those 6 years.3) He was a military officer - even if he was in prison, he would have been notified as soon as he returned to active service. An officer in the military doesn't just disappear; there are records that could have been consulted, so that he'd have an opportunity to respond to the court action.4) Laundresses were often followers of the camps and forts. They were often whores. There's no way a lady like Julia would have stooped so low. Remember, she had a daughter to consider. Since other work was mentioned at the same time (working in the hospital), a lady would have chosen something that did not smack of loose morals.5) The final solution was so contrived! ALL the pieces fit at the end; how convenient. However, life isn't like that. I thought the author took the easy way and my estimation of her originality dropped through the floor.6) SPOILER: I can't tell you how many stories I've read lately have the (thought-to-be-dead) husband appearing after the 2 main characters are ready to head into the sunset holding hands. Please!7) Lovelace's characters were often one-faceted and the character's growth was stilted or poorly developed. For example: Suzanne hated Andrew through the first of the book. Andrew gives Suzanne a pony; now Andrew is wonderful. How shallow!This is my second book by this author; I doubt there will be a third!"},{"Title":"The Horse Soldier","review":"SHOCK! to both parties involved - She is married to another man - he was her husband, or so he thought.Major Andrew Garrett had just returned from five days on patrol and found the post commander swimming in his usual laudanum-induced stupor.

Caring deeply for someone you love, even to the point of taking on their problems, is not wrong, nor pathological. It's part of what makes us human. Life is hard. Deep companionship, sharing of hardships, deep emotional involvement, feeling each other's pain - Humanity have grappled with these concepts since time immemorial through art, literature, philosophy. Along comes the American \\"Self-movement\\" and declares patly that any level of sacrifice for another is sickness, that one's own happiness is all that counts, and that this happiness exists in your own \\"vacuum\\" independent of the feelings of others close to you. Emotional poison!This book has come to serve as a bible for those who are afraid of intimacy/human interdependence and are looking for moral justification for their continued self-centeredness. To them, I say - toss this garbage, start daring to involve yourself in the lives of others again, love, live - we all need others! You're no different, and Melody Beatty is the shallowest of philosophers. If you have an imperfect, troubled love relationship with an imperfect, troubled human being, welcome to the club. It's called being human.There's nothing wrong with it. Toss this book on the fire, stick out the tough times TOGETHER.

No, we're not helping each other too much; that's, believe me, the least of our worries.Speaking of the past, the concept of &quot;co-dependency&quot; is getting to be a bit of an anachronism. It was a product of the 1980s, the self-help decade. If you want to read a more valuable comment on that era and its &quot;movements&quot; and cult gurus, I recommend &quot;Selling Serenity&quot; by a guy who worked for the publisher who made the self help fads into household expressions.

He was horrific with constant verbal, emotional and sometimes physical abuse, and he wanted to blame it all on me. I lived in fear and torment through my entire marriage, but my abuser said it was my fault for \\"making\\" him angry with my personality and attempts to have my own opinions. He told me I needed to change to be more like him and went to therapy saying I was ruining his life. Unfortunately, his therapist didn't know the truth- that my husband was incredibly demanding, controlling, expecting and abusive. He would wait on me hand and foot, against my wishes, then berate me for hours and hours at a time because nothing I did in return was good enough. He was critical and impossible to please. So, my husband came home with the idea that he was codependent and that he was enabling me to \\"act out.\\" He read this book, and decided that I was the one making him codependent and that I was the one who was abusing him by not giving into his every desire and making him happy enough. Sadly, this led him to abuse and criticize me more, and he now has even more excuse to deny responsibility for his cruel and torturous behavior. Instead of recognizing and stopping his abusive behavior, he decided that, since he was codependent, I must be the corresponding abuser. Never mind my bruises, emotional anguish and fear every time he came home! Maybe there are people who could benefit from this book, but in my case, it caused my abuser to deny his actions and escalate his cruelty. Maybe there are codependent people out there who do allow people to abuse them, but in my case, the man who behaved with some codependent mannerisms was the abuser.

In addition, Melody Beattie, by default, must be the empress of the same. The problem is that this empress is walking around in the nude and no one has the courage to tell her that the magic co-dependent garments she is dressed in and is recommending to you are not really there. She has had a con pulled on her, and it is time for her to see it for what it is.Co-dependent Disorder is not a real emotional disorder never was and never will be- at best the construct is the mad rant and raving of on the wagon substance abusers who have fried their brain cells with drugs and/or boiled them in alcohol and are now trying to tell you how to live your life. Do they really have the answer for your life; I cannot see how they could.To be fair Ms. Beattie is not holding herself out as a mental health professional nevertheless, her book and the others like it are attempting to treat a made-up emotional disorder, which can be very dangerous to the unsuspecting public. The truth is that members of the co-dependent sect hold mental health professionals in very low esteem, which may be because mental health professionals have never embraced the co-dependent construct as a real disorder. I have even read in more than one of the co-dependent cookbooks that mental health professionals do not believe that co-dependent disorder is real due to the fact that they are co-dependent.

Oh well.Codependency is loving and sharing your life with someone who is an alcoholic. It can be for other reasons as I pointed out in the other review. Codependents think and feel responsible for other people, especially their children, for their feelings, hurts wants, needs, well-being, and ultimate destiny.Most of us started doing these things to help others in need out of necessity to protect ourselves and meet out needs. \\"We performed, felt, and thought these things to survive -- emotionally, mentally, and sometimes physically.\\" Sometimes, the things we do to protect ourselves turn on us and hurt us as a result of who the person is -- if he is a loved one. Many professionals say that the first step toward change is awareness. Detachment is the hardest thing you will ever do, as you feel the other person will drown in his distress and destroy his life without you there to guide him.

Each time you read it, you find something new which clicks. The only thing I wish the author would do for her next edition would be to substitute \\"addict\\" for \\"alcoholic.\\" I was reading it based upon my daughter's meth addition and our co-dependent relationship. \\"Alcoholic\\" just rubbed the wrong way and, if Beattie wants this to be a book used for all addictions and their co-dependent aspects, she might want to consider the substitution.

Melody Beattie is the first person to give a name to all the crazy things I had thought and done, me and millions more like me. I never liked the name \\"codependent\\" (it sounds like the woman is mentally ill, rather than suffering the stress effects of living with a man who drinks too much). It was wonderful, however, to know that enough other women suffered all the same problems to merit giving the condition a name.Over the years, it is clear that Melody has grown continued to learn; she has shared that growth and learning with all of us each time she updates her book. I just read \\"Codependent No More\\" again, the last time being maybe 15 years ago. Melody has added so many priceless things, and organized the material so that it has even greater impact.Live Your Own Life! Set Your Own Goals! are segments of this edition that inspire. Especially rich are the new additions that give more information on how to change and rebuild. I've grown too, and written my own book, but no one will ever do it better than Melody Beattie.I strongly recommend that everyone who has ever been fired up by this book now go back and read it again. It will rekindle all of that fire--and more.

I am taking a long time to finish it because it is so deep. It is easy reading, but in order to get much out of it you really have to read it slowly and of course change your wrong behavior, one step at a time. I like the fact that the author tells you that change does take time. It seldom happens overnight. Very comforting for someone who wants to see huge changes overnight. I also like that she encourages you to have a relationship with God. He is the only one whom we are supposed to be codependent with. Eveyone else is imperfect, just like me.."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"This author is one of the most honest, insightful, and thoughtful writers in the world of recovery.

Thanks, Melody!"},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"CODEPENDENT NO MORE is the best self help book I have ever read. It gives a clear insight on how to deal with all types of feelings such as fear, despair, depression, and anger. First the book reveals how to process these feelings rather than denying them and then how to move on to feelings like love, joy, fulfillment, and just feeling okay about yourself in general by giving your life a new spiritual meaning. In her private life, the author has moved from an alcoholic and drug addict, a rape victum, a prostitute/stripper, and finally a welfare recipient to a well adjusted best-selling author and a spiritual advisor. Her life itself is a miracle. She has a way of passing the magic and the spiritual techniques that she used to transform her own life to the lives of her readers. I have read all of her books and I recommend them all. I read her meditation book THE LANGUAGE OF LETTING GO daily with my morning coffee.

It is AWESOME. It really changed my perspective on how I viewed myself. As a matter of fact, it made me realize that I was causing my own problems because I was an enabler. I was in a bad place in my life when I happened to come across this book. In retrospect, it was devine intervention that made me pick it up at the bookstore because it literally changed my life. I am a counselor now and I recommend this book to all my clients. (I also use some of the meditations from The Language of Letting Go, also by Ms. Beattie). I can't say enough about this book. This book is not a \\"fix it all\\" as there is no such thing. People have to WANT to make changes in thier lives and the information Ms. Beattie gives is invaluable. One can take the information and apply it to their own situation. Can't say enough about this book!"},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"Codependency is about more than relationships with alcoholics.

It helped me highlight some of the ways that I live for and through other people, rather than existing through my own experiences. Beattie helped me \\"detach\\" and bring some sanity to a relationship that was making me insane. Some of the personal stories in the book can be a little cumbersome, and I found myself skipping the ones that didn't apply to my personality. Overall though, this book is really insightful and taught me a lot about relationships and the ways I relate to others."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"This book is well written and easy to read. At the end of the chapters are self help questions that help you to stay focused on self. If you are really ready to take a look at yourself and stop living life like you have been doing than this book will help you to accomplish that. It is a process that will take time because these are old habits and they are hard to break. All in all the book is very good if you are ready for change."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"I have been struggling to keep my family in order since I returned home from the military for the last year and a half. After the death of my daughter and my wife's descent back into the trappings of alcoholism I thought that I was doing everything right. I hadn't realized that my behavior was this way, nor had I even heard of codependency until one of our increasingly frequent fights went too far. I sought help. I sought help from marriage counselors, therapists and Al-Anon. My therapist suggested I pick this book up and check it out. I was not disappointed. Although a lot of the book does seem like it focuses on helping the codependent wives of alcoholics, there is just as much support for husbands who fall into the same patterns of servitude to their spouse's disease. I followed the book as closely as possible, worked through the activities and realized that I was making mistakes too, and with the help of this book I can work on fixing my problems. I have waited about a week since finishing it to \\"test the water\\" and see if the small changes I made to my behavior would help, and I have realized that I can still feel happy, even in the midst of what seemed to be the most hopeless of situations. Yesterday I picked up the Codependent No More Workbook and plan on going through that through the course of this week. If you are looking at this book, you probably were told to look at it by someone else, make sure you thank that person for the recommendation. They are helping you to \\"rescue\\" yourself and stop worrying about the things you can't control, and this book serves as an excellent tool to steer you in the right path."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"Wow. This book should be required reading for every person on the planet because we are ALL co-dependent to some degree. Melody Beattie is gut-level honest and real. She talks to you not like an instructor from the front of a classroom, but like a friend at your kitchen table, helping you to see a side of yourself clearly for the first time. You want to be free to really enjoy your relationships, read this book!"},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"This book was recommended to me by my therapist. I never thought of myself as codependant. Now, I know that it fits me to a T. This book opened my eyes and has helped me a lot in my life."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"Codependency, like people, comes in many forms... Mine was not from alcoholic parents, or alcoholic family members, or drug abuse, but something just as hurtful and deep... being sexually molested as a child. It's amazing to see how something can alter one's life, in ways we don't see, but feel and continue to feel as gown ups if we don't get the internal and emotional help we need when we face something as devastating and traumatic as a child. We carry it on to our relationships... the painful relationships we feel so sure that we are able to fix, because we feel it in ourselves to fix, yet we put off fixing ourselves. We choose to overlook our needs, or wants, our dreams trying to fulfill someone else's. We feel that if we are able to help someone else, that our internal fears and pain will go away, or at least like a pain killer does to the body... will mask it for the time being.I had two failed marriages - first one I was married to a man with OCD... severe. I felt that I would change this man, that I would be able to make a difference and it didn't, it just made me a very unhappy person, which drove me to a relationship with food, it was a relationship which filled me up, made me mentally content, or so I thought only to see that the only thing from that relationship with food which I gained was weight and I was miserable. I knew that was a relationship I needed to sever, so I began getting help from a counselor and started seeing my unhappy life from a different perspective, getting the help, helped me see that it was not so hard to get out of. Yet I went back to what felt comfortable... and soon after that I went into another relationship, with a alcoholic man which I saw at the time as being a \\"social drinker\\"... another \\"victim\\" which I felt I could help, I could cure, I could change. Although he is now a recovering alcoholic, he put me through the mental wringer - this too ended in divorce. And then... the married, \\"I will get a divorce... cheated on his wife with me\\" boyfriend... three years I was with him and three years I listened to the lies he told me when I would see texts from other women... I lived in constant denial - we would break up and we would get back together... it was always me who wanted to make it work. Two days ago was the last straw! I said NO MORE!!! Wake up Linda and stop living a Lie!!When I began seeing a counselor again a few months ago, this time with the yearning and longing to make a life change for the choices I make. My doctor suggested I read the book on codependency and I am three quarters through it. I've read so many eye opening moments. It is altering when you see that what you are going through you are not alone, and you begin to understand your worth, not by trying to change someone else's life, but by making the choice of taking control of yours! This book is helping my inner child grow up and see myself for the genuine and amazing person I am - I have so much to give myself! So much love, attention and respect! I have always looked for that in others, when really no one can give it to me if I don't give it to myself first! I have a new perspective on my life and the relationships I will allow in my life. Life is about choices... it's never too late to reevaluate and improve on oneself - this book has helped me open up my eyes to that! I am not closing them, and when I blink, I will reflect on the lessons I have learned from my failed relationships and my will to know the difference and to make a change for only better!"},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"this book changed my life in a practical way, didn't even know what codependant was much less that I was one, after reading this book I was able to recognize the behavior that I was repeating and getting the same result that was so frustrating me.

You don't have to wonder why you feel guilty, sad, depressed or any of a number of other ailments that may have hitched a ride on your feelings.There's a reason this book has sold over 5 Million copies. The stories are well told, and Melody's writing style will keep you glued to the book.

A friend at work recommended it to me and it took only a couple of chapters, where the author tells the stories of people she has known, for me to see myself in those situations. Then I realized I really did have problems. Fortunately, the book tells how to fix them. :)Because of this book, I have been able to set better boundaries in both personal and business relationships. It has really made a different. Not everything is perfect, so don't expect your situation to magically transform after reading this, but you will have a different insight as to what you are involved with and what you can do about it.Beyond anything, I feel this book offers a lot of hope and that is certainly something we can all use more of."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"This is an EXCELLENT book.

So being the good \\"student\\" I went out right away and purchased it. I can tell you I would gladly pay a million dollars for what's in this book (if I had it). Although, it mainly deals with people coping with alcoholics/drug addicts, it spoke to me. Each night I couldn't wait to read it and almost immediately I was able to start applying some of the suggestions. It has made such a difference in the way I'm starting to think, about myself and everything around me. It's also helped to lift the heavy despair that has been keeping me from enjoying my current relationship. I'm here on Amazon to purchase the next book, Codependency and Beyond (I think that's the title). I'm even going to give it to my partner, so that she can finally see what I've tried so hard to explain. I can't say enough good things about this book.

I hated the guy, but I couldn't bear to think of life without him. He had be questioning my sanity and going from one extreme to the other. For two years, I poured all of myself into a relationship that was unhealthy, one-sided, and destructive. My brother recommended me to read this book when I was in the relationship, but I felt too proud and stupid to read something with \\"Please don't say you need me\\" on the cover. After the relationship ended, I was bored one day and began reading.It was like a revelation... I didn't KNOW how much of a co-dependent relationship I was in. I really cannot recommend this book highly enough. I think there is a lot of truth and potential help for those who are miserable and lost in unhealthy relationships.

We were friends who went to movies, dinner, watched some TV together, took trips together.I began to count on her to be my partner for any plays or other events that were on our community calendar. I realize today, that I had become overly dependent on my child to be a source of company for me.I had not developed enough outside resources of my own. After she left for school, I began to slowly slip emotionally - I just could not seem to get myself together - I could not stop calling, writing or e-mailing; I was totally nuts and, so was my life! She finally told me herself, to back off and give her some space. It was difficult to accept those words but I knew she was right; I was taking away her dignity as a 19 year old adult. The book has helped me so much to realize that I need to focus on making my own life the fullest that it can be and, not put that burden on any of my three children. Thanks Melody."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"My therapist recommed this book. This is!!! Me I would just like to know how the author knows so much about me. I told my mother that the author had written about me. It let me see that I do have a problem. A problem that I didn't realize I had. This book has put me on the road to recovery. I no longer feel guilty about caring for myself."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"After spending six years in another 12 Step Fellowship and succeeding in arresting that specific compulsion/obsession, I found myself repeatedly in destructive relationships. Not knowing why I kept on sabotaging my recovery process and being terrified of NOT having an intimate relationship, I came across this book. The hope that I once felt in my first few years of recovery from my primary compulsion/obsession came back into my life. The author, through her own experience as a professional and fellow co-dependent, offered me a glimpse into my inner-being. The journey continues . . . ."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"This wonderful book captivated me from the very first words the author wrote: 'This book is dedicated...to me.' Of all the self-help books I've ever read...Codendent No More is the most inspirational and spiritual read. Ms Beattie helped me to tap into my own shortcomings. And I thank her for that because in doing so, I am now TRULY able to move forward in my soul and spiritual growth. I feel like a thousand pounds have been lifted off my shoulders; I feel a sense of peace within myself that I've never felt before. Codependent No More is a 'must read' for anyone who has been searching for positive and meaningful growth within themselves. YoU WoN't Be SoRrY :)"},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"As a counselor, Melody Beattie understands well the nature of codependency. As a recovering codependent,she also understands the feelings experienced by the person struggling withthis issue. This book is very blunt, and it has taken me a long time to read it. It is not a one-sitting book. It gives the reader a lot to think about and provides excellent starting points for journaling about one's own experience."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"My therapist told me to buy this book. Naturally I came on here and got it used.I'm not a big reader whatsoever, Id rather watch stuff on tv or listen to it but as soon as I started reading it I really got hooked! So much of it hit directly on to me and helps me be able to move forward! I highly recommend this book because it is/was a big eye opener for me.She also writes very down to earth. Its not medical mumbo-jumbo stuff."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"I am counselor. I specialize in trauma and I am a survivor of trauma. This contributed to my co dependency. The first time I read this book, I could only read a few pages before I threw it across the room. You have to be ready to confront your issues and ready to heal before you read this book. I now share this book with my clients."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"I highly reccommend this book to anyone who suffers do to the addiction or alcoholism or eating disorder of a friend or relative. The book is easy to read, hard to put down and offers plenty of information and encouraging words as well as links to help for the families and friends of alcoholics, anorexics and bulemics, over eaters and addicts. Having been a member of alanon for families &amp; friends of people with drinking problems for five years I can honestly say that this a good first book if you haven't tried a support group like alanon and are wondering what codependency is all about and how you can find help and what help feels like."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"I was given this book by an acquaintance shortly after joining Al-Anon. It has lived on my coffee table ever since - it's been eleven years now. It doesn't just live on my coffee table, though - it lives in my heart and in my soul. If you are recovering from anything, if you lack self-confidence, if you are anxious or afraid, if you are struggling with a relationship, this book will tell you - gently, always gently - that it will be okay. I am sure God speaks to many of us through Melody Beattie. Melody - thank you for helping me find my life."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"This book is very well written. I could hardly put it down. I've been in therapy for nearly a year, and inch by inch I have gotten to the point where I admit that my husband's problem is perpetuated by me. I don't know what will happen in the future, but at least I think I can reclaim my happiness. I am grateful for this book!"},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"This is an excellent book on Codependency. It is the first book I've read that gave me a good understanding of what codependecy is what causes it and what can be done to treat it. I found everything she shared to be relevant and helpful. The author strikes the perfect balance between sound psychology and practiceal descriptions that make since to anyone who struggles with codependence. I can not recomend it highly enough."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"This book turned my life around. I started reading it when I was in crisis with my partner, and this book helped me ground myself and focus - immensely.But even when the crisis ended the change this book made upon my life was enormous. I felt freed to live my life, and let others be responsible for theirs. That sounds so simple, but the impact of it was that even the sun seemed to shine brighter, I had more confidence than before, and more purpose and direction.I recommended it immediately to several friends and family members, and they too have been astounded by this clear, direct book. My relationships with my family, my coworkers, my partner, and myself have improved.This will be one of those books that I reread once or twice a year, to keep myself on track."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"Years ago I worked with a lot of this material, and a lot of other material, most of it was good. My father died this last winter and stuff started shifting around a bit and at any rate it became apparent that some of what was getting in my way was codependence.I bought this on CD and am now buying it on paper. Clear, concise, smooth, down to earth and a bunch of material where i got to take a breath and process a little bit ... the material is not easy to slip by thinking something along the lines of 'this might be for me, but i can really tell it is for so and so'... so to me (at the moment) it is pretty elegant in its structure.Those who have survived living in dysfunctional families have a weird set of skills and handicaps, this book (especially on CD) seems to slip in between that hodge podge and provide a foundation for moving forward from where-ever you are. For me it has been over 4 years since my life was 'out of control' it would be easy for me to think i no longer had any of this going on, but I heard the cadence in my voice shift when i thought there was some way that i could communicate to make 'things work out well for everyone'. Which started me on 'time to look up this material again and see if maybe i am ready to do more than i did the last time'.It seemed to me that this book was structured well for any number of individuals, someone new to it or someone who knows it all but isn't working it or someone who just got to another stage of life and found some surprises.Anyway it seemed pretty useful to me."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"I was amazed at how much Melody Beattie knew about me when I read this book. It seemed as though she had followed me around my entire life and wrote my biography in this book.I was raised by an alcoholic mom and several alcoholic step-fathers. In order to have SOME stability and order in my life, I took on a lot of responsibilies that were not mine. This resulted in my Codependency character. I carried this behavior into my marriages to alcoholic men.Alcohol was so prevelent in my family that I did not see it. All of my family members were high functioning alcoholics other than my grandfather, who was a low functioning alcoholic. I labled my grandfather an alcoholic and the other members of my family as normal drinkers. I do not drink much at all so I WAS AN ABNORMAL drinker.LOL (Hindsight is 20/20)Anyway, this way of life teaches Codependency. Recognizing codependency and taking responsibility for YOUR OWN life can help your emotional health. And that is exactly what this book helped me do. Melody taught me how to set boundaries on myself to not do for others what they can do for themselves. She taught me that by taking on others responsibilities, I am taking away their opportunity for self growth.This book was my first eye opening experience into my own life. It was just the beginning to an extremely adventurous ride into self knowledge.Well worth the money."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"The concept of codependency has made its way through our culture but I did not really know what it meant, so I went back to this original source to learn more.Bingo. Eureka. Light bulbs popping on. I really connected with Melody Beattie's definition of a codependent as a person \\"who has let another person's behavior affect him or her, and who is obsessed with controlling that person's behavior.\\" It sounds simple, but encompasses a whole lot of misery and dysfunction. As Beatty quotes Scott Egleston, \\"Codependency is a way of getting needs met that doesn't get needs met. We've been doing the wrong things for the right reasons.\\"Often this happens when dealing with a loved one who is abusing alcohol or drugs, but it can also arise in other situations in which a family member has an obsessive disorder or other problems. Every family would benefit from understanding these concepts. For example, I work with mothers, and I can see how maternal caregiving could easily slip into codependent caretaking of our children or other family members--with worry, anxiety, controlling, and failed rescue attempts--if we are not aware of these dynamics.Some readers may be turned off by Beattie's insistence on Twelve-Step programs (like AA and Al-Anon) and the Twelve Steps themselves and their \\"Higher Power\\" orientation, but even so I think this book is well worth reading.Being codependent can make you feel truly crazy and leave you wondering why. Why can't I help my loved one? Why am I so angry at my loved one, and myself? Reading \\"Codependent No More\\" was like receiving an answer key that helped crack the code that explains the whole situation. The solutions are not easy by any means, but it feels like a positive first step to have a deeper understanding of the dynamics at work; to learn that we are not alone, and discover there is a path forward."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"I didn't know that living with a Drama Addict could have the same effect on you as living with an alcoholic. I also didn't realize that it could create so may bad habits; and ones that seem to have nothing in common with eachother. I'm so glad I read this book!"},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"I bought this book because i wanted to know more about the meaning of the word Co-Dependent. I felt that i may have that in the relationship sense. This book explained to me the generalization of the word in use with Alcoholic families. But alot of the feelings and dependencies were similar to my own. Very worth while if you feel you may be co-dependent for one reason or another."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"Although this book may give some very healthy affirmations for people who are involved with people who have substance abuse problems, or people in abusive relationships and how to detach from them, I wouldn't dare consider this a book for the average depressed or lonely person.Beattie's definition of what codependency is in this book is almost laughable in its attempt to tag everyone in the world as a codependent. (Except herself. She's above that now.) By the *extremely* broad list of codependent &quot;symptoms&quot; in this book, anyone who picks it up could be labeled as codependent. Also, calling it a &quot;progressive disease which can eventually lead to death&quot; is absolutely ludicrous, sky-high rhetoric.Worried about the misfortunes of your loved ones? Oh, you shameful, pathetic codependent. Care for someone else's well-being? You hopeless codependent. You must have had an alcoholic great grandfather. Are you crying? Only codependents cry. Does anyone else's behavior affect you in a way other than affirming your Nitzschean ubermenschen attitude? You are so codependent. Join a 12-step program now. Don't ever help someone who is sick or down on their luck or you'll be an enabler, or &quot;taking their inventory&quot; or whatever AA catch-phrase can be quickly thrown at you.Regardless of what Ms. Beattie says, loving yourself is not this complicated. Seek happiness within yourself, not this book.Avoid the Codependency Cult and be yourself.Caring is NOT a disease. While I agree that this book may have helped some people, it is not the solution for everyone. I think the solution always lies within the self. &quot;Codependent No More&quot; pathologizes the natural tendency to care for others, and perpetuates the dubious myth that a caring partner is responsible for an addicted person's behavior. No one can cause another person's addictive behavior, period. And being concerned about someone with addictive behaviors does not prove that you have a personality disorder. Read with caution, and don't allow this bunk to run your life...or you'll be codependent, ha ha."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"Recommend by my therapist.

Melody Beattie referred around 14 times, in footnotes, in her 'Codependent No More' book, to the book, \\"Getting Them Sober\\".Getting Them Sober: You Can Help! (Getting Them Sober)So, I bought it and used it with my clients.....and now I can see why that book is the 'sister book' to Melody Beattie's books. (Melody wrote the cover endorsement for \\"Getting Them Sober\\", saying it is the 'best book for the family of the still-drinking alcoholic'.

She spoke with authority, spoke from her own experience, strength, and hope. I remember carrying my copy around to catch glimpses of this fascinating \\"road-map\\" whenever I could get a free minute or two. I would copy out the pages of the \\"traits\\", bringing them to the 12-Step Groups I attended, and was amazed at how we all seemed to be products of such an amazing \\"fabric of our very souls\\". We had different names, and places, and ages, and yet we all seemed to have come from \\"the same source\\", i.e., the dysfunctional family that had replicated itself many thousands of times across our culture.Only recently did I have occasion to get another copy; a friend had come into my realm, and was so snagged, so caught in all the snares of the disease of Codependency. I found 4 copies on Amazon, and just ordered them all. Opening the pages, I found again, all the characteristics, all the nuances of \\"old behavior\\" that I thought I had long ago moved beyond.

It gives a clear insight on how to deal with all types of feelings such as fear, despair, depression, and anger. First the book reveals how to process these feelings rather than deny them and then how to move on to feelings like love, joy, fulfillment, and just feeling okay about yourself in general by giving your life a new spiritual meaning. In her private life, the author has moved from an alcoholic and drug addict, a rape victim, a prostitute/stripper, and finally a welfare recipient to a well adjusted best-selling author and a spiritual advisor. Her life itself is a miracle. She has a way of passing the magic and the spiritual techniques that she used to transform her own life to the lives of her readers.

This book made me realize that I have a voice and an opinion and both matter just as much as the next person. I realized that I can make decisions and not have to worry if my opinion is what other people may think or want. My opinion is exactly that...my opinion. It is okay to have an opinion that is different than someone else's. When I first read this book, I figure that I would not post my feelings about it because they were too personal. I very highly recommend this book, not just for people who live with an alcoholic, but for anyone who is trying desperately hard to fix a bad relationship, whether it's with your spouse, your parents, and your children. With anyone you love. It's pretty amazing for anyone who has struggled to figure out why they often care-take other people but feel guilty taking care of themselves. An eye-opening book that reveals many of the behaviors one adopts to handle living with someone with addiction problems, or as in my case, mental-health issues. I never realized the extent to which my relationship warped me, to some extent my fault for allowing it to happen, but the book also presented a lot of ways to come to an understanding of what it means to be a codependent and also ways to combat and correct behavior. This is one of the most life-changing books I've ever read. It has changed my life for good and I highly recommended this book to all readers."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"while this may be a hard read, due to digging deep internally, it is an excellent tool for learning about yourself and learning healthier ways to be in relations with those in your life"},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"This book and the follow-up books to this series were an amazing eye opener into destructive, counter-productive behaviors that shaped my choices in relationships.What I love about this book are the countless real-life examples that resounded of patterns occurring in my own life. Reading these books combined with therapy have helped me to recognize why and how I've found myself in similar relationships at different times.My wish is for others who are in this co-dependent role to find the courage to read these books. The revelations have been painful to say the least but I am a better woman for it, am able to recognize how my behaviors contribute to the dysfunction and assist me in making positive changes in my life."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"The book definetely describes the codependency problem very well, specially on chapter four, where it lists all the sad things you've been doing to deal with oppressive or manipulative people, but you are too ashamed to admit you do them. It's like a crude view from the mirror that you wouldn't have except for if you went to a shrink. So, it's a good way to describe how bad the situation is for you and what you need to work to get out of it. However, as I'd say all psychological issues, there's no formula that will work for everybody. Each case is a unique case. And once you know what the problem is you still will take quite a long time to figure out how you will live a life that is truly your own. Whether is an authoritarian parent or some relative which makes you think he/she will die if you don't give him/her attention or an alchoholic spouse that is demanding 100% of your attention, will power, free time and energy, you will still have to figure out what to do with this weight on your life for which you also have some feelings and with all the rest of things and people on your life that are important but for years you couldn't pay attention to them.So, I really recommend reading this book, specially the first 10 chapters, for you to finally feel that it might not be your fault what is happening on your life that is driving you crazy. I really recommend reading this book for you to start thinking differently and for you to see that there is a light in the end of the tunnel. But, it's important to state that fixing your life might really take several months or years and might require professional help so that there are no disappointments on the results of reading this book."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"This book was recommended to me and I was so impressed by it I bought it for my mother also.

I had been Senior Class President, Top 2% in the Country during College, successful in modeling and acting, selected as Volunteer of the Year for the State of Iowa and the list of \\"stuff\\" could go on an on. I was so empty inside myself that I didn't any longer know how I felt inside. I was losing any sense of who I was.I'd become someone that functioned to serve, protect, nurture, encourage, forgive and love someone that couldn't love back. I was with the same person, in a marriage, for almost 5 years, and woke up one morning and realized that the person next to me was a stranger who didn't know the real me. The person that my life revolved around, the person that I chose to take care of and \\"cover\\" for, just liked having me around so I could pick up the pieces and paint a picture of a relationship and a family that was like \\"Ozzie and Harriet\\" so that others would think that everything was just fine. I can't stand the word \\"fine\\" anymore. Nothing in my life was fine and it wasn't until I hit bottom and read \\"Codependent No More:How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself\\", that my life began to change. The book answered all of my questions and caused me to look deeply at myself and my situation and evalute how sick I was. Yes, I was the sick one in the relationship too.I thought that I was doing everything right or doing what was right for my relationship. But I didn't ever consider that my own personal cup was empty and the only person who could fill it with healthy things was me. I didn't know that I was controlling others as I only saw myself as a caring and loving person. What had happened is that I went overboard-WAY overboard to the point that I had stopped eating, started using pills to medicate my pain and refused to make changes in my life.I was scared. I didn't want to be alone in life. What I didn't realize is that I was already alone. I wanted to love and be loved. After reading this incredible book, I realized that I wasn't being loved. I was being used and abused and I needed to hit this emotional bottom before I would accept help. My therapist advised me to purchase \\"Codependent No More\\", by Melody Beattie AND to read it. I almost felt odd going into the self-help are of the book store. Little did I know that the healthiest place in any book store is the aisle that reads \\"Self Help\\"!I owe my life to this book and I thank all of the wonderful people who contributed to the stories in this book, that allowed me to move out of my relationship and to enter a long recovery period. I am still in the care of a therapist. Sometimes I act in a codependent fashion. The difference, however, is that I now see red flags that prevent me from getting too deep into relationships that I reach a point where I lose myself.I offer this review to you as a gift. May this book help you, no matter what your circumstance, and may you take hold of your life again. You deserve to learn how to care for yourself. You deserve to be loved and to learn how to accept the beauty that comes with a healthy relationship.My Warmest Regards to ALL!Peter CanniceScottsdale, ArizonaEmail: Horsepete@aol.com"},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"This book is good for people who find themselves depressed and needing some insight on why they feel the way they do. After reading this book the other book by Melody Beattie &quot;Beyond Codepedency&quot; will help you fix the codependent problem. These books will help anyone who is dealing with an alcoholic relationship or any other dependent relationship. If you find yourself caretaking all the time, ie: thinking or feeling responsible for other people, feel it is your responsiblity to help other people solve their problems, feel needy people are always attracted to you, and feeling unappreciated or used; or you have weak boundaries with the people in your life; you have dependency issues; poor communication; and low self-worth- you are codependent. I didn't think I was, but this book laied my life out perfectly. If you are feeling crazy for the way you are feeling read this book and you will understand why you are feeling the way you are. It is normal it is just you are a codependent person and you need to fix that."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"So far as I can tell, very few people could ever read this book without taking something positive away from it. And you don't have to be the product of a broken home, child abuse, neglect, or other serious trauma to see how the machinery of so-called \\"codependency\\" tweaks your life; always for the worse.Having read other peoples' reviews, I'm not sure where some of the negative \\"cult\\" comments and rancor come from. I recognized a lot of these behaviors in mysef and in my family, and I'm not from an abusive, alcoholic, or otherwise chemically shattered upbringing. I have good parents and I had a good childhood. Just the same, even good parents and a good childhood are no guarantee against developing unhealthy relationship habits, as well as damaging internal emotional processes.If you're like me, you shy away from \\"self help\\" literature because it all seems way too touchy-feely. I don't see myself as a victim, and I refuse to adopt the victim mentality. But nobody gives parents a rule book on setting healthy emotional boundaries with their kids, and kids that grow up in a home without healthy emotional boundaries become adults without healthy emotional boundaries. This can really get you into trouble when you start trying to form a family of your own, and is the reason why I sought out this book with urgency.Does it seem like your hapiness is too connected to how other people live their lives? Do you get really upset and depressed because those whom you love engage in behavior you see as risky or damaging? Feel powerless to stop your loved one from using or abusing mind altering substances? Tired of always feeling like \\"the bad guy\\" when you're just trying to get your partner to \\"be good\\"? Has your own social circle dwindled or vanished, so that now only your partner and his/her friends are 'your' social group? Would you like to know why it's so hard to get out of bed every morning, and why you spend so much time worrying about that certain person in your life, while worrying too little about yourself?The problem called \\"co-odependency\\" is not a catch-all, nor is it remedied over night. But I'd dare say that at least half or more of American adults--indeed adults across the entire world--struggle with some form of co-dependent-like behavior. And if you want a deeper insight into this problem, what it is, what it is not, and how it messes with your life, then read this book, and gain strength from understanding.Now, having said all this, and having dealt with these issues for a few years, I think I need to be honest and say that a book like this is only the FIRST STEP. Nothing replaces a good therapist or psychologist. If you feel like you really are that messed up or are \\"going bonkers\\", please, see about getting some professional counseling. When your car is broken do you try to fix it yourself? No, most of us do not. Not even those of us who are handy with cars. The same is true for psychological and emotional disturbances. Many companies now offer Employee Assistance Programs (EAP) that offset or eliminate the costs of counseling. If your company has an EAP, by all means, use it!Barring counseling, I would HIGHLY SUGGEST another book, once you have passed through the bowels of \\"Codependent No More\\" and are ready to move beyond merely identifying your problems, and are anxious to work on SOLVING them.To merely gaze at one's navel and bemoan the sorry state of one's broken or damaged history is to remain trapped in emotional and mental amber. You're not REALLY going to \\"get better\\" until you attack the unhealthy mental habits at the heart of the problem. Understanding the root of the trouble is just a first step, making changes for the better is what happens next, and ought to be the logical goal of EVERY person seeking relief from abnormal or extreme emotional and psychological disturbance.Which is why I highly, highly, highly, suggest seeking out the classic \\"A Guide to Rational Living\\" by PhD. Albert Ellis and PhD. Robert A. Harper. Whereas Beattie is good at giving a layman's view of co-dependent problems and guiding the unkowing through a tour of co-dependent issues, where they might come from, and how they affect our lives in the present, she is not technically a TRAINED professional in mental health care. Without seeking that kind of professional-level knowledge, one is very likely to fall into the \\"Twelve Step Trap\\" wherein 'recovery' becomes an asymptotic hell of forever progressing towards wellness, without actually attaining wellness.Doctors Ellis and Harper have the goods on making changes in your life RIGHT NOW, without facing a daunting and endless program of eternal Anonymous-type meetings and couch sessions with your shrink. Refreshingly pragmatic and frank, Ellis and Harper give you a toolbox full of solid instruments to help you start dismantling that co-dependent house you've built for yourself (yes, I said YOU built for YOURSELF), and avoiding taking on \\"group\\" and perpetual \\"recovery\\" as just another set of addictions or ways to avoid truly attaining mental and emotional health.Thanks for reading. Best of luck on your journey, as I continue my own."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"This book saved my sanity, my relationship, maybe even my life. I was going through major upsets in my relationship due to a partner's addiction. I was trying to &quot;fix the world&quot; one painful day at a time. When nothing happened except for me to lose hope, trust, faith and love, I turned to a friend for advice. She recommended this book to me. I was skeptical to try yet another DO IT YOURSELF book to fix what was wrong with me, but this one opened my eyes. For the first time ever, I saw the patterns of my actions leading me straight to heartache and frustration. The descriptions were right on target, I saw myself in every list. It was scary, yet encouraging, because I did not feel alone, nor did I feel I was too far gone to be helped. This book will be a fixture on my nightstand to get me through the weaker points in my life. Whenever I need to take a reality check and think of ME instead of that other person, I open the pages and let it heal me. Thank you, Ms. Beattie!"},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"I read this book to help me to understand why I could not seem to fully separate myself from an extremely dysfunctional relationship that I had been in for almost 8 years. While Melody frequently uses alcoholics and drug addicts as her examples of co-dependents, that was not the case for me. I was in a relationship with a person that was/is clinically depressed (and not doing anything about it) and who would take their anger out on me. Our home life revolved around how he was feeling from day to day, as it does also with alcoholics. This book helped me realize how I had ended up essentially taking care of a grown man because he didn't want to do it himself. There were lots of other problems with the relathionship, but the main thing is after reading this book I finally woke up. I can honestly say that I have been able to detach from that person (not an easy task) and my life has been so much better for it. This new knowledge has also helped my other relationships with friends and family. I am learning how not to get over-involved and feel a need to 'fix' someone else's problems that they have created for themselves. This book definitely has set me on the right path and I hope to be able to continue to look out for ME."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"This book is about living your own life instead of living your life for your significant other. It is a wonderful book. It changed my life. I would also highly recommend the book An Encounter With A Prophet which helped me become more reliant on God."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"As a counsellor with thirty years experience, I can assure you that, contrary to what at least one other reviewer has indicated, loving yourself is NOT easy for everyone. If life was that simple, counsellor's case loads would be much lighter and the world a much happier place.This book is an excellent starting point and great self-help book for those who are codependent. It is not simply a matter of &quot;starting to love yourself,&quot; but a matter of going back through the years, generally to the formative years of childhood, and discovering why you have developed the need to be codependent. In other words, it helps to know where you came from before mapping a route to where you are going. I did find the book made considerable reference to drug and alcohol addiction. While that is a major form of codependency, it is not the only form, but others received less priority. For that reason, the book lost a star in the rating. &quot;Codependent No More&quot; is written in an honest, straight-forward manner; therefore, if it evokes anger or negativism in the reader, it is likely because the reader sees at least a partial reflection of themself in the book.Like any self-help book, the advice given only works if the individual is prepared to make long-term changes and has the commitment to work at the root of the problem. For those who are codependent to a minor degree, this book provides helpful insight on how to deal with the problem; however, if the problem is a more serious one, opting for professional counselling is likely still the best course of action. Often old habits are difficult to change on one's own. Freeing yourself from the chains of codependency can result in newfound freedom, peace of mind and a happier, less stressful lifestyle. I do recommend this book for the valuable information it contains."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"I read a review on here that said calling codependency \\"a progressive disease which can eventually lead to death is absolutely ludicrous, sky-high rhetoric.\\" I am glad this reviewer has never felt the overwhelming depression and despair of codependency that can lead to thoughts of suicide but I am here to tell you that I have felt it and this book did save my life. Fortunately, I read it at a time when I needed it most. For anyone to say that you just need to \\"get a life\\" or grow up, they are obviously not people who need this book.If you feel that you are constantly going in circles trying to please everyone in your life, this is the book for you. If you feel that you are not \\"good enough\\" to be around other people, this book is for you. Even if you are not surrounded by chemically-dependent people you can still be codependent.I read this book for the first time about 12 years ago. I have bought and given away many copies and don't even own my own copy at this point. Getting past being a people-pleaser does not make you nasty or selfish or an egomaniac. Instead it allows you to give of yourself fully to those things that YOU want to give fully to. You learn to say yes to what you really want to do instead of being a doormat who can never say no because it just isn't nice.Read this book for yourself. Please don't let the naysayers persuade you against this book. You don't have to be a fan of 12-step programs to read this book. I tried that route and it did not work for me but this book did. Good luck to everyone becoming the person you were meant to be!"},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"This was an interesting book to read, and perhaps an appropriate introduction, but at the end I felt like I was wallowing in codependency, not moving on and learning practical ways to heal. This book merely identifies the problem, but fails move to the next step of becoming \\"Codependent No More\\".I felt this book was more theoretical than practical. Additionally, I don't like Beattie's overall philosophy, extracted from work with alcoholism, that once Codependent, Always Codependent.A better foundation for beginning to work through these issues has been one of continually self-awareness, healing and breaking old codependent habits.Instead of Beatie, I would recommend Breaking Free From the Codependency Trap, which provides a brief overview of codependency, but incredibly practical solutions for individuals, couples, therapy sessions and group therapy.Breaking Free of the Co-Dependency Trap"},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"Finding myself a soon to be divorced woman and mother of four, I entered counseling and after one session, this book was recommended to me.

I believe that anyone who even remotely considers themself a codependant or is involved with a person that has a dependancy issue, needs to read this book. The content is remarkabley easy to read and allows for pariticipation (self-examination)after each chapter is completed. I feel that it is almost a work book for the person who is ready to make a positive change in their life. The author goes to great lenght to make sure that the reader is comfortable about the information that is being written.

She said in 200 pages what could have been said in 50. Most of the ideas were repeated. If one is reading that book, they must have a pretty good idea they are co-dependent. Instead, she gives multiple check lists, vignettes, definitions. She never turns it around postively so you can benefit from the grueling experience (of reading her book).

I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"I had the prior misconception that if something hurt it meant that it was the absolute truth; but I know now that it is not. Every time I opened this book I ended up in tears and panic, turning each page frantically I wondered, \\"Is this me?!\\" Each time after I was a complete mess for days. There are a lot of positive reviews for this book but in my case I feel it has the opposite effect. I have never experienced another book that has made me feel so awful and confused. Honestly you don't even need to make the purchase, this book can be summed up in the statement \\"Stop controlling others and take care of yourself\\". But it doesn't say why, it just gives alternatives and shallow answers to a problem that is much deeper than the simple label of what the author calls control. I find the simple commands she gives do not help you alleviate the pain inside and that's the real issue here- heartache. In this book there seems to be a lot of blame and finger pointing which doesn't feel great no matter who it's at. I have found that for me personally, I'm looking for something that I can connect with on a spiritual level not just a short answer based in psychology, something that really truly helps and heals. I think if you are in a situation that is deemed \\"codependent\\" or anything else that resembles it, you don't realize how special and wonderful you really are because somewhere you have forgotten and that's ok- it will come back. I just don't know that this book will make you remember, maybe it will, but I needed more. I'm reading a series of books right now by Sanaya Roman that have to deal with healing and loving your soul on the deepest level possible. The concept is once you feel secure and warm on the inside, your life will start to mirror that too. But the difference between those books and this book is that the lessons can be applied more universally and there is no information that is \\"put into\\" your head to confuse you, you are allowed to make your own connections and leave the rest of the information behind that does not apply to you. I know that these books work for me because they make me feel wonderful and secure about who I am, however \\"Codependent No More\\" does not."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"If you are ready to face some realities about yourself, if you've ever wonder why you have had so many unhealthy relationships, then this book is for you.

My therapist reassured me I was not crazy but I was severely co-dependent. When he suggested I buy this book, and said that if I studied it my life would get better, I felt that I had nothing to lose.

Thank you for your work..."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"It took about ten pages before I started recognizing myself in the portrait of the co-dependent. Then--Eureka!Melody writes from the perspective of someone who's been there as a chemical abuser, as an enabler of other abusers, and as a therapist. Most sections are well-written enough to rise above a slant towards either gender. I have to admit I felt embarrassed ordering this book. Had a male therapist not strongly recommended it after I went to him feeling overwhelmed by my own situation I would have continued to dismiss this and other \\"recovery\\" literature as fodder for Oprah and stereotypical hen-parties. However, I quickly realized through reading this book (once I found a nice dark corner) that co-dependency is a real phenomenon for both men and women. As the non-alcoholic in the relationship a man might have not done anything to \\"deserve\\" what he's suffering at the hands of his tormentor (and himself), but nonetheless it has an inevitable and lasting effect. This book can get him started towards admitting the problem so he can address it and perhaps start to rise beyond the anger, confusion, self-doubt, resentment and negativity to a happier place. This is what they call \\"recovery\\".My only criticism of the book is how it starts looking cobbled-together towards the end. It seems some content was shoved in to get it to the 200-page level to justify more shelf space or a higher price tag. It would be well worth the $11 as a 50-page pamphlet. A \\"patty\\" this good doesn't need filler.So even if you're a Joe Six-Pack meat-and-potatoes type of guy, give this book a try if a loved one has a alcohol or drug problem.

I can now see how my need to control zaps the energy from others and does not let them have self worth.Highly recommend this for anyone."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"I am currently reading, and re-reading the book Codependent No More written by Melody Beattie. I have found so much of what she says in this book to be very helpful in overcoming codependent behavior. I have really learned so much from this book, that I would love to read some of the other books Melody Beattie has written. I found this book at just the right time so that the information I have gained from reading the book will help break my codependent behavior. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"I read this book 10+ years ago and it did change my life and start me on the road of personal freedom and autonomy.

It taught me how to love myself again."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"Codependent No More, was given to me to read during a personal crisis. Without it I'm not certain how I would have, otherwise, dealt with the experience. Within it, I found myself in so many places - not all, but in many. I keep it on my nightstand and read parts of it as reconfirmation that life goes on and we are forever growing and conquering obstacles within ourselves. No other book has ever held such fascination for me. My gratitude to its author is sincere."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"This book is for alcoholics, or people who have had their lives damaged due to close relationships with alcoholics. And, the \\"recovery\\" from codependency is very much based on having faith in God. I am not an alcoholic, and am an atheist, so I cannot really recommend this book as a useful tool for unlearning codependency."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"This book is not just for those who find themselves living with alchoholics or abusive partners. It is a revelation of deep insight into low self esteem, how this effects your situation and your life and what to do to get yourself happy.Anyone who finds themselves in an unhappy situation, for whatever reason, who may not value themselves should read this book!It is so easy to follow and understand and is gripping to read as so many points will touch home. It is a basic guide to living your life with you in control. If you are even reading this review, you may feel you'd benefit. Just buy it!"},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"This is an amazing book that helped me to open my eyes in the area of relationships, and it helped me to see old patterns that previously kept me stuck.

It's also a great read."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"I read this book over and over. It's a keeper. 'Course my edition is from 1987!! Beattie has become a household name in codependency issues, and this is a page-turner, as well as having ME on every page of the book (yep, unfortunately, I'm QUITE codependent). But beyond that, Beattie has an interesting writing style, gets the reader involved from the get-go, and really puts her heart and soul into the book. She's great, and so is Codependent No More!"},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"I found this book absolutely excellent for understanding where I was coming from and why. It is very comphrehensive, easy to read and I found myself nodding away at all I read. Melody Beattie is a fabulous writer and very supportive in her writing. I would recommend this book to anyone who has ever found themselves so wrapped up in someone else they don't know who they are anymore. This book is an ally, a friend, a positive guide out of co-dependency. It cannot but increase awareness in oneself."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"I have know for sometime the way I process emotions of others was impacting me in an unhealthy way. I was jailed by what others may be thinking of me. Preoccupied by anticipating others needs to the demise of my own. I have read similar books but did not finish many of them because of the mind numbing jargon ( my under graduate emphasis was on mental health!) or the authors' idea of being a ball buster/princess which was not acceptable to me.After a chapter or two I found that I am much more normal than I had thought (no I was not as crazy as my benefactors needed me to be) and I have every right and need to take care of myself. NO ONE ELSE is going to take them as serious as needed. That is my job, With the help of this book I have entered a 12 step program, Codependents Anonymous. I have heard from everyday people, I am right and I am not alone.This book validated my feelings in a lot of ways; I can fix this, I am smart enough, strong enough and wise enough to do so, and my happiness is my responsibility and love taking care of myself. I can do this without apology.My 'to-do&#34; list is much smaller. Those who were there to take advantage of me have disappeared, leaving me with more time to spend on those who have earned their place with me.This book make you think for yourself by doing away with lists and a tremendous amount of journaling. If you are willing to work and focus all the answers are there. IF you are willing to work and do your part.Read it. Mark it up and give it to the next codependent you meet and set them free. This book has saved me thousands in counseling fees."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"At first I was skeptically about me being codependent, but after reading the first few chapters I saw myself as that.

God bless Melody Beattie."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"I truly hate this book. If you are an individual who is more in tune with your intellect and seeking a book to help you that is non faith based, then this is truly not the right book for you.They give you several scenarios on helping you define what is co-depency and if you are a co-dependent, but after a few case studies or stories of certain individuals you really are just reading the same thing over and over and over again. Notice the extra \\"over\\" I put in for emphasis, the book is by far many times annoying like that where the same theme repeats itself.The author suggest that you always result to a higher power for asistance, much like what you hear from traditional help books that defaults back into faith based. I would really like to find an author that can think outside of the box and look at non traditional means and therapy than what this book offers.This will probably be helpful towards those who are of a faith -- but for those of who aren't, I wouldn't waste your money."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"I got the 7 cd audio and could only get past chapter 5 or so before getting really angry for forcing myself to listen to this and lying to myself that it would get better eventually. Every other word was co-dependent this codependent that. She spent way too much time trying to define and ended up contradicting herself after listing everything under the sun. The ridiculous amount of times the word 'co-dependent' is used, is not only extremely obnoxious to listen to, but it emphasizes a judgement label. We may be affected by codependency, but it's not who we are. In fact who we are is whatever is underneath what's holding us back; what's left after we stop making our entire world only about what's out there. If a judgement must be made, yes, I know full well I'm codependent...that is why I paid good money for this in the first place. I got this because I'm sick of letting myself become my worst enemy and I wanted to start that path to healing. With my tendencies to see and be consumed by everything wrong with the world around me and volunteering to burden myself with things I probably have no control over or feeling responsible for other peoples feelings and my constant need to define my flaws and \\"fix\\" it, I have no need to be reminded a million times what is wrong and in every hue it comes in. I had positive intentions to relax because finally, there would be something that understood what I needed & I could just sit back and listen. I wanted to learn and explore myself and feel empowered... to relate to others and see where I might learn from their trials. I wanted something that was supportive and helpful and deeply insightful. I NEEDED to feel understood and to learn what healthy compassion/love looks like (for myself and others). What I got was dry/cold, technical observations, lists upon lists, labels, non-stop references to alcoholics (totally irrelevant to my case), a severe lack of wisdom/humanity. And I could certainly do without her mentioning over and over how she was not an expert (we get it, but now I doubt why I'm even listening to you) or how, before she understood it, that we looked completely nut-so and very unpleasant to be around. I'm sure ultra sensitive souls like us could get the point without knowing the author was capable of such mean spirited judgements when faced with something hard to understand. And for whatever reason there were random references to \\"God\\". To that last part, I found to be extremely offensive, irrelevant, irrational and full of arrogant bias assumptions. You want to talk about God? Write a book on Christian healing and Codependency. Oh, but you can't cause it just tells you your problem is that you don't know how to be selfish and that you care for others too much or tend to martyr yourself. The voice for the CD version I also found unpleasant. There was no warmth and her pronunciation was very blunt in the syllables...causing her to sound annoyed or judgmental at times. I would not call this self-help...more like a shallow and simplistic descriptive manual. I highly recommend \\"Toxic Parents: Overcoming Their Hurtful Legacy and Reclaiming Your Life\\", by Dr. Susan Forward. I promise you will not want to put it down and you will feel supported, understood and optimistic about progress. Most importantly it will open doors to viewing yourself in a new & much brighter light."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"I just got this book and have already read the first three chapters.

I had no idea that what I have been doing was so destructive not only to myself but my family and everyone in my life. I see that this codependency started at a very young age in my life. The book not only explains but gives you insight on how to stop the behavior in it's tracks. It is refreshing to know that the author went thru this and has come out of it a better person.This book is a tool to help you along while trying to reverse years of this behavior.

This was a suggested read from my marriage counseler and I can honestly say it has changed my entire way of thinking. The book is written in a way that i appreciated immensely. Beattie even admits that she is not a professional. Her explanations, descriptions, and suggestions were so on point I felt like I was reading a book made specifically for me. I have spent my life trying to control various situations and outcomes in all of my relationships. I have always struggled with feeling to enmeshed and getting way too upset when people in my life are struggling. I have always felt like I \\"take on\\" other people's feelings... If that makes sense. I had completely lost who I was and what mattered to me. I don't know if I read this book at just the right time or what, but I feel like my world has changed for the better! I will no longer put myself on the back burner and prioritize everyone else. If you feel out of control in your life, and are consumed by the \\"what ifs\\" all the time then this book is for you.

Initially I was sceptical (I remain sceptical of much of the content published as 'self-help') but I began to see myself in much of what is author had to say. I do disagree with some of what she has to say (I don't think her suggestion that co-dependant personalities must necessarily suffer from low self esteem is necessarily true). But certainly the author caused me to question and subsequently recognize and acknowledge my own codependent behaviour and the consequences. I recommend this book for anyone who is living with or has lived with addict.Take the time to do the activities; these were annoying for me at first but led me to insights about myself and my relationships with the people in my life.

Instead of worrying about -- and trying to control others -- this teaches you how to let go, how to focus on yourself and your own actions and find peace with those decisions. We can't change others or their decisions. But we can change how we react to those people and their decisions. Life is a lot easier when we accept that we only have control over ourselves.

I never really understood what it meant though. Three people on separate occasions told me to read this book. I purchased it, but for some reason, kept putting it off. I sought therapy and was in such a unhappy, depressed funk that I couldn't shake. I tried everything else, so I decided to really give this book a fair shot. The beginning was very slow for me (I guess this is why I kept putting it down). By the third chapter or so, I was crying like a baby and couldn't believe the extent that what I was reading, related to me. I was finally able to put a face on codependency and it was all ME! It was very painful because I recognized myself and didn't like it. Some nights I had to put the book down, because it was too much to stomach and digest. I kept reading and had the biggest breakthrough ever. This book has changed my life and I am determined to be codependent no more. I will always keep it as a reference and am sure I will read it again, until it is memorized and truly a part of me. I say to anyone that is codependent and want to break the chain, this book is highly recommended. Even if you have never experienced life with an addict, keep reading.

I purchased copies for both my Nook for PC and Kindle Fire. The first 5 chapters gives the reader the impression that this book was written specifically for the reader. I fell for it. The breakdown of different co-dependent areas is believeable. As I got further into the book, I was turned off by reading about living with alcoholics and the detailed descriptions.

This one is a great start for anyone with unhealthy patterns and long strings of horrible relationships.The original target audience for this book (and its concepts) were significant others of alcoholics. Yet many (including myself) have found the patterns of a codependent apply to anyone with unhealthy attachments to others.At the time I read this, I was just getting out of a bad marriage. I was terribly depressed to the point of being near-non-functional. This book gave me some basic building blocks for climbing that first step towards sanity. I learned I didn't have to be absorbed by someone else to be happy. I learned I needed to take care of myself first, then others. It gave me the foundations I needed to enter healthy relationships, and eventually a happy life-partnership.With a little imagination, the basic dynamics detailed in this book can also be seen in social dynamics of larger groups. The unhealthy clinging, manipulations, and drama that lead to petty infighting (in smaller groups) and political dysfunction (on a societal scale)."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"If you believe you are a codependent, this is a must read!!! You will learn a lot about yourself. Very good book!! The only downside is, the book starts out slow. The first 4 or 5 chapters says a whole lot of nothing over and over again(which is why I rated it four stars instead of five)! The book also mentions alcholics a lot too and that kind of annoyed me as well. I almost put the book down until I came to the next chapter, I kid you not, I learned so much about myself, I was reduced to tears..!! THIS-BOOK-REALLY......BLESSED-ME!!!

I have owned this book for over 15 years and I can't tell you how many times I have gotten the book out and either read it all the way through again or just went back to certain chapters that pertain to what is going on in my life at that certain time. It is a constant reminder that I am not alone in this battle for safe boundaries in my life and also for adapting safe people in my life. When the crazy feelings come around I know that it is my body telling me that something is not right with what I am feeling. I dont ignore my feelings anymore, for they are what keep me safe! Thank you so much Melody for sharing this book with us."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"This book has been a useful tool in my life. Living with an alcoholic and knowing many, it has given me many helpful suggestions. I learned that I am only responsible for myself and I cannot change anyone else. I had to learn to feel good about myself and not look to another to do that for me. I thought I was a victim but then learned that there are no happy victims and I want and deserve to be happy.I now have many healthy relationships and have a lot of fun in my life. Along with Melody Beattie's books, I have found other authors that I absolutely love because they too are about living in the moment and having a magical life.

I've read a lot of self-help books but nothing has compared to the powerful information in this book. Codependency doesn't mean that you are a bad person, it means that you are a loving person simply loving the wrong person -- you need to love yourself first and foremost. Relationships will improve drastically when you put yourself as #1. Too many messages run rampant in our minds telling ourselves that we're not good enough, pretty enough, smart enough -- we ARE ENOUGH. Our self-esteem is our responsibility solely. Take back the love you owe to yourself and quit giving it away to all the wrong people. There's lots of freedom in this little book. A wonderful companion.

I consider myself now in recovery from codependency and have the tools now to give myself a better life.

They care, they want to be there for others. But sometimes that caring does not start with self and we become codependant. We pour ourselves into the lives of others and wrestle with undesirable consequences. Even if you are not dealing with an addictive person in your life, \\"Co-dependant No More\\" will spark you to learn to love and care without enabling. You will walk through an invisible door of a learning experience that will change your life and the lives of those around you.I would suggest every parent read this book!"},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"This book will also help anyone who has grown up in a hosehold where an addiction has been present, having a profound effect on your adult relationships. Being a guy in his 20's, I was embarassed to read a self help book with such a flakey(?) cover, but it has changed me immensly, and for the better. I understand a lot more about myself now, and I can work on myself and better myself--because if you don't work on you, who will!

Not only did I get lots of insight into the codependent mind, but the book offers solid help to turn these counterproductive survival tactics around. I not only recognized the client, but I recognized myself and some of the unhealthy ways I interact with my partner.

Like some of the other reviewers, it was painful at first to see myself described in the book. But it helped me to understand why I was attracted to addictive personalities, what attracted them to me, and how to eventually break the cycle.

It certainly worked for me."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"I finally found out that I had the right to be happy.

It's not the fault of the book but it just wasn't a match for my needs. Although there was some good information about identifying the behaviors of a codependent, the book leaned heavily toward codependency in relationships with alcoholics and other substance abusers. The author seemed to spend a lot of time identifying behaviors and telling you why you need to let them go. There were writing exercises at the end of each chapter but I've done all these types of exercises before to no avail. Then the book steered toward the 12-step program used by AA, which might be extremely helpful for most but doesn't jive with the fact that I am an atheist. The concept of not taking personal responsibility and putting it off on a higher power just conflicts with my belief system. For those of you who are deeply spiritual, it is probably a wonderful resource for dealing with codependent relationships. For me, not so much a love connection. Still looking for straightforward (non-faith based) exercises for how to heal the scars of many years of emotional abuse. Any suggestions?"},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"I feel i can finally put a name to everything I have been thinking, feeling, and doing.

You are in a rut because the excitement is gone.There are others that fall into the \\"you complete me\\" trap. Complete yourself then find a partner.

However, I am not the spouse, daughter or any relation to an alcholic or drug user. The reason I say this is because I almost didn't continue to listen pass the first cd because that is who the book seemed to be geared towards.I understand that the book is intended for people who \\"suffer\\" from and with codependency however the word alcholic must be mentioned at least 1,000 times. It really began to wear on me, I felt as if the book should have been \\"Codependent to/with an Alcoholic No More.\\"It was a test of my patients and tolerance to continue listening because I was trusting that God's message for me was in the book. I received it but I must admit, it was with a lot of teeth grinding."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"Many books have been written on growing up in an alcoholic or otherwise destructive house. While it is important as a first step to know how some of our bad habits and attitudes get developed (the &quot;why&quot;), it is CRITICAL to know the &quot;how&quot;: how can we recognize them in ourselves, to challenge our faulty thinking, to implement healthy strategies for interacting with others (and ourselves). This book is fantastic in the whys and the hows. I suspect many of you who read it will say things out loud as you read as I did, such as &quot;Yes!&quot;, &quot;So true!&quot;, etc. when you see yourself in the descriptions she gives. I was so impressed with this book, immediately after I finished it I ordered &quot;The Language of Letting Go&quot;: daily readings to help stay on the right track. I have gone to counseling, read books on cognitive therapy and several other self-help books, but this book is by far the most helpful. I finally GET IT: I didn't know I was codependent.

Codependence is not a bad word, or a label of shame...the book uses it as a term of enlightenment leading to empowerment.Although not confined to certain life situations, the book is geared for those who have endured the compulsive, destructive behaviors of alcoholics, severely ill, mentally unstable, etc. Time endured with the chaos, confusion and compulsive behaviors of our loved ones may generate a codependent personality. The codependent coping mechanisms are simply not healthy for one's own growth.Codependence can give you superb intuitive powers, amazing organizational skills, unflagging energy and extraordinary juggling skills---however there is one focal point of the book. A codependent is always busy taking care of everyone but themselves...this book is bold and tactful in its delivery...engaging, helpful, and above all...hopeful!"},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"Loads of descriptions of the various problems of co-dependency but few if any suggestions as to how to cope or what to do about it."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"This book is a great book. I liked it so much I read it in weeks (when it would have taken me a year, reading here and there) It is very easy to read and extremely interesting. Most of the examples are based on alcohol/drug addiction, even though I am not surrounded by those circumstances I found this book to be quite helpful. However, I believe the reader wont get as much from it if he/she isnt mentally ready to let their guards down and absorb the messages thoughout the book. I cant understand a drug/alcohol addiction, nor I know someone that has/is going through one but I got the concept: It applies to unhealthy relationships. As long as I substituted my problems in when it mentioned drugs/alcohol it made sense to me. I am assuming it works great for those with the drug/alcohol issues as well.

This book opened my eyes and has made a profound impact on my life and the lives of those I love"},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"Beattie sort of touches on behaviors/experiences that many of us can relate to. I don't think we'd interpret these things in the way that she does (nor give them the managable labels she does), but it does feel good to have these hard-to-define things explained to us by someone who speaks like she knows what she's talking about. I think that causes many of us to accept her interpretation of things and accept her as an expert on the subject. But Beattie, in her affected authoritative tone, rambles all over the place, and it can cause your mind to feel disoriented and confused. And this confused state of mind you fall into while reading her words helps to conceal how Beattie consistently contradicts herself throughout the book. After the first 100 pages or so I felt dizzy at all the confusion she'd stirred in me. Or maybe SHE didn't stir anything up in me - I'm a codependent victim. Sheesh. I think the good feelings this engenders in people is due to people relating to a lot of the same gripes as Beattie. It's nice to see our problems in print - it gives us hope for a solution to these problems. But the good feelings end there. Beattie does more damage than good. The one message that blasts loud and clear out of this book is CARE FOR NO ONE BUT YOURSELF. But then she says that caring for people is good. But don't do it. But you can still love them. But don't. This appears to be a book written by a conflicted woman who obviously has issues, and decided to put in print the neurosis that helped her to cope with these issues. It just makes me feel bad that people may try to implement her ideas/advice in their lives to the destruction of their good relationships. She's advocating being alone -\\"undependent\\" of anyone - and taking the \\"necessary\\" steps to detach from these relationships. Some abusive relationships may need such severing, but Beattie casts the label of \\"codependent\\" under a wide enough umbrella to cover everyone. \\"Everyone's codependent.\\" So good relationships will be destroyed by following her advice, as well as bad ones. I think that down the road many people who follow her advice and alienate the people who love them in their effort to be \\"undependent\\" and \\"detached\\" will feel a deeper pain than the one that caused them to pick up this book in the first place. And then they'll just be confused as to why they're unhappy - they did just what Beattie said.It pains me to know that this book is in print. I'm sorry for everyone's individual pain and I hope you find something to soothe it. This book, at best, is destruction disguised as hope."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"Very good book.

My wife was recommended this book because her relationship with her parents has turned her into a codependent, and it's done wonders in opening her eyes. We read the book together and it helped us to understand what feelings are \\"ok\\", how to handle unpleasant situations, and how to detach ourselves from the manipulation of others. Melody Beattie isn't a psychiatrist or a Ph.D., so she isn't as well versed in the technical jargon as a psychotherapist, but she has a great deal of life experience as both a councilor and a codependent. This allows her the unique ability to speak in down-to-earth, easy to understand language that lets her connect with her readers. The audio version was great, I really enjoyed listening to it. I gave this book 4 stars because it's not going to work for everyone. Melody Beattie is a big advocate of 12 step programs, but there are other ways to handle situations as well. So I don't think that you are going to find all the answers in this book, but it will definitely give you some good advice on how to handle abusive relationships, and most importantly it will help you start to realize that things can change, even for you.

Goes to show how much I'm moved by it and wanted to keep one for repeated reading.The author presents the topic from her own point-of-view and personal experience from the side of addiction moving to the other side, which is codependency. Little did I know that my behaviors and feelings were falling into the category of codependency. The book has a way of opening your eyes onto yourself, without sounding judgmental or persecutory. In a compassionate way, it made me understand that given any type of addiction-related situation (mine isn't alcohol or drug related yet the book still applied), the end-results are somewhat the same and related for individuals affected by another person's addiction and has a clear-cut, self-invoking way of \\"fixing\\" the individual affected (and not the one with the addiction). I know, it probably doesn't make sense but being on the receiving end of someone I care about who has an addiction, I found the book informative and helpful.There's a lot to be taken from the book that one-time reading won't be enough for me, at least. I think there's multiple versions of this book out there by the same author under different covers, but the contents are the same.If you found your way to this book, either thru someone or by yourself, you're probably in a situation where you are feeling hopeless by someone else's problem. This book may enlighten you to what needs to be done, and that you need to start taking care of yourself, and in a loving way, no longer be dependent on the addict.Good Luck and God Bless!"},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"This book was recommended to me by my thearapist.

I think it has some good points, but is overly simplistic. I was looking for a book to help me deal with a video game addict. Labeling folks who get emotionally involved as \\"codependent\\" makes a feel-good psychobabel label, but is not totally intellectually honest with the complexity of some modern problems. Take the case of parents of video gamers- this book would label them as codependent, which is silly. No, they shouldn't just live their own life and forget about worrying about their family member. That is another problem altogether - lack of caring, which today's kids and teens don't need either. I was looking for a better way to be emotionally involved with others. It is a start with the bare basics of not enabling, but I felt it is again focused on the \\"me me me\\" folks, and the folks who want to label others.

Go ahead and detest me and my critique. Because your advance in life has been distorted, you have simply traded one idea of yourself for another. The old idea of needing for the new idea of not needing.The title needs to be changed. Codestructive No More. We all depend on each other for support, love, trust, friendship, hope, even opinions and reviews. Codestructive No More! is my take on it.I know that your new idea has helped you. It is serving its purpose and has been a true blessing. Eventually you will need to move on. We all need each other, we are all codependent. What you are really looking for is a way of being non destructive in your dependence. Tell me you do not need others and I will tell you that you are denying yourself your greatest gift, no person is an island.I loved the part of this book where we are supposed to do that exercise where we give ourselves something... What if that something that you really need is a someone..why then (according to this book) you are a codependent fool. Rubbish to that shame disguised as advice, the real problem lies in the fact that most of us are in so much pain we could not truly be there for another if we wanted to.This book is good in the fact that it helps us to realize that we may be dysfunctional.. My friends... we are all dysfunctional in one way or another. But my exception with this writing is that it attempts to cure the symptoms and not the root cause. The root may very well be your pain that you keep within and cannot get out. Removing oneself from a situation or starting new habits are awareness steps. Eventually you will repeat your pattern until you have healed your mind and your heart.This planet is one big problem and it is time to recognize that the chaos we see is not a world going to hell in a handbasket, it is a world coming out of its shell. The book gets two stars because it is a starting point.. If you were not alone deep within your heart you would not be a controlling and/or leaching personality.

However it seems to have some good information on what we codependants do to ourselves and activities at the end of each chapter to make it easy to understand."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"Melody Beattie hits the nail on the head with this book on codependency. It really teaches how to overcome codependency. I didn't think a book was capable of doing such a thing, but this book is capable. It's the best, most well-written book on codependency that I've ever read. At the end of each chapter, there is a section with personal questions that the reader can answer to obtain a deeper understanding of their makeup in their relationships. With this book, the reader can learn where, how, why, and when self-destructive aspects of themselves are used, consciously or unconsciously. I bought my used copy of this book from a seller on Amazon. The book arrived within days of the purchase being made. Codependent No More: How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring arrived in great condition with no markings or tears anywhere."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"This book is very well-written and thought provoking. I should have read this book 3 years ago- I would have understood myself so much better!!!"},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"I re-read the first chapter three times. I will keep this book forever. It's the year 2012 and I had never heard of this book and a therapist recommended it. I felt like I opened-up a book to a world of people who live like I do ~ and I thought I was the only one. If you are only a little bit co-dependent (like me), the middle chapters can linger on and feel quite deragotory, pointing out habits you don't have, but it picks-up in the end and is a rather helpful book overall ~ for the insight if nothing else. Recommended."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"At first I didn't want to read this book because I thought it was just about people who lived with alcoholics and figured it wouldn't have anything to do with my life since that wasn't what I was dealing with. I'm beyond grateful that I did choose to read it though. It's helped me to see the reality of my life, not the denial and lies I had been hiding behind. I've accepted that fact that I am codependent and am ready to try growing beyond all of my self-doubts and become healthy. If this book has been recommended to you, don't hesitate like I did. Go out and read it right away :)"},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"I read this as a library book several years back (as a library book) upon the recommendation of someone discipling/counseling me. I ordered a copy for myself recently, as the issue of codependency seemed to be coming back into my life and also of some beloved friends. It is a great book that addresses some tough issues without being preachy or condescending. It is full of helpful information to guide self examination, with questions to consider at the end of each chapter. The title of the book may actually be a bit of a turn off, or misleading, as many codependents may not see themselves as trying to control others. Don't let that be a barrier to reading this book!Read it for yourself, apply it to your own self, and then pass it along to bless others as well. It is compatible with the Christian faith, which I found helpful, as I am a Christian. However, I believe it is written to minister to a very wide group of people, regardless of your belief system. It is very in line with the AA 12 step programs, which the author highly recommends."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"It is not an overstatement to say that this book is life changing for me. The word &#34;codependent&#34; seems to have a negative connotation but I think the reality is that a lot of people face this issue. The entire time I was reading it, I'm sure I was shaking my head &#34;yes&#34; and I constantly kept feeling like someone finally got me and my situation for the first time. I love the action items at the end of each paragraph. It really does give you a basic framework for recovery and I cannot recommend it enough. Especially if you have been affected by someone with alcohol or substance abuse issues. This book helps to teach you to take care of yourself, guilt free and to control only what you can control."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"I love this book!!it is written amazingly, she puts stories and real life examples that helped me really understand it...."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"Good read, harder to accept the truths that you realize once you read this.

The book does not spend any time in describing stereotypical situations, but rather starts with a strong description of what codependent persons go through. it helps in the book to read that that she has gone through the ailment herself and that there is a way out with hard work and dedication to oneself. She is quite insightful in analyzing the personality of a codependent person.I would absolutely recommend this book to anybody that wants to learn more about this mental problem, but I am warning that this book is harsh and he needs to be read in small doses. I recommend to take notes along with it!J.P."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"This is one of those books I listened to in my car. I laughed so hard as Beattie described standard manipulation and guilt tactics that we often use, but are ineffective and often damaging. The humorous part is that I never realized I was doing it, that I could stop, or how much fun life would be without it. I came across this as part of my Al-Anon work, but would recommend it to anyone. As kids, we are all dependent. Maturing and becoming interdependent adults, rather than codependent, usually requires some conscientious retraining.

It was full of insights that I needed to read and study. I plan to re-read it soon. This book seems to be written directly for me. The author simply didn't use my name! I have talked to several people about reading this book. I was surprised how many people have read the book. I was reading the book one morning at Denny's while having a cup of coffee when the waiter said how great the book was. He told me about a codependency group which he attends. The book was written from the perspective of a recovering alcoholic but what the author says applies to any codependency or addiction situation. People in caregiving situations should especially read this book. I give the book five stars!"},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"I have listened to the audiobook version. One red flag is that she admits the term co-dependent has been confused and abused but still pretends to be an expert while claiming she refuses the title of guru. She still has issues.Another irritant is she never stands on her own two feet and talks about her co-dependency. She uses clients as shields. I got tired of waiting for a true stance. There was never one coming. The definition of co-dependence has been thrown together for prescription purposes. Many of the symptoms can be transferred to those who've experienced trauma. Basically, she's not prized, there's nothing new this woman is doing, she's kept everything clinical, ambiguous, and blaming those who've been traumatized by those with psychopathic disorders and addictions.This country was built to protect criminals. Many countries were started by convicts such as Australia. This book doesn't help anyone learn about the nature of their abuse and why they are attracted to abusers. This only helps them to blame themselves."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"To begin, I bought this book because I wanted to understand what codependent actually meant, seems everyone has a different notion as you will see if you buy this CD. Author bores you with every one of her colleagues definitions of co-dependant, which vary greatly so by the end of the first disc you are prepared to accept that every single person that ever lived is codependent. \\"You are co-dependant if you like to drink water, if you hate to drink water, if you have trouble sleeping, if you sleep too much...: COME ON! It was laughable at times. SOOOO Long, SOOOOO many twists and turns and qualifications and re-qualifications and anecdotes Very little substance. From the start I wondered who I might give it to when I had finished but wait..I cant do that, that is codependent behaviour, sharing anything with anyone is codependent, as is being selfish!Book is tailored toward alcoholics and really could have been edited to half the length.

I saw myself on every page. Reading this book was the first step taken on a solid path of recovery. This path includes reading this book, doing the exercises, attending CoDA meetings and working weekly with a sponsor, going through the twelve steps. Ms. Beattie gives one of the best definitions of codependency I have seen and takes her time doing so. It is a complicated disease, with many strains and deviations. She captures it all very well. I could relate to the stories shared within and found the exercises to be very helpful to my recovery. If one thinks they might be codependent and/or is struggling with an addict in their life, this book will provide comfort, valuable information and hope.Juliet A.

Very informative, helpful, and draws out the unrealized traits, habits, & needs.

I now see what I must do to change it. . . and that's the HARD part!"},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"I found this to be very accurate in many areas of the codependent personality. Not every characteristic is applicable to each person but there are enough that you can find those that apply to you and can benefit from seeing how it fits you and how you can change those characteristics that you no longer want in your personality and life.I like the writing exercises at the end of each chapter. If you recognize those qualities in yourself that are described in a chapter and want to change you have the opportunity to write down what you see in yourself and the changes you desire to make. You can also go back and read what you wrote to see if you are doing what you committed to do."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"I recently hit a bottom in my life and would highly recommend this book.

The first one deals with a collection of case studies, and you can see my review I recently posted for that book. This book is a much better written, clearer and more insightful. I really love the authors writing style, and am not sure if I love her style or her editor's oversight. LOL In either case it is a very smooth read and builds upon each chapter. I always enjoy books that have short chapters that are real good because you can't put them down. However in this book, I found I was doing some real good introspection and analysis of different relationships and therefore needed some time to digest the material. A great read, great insight and I found it very enlightening, very insightful and very liberating. I highly recommend it, and can easily see why it sold over 5 million copies. Don't be afraid.

I am now 23, but little did I know that co-dependency was causing just as much stress in my \\"life\\". I spent the past 4 years of my life in an abusive relationship. Mostly it was emotional and mental abuse, but it got physical at the end.It was my fault, though--I would rather be with him than alone. I was so dependent on my alcoholic, angry fiancee, that his life became mine. And it was not a good life. I thought he was the only one who would love me despite my disorders...so I took the abuse.I took blame for things that were not my fault. I had sex when I did not want to. I was fearful of his every move, and dependent on his every move. I was put down every single day. I was made fun of. I was dehumanized. But I frequently thought, \\"I'm no good, no one else would want me, and therefore I have to put up with this.\\"But please, believe me (and Melody!) when I say: Don't put up with it ANY LONGER! I feel I wasted 4 years of my life...which really wasn't \\"my\\" life at all.I'm still struggling, but the bravest thing I have ever done was leave that man.

She had been married and divorced twice. I don't fit the pattern of codependent, but the book provided tremendous insight into those who have been married to alcoholics, and others with various self inflicted problems, and what they needed to do to take charge of their own lives and not try to control the lives of those who weren't willing to solve their own problems. It was worth the time it took to read it."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"I bought this book first for myself and then ended up buying a second copy for a good friend of mine who I feel could benefit greatly from it. What I love about it is that it's so easy and simple to read. It's written in a way that puts it in very simple terms that anyone can 'get'... and cuts right to the chase of the heart of codependence and where the problem exists. It is eye-opening and explains what we've been doing wrong this whole time. Before this book, I had been speaking what I like to call a codependent \\"emotional language\\". You learn to speak a whole new emotional language after realizing that being codependent was a very unhealthy way of seeing the world and dealing with others in relationships. It opened my mind to a healthier me, a real SELF, and taught me about boundaries and how to interact more powerfully in all of my relationships.

This is a human thing to do, and we need to learn new ways of being effective in our life."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"Over the years I have purchased this book numerous times, lent it to people in difficult relationships, and usually they don't return it--beause it is so good, they need to keep it. It explains issues and options in easily understood language. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"This is the book that started it all. I know it is clich&eacute; but, this book has changed my life and my thinking...I was talking to my father on the phone one day and I was explaining to him how I have no problem exercising and eating right when Otty is gone but I can't seem to keep it up when he is home. My father then asked me if I wanted to know what that was called...he told me it was called co-dependence and that I should start learning about this by reading a book called Co-dependent No More. I pretty much ran out right away and purchased the book.Now, I have never been a big advocate for self-improvement books, but I have to say that this book was very enlightening. Co-dependency has a different definition for everyone. This book made me delve into my own retched thoughts and confront them head on.This book made me realize that I have a voice and an opinion and both matter just as much as the next person. I realized that I can make decisions and not have to worry if my opinion is what other people may think or want. My opinion is exactly that...my opinion. It is okay to have an opinion that is different than someone else's.I also learned that I need to detach myself from the people in my life that cause me harm...emotionally, physically, doesn't matter...Though I may not struggle with an abusive alcoholic, I still struggle with the internal doubts and feelings of self worthlessness. I have learned that I do not need to immerse myself so deeply in someone else's life that I lose myself. I can keep my individuality while sharing my life with another. If we have conflicting views...that's alright.When I first read this book, I figure that I would not post my feelings about it because they were too personal. However, now having some distance from the book and being able to employ the lessons I have learned, I am able to share myself with others.I am not perfect and it is absolutely acceptable for me to let other people know this. Maybe, by sharing these thoughts, someone else might be inspired to read this book and better themselves as well."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"To me, it is a 5-star item. It allowed me to face my own problems which were contributing to my marriage problems. Once I lost the fear of losing my husband, learned to defend my interests, our marriage improved. I feel that now he has more respect for me, more trust in me. Amazingly, when I stood up for myself and thought it will end my marriage, he actually communicated his concerns, and we worked things out. Don't get me wrong, marriage is a full time job, but now I have the qualifications for the 'position'.The book also helped me defend myself and other co-workers at my work place, and I have won every battle with my boss and earned the respect of my co-workers.The book allowed me to lose fear over a divorce, getting fired, or getting dishonored by my family who disagree with some of my choices. I am an honest, loyal person who has a lot to offer, and I deserve to be loved and respected. After applying the techniques from the book, I gained the love and respect of others, which convinced me that my principles are right, and standing up for the higher good was well worth the fight."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"This is the best book I've ever read about letting go of unhealthy attachments to people and the pain associated with it. I highly recommend it to anyone who has ever loved an addictive person, an abusive person, or lived in a family with dysfunctional behavior. To me, the best lessons explained in this book are &quot;you cannot change other people - they will only change when they are ready&quot; and &quot;detaching from an unhealthy situation doesn't mean detaching from the love you feel for a person, it means setting yourself free from the pain of your involvement with them.&quot;"},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"I finished reading this book and turned back to the front and started reading it again. How could anyone describe me so perfectly and give me the help and guidance I need when they don't even no who I am.The best self help book I have ever picked up especially after living with an alcoholic for 32 years.It will be a crutial part of making a new, healhty woman out of me.Thank you for this book!"},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"I laughed and groaned my way through this book, recognizing myself and my loved ones throughout the pages. A good book for those with a severe codependency problem, or those who simply want to improve their relationships with Self and others. A bit heavy on the \\"positive thinking/love yourself first\\" mantras, but solid instruction and methods for better relating. I Highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"I read this book when it first came out, and since that time have viewed Melody Beattie as a role model author for emotional well being.This well being starts with you. In this classic book, you will learn and understand a lot more about what it means to stop jumping through hoops to get the responses you want from another person, and/or try to fix them. You will understand more about creating your own healthy boundaries, and what exactly is within or completely out of your control.Trying to fix, heal, save, rescue another person leaves us nothing short of depleted, and miserable. I know, because I lived it too. The good news is that once you are aware of the patterns, and exactly how to turn them around, all of a sudden your entire life turns around for the better from the inside out. And this, is the one (and only) thing you can control.I applaud Melody for her heartfelt courage in writing this book as well as her other ones. Each one is special. This is the classic that started it all, and is well deserving of 10 stars!Barbara Rose, Ph.D. author of Know Yourself: A Woman's Guide to Wholeness, Radiance & Supreme Confidence and Stop Being the String Along: A Relationship Guide to Being THE ONE"},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"NOT taking on their burdens by shielding them from their reckless behavior. The best way to honor someone is to empower them to solve their own problems ... not enable their disease into destructive ends. Codependance confuses love with pity, rescue with romance, and sees unhealthy entanglement as partnership. The danger is that such relationships can last for years because it is frighteningly and overwhelmingly difficult to break away from one another. This book is a classic in preventing and releasing such terrible couplings.Caretaking is not about caring for the other person. It is about control and a \\"you owe me\\" mentality. It's human to expect things to go both ways. The challenge is to watch yourself so the tendancy doesn't have power over you like a compulsive machine."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"This book describes anyone who is in any kind of co-dependent relationship. It opens your eyes to the real you, what makes you tick, why you tick that way and how to heal yourself. It focuses on how to change your life from chaos to happiness, restoring sanity and begin liking and even loving yourself. It opens your eyes to the types of behaviour patterns we exhibit which actually make these co-dependent relationships even more chaotic. Painfully honest. It will restore hope, give encouragement and incentive to those who seek healing in their lives from the pain of being involved in a relationship with an addicted person."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"Melody Beattie, a former addict, used to hate codependents (which she defines as \\"people who have let another person's behavior afect him or her, and who is obsessed with controlling that person's behavior\\"). Codepdendents are most frequently the family members of alcoholics or drug users, but the definition is broad. Beattie thought codependents were hostile and detrimental to the recovery process. When she went through codependency herself, her eyes were opened to the world that these people live in, and to the potential for recovery if one can identify the problem and take positive steps to improve their life.This book is a quick and easy read, and it will hit home if you have an alcoholic or a codependent (or both) in your life. Beattie provides example scenarios of codependecy, expounds upon the traits and self-defeating behaviors of codepdency, and provides self-help steps to move beyond codepdency. Although this isn't marketed as a workbook, Beattie provides checklists and open-ended questions at the end of each chapter, and a blank journal to record your reponses would be an excellent companion to the book.Highly recommended to anyone who has an alcoholic or drug-addicted family member. This can be an eye-opener and a life-changer."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"This (and the sequel) are the only self-help books I've ever read. It changed my life, and that is exceedingly rare. It validated my feelings and gave me the tools to cope with the issues in my life. As I read it, I was amazed and delighted to find that others had said and felt the same things I was saying and feeling. Best of all, there were solutions! If you are co-dependant, keep these books nearby for quick reference and read them religiously. You may often need a refresher. It's like a mental shot in the arm!"},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"This book helped me to see the side of myself that gets hooked into situations that are unhealthy for me, and my reactions to it. I felt like Melody is a friend who tells you the truth without her ego getting in the way. This is one of the books I go to to when I'm checking out that I am on the right path and that I'm not crazy. Her writing is simple and to the point without alot of fancy language that makes an already insecure person feel better able to grab the message. Face it, if you are reading this book, your mind and emotions are probably in turmoil, and kindness is the key to recovery from what's eating you. This is one of my books I no longer loan out, because people don't return them!"},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"I read and reread this book many times.

If you get wound up and anxious about other people's lives, moods, emotions, feelings, etc., to the point that you're sacrificing your own needs, you're probably co-dependent and you can live a much happier life if you start addressing your co-dependent habits.Thanks to this book I am taking better care of myself--the person who all these years needed much more help than what I was willing to bend-over-backwards for other people."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"This book was pretty helpful in some ways.

Friends told me it would be a huge adjustment but, I just &quot;poo pooed,&quot; them and said,&quot;no,&quot; I am prepared for it; and besides, it will be a wonderful experience for her to live away from home and experience life in the dorm. As a single mother, I had come to depend upon my daughter in numerous social situations. We were friends who went to movies, dinner, watched some TV together, took trips together.I began to count on her to be my partner for any plays or other events that were on our community calendar. I realize today, that I had become overly dependent on my child to be a source of company for me.I had not developed enough outside resources of my own. After she left for school, I began to slowly slip emotionally - I just could not seem to get myself together - I could not stop calling, writing or e-mailing; I was totally nuts and, so was my life! She finally told me herself, to back off and give her some space. It was difficult to accept those words but I knew she was right; I was taking away her dignity as a 19 year old adult. The book has helped me so much to realize that I need to focus on making my own life the fullest that it can be and, not put that burden on any of my three children. Thanks Melody."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"CODEPENDENT NO MORE is the book that introduced the word &quot;codependent&quot; to the world, and it is the book that set me on my road to recovery (when I was only 17). I don't know where I would be without this book. Indeed, the insights this book offered me and the hope it gave me was revolutionary for that time in my life.So, what exactly *is* a codependent, you ask? Well, Melody defines a codependent as someone who believes that their happiness comes from one specific person, and then they become obsessed with controlling that person. Melody also describes that many codependents get jolts of self-esteem by &quot;rescuing&quot; people, but that the self-esteem can often turn to resentment and blame due to the stress of being burdened by others' problems. Sometimes alcohol and other addictions are involved in these situations and relationships, sometimes they aren't.Looking back, I see that CODEPENDENT NO MORE set me on the road to my current spiritual path, the self-study book about spiritual psychotherapy called A COURSE IN MIRACLES. The Course says that our only real problem is the belief in the &quot;separation from God.&quot; The Course says that we make many &quot;special relationships&quot; as substitutes for God. In many ways, the two concepts - &quot;codependent&quot; and &quot;special relationship&quot; - are very similar, and they both have a similar cure: the acceptance of God as our only security.Soon after finding CODEPENDENT NO MORE, I wrote Melody Beattie a letter of thanks for the inspiration. She kindly replied, and gave me information I had requested. So, this book is a landmark in my life."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"Okay, yes, sobriety was the beginning. Until I could stop using drugs and alcohol, I was unable to really change me. The journey of sobriety was the beginning. Through sponsors and therapists, of course in my own time (I'm stubborn.)I was ready to look at How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring For Myself. The relationship I had with myself was the first one I needed to look at. Realizing my behavioral addictions - was one of the most baffling areas of life - I am the only one who can help myself, by hearing myself and following the advise of others. This book helps. It's the effort I put into my own recovery - by reading, working and following the activities in this book. Life does not have to be the terrifying world it was. Life is a process.

I spent 20 years with a husband who told me how to think, feel and behave. I didn't even remember who I was until I broke free of the relationship. A year later I met a man who did the same thing to me but in a different way. Another 20 years gone. We're still together but things are different now since I finally decided I needed someone in my life who would treat me with kindness and consideration. He finally did.

Let me tell you it is life changing. Each chapter deals specifically for how to gain control of your own life. I know I highlighted just about every page. I also refer back to book when certain circumstances come up. I have even bought the book for a family member and will continue to recommend it to other individuals. If you find yourself drained and trying to take care of others to much, this book is for you. As Always, the best thing is ordering from Amazon. I purchase the used books. The prices and service can not be beat."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"I am or was definitively codependent and this book was very helpful to me. I needed this book and it's done a lot of good. That said, it actually sucks pretty hard.The points and thoughts in the book are so disorganized as to be incomprehensible in some places. They are repeated, sometimes a few chapters later, sometimes a few sentences later. It was not written by a professional, and it does not seem to have been edited by a professional. There are contradictions, digressions, and parts that are actually confusing enough that I do not know how to talk about them as I still do not understand what they are saying.It's really targeted towards codependents involved with alcoholics, and definitely towards Christians. If the book was forthcoming about that, say, on the cover, that would have been helpful. Alcohol is not a problem for me and those words are wasted on me. Personally, I find that the inclusion of religious material not only narrows the appeal and usefulness of the book, but backpedals on the core message. Jesus is the ultimate co-dependent; Christian mythology teaches that he took on the problems of the world as his own. Nobody can do that, and the useful parts of book will help you understand that.It's a lot of work to read. You have to sift, filter, and even re-write it to get any use out of it, but if you're not learning the things you need to learn elsewhere, give it a shot because if you ARE codependent and the choice is between doing nothing about it and reading this book, it is in your best interest to READ IT. It can and will help you understand what is wrong with you and maybe point you in the direction of fixing it.PS - If you need to read this book and are not reading this book, I'm going to get very anxious and do what I have to do to get you to read it so I can feel ok about myself again. I only do it because I care about you so much."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"This book isn't a bad read, but the writer focuses heavily on alcoholism and those affected by it, and there's a strong focus on religion ( god ) which started to get on my nerves.I think everyone would take something good from this book, but it's definitely not the be-all-and-end-all of codependency,"},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"This is my second copy, I left the last on a plane.

She has walked through the trenches, fought the battle and lived not only to tell about it, but to offer hope for those of us who are still in the battlefield or still shell shocked from the trauma of it all. I recognized myself in her descriptions of a co-dependent, sometimes painfully so. I had to put the book down a time or two, because I felt she came right off the page to knock me into reality. I heard of the book from Dr. Irene's verbal abuse site [...] which stated this book is a must read for those of us with codependent behavior. I have to agree. I am looking forward to applying my newfound knowledge and the confidence acquired from it in oncoming life situations. I hope to become my own new hero."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"I was going through one relationship after another and blaming the other person every time it ended. After reading this book, I realized that I play just an important part in the relationship as the other person and I need to take responsibility for that part. Not only that, this book made me realize that I can only take control of that part (myself). Since then, I am proud to say that I feel happier and more mature as a person and am currently in a wonderful relationship. Don't get me wrong, this book is not a quick fix. We don't change overnight, but it puts our selves and our relationships in perspective and helps us get on the right track to recover. I am now using another fascinating book called &quot;Rhythm, Relationships, and Transcendence&quot; by Toru Sato that is helping me develop further. It is also a wonderfully helpful book!

It gives a clear insight on how to deal with all types of feelings such as fear, despair, depression, and anger. First the book reveals how to process these feelings rather than deny them and then how to move on to feelings like love, joy, fulfillment, and just feeling okay about yourself in general by giving your life a new spiritual meaning. This book also promotes a healthy relationship with yourself and others by teaching the reader how to take care of himself/herself and create happiness rather than attempting to achieve martyrdom by resenting and controlling others which ultimately manifests into depression and anger. In her private life, the author has moved from an alcoholic and drug addict, a rape victim, a prostitute/stripper, and finally a welfare recipient to a well adjusted best-selling author and a spiritual advisor. Her life itself is a miracle. She has a way of passing the magic and the spiritual techniques that she used to transform her own life to the lives of her readers. I have read all of her books and I recommend them all. I read her meditation book THE LANGUAGE OF LETTING GO daily with my morning coffee.

I found myself completely disagreeing with the author in that she seems to think that her definition of codepedent is a state to be overcome. Nothing could be farther from the truth. One could also define codepedent as passionate, loyal, selfless and honorable. A \\"real\\" friend.While it is true, it is not a good idea to get so wrapped up in someone else's life that you do not have a life of your own, at this point our agreement stops. This author seems to feel that people who care, should not. The friend who interceeds to stop another friend from killing themself, is wrong. They should \\"let them handle their own problems\\". What ever happens- happens. If a drunk kills someone..it is their problem. If a friend is going through anger and takes it out on you, walk away - it is not convient for you. I find this kind of thinking scary. It is what is wrong with our world. No one cares about anyone but themselves. It is what causes the wars and sucide as others feel alone and abondoned by society. Everyone has weakness. Everyone has faults. Everyone needs others. Caring and reaching out is not one of them.Skip this book and go with your own instincts. It's advice Of course do not let anyone run you, but to care with passion and honor is not wrong."},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","review":"This book changed my life.

This is not a review of Calvin, but a review of this reprint of his work. The reprint itself is printed with clarity, and is arranged quite well.

At $30 I thought this was quite reasonable, especially for a paperback reprint. Unfortunately, this is ONLY VOLUME 5 of a five-volume commentary set on the Psalms (I should have known that at 500 or so odd pages that this couldn't be the complete work). The commentary starts in the middle of Psalm 119 and finishes with all the appendixes and indexes. I hate to rate a Calvin commentary at two-stars, but the advertising of this on Amazon is quite misleading and unfortunately priced. To buy an entire set, which isn't even available (I couldn't find one), would be at least $150, which is quite high for paperback volumes.

I would have loved to have known this story back then to tell around the campfire. - - - Three brothers live in a mythical valley where they have a vista of a gorgeous waterfall pouring out of the mountains. The afternoon turns the waterfall to a golden blaze, hence the name Golden River. The two older brothers are very mean and bully the youngest of them and make him do the chores. They are angered to find that one night while they are gone the younger brother gives shelter to a stranger. Arriving back home they throw him out in spite of his warning that he is the West Wind and will return just one time. His return is in the form of a gale force wind that destroys their house. Not only that but the West Wind stops the rainfall into the valley; the farm dries up; the three brothers move to the city. They use some gold that they have to become goldsmiths but spend the profits instead of using some to buy more gold for smithing. The younger brother treasures a gold mug with a face imprinted on it. They tear it away from him and toss it into the kettle to be melted down. Then they leave. The youngest brother hears a voice from the kettle and realizes that it comes from the face that was on the mug. He is asking to be fished out. When the brother does this, the gold face becomes a head and body and sprouts arms and legs and struts about as a dwarf. This is the King of the Golden River. As a reward for the boy's kindnesses he tells the boy the secret of how to turn the river to gold to make himself rich.- - That's all I will divulge. - - There is a moral, of course. This tale is short and delightful; written as present for the young girl who later becomes his wife."},{"Title":"The king of the Golden River,","review":"The brothers Schwartz and Hans seem to have it all - a rich valley in the mountains that provides for them handsomely. But, instead of being happy and generous, the brothers are mean and miserly. And when they mistreat Southwest Wind, Esquire, his curse brings about their downfall.

This book was his only work of fiction, but it is quite good, with a charming story and a firm morality. Also, part of what makes this book interesting is that it was influential on later writers of Fantasy literature, making this something of a pioneering work in the genre.I highly recommend this book. It's definitely one that should be read by the young, and the young-at-heart!"},{"Title":"The king of the Golden River,","review":"This is an amusing if slightly odd story. I guess that Ruskin considered himself such an intellectual jack of all trades that he'd a have a go at the genre, if only to say he'd done it.The story is built from familiar parts. There's a Cinderella theme, built around a young boy and his two cruel brothers. There's also a theme of the wandering stranger who, after being treated well or poorly, rewards the doer equally well or poorly. In fact, that was such a cool idea that Ruskin threw in two magical beings quite independent of each other, making the front and back halves of this little creature look like thay came from two different animals.It's a pleasant enough fairy tale, but not one that I'd spend a lot of time hunting down.//wiredweirdPS: This reviews a different edition of the story, apparently not listed at Amazon.

His words are sometimes poetic, and often very inspiring. But some of his conclusions are suspect and must be read critically. Don't read this for an introduction into Jesus history; but do read if you can remain critical.In some ways, he illuminates a sensitive Jesus, and a Jesus who is truly inspiring. But he bashes the Book of John so unfairly that I ended up questioning the legitimacy of most of what he wrote subsequent to that. For instance, he positions John as the book most often quoted by the anxious, uptight, and intolerant. He insinuates that John's book created the foundation for all subsequent crusades of intolerance, from the actual Crusaders to anti-Semitism. Anyone knows that that isn't what John is all about. Anyone knows that in the mind of a madman, any passage of the Bible can be made to serve perverse needs. Right now we see extremists justifying mass destruction in the name of Islam (which most Muslims are deeply troubled by). Islam is not to blame. Neither are St. John or John the Elder to blame for anyone who takes their message of divine love and uses it to justify hatred and violence."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"\\"For those who believe in God, no explanation is necessary. For those who do not, no explanation is possible.\\" John LaFarge This is the third in a series, which is great for readers, and I am going to get volume two, as I never knew \\"How The Irish Saved Civilization\\" was the first volume. The first volume was wonderful, and yes I may lack a degree of objectivity due to my last name. However if measured by it's popularity alone, it is a book that was enjoyed by many. I was a bit skeptical when I read the title due to its sweeping nature; I thought it was a bit of Irish Hyperbole, which is many things, but rare tis not. I cannot comment on the second book yet, but I liked this volume at least as much as the first if not more. Mr. Cahill has the ability to tread forcefully and authoritatively on thin ice, thin ice defined here is religion as a topic. It takes a deft mind and one filled with knowledge and sensitivity to comment, much less write a book, without alienating someone, or worse hurting someone. If this feat is possible, I believe Mr. Cahill has come as close as a person can to doing so. He brings writings and their authors to life, especially with Paul, and by doing so, the subject of their writings Christ. I thought he did a tremendous job of demonstrating how certain prayers and stories evolved, and how Ancient Greek, Hebrew, and Aramaic are not interchangeable, and that those who bear the responsibility for translating original texts, have to be extraordinarily good, omit any editorial, and still deal with single words that can change interpretations no matter how careful a translation is. English is a long trip from the original writings, and he demonstrates this without passing judgment. The potential for meanings to become open to question, when they may have been established as a given, is delicate at the least, he shows the History, makes his case, and does so with care. In many instances, even with the linguistic twists, the essence of the meaning is there, and he is to be given a great deal of credit for his scholarship, demonstrated through his explanations. He brings in humor but does so respectfully. In describing the talking statue and its role in the Apocalypse, as a \\"publicity department for the beast.......... spin doctor... and media consultant\\", as an image that \\"encourages mass adoration (long before television or fanzines were thought of).\\" he makes the reading approachable. He makes the men and women that were the earliest reporters/recorders of Christ, people that can be understood, not just frescoes on ceilings, walls, or paintings on massive canvas. An excellent book, by a talented Author, that should appeal to most if not all. There are no preconditions required to read, learn, and enjoy this man's writing. Just as being Irish was not required for volume one."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"This book is sandwiched by two excellent beginning chapters that focus on the social and historical context of Jesus (&quot;the world before&quot;) and by two very finely done final chapters on the impact of Christ's message up to our own time (&quot;the world after&quot;). I didn't find the material in between, in particular the chapters on Paul and Luke, to be as satisfying. This material seemed more theologically-oriented, and I came away with the impression that Mr. Cahill is not quite at home with theology. An established scholar could very easily pick apart his arguments and points of reference. I didn't feel that Mr. Cahill had much of credible substance to add about Paul, the most controversial and fascinating of the apostles. For that reason I gave the book 3 stars (whereas I'd give How the Irish Saved Civilization 5 stars in a heartbeat) although I hasten to add that Desire... is definitely worth reading. Mr. Cahill's writing is always eloquent and insightful."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"Cahill has written some excellent books, but this is emphatically not one of them. Jesus is quite simply the most transcendently important figure in the history of theology. Moslems, Christians of all variety, Bahai, Torah Observant Messianic Jews all consider the religious inspiration of Jesus manifest. At least as significant, great moral leaders and thinkers from Spinoza (who considered Jesus the greatest of all Jewish prophets) to Schweitzer (who began the study for the historical Jesus) did not doubt for a moment the unique spiritual importance of Jesus.One other online reviewer noted the famouns C.S. Lewis analysis that Jesues was either insane, evil, or divine. It is not necessary to go that far (Moslems and several Messianic Jewish groups simply consider Jesus a great prophet). But a &quot;nice guy&quot; whose teachings endured and grew through more intense persecution during its first several centuries than any in world history is not just a &quot;nice guy.&quot;"},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"I think the &quot;Jesus debate&quot; of the past 10-15 years has largely been a good thing. Readers should be aware that it inspired the generally excellent PBS series a few years back, &quot;From Jesus to Christ.&quot;Cahill's book doesn't add very much to the discussion - he seems to have picked and chosen what he likes from certain scholars he prefers (Cahill is not a New testament scholar), and re-packaged them with his own lively personal opinions. For someone new to Christianity, but adequately educated, this book might have some provocative value. But for those of us who have labored long in the &quot;Jesus of Faith&quot; vineyard (i.e. who strive for a daily relational faith wherein we somehow try to incarnate Jesus' teachings for society) it certainly isn't essential.And like other reviewers have noted, Cahill doesn't do full justice to the implications of John's Gospel for the Christian community. In its grand historical and symbolic narrative, John is the result of two generations' struggling under the Spirit's tutelage to make sense of the Incarnation, and reaching a magisterial conclusion as to what Jesus must mean in the largest sense, not only at the close of the first century but into the future as well."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"Thomas Cahill has written a series of &quot;hinges of history&quot; books in which he investigates how a few people made major differences in the advancement of history. This book is about a single person, Jesus. The authors translation and thoughts give an immediate and real sense of who the man was and how civilization is different because of him. Cahill is simply a very good writer, which makes anything he writes worth reading. In this case the subject of his book is fascinating by himself. I often found my self disagreeing with Cahill's opinions (e.g. that Jesus thought that an &quot;end time&quot; was fast approaching) but his reasoning was well stated and the evidence is always mixed. I do wish he had stated clearly the Mary the Magdalene (her name is Mary; she is from the city of Magdala, like today's Jimmy the Greek) was never identified in the gospels as a prostitute before he made jokes about it. Cahill clearly makes that point, but only after he jokes about her &quot;profession.&quot; Nevertheless, his humor is a large part of what makes the book enjoyable and the obvious respect he has for Jesus and all the apostles is another plus. I especially recommend his description of the world pre and post Jesus and his chapter on Paul. PS Don't skip the footnotes."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"There is wide interest about the life of Jesus, Paul and other early figures of Christianity and this book offers much more information than can be obtained by simply reading passages in the Bible. However, I have certain reservations that cause me to take some of the information with a grain of salt. I recall reading an account of an interview with a famous author about his newly published book. Literary critics had developed various theories about the \\"deeper meanings\\" in a particular passage, and the author was asked which of the theories, if any, were correct. The author replied \\"none of them\\" because he had intended no \\"deeper meaning\\" in that particular passage. I am sure that if the author had died before revealing this position that the scholarly debate over the \\"deeper meaning\\" would still be continuing to this day.In science there is a vague concept I like to call \\"The Sufficiency of Information\\". It is possible to take measurements in which the readings are close to the limits of accuracy of the equipment. Trying to force meaning out of the data is in this case very misleading and close to the phenomenon of seeing faces and other shapes in the clouds. At such a point the resultant meaning is coming from the mind of the observer and not from the data itself.In Cahill's book he discusses the different Gospel versions of some of the accounts in the life of Jesus. One of these struck me particularly as bordering on the phenomenon I discussed above. Mark 10:29 \\"There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel's, ... \\"Significance is attached and analyzed regarding the slightly differing wordings in the Matthew and Luke versions (e.g. Luke omits \\"sisters\\" and \\"lands\\", Matthew omits Gospel's\\").Perhaps I am just a skeptic at heart, but it seems to me that just as one can not see the message and beauty of a painting by examining the brushstrokes under a magnifying glass, one can not appreciate the intent of the messages in the Gospels by analyzing in minute detail the particular choice of words used by the different human authors. If we believe that God inspired these messages, it seems to me that he would not necessarily consider that there is great significance in the minutia we see here, but instead would prefer that we stand back and focus on the important messages that the authors were inspired to convey.If we are not careful we may not see the forest for all those pesky trees."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"I have to agree with the words of other reviewers who say that Cahill presents his own suppositions as facts. If you are not well-founded in Bible teaching, you could easily be convinced that what he says is &quot;gospel&quot;, when it clearly is not. He does give a refreshing picture of history before Christ comes on the scene, and this may be his strong point....that is, painting history in strokes that brings it to life. After reading this book, I feel alot more informed about Alexander and his father. But, as a devout Catholic/Christian, and a student of Scripture for 25 years, I found it irritating that he would pick and choose isolated bits of scripture to illustrate a very subjective point of his own, while choosing to ignore points that would have disproved his personal theories. As long as you don't swallow his mental meaderings, entertaining though they may be, as Truth, you can enjoy this book for what it is...One man's opinions. I mean, it is ludicrous for him to pretend that he knows St. Paul's or St. Peter's motives for doing anything...much less, &quot;...what Jesus REALLY meant when He said this was...&quot;etc, etc. One must maintain a careful perspective in reading this treatment of Holy Texts. If the reader can do this, he/she will go unharmed."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"Cahill wrote a solid, readable book. This book makes the time before, during and after the birth and death of Jesus Christ tangible to the reader of his work. In this book Cahill sets up the cultural setting (important in any latent look at history) before Jesus Christ's birth, the time of the Roman Empire. The time during Christ's life is described in a way that certainly gave me a different perspective on that time period. The time after Christ does a fine job of documenting how Christ impacted the world. No matter what you believe this book is done well, and is fairly balanced. A good read. B+Joseph Dworak"},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"Thomas Cahill is attempting something very difficult here. He is trying to tell the story of the person about whom everyone else has already told the story. He is trying to stand in the cataract of Jesus scholarship and grab out a few choice coins (not rocks), without getting drenched by a spray of technical verbiage. He is trying to write a biography that is chatty and colloquial, but also based on clear reasoning and sound scholarship. He is trying to write in a fair-minded manner about someone everyone either loves or claims to like in a deconstructionist manner that, finally, amounts to something resembling fear.I have read quite a few similar attempts by non-scholars, or by scholars on Sunday afternoons, to do something like this, and I feel this one comes off pretty well. Probably the closest comparisons might be A. N. Wilson's skeptical Jesus, A Life (inferior), or Philip Yancey's mushy-evangelical The Jesus I Never Knew (not bad).As you can see from reviews below, Cahill manages to offend a lot of Christians and secularists. Considering all the chances he is taking, both with style and substance, one might call that an accomplishment.My advice would be to read a chapter before deciding if this is your style, if possible. I almost always found his arguments reasonable and informed, and I have read a lot of these books, on all sides. For me, the fact that he has literary pizzazz, and is not afraid to make a joke, maybe even a pun, does not hurt. This is not a book written by a robot. Cahill treats the text with the respect of relating it to the world of our experience, even if he is sometimes a tad groanish in doing so. Furthermore, while not a scholar, Cahill relies on a few fairly reasonable ones -- no, that does not include anyone in the Jesus Seminar, but unfornately, neither does it include N. T. Wright, in my view the best -- and he brings a fair amount of ecclectic background knowledge to the texts. (I was shocked to find him referring to the Chinese philosopher Yuan Zhiming, for example, who I thought was my secret.)If some disrespectful comment here on John or another Gospel bothers you, try Craig Blomberg's Historical Reliability of the Gospels. If you ae attracted to the subtitle, &quot;The World Before and After Jesus,&quot; but find too little about Jesus' impact on history, I might recommend Christianity on Trial, the fascinating works of Vishal Mangalwadi, or the relevent chapter of my own Jesus and the Religions of Man. If you're offended by Cahill because he makes bad jokes, I can't help you there. But I think he is ultimately serious about Jesus, and I'm with him there.David Marshall / christthetao@msn.com"},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"I have not completed the entire book but halfway through and each successive mistake in the format makes me a little more than irritated.

Also, there are formatting issues where there are no spaces between a period and the start of a sentence. Hopefully there will be some type of validation for Kindle format books in the future?"},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"Thomas Cahill capably describes the cultural backdrop at the advent of Jesus of Nazareth. However, a thorough investigation of how Jesus' life affected the course of Western history is not to be found in this volume.Expecting a thorough treatment of the trendline of history before & after Jesus' life, one is dismayed to find that the bulk of the book is spent developing Cahill's own peculiar Christian theology. We have here a Jesus who is real and gritty enough to satisfy believer and skeptic, but a Jesus who is known as Teacher, rather than profound miracle-working Messiah of Jew and Gentile alike. This is the kinder, gentler Jesus who castigates ONLY the religious while embracing mainly the politically and economically disenfranchised. Not Jesus the spotless Sacrifical lamb, but one who through suffering ushers in the theology of redemptive suffering. Those who suffer the most among us must join in the universal redemption, and all, the believer and unbeliever alike, constitute the body of the suffering Cosmic Christ.Cahill's treatment of Paul is at once sympathetic and filtered. This Paul is a careful theologian. Paul does not see Jesus as divine, but as the holy instructor. He does not rail against extremist Jews who like himself chose to persecute Jesus' followers from town to town. Only John is singled out as so anti-Jewish. Rather Paul is seen as one who developed a Christology short of divine, while John goes overboard and sees Jesus as both God and man, which Cahill finds problematic and unnecessary. Apparently it is John who is responsible for twenty centuries of Jewish persecution at the hands of \\"christians\\", which Cahill asserts but does not support.On the whole, a stimulating read but neither great history nor defensible theology."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"This is an example of the worst kind of history now being written--an embarrassing &quot;personal&quot; commentary on selected historical evidence with a biased and highly editorial slant. The author is much too prominent in the flow of the narrative, as if a reader cares what he was thinking or what are his feelings on various data. One can't help asking over and over again while reading: where did he get that fact? How did he come to that conclusion? what makes him think we care how HE feels? This is a highly irresponsible piece of &quot;scholarship.&quot; For example: how does he know what the exact physical attributes of SS Peter and Paul? Has he considered the arrogance, offensiveness, or superior air of his comment that &quot;there can be little doubt that Mary was not the Ever Virgin of of subsequent popular piety?&quot; (p.97) or how about his juvenile interjections, present throughout the text, like his suggestion of how the Jews would have reacted to Jesus' command not to look on on woman with lust (&quot;Earth to Jesus: Hello!&quot;) (p. 83) The dumbing down of history has its new patron saint."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"I try to read this book every Holy Week because Thomas Cahill does an excellent job of framing the centrality of Jesus in history and supporting his case for his decision to place Him there. I had to buy a new copy this year because my old copy had not been returned by someone I had loaned it to. This is one book that ought to be on every Christian's bookshelf and read frequently. It is a book of hope, awe and faith that demonstrates how radical the message of Christ was in the world and how radical it continues to be after nearly 2000 years. I find it always leaves me with a sense of confidence in the future and humility that God did indeed choose to \\"pitch His tent among us\\"."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"Let me just start with the basics. If you believe Jesus to be the son of God, this book will not change your mind about His role in the world and in granting you salvation. If you do not accept Jesus as the son of God, this book is not going to change your mind either. What Thomas Cahill offers is a well written, if not particularly deep, take on Jesus, how the Gospels attempt to portray Him and how the world changed due to His presence. In contrast to some members the Jesus Seminar, Cahill takes the Epistles of Paul and the Acts of the Apostles seriously in portraying Jesus. Cahill also offers fairly good overviews of the styles of the various Gospel authors and how they reflect different aspects of Jesus. Having said that, this book only barely touches the surface of its subject and that is what proves frustrating about it. You simply can not cover Jesus, the Gospels, and the world before and after Jesus in 300 pages no matter how well the book flows."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"Part of my high regard for this book is based on timing. My own frustration with other men speaking with such over-whelming certainty about God, Christ, life and death had reached a peak, shortly before I picked up this volume. I agree the opening chapters setting the scene about the Greek, Roman and Hebrew world before Christ were at times a bit dense for me (and I generally read alot of history). But from there on out I practically inhaled it. Mr. Cahill managed to both deflate alot of what I believe needed deflating and strongly reafirmed feelings I wasn't even quite sure I had. It works and I'm glad I read it. One side issue: I've seen hundreds of images of the crucifixtion but, I never really \\"got it\\" until reading Mr. Cahill's description. He made it more real and more awful than even Mr. Gibson's film. After reading some of these other reviews I'm reminded how polarizing an issue faith/religion can be. But after reading this volume I felt energized about my own personal leap of faith. Thanks Mr. Cahill."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills is a somewhat interesting overview of Christianity and its impact on the world. Cahill has a gift for lively exposition. It's certainly not a boring theological composition. Ultimately, though, I found the work to be a disappointment due to the way in which the details are not brought together in a unifying fashion. Cahill divides his look at Jesus into separate chapters. There's, for example, the Jesus according to Paul(the cosmic Christ), the Jesus according to Luke(the gentile messiah), the Jesus according to John(the word made flesh). True, each NT writer brings his own perspective to the table, but one doesn't get the sense from Cahill that they're writing about the same person. The different portraits don't add up to a coherent whole. A careful reading of the gospels and Paul's epistles reveal one Jesus seen from different angles. As an analogy, take an elementary school teacher. She can be described by the various groups she interacts with: students see one side of her, fellow teachers see another, her family sees another, yet she's still the same person. It's the same with the various descriptions of Jesus.Cahill makes a number of assertions about various details without any backup evidence. For example, he dates the 1st letter of John to the early 2nd century. Now, this may or may not be the case, but surely a little reasoning is in order. Instead, in his endnotes he refers the reader to read the works of the eminent scholar, Raymond E. Brown, not something most readers are likely to do. Another problem is that throughout the book he seems to espouse the view that Jesus was merely a human exalted by God(Adamic Christology) in contrast to the view of pre-existence Christology(the view that Jesus was God before the incarnation). I don't think this view can be wedded to what is actually written in the NT. He does provide an explanation in the endnotes, but I would have preferred a more detailed explanation in the main body of the book.Cahill does seem to assume the general reliability of the gospel accounts with a few exceptions. He also seems to accept the resurrection(of one sort or another) and other miracles of Jesus but with some reservations. For example, he writes, &quot;...these stories accrued to Jesus in the course of development of oral tradition and that by the time the evangelists came along there were already set &quot;wonder stories&quot; meant to prove that Jesus was the promised Messiah. A careful analysis of the texts of the gospels, however, has convinced many scripture scholars that several, perhaps even a majority, of the basic miracle stories go back to the most primitive layer of the oral tradition - that is, to the testimony of the original eyewitnesses&quot;. He also takes brief jabs at the Jesus Seminar, Barbara Thiering, and John Spong.The best parts of the book are where he contrasts the tenor of the world before and after Jesus. He compares, for example, the warlike tendencies of the Romans to Jesus' message of love and compassion. Augustus was called the 'son of god', but he was certainly no 'Just one': compare pax romana to &quot;peace I give to you&quot;. He describes the church as the first egalitarian society. He also includes a defense (of sorts) of Paul. Christians will be glad to know that he apparently wasn't a misogynist and he didn't endorse slavery. In fact, as Cahill explains, it was the very writings of Paul which provided the impetus to abolish slavery in later centuries.Overall the book gives a mixed result. For those interested in Jesus and Christianity this is one of many books that can be consulted, but it shouldn't be the only one."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"Oh wait -- that's another matter.Thomas Cahill's third outing on the hinges of history brings us to Jesus Christ, and appropriately so, for so much of the word 'hinges' on this person (and we'll define that word more closely in a moment) in many, often unknowing ways. Obvious hinges are the calendar which, even when modified to be BCE/CE rather than BC/AD cannot escape the fact that break is with this phenomenon.Cahill has taken up the task not of showing who Jesus is, either as person (and that can be God-man, special prophet, political activist, or mythological figure) but rather to show some of the differences, a before-and-after, if you will, of what the world was and came to be due to the influence of this person, which obviously requires an examination of the influences on other persons, too.Cahill uses ancient historians, modern scholarship, Biblical texts, and simple logic and reason to show influences and changes brought about by the Jesus Movement/Christianity. Packed with details written in an interesting manner, Cahill manages to interest, challenge and enlighten all at the same time.Put together with the other two books (Gift of the Jews, which might serve as a prequel, and How the Irish Saved Civilisation, which carries Christianity further), this trilogy is a good introduction to the history of modern theology, philosophy, intellectual sensibilities, and how the world owes so much that is never quite realised to so few."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"Those who read history regularly know there are two types of history writers: those who bring history alive in fresh and exciting ways and those who duly record the facts in a dry and technical manner. Thomas Cahill is definitely an example of the former; his writings resonate with the reader and his books read more like page-turning novels than obscure history lessons. Not surprisingly, these qualities are evident in Desire of the Everlasting Hills, the third installment in his \\"Hinges of History\\" series.As he does throughout his series, Cahill brings to light a historic event that forever altered world history and left a lasting influence on civilization. In this case, Cahill recounts the life and teachings of Jesus Christ and the subsequent impact they had on the rest of the world. He opens with a beautiful introduction, explaining why he chose Jesus as a subject for his series. He writes:\\"His name, as everyone knows, was Jesus of Nazareth - or, as the Jews of his own day called him, Yeshua. As everyone knows, he preached a message of mercy, love, and peace and was crucified for his trouble. This unlikely character has long been accounted the central figure of Western civilization. Even now, as we cross to the beginning of the third millennium since his birth, we count our days by his appearance on earth; and, though our supposedly post-Christian society often ignores and even ridicules him, there are no serious suggestions for replacing him as the Icon of the West.\\"Cahill opens with the best and most fascinating chapter of the book, describing the world Jesus was born into. To do this, Cahill traces the impact the Greeks (through Alexander the Great's conquests) and the Romans had on Palestine and the Jewish culture by giving us a whirlwind tour of ancient history.Soon after Alexander was assassinated by his men for forsaking his Macedonian and Greek heritage in favor of adopting the customs and traditions of the newly conquered eastern cultures and for his near maniacal ego which led him to fight unnecessary battles leading to high casualties and low morale, his kingdom was divvied among his lesser generals and subordinates. Cahill writes:\\"Even if, his sights on bigger game, Alexander immediately forgot the Jews, he did not rule them long. Soon after his untimely death, his son by Roxane was put to the sword, as were Roxane herself, Alexander's half-witted brother, Philip, and at last that skillful survivor, the dowager empress Olympias. No blood relative of Alexander's was left alive. The army, which would have none of them on the throne of Macedon, was taking no chances...The greatest empire the world had ever seen was broken up among conspiring officers of the second rank: Antigonus II, son of Philip's legendary general Antigonus the One-Eyed, mounted the throne to control both Macedon and Greece; Ptolemy took Egypt, and the Ptolemaic line would last there in its glorious capital of Alexandria, the bones of Alexander interred in the great mausoleum beside the library, till the last of the line, Cleopatra, would end her own life with an asp at her breast; Seleucus took up rule at Antioch in Syria and from there the Seleucids ruled the arc of Asia from the Aegean to the Indus. The Levant, which lay between Syria and Egypt, was at first in vassalage to Egypt. But in 200 B.C., the Seleucid monarch Antiochus III won the Levant from the Ptolemies in battle, after which the Seleucids from their capital of Antioch ruled the entire eastern Mediterranean, including the negligible patch called Judah.\\"The Seleucids quickly began the process of \\"Hellenizing\\" their conquests, effectively assimilating these vast ranges of territory and peoples into Greek culture. As Cahill writes, \\"After all, uniformity of culture and standardization of its procedures made governing so much simpler.\\" This proved to be especially difficult in Judah, where the Jews held fast to their religion and culture, far more than their surrounding neighbors and societies. Things came to a head in 167 B.C. when the Seleucids gave a statue of Zeus \\"pride of place in the Temple of the living God and defiling both the Temple and the Jewish people with unimaginable sacrilege.\\" This proved to be the straw that broke the camel's back. As Cahill so aptly puts it, \\"There are humiliations a proud people - even one oppressed for generations - cannot abide.\\"Led by Judas Maccabeus, the Jewish people revolted against their Gentile rulers and, even though they were outmatched, outnumbered, and out equipped, they defeated the Seleucid soldiers at every turn. Cahill writes, \\"Judas understood that, even if they are outnumbered, those who fight for a cause can overcome those who, like many of the Greek troops, are mercenaries fighting only for a pay packet or hapless ordinary men drafted against their will.\\" Eventually Maccabeus's men entered Jerusalem triumphantly, rid the Temple of false idols and rededicated the Temple to worshiping the one true God. An eight day celebration of singing psalms and playing music commenced. Cahill states:\\"This is the Feast of Hanukkah (or [Re]Dedication), to which the pleasant legend later attached that there was found in the Temple a cruse of oil sufficient for only one night's illumination, but the miraculous oil burned for eight nights, inspiring the Jewish domestic custom of lighting lamps during the eight nights of the commemoration.\\"In fact, this book probably explains the origins of Hanukkah better than any other source I have ever read, explaining the historical and religious significance this event signifies with Jews today.After describing the setting of Jesus' birth, Cahill then enters into the meat of the book, devoting several chapters to the different historical perspectives of Jesus and what can be gleaned historically and theologically from each. While still containing historical information, these chapters mainly focus on the teachings of Jesus and their theological significance. Although Cahill certainly possesses a commanding knowledge of the subject material, the book tends to get bogged down in these chapters at times. For those expecting a historical excursion these chapters might come as something of a disappointment.My biggest problem with these chapters, however, is that those of us with orthodox Christian beliefs will find much to disagree with in Cahill's theological take on a number of issues. For one, he believes that the Christian \\"body\\" Paul speaks of in I Corinthians, consists of everybody in the world, not just Christians. He writes:\\"In First Corinthians, the earlier of Paul's two surviving letters to the crazy Corinthian church, this passage on what has come to be called the \\"Mystical Body of Christ\\" is followed directly by the \\"Hymn of Love.\\" In other words, those who recognize the Body - and therefore recognize that everyone they meet is part of Christ - are obliged above all else to charity...But everyone, whether he knows it or not, whether she wishes it or not, is \\"of the Body.\\"\\"At other times he questions Biblical inerrancy and authorship. In other passages, where Paul writes about gender complementarianism (e,g. I Timothy, Ephesians, etc.), Cahill insists Paul is not the real author of such teachings and believes the passages were added after his death to impose uniformity on the burgeoning church. These beliefs do not square with centuries of orthodox Christian faith and, yet, Cahill injects them as if they are fact without ever giving opposing viewpoints the time of day. This is fine; after all it is Cahill's book. There is nothing wrong with interjecting opinion in history, but readers need to be able to discern the history apart from Cahill's own estimations.This is not to say these chapters are not without merit; indeed, Cahill does an admirable job of organizing New Testament teachings and I was still able to learn interesting tidbits of New Testament history. It is obvious that Cahill also has a solid grasp on the New Testament teachings, it was mostly just off-putting how he holds to controversial theological beliefs but teaches them as if they were fact with no legitimate arguments that stated otherwise. While I did not agree with a lot of his theologically-liberal beliefs, they would have been a lot easier to swallow if he had acknowledged they were not in line with orthodox Christian teachings.Another nice feature of the book is the inclusion of glossy photographs of artistic depictions of Jesus Christ throughout the centuries. This shows the reader how the image of Jesus has changed over the centuries. These photographs included drawings found in ancient catacombs to the Shroud of Turin to more modern paintings by Rembrandt.In Cahill's final chapter, \\"Yesterday, Today, and Forever: The World after Jesus\\" Cahill discusses the impact Jesus has had on the world since his life and death. While I was expecting something along the lines of Rodney Starks' brilliant conclusion toThe Victory of Reason: How Christianity Led to Freedom, Capitalism, and Western Success, instead, the reader gets something much closer to a muddled, anti-climatic whimper. While Cahill clearly acknowledges the positive impacts Christianity has had on the world, albeit in a muted and subdued fashion, he also subjects his readers to rubbish like this:\\"But it is also true that the West could never have realized some of its most cherished values without the process of secularization. The separation of church and state was achieved in the teeth of virulent Christian opposition, as was free speech, universal suffrage, tolerance, and many other values we could not be without. That these values flow from the subterranean river of authentic Christian tradition points up, once more, the paradoxical validity of the distinctions Jesus made between the religious establishment and true religious spirit.\\"There are only a select few that can breathe life into ancient history as effortlessly as Cahill, who effectively and forcefully writes history for the masses. There are even fewer who can encapsulate a long period of history into a few short pages while still managing to convey all of the important and relevant facts in his easy-to-read breezy writing style. It is readily apparent, however, that Cahill does a much better job of writing history than theology. If he had stuck more to history instead of getting bogged down in liberal theology, Cahill's book would have been a much more welcome addition to my library."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"Meticulously documented and lovingly rendered, this third in Thomas Cahill's &quot;Hinges of History&quot; series is excellent! The ancient Mediterranean world of Alexander the Great and Augustus Caeser comes to life vividly under the spell of Cahill's pen. We understand the world that Jesus of Nazereth better because we understand the politics and culture of the period.I was raised on the Christian gospels but never before understood them and their writers as I have come to understand them after reading this book. Jesus, Peter, Mark, Matthew, Luke, John, and Paul became &quot;real&quot; people to me.Even if you are not a Christian or have rejected the doctrine of Jesus, you come away from this book with a new respect for his message and its effect on the ages."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"First, we meet in Connemara with how your Irish did what they did. Next we rendezvous in Palestine, with the everlasting hills. There's talk, Mr. Cahill. The neighbors are talking.I'm delighted with the scandal, actually, and scandalous it is. Some folks I know, dear and precious folks, would have you stuck on a spit and roasted till dry for parts of &quot;Desire of the Everlasting Hills.&quot; And because I enjoyed the book immensely, I'd be roasting right next to you. Don't get me wrong: some of your book had me up in everlastin' arms, but not enough to prevent them slapping on the basting sauce.The above was personal, Mr. Cahill only. Here's my review.If, like me, you laughed when you read the cover flap, that &quot;Desire of the Everlasting Hills&quot; is meant by the author as an act of reconciliation between Judaism and Christianity, and like me, you thought, &quot;two chances of that, Tommy boy, fat and slim&quot;... but you were curious just how he was going to do it...I'm telling you, read it. You may wind up rotating over open flames, or maybe you'll be the one with the basting brush. Either way, it's a great read.Like any teacher worth his salt, Cahill begins with a foundation of information upon which he builds his framework. This foundation of Jewish history and world culture is not only fascinating, but absolutely necessary. In his wonderfully gifted way, Cahill as teacher builds &quot;line upon line, precept upon precept&quot;, giving the reader the feeling that he is saying, &quot;Hang with me, I'm going somewhere with this.&quot;The reader who hangs with him is taken places sometimes difficult to go. What Cahill says about the Gospel of John alone is enough to have some folks toss more wood on the fire. (I was reaching for the wood even while I was roasting.) Because next the confounding man, in that luxuriant prose of his, will lead the reader to places of truth so dead-on that after railing him in one breath, you're cheering him in the next.I can't figure the man out, but I adore him. He's some kind of champion for God. He faces, unafraid, subjects many scholars skirt (like the miracles of Jesus), and he has the unmitigated chutzpah to go places many will not. (Hence the need for the barbeque sauce.) This book is a vehicle. A vessel. Whether it's a vessel of &quot;noble use or common&quot;, I suppose that's up to the reader. Or God. I found within this vessel some mighty good stuff. He has me looking at my Jewish neighbor with different eyes, like maybe we're related or something. At the least, this book gave me things to think on. And if that's what reconciliation means...why Mr. Cahill, I do declare."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"Mr. Cahill presents a good argument in this book. What he is argueing is hard to come up with though upon finishing. He seems to leave learge gaps, specifically as other reviewers have noted he does not with much of the 'after' Jesus Christ. The focus of this book seems to be on the credibility and cononizatin of the books of the bible. Though I think it is opinionated, Mr. Cahill does point out plainly that other books were considered for the canonization process and that the current 'Bible' is not all that was ever written in ancient times about Jesus Christ. He presents his arguements to lend credibility to the current canonized bible and does it well. A good book for anyone interested in the early history of the church. For a complete list of books/letters considered by the early Christians to be possibly added to the bible, see Halley's Bible Handbook. I valued this book as a great read and history of what happened during the early days of Christianity."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"Much more atmospheric than &quot;How the Irish...&quot;, at least seems so in comparison since the time period he covers is so much earlier. Because of this, there is much more speculation, so it doesn't seem to pack as much historically authoritative wallop. But there is good history here, and presented in Cahill's trademark easily accessible style. This is a great thing, since now that I am out of school, this sort of reading is done for pleasure, so too much rigor is a disincentive. Makes me want to re-read the New Testament with these new insights and empathies.By the way, if you are considering the book-on-tape version, I give high marks to the voice-narrator as well."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"Not a history scholar, I come at this book from an entirely spiritual angle. I bought it because I wanted to see if a historian found that Jesus's existence did actually add (or subtract) anything to the life of world he left behind. I also discussed the book with a historian friend who found it woefully lacking in what he calls substantiated history. But more interested in the spiritual side of theology myself, I came away from this book with more than I expected; reading it turned out to be an intense spiritual experience. (What he subtracts, by the way, was the primitive adversarial world view of taking for granted that wars solve all problems.)I was also not looking for great depth of analysis into the authenticity levels of the books of the New Testament, as there are many other books out there that provide that (Elaine Pagels, Robert W. Funk of the Jesus Seminar. . .).Though I couldn't have told you at first exactly what I was looking for (even though I tried to describe it earlier in this review), I knew when I found it--and this might sound a bit overly mystical to some--that that was it. It's what I look for at bottom in all my readings of spiritual books; and it is the goal of all mysticisms, too! I was looking for--and found--the actual living presence of Christ in this book. And that's what was there! Christ lives not only historically on the dusty paths Cahill so finely details, but in the pages of this amazing book. I met him there--&quot;again for the first time&quot;! as Marcus J. Borg explains in his book. &quot;Again&quot; because it was yet another much-needed angle of the man. &quot;For the first time&quot; because Cahill's view is breathtakingly fresh. This is achieved primarily by Cahill's daring in his down-to-earth style. As he says in an interview, &quot;I get any amount of disapproval for going from what people consider to be a high and exalted style to getting down in the gutter.&quot; In his book he says this was Jesus's style of preaching--to shock people awake.Finally, the book contains some illuminating and well-explained beautiful color illustrations. The reprint of Saint Catherine's Monastery's encaustic icon of Jesus--our oldest surviving icon upon which most of our future depictions of Jesus are based, and which is likely &quot;based on eyewitness accounts&quot;--reaches right into your heart. I found myself staring at it for timeless moments and entering a deep velvet peacefulness, inadequately described.As in the reproduction of the icon in this book, Jesus really hangs out between its pages. I left the book confirmed of the presence of his spirit in our world today, in the details, in something as expected and unexpected as a happily profane book by the writer of yet another &quot;gospel.&quot; Cahill is as worth reading as a holy book, if you read holy books seeking the presence of the divine."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"This is a pretty sorry attempt at describing the life and times of Jesus. The author continually interjects his biases (opinions, whatever) into his writing, making little or no attempt to maintain an historical objectivity. I suppose that this is where we have come as a culture, and I also suppose that this (Thomas Cahill) is exactly what we deserve."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"I really enjoyed this exposition of the historical development of the pre-Christian 'Jesus Movement' (as Cahill terms it before the title 'Christian' was in use). His examination of the gospels, their writers, and how the writers' points of view affected different views of Christ is very interesting. Cahill also pulls no punches in the presentation of historical fact - eg. he comments on Jesus' nakedness upon the cross in detail, which I see has upset at least one other reviewer.However, this is REAL. This is what Cahill believed happened, based on the historical data available. If the reader is narrow-minded in their beliefs and intent on blinding him or herself to historical probabilities, then they will not enjoy this book. If they have a certain personal view of Jesus that is at odds with the theories espoused by Cahill, they probably will not enjoy this book either.For me, this book has helped me to understand more fully who Jesus was and is, and it has enlightened my reading of the gospels in my personal Bible reading."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"For the last six months I have read as many books as I can get my hands on regarding the life of Jesus, Acts, and the letters. Most of these have been academic, along with a few popular histories. I prefer the academic, only because every opinion or assertion is supported by footnotes of arguments. However, I also like the authority of a writer who doesn't intend to support each one of his/her conclusions such that he/she, in the end, says nothing unique or personal.And so I arrive at Cahill, a book I pulled from the stacks of my local library. I have found this book the most difficult to read. The tone is almost bombastic. Nothing is supported by scholarly argument and even his Greek translations are stretched to conform to his line of argument. He seems to take a very literal view of the bible - or at least never questions its authority or the veracity of its construction. The Virgin Birth and the Bethlehem story, for example, largely thought to be inventions, are interpreted quite literally. Most scholars point out that having Jesus born in Bethlehem served a very specific purpose of placing Jesus in the Davidic line of ancestry (which required a Bethlehem birth). Whether you believe this or not, it should at least have been acknowledged. But Cahill doesn't seem to want to pull from any outside sources or wade into scholarly debate but instead wants to (for the most part) restrict himself to what is written in the gospels - plain and simple. And this is just one example.This is not to say that I dismiss the book outright. There are some very good interpretations of gospel verse that are more \\"liberal\\" than what one usually gets in contemporary churches (much of the book sounds as if it is being read from a pulpit). But I am afraid it opens itself up to the same criticism - that is, everything is accepted at face value, specific verses are chosen to support a moral point of view and everything else is largely ignored.Take for example Jesus as a miracle worker. Modern writers just seem to dismiss this with a knowing wink. We're moderns, we know better. (Although in fairness, Cahill seems to accept much of the miraculous as true - but this is never clear to me.) But certainly Jesus' popularity in the ancient world had much more to do with his reputation as an exorcist (healer) than a preacher - as the Jews were particularly valued in the ancient world for their \\"magic,\\" and thus explains his reputation among the Gentiles - who cared little about his preaching. Cahill never touches this subject. He seems more bent on showing that Jesus was really an Irish liberal fighting for the underdog - and this was the basis of his popularity. I personally love this view - much more than say Jesus as a crusading moralist who wants to smote and smite. But I also want to believe the Irish saved civilization. But does that therefore make it correct?"},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"Having read some of the critical review's of Thomas Cahill, I feel compelled to add my \\"two cents\\" (probably less in these inflationary times).Mr. Cahill does not pretend to present his beliefs as absolute dogma on biblical history. Rather, at least in my opinion, he wants to challenge the reader to look deeper into the gospels with the question of \\"what if\\" or, as Einstein used to say: \\"a thought experiment\\".I found the book refreshing in its presentation, enlightening in its viewpoints and a joy to read.A very wise uncle of mine once told me: \\"the only way you can truly form an opinion is to read and understand as many opinions that are diametrically opposed to yours.\\"A wonderous book if you enjoy the Jesus story."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":". . . although it doesn't miss by much. As part of his Hinges of History series, Cahill places the Jesus story in its historical setting. Whatever your view of Jesus' divinity, there's no gainsaying the importance of his followers in the stream of history. Not only the history of Europe, but given the migrations of his adherents, throughout the world. Although the book is filled with the message of love and peace, Cahill's opening statement about hills lists all battle sites. Not an auspicious beginning for a study of a &quot;new word&quot; supplanting the turmoil of the age. Like nearly all Christian historical writers, Cahill's description of the pagan world is bleak. Only by making the social environment of the era as desolate as possible does the arrival of the &quot;good news&quot; concept work. Cahill would have us believe the pre-Christian civilization offered no solace, had no love, no joy, people suffering empty lives with no hope. It's difficult to believe that the Mediterranean world was that much different from any other.This being an historical treatise, Cahill must rely on his sources. These are naturally scant, since Jesus went unnoticed by contemporary commentators. Another agitator in a backwater Roman colony was of little import. Cahill must, perforce, turn to the Gospels for his relation of this vital historical character. He omits reference to the long history of critiques of these documents. Instead, he grants them high validity. This is surprising in light of the long duration between the events and their written recording. The time lapse is decades, not just weeks or a few years. He uncritically credits the accounts as being retrieved from the memories of those who supposedly witnessed the events. This is startling. Anyone who's ever played Gossip, passing a whispered message from person to person, knows how garbled the original statement becomes in but minutes. What quirks of memory can occur over decades? Of course, as Cahill stresses, it's the message in the Gospel that's important. True enough, but we're supposed to be dealing in history here, not evangelism.Cahill examines each of the Gospels in turn, relating them with an easy wit. The chapter on Saul/Paul as a Jewish/Greek intellectual is the high point of the book. Cahill presents in modern language the various stilted texts Christians are subjected to. The effect is charming. Readers unfamiliar with Cahill's style may be jolted, but he's trying to convey a complex story without sinking into a prolix academic style. He deserves credit for his courage in doing this. He's clearly trying to widen his audience with the message. The message from the Gospels lacks unity, of course. Given the diversity of times and authors, with texts further modified by attentions from later contributors, his task is daunting but not insurmountable. Accepting these problems in pinpointing sources, Cahill is able to impart the theme of each Gospel clearly. He doesn't get bogged down in academic trivia. For Cahill, the value of the message far outweighs other considerations.Cahill believes in the message. He stresses that Jesus sought justice, suggesting this was a novelty in the era. It's a novelty in any era, and others have pursued the same goal. Even that Roman Empire so maligned by Christians [and Cahill] tried various means to achieve it. In Rome, Consuls were given authority for but one year to prevent accumulation of power leading to injustice. It eluded them, it eluded Jesus, and it's eluded Christians as Cahill points out in his discussion of anti-Semetism through the ages. He spends some time on this particular form of Christian injustice. It's disappointing that he can move out of his declared time span in addressing this issue while ignoring many others equally significant. Christians have displaced or eradicated peoples throughout their history. The Incas are gone. The Maya likewise, their vast story of holy books torched by priests. Hearts and minds can be won at swords' point - the history of Christianity confirms it.The question arises - who should buy and read this book? If you want a concise history of Jesus' era, this is a good start. If you don't want to wade through the King James, New English or Vulgate bibles but wish to understand what the fuss is about, this is a good review of the Gospels and their writers. If you wish to assess whether Jesus has a message for you, perhaps you'll gain some insight from Cahill's presentation. If you're not a Christian, Cahill, although he's firmly convinced, isn't likely to make you one. If you're already a Christian, Cahill may give you a fresh insight into the people who got Jesus' message out to the world. You decide.

This is a group that has very unconventional means of doing scholarly research on Jesus. I highly recommend JP Moreland's Jesus Under Fire. In this book Jesus Under Fire challenges the methodology and findings of the Jesus Seminar, which generally clash with the biblical records. It examines the authenticity of the words, actions, miracles, and resurrection of Jesus, and presents compelling evidence for the traditional biblical teachings.Combining accessibility with scholarly depth, Jesus Under Fire helps readers judge for themselves whether the Jesus of the Bible is the Jesus of history, and whether the Gospel's claim is valid that he is the only way to God.

Very highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"Thomas Cahill has consolidated from the best of modern scholarship a climatic and refreshing view of Jesus that is simply exhilarating. His treatment of the teachings and miracles of Jesus, the horrible and shocking way in which he died, the trauma and then deep conviction his followers had in his resurrection, and the different tones with which so many authors recognizably portray the same man is literary and scholarly profound. Yet he is unpretentious. He presents us with a window through which the deepest meanings of biblical literature can be perceived. Cahill draws the reader to the place where these writings still do change the world we live in, one individual heart at a time.Jesus and the movement that came after him responded to the cry that Cahill calls the desire of the hills upon the Earth: that no longer they be the sponge that soaks up the blood of humanity's crimes against humanity; that no longer we call &quot;great&quot; the butchers of our race. Jesus, whom with all respect he reminds us was a devout Jew, gave humanity a new and good and redeeming vision. This vision turned the values of the Greco-Roman world upside down. Social justice; equality of class, race and gender; compassion, mercy, forgiveness, and caring for the poor and week and oppressed, thanks to Jesus these became the highest values and the very conscience of Western Civilization.There is much discussion about the historicity and divinity of Jesus. What Cahill points out is that even though there are many conflicting doctrines of faith regarding Jesus and many attempts to tame him, once all the arguing is done, the razor-sharp literature he inspired is still there. His works and teachings and his subsequent death-and-resurrection stand on their own. They simply will not go away. They have rung the bell of the human heart. As an undeserving gift for our benefit, Cahill helps us listen.&quot;How beautiful upon the hills are the feet of those who bring good news&quot;."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"Cahill continues his series with the Greatest of all men. Does he hit his mark? Kind of. Cahill tries hard with this book, but comes off as a pseudo-scholar who tries to pass off a lot of his own bias and intuition as indubitable fact. That he respects Jesus greatly is clear; that he selects from a certain thread of scholarship only is also clear. He has pretty much made up his mind about the dates, authorship, etc of texts, which is fine, but he won't admit that there are competing, compelling views that differ from his. There is much to delight and disappoint a variety of viewpoints about Jesus, and Cahill refuses to be pigeonholed. This isn't necessarily always a good thing, as it seems to come from inconsistency and a desire to be original, rather than from a coherent portrait of who Jesus is/was. Surprisingly, in all of this, he bucks modern trends and gives us a fresh, positive view of Paul; he also takes the view that the first few generations of Christians really had it right, and the last 1900 years have been mostly unmitigated disaster, with but a handful of those who call themselves Christians being hypocrites, neanderthal fundamentalists, the usual ilk. In fact, he even says Christians have more conclusively rejected Jesus than Jews have. Buy this if you have a few bucks burning a hole in your pocket/Amazon gift card; otherwise, take a pass."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, which I read while on retreat at a monastery. No, I'm not very religious -- just like the solitude, and this book was a good one to keep me company. Cahill has a very engaging and readable style, and if he's not as scholarly as some would like, he taught me a lot about the time of Christ that I didn't know before. Though at times his objectivity is overwhelmed by his clear faith, and though he gives the Shroud of Turin a little more credence than I would, I felt that was okay -- I enjoyed reading the work of someone who's clearly passionate about his subject. And I wish we could go back to the faith of early Christianity -- the world would be an infinitely better place."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"&quot;Desire of the Everlasting Hills&quot; is the third of Thomas Cahill's &quot;Hinges of History&quot; series of books. This one covers the central figure in world history, the person around whom the calender is arranged--Jesus of Nazareth, the Christ.Cahill does an excellent job in researching and reporting history. One of Cahill's strengths that I enjoy is his method of weaving historical events together so that you know from whence the main theme of his book arrived.A weakness in Cahill's books, however, is his reliance upon those in the historical-critical (liberal) camp on matters of theology and belief. At times it would be preferable if Cahill either stated what the various scholars believe concerning certain beliefs, or just not comment on the religious aspects and focus solely on history."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"I went into this book with a jaundiced eye. I am not trusting of ANY New York Times Bestselling book that explore ANY aspect of Christianity. Perhaps it is my knee-jerk reaction to the horrendous treatment Christianity has received at the hands of the popular media.Coming from this viewpoint, I was surprised at the respect Mr. Cahill afford's one of the world's great religions. He seems to understand the historical legitimacy of the New Testament (The Gospel of John excluded), and treats it accordingly. Mr. Cahill won my heart early on when he slammed the Jesus Seminar scholars. (To those of you who don't know, the Jesus Seminar is to Evangelicals, what Newt Gingrich was to any Democrat).This is not to say Cahill is an Evangelical. He does things that a conservative Christian would not do. He slams the Gospel of John. He quotes his own translations of Scripture. And seems to justify some tendencies of liberal demoninations to &quot;pick and choose&quot; what they like and don't like about scriptural edicts.Cahill's great strenghth is in explaining the &quot;inter-tesimental&quot; period of Palestine. In a lucid writing style he explains how the Holy Land became &quot;Hellenized&quot;, and then conquered by Rome. It is a period Christians in general do not understand.Cahill is also very strong on expaining Paul's theology. With great respect for Paul's intellectual skills, Cahill explains how Paul challenged a lot of cultural stereotypes in the Roman world.The reason I did not give Mr. Cahill 5 stars is because he stumbled twice. His evaluation of the &quot;Sermon on the Mount&quot; was clumsy and uninspired. (The best analysis of the Beatitudes I have read is from Philip Yancey's book The Jesus I Never Knew.)Cahill also got weak at the end when he wanted to figure out what the life, death, and resurection of Jesus was all about. While he was passionate about the need for Christians to serve the poor, the argument had the a &quot;New Age&quot; feel to it. To the Evangelical, serving the poor has the ultimate goal of converting them to thier faith. Thus, bringing them to heaven. To Cahill, the goal of feedig the poor is to - well, feed the poor."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"Mr. Cahills gift to his readers is a fascination with the truth. He is a shill for no one and he carefully explores all that he can find in order to fully explore where the truth lies. His explanation of the original gospel of Matthew (the Q gospel) brings an intelligence to this topic, the likes of which has not been seen before. I think ths point is very important. In Mr. Cahill, you get an objective viewpoint, and where it leads is where it leads, and his ability to separate fact from fiction make all his work a treasure.One point about the audiobook. Mr O'Byrne's performance, among others, should put to rest those who denigrate the form. I was so drawn into the reading that I received far more from hearing it then I would have from reading it."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills is engaging and well worth the money and time. I lead a busy schedule and found it disappointing every time I put this book down because I had other things to do.As to the writer from Branson, I would just warn folks to take an even-keeled approach to this book. Yes, I found, too, that Cahill's approach to Jesus was a bit &quot;earthy.&quot; However, the wealth of scholarly information and comparison outweighs this consideration.If you're a Christian who is afraid about what Mr. Cahill wrote and how it might alter your views, I would say you should skip this book. If you're open and want to mesh/compare/contrast this scholarly approach with your religious beliefs, read it. Your faith may be improved by it, depending on your approach.Kudos to Mr Cahill for another excellent effort!"},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"I read a lot of these types of books, and this work shines. The author presents his insights into the Gospels with a real down-to-earth warmth, eschewing the frequent errudite style of many such scholars. In particular, I enjoyed his treatment of some of the &quot;toned-down&quot; translations of the New Testament; he presents some of the original, accurate language that really helps present Jesus in a much more human light than other books. I really can't recommend this one enough."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"This book is incredible! I loved the way Cahill's thoughts are presented in a smooth, flowing manner. It's as if he's an old bard, telling a tale of ancient times... But what I found most appealing about this book is the wealth of historical and political information. Cahill shows how various kings and conquerers influenced world politics and the Jewish people, and how they set the stage for Jesus' life and times in first century Judea. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in Middle East historical study. And even though Cahill writes from a religiously neutral position, I believe that for the serious student of first-century religious history, this is a \\"must have.\\""},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"Having read the first two books in this series (How the Irish Saved Civilization and The Gifts of the Jews), I was expecting a lot more than I got from this. I was expecting an analysis of Christianity's influence on western civilization. Instead, it amounts to an analysis of Jesus... It does not go much further in its analysis than the completion of the last books of the New Testament, sometime before 100 AD. He says that he is trying to answer the questions: &quot;Who was Jesus? What was his effect and that of his followers on his own world? What was their impact on subsequent history?&quot;The influence on their own world is well detailed. Cahill begins by exploring the world that Jesus was born into, from the rise of Alexander through the years of the Maccabees. He relates Jesus and his followers to their cultural environment. At times, he seems to be imparting his own views. He makes Paul and Jesus out as if they were openly preaching equality of women, for example, as one of their major themes. While I am sure the early Christian church felt that women (slaves, and other second class citizens) should be treated with compassion, the idea that they were truly equal (on Earth, at least) isn't nearly as clear as Cahill tries to make it.He virtually ignores the subsequent influences of Christianity, which is what most troubles me. He considers the &quot;First Council of Jerusalem&quot; to be a minor instance, when it seems as if most of the major figures of early Christianity - the ones with all the sway over how the message was preached - were present to decide how to proceed.Some of his confidence in the gospel is naive, from a historian point of view. He takes references in John's gospel to mean that the author had access to a witness who remembered great detail, rather than modification of details to fit the author's world-view. He makes no real justification for this view, other than his faith that the gospels are (relatively) accurate historical documents.What would fit more with the motif of Hinges of History would be to take these studies, and then do a focused study of how it impacted the remainder of history, which is confined to 20 pages that is more a re-iteration of previous ideas than applying the previous revelations to later events."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"Those interested in biblical history will find nothing new here. If you want an inspirational historical account on this subject, read John Romer's &quot;Testament&quot; which was also a PBS series. Mr. Cahill seems to have enough points about the Christian/Judaism relationship and the early church to fill a magazine article. His conclusions are almost shocking in their reliance on predictable politically correct catch phrases that swiftly deteriorate into his personal opinions. The book is crushed under a huge modern bias. All the cool sins (adultery) will be forgiven while others (making money) will not be. To borrow a catch phrase,this book is one calorie &quot;Christian-lite&quot;. Although only 320 pages, many pages are nothing but passages printed from the bible that make the book appear longer than it really is. Mr. Cahill will make millions on this book, and we will certainly be seeing him on the Oprah show."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"Thomas Cahill's book may do a Christian more harm than good. Cahill is obviously a learned man who examines Jesus from a &quot;scholarly&quot; viewpoint. He sees Jesus as only a man and certainly not God. In fact, he alludes that later Christians simply made up that Jesus was God. The problem with this approach is that, to analyze Jesus as only a man is to misunderstand Him. Jesus can only be analyzed as his total self-- God AND man, the God-man, God incarnate. Cahill's erroneous perspective leads him to many mistakes and &quot;veiled&quot; judgments regarding Christ. For example, in a section entitled &quot;Where is Jesus&quot;, Cahill dismisses the traditional notion of resurrection-- i.e. that Christ rose literally from the dead and sits in heaven today-- calling this view &quot;too cerebral to make a lasting difference in the ordinary lives of ordinary people&quot;. Instead Cahill insists on a more &quot;feel good&quot;, &quot;humanitarian&quot; approach to the resurrection. Christ, he says, is really resurrected in the poor and needy, &quot;incarnate in anyone and everyone who needs our help.&quot; This is the true value of Jesus' life to Cahill.This &quot;social justice&quot; approach to Jesus, concludes Cahill, is a good one because in reality he says, &quot;nonsectarian, agnostic [scripture scholarship] has brought believers new riches.&quot; (Christians will note that this idea is in direct conflict with 2 Corinthians 4:4). After all, he continues, the Gospels are really only a tale of a &quot;good human being&quot; and &quot;in the end, it has little to do with whether one believes Jesus to have been the Son of God [or not].&quot; His plea to Christians is to &quot;reassess Jesus&quot; since their sectarian, religious view of Jesus as the Lord and Savior has made Christians &quot;misunderstand Jesus in virtually every way that matters&quot;.This book is radically misaligned with Christian beliefs. It purports itself to be a &quot;scholarly&quot; look at the &quot;historical&quot; Jesus, but misses the lasting message of Jesus as Savior and Lord. There are many other mistakes, claims that fly in the face of sound, church doctrine, and frankly at times plain buffoonery-- too much to include in this review. Indeed, this may even be a dangerous book for the Christian who is not well-versed in apologetics and doctrine because Cahill cleverly disguises his bent of denying Christ's divinity until the end-- which could seriously confuse Christians. If you wish to know more about Jesus a better alternative book would be &quot;The Case for Christ&quot; by Strobel. Check it out."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"I just want to respond to the reader in Branson, MO who suggests that this book is theologically unsound. He obviously did not read the book. For instance, although Cahill does state that Christ is present in all people, he also presents strong evidence for the bodily resurrection of Christ. I loved the book and would recommend it for Christians and non-Christians alike."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"I must object to the reviewer from Branson, Missouri who has obviously never read this book and has his own agenda.This book is a scholarly, entertaining, vastly informative, and well researched history of Jesus, the founder of Christianity, and his times.I couldn't put the book down and read it straight through one Sunday. I laughed sometimes and wept at others.Cahill fleshed out the historical and religious figures of Paul, Mark, Matthew, Luke, and John. They became real people to me and the gospels and epistles which these men authored took on the fascination and attraction of great literature without ever losing their religious signficance."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"This is the answer to all those questions most people had as they questioned the Christian messasge as presented by the established church. I hope it is read by everyone who has ever had an interest in the evolution of religion as we know it and tried to pierce the fog and find the Christian message. I am going to order several copies for my friends."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"Cahill captures the culture of the world immediately before, during and after the life of Jesus with amazing color, candor and well-timed humor. The ancient world comes alive, and the portraits I find here of people like Mary, Paul and others ring true because they reveal the real people, warts and all, who became so integral to the Christian faith.I am a follower of Jesus Christ and claim Him as my Lord and Savior, and this book has given me much-needed context and cultural understanding of not only what the world was like during Jesus' time on earth, but also living-color portraits of the audiences the Gospels and Paul's letters were initially intended for. The latter has been HUGE in helping me understand the proper context for reading Paul's letters, which are so widely misinterpreted and misused.I also found Cahill's take on the incredibly controversial Book of Revelation to really make sense to me, more so than the sci-fi type explanations offered inLeft Behind: A Novel of the Earth's Last Days (Left Behind No. 1)or similar interpretations.I never viewed this book as a spiritual guide or a substitute for the Bible. Rather, I took it as a highly-entertaining, historical commentary that helped shed some much-needed light on what the people and the culture of this world were like immediately before, during and after Jesus showed up on the scene.Keep that last tenet in mind, and you will enjoy this book immensely, whether you're a Jesus follower or not.-- John Nemo, Author of The King's Game andMiller's Miracle"},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"Cahill is a comparative cultural historian, and as such, views the history of Judaism and Christianity through secular eyes, yet is faithful to how adherents of each understood their faiths. I recommend this book with enthusiasm, for the historical context in which Cahill places Judaism, the advent of Jesus and the evolution of the Church, for the cogent analysis of why Jesus had such a radical impact, for his descriptions of the early Church and his ability to unpack Paul's theology into terms the secular world can understand, terms that perhaps many Christians might benefit from considering. However, be advised that Cahill does not adopt a \\"sola scriptura\\" approach to his analysis, and therefore does not esteem scripture as might a Christian author for a Christian readership. I do not let this offend me, for my reverence of Scripture is well-establlished, and I feel Cahill's work can benefit us who believe in our witness to those who don't by his very reasonable approach to understand what Jesus is about and why the world reacts to Him as it does."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"Desire by Thomas Cahill is an excellent account of Jesus life and times. Cahill gives background information regarding contemporary Jewish/Greek/Roman society and then addresses Jesus as presented in the 4 Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke and John). Cahill also touches on John the Visionary's Book of Revelation and Jesus effect on us in the modern age. Cahill presents Jesus as one who primarily taught love, compassion, good works for the poor and downtrodden, and explains why all of this results in his execution. A very good book for believers and non-believers."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"Thomas Cahill, author of HOW THE IRISH SAVED CIVILIZATION and THE GIFTS OF THE JEWS, offers and inspiring exploration of Jesus Christ and his impact upon the world for these past two thousand years. He examines Jesus' life within the context of the social, political and economic structures of the day, painting a detailed picture of Christ that is scripturally accurate, at once fully divine and fully human.This multilayered portrait reveals Jesus as carpenter, son, teacher, friend, healer, leader, prophet, messiah and ultimately Word made flesh. Beyond this, offers the Jesus of today - the central figure of history whose Gospel message of love, compassion and peach has brought (despite the frailties of his followers) salvation to the world.Unlike many books of piety, DESIRE OF THE EVERLASTING HILLS, also stands as an engaging historical narrative: well-crafted, structured yet flowing, and passionate with attention to both scriptural integrity and historical detail. Mr. Cahill's third entry in his HINGES OF HISTORY series is one that can be read with pleasure and contemplation. It is a fine work deserving of time and attention."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"I am writing in response to earlier comments. A review stated that Cahill's ideas don't represent Christianity. In fact they do, that is the beauty of Christianity, it is open to personal interpretation. Jesus and His teachings speak to each of us in different ways. Next time you speak of particular views not agreeing with Christianity, you should rethink your comments and say that the views expressed do not agree with your own. An open mind is the key to new knowledge and understanding."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"After his enthralling and splendid first book in this series, How the Irish Saved Civilization, I could not wait for more. However, in the second book, The Gift of the Jews, Cahill had a fantastically rich and important story to tell, but his writing did not match up to his first effort. I really am sorry to say that the decline inthe quality of the second book continues here. Again, Cahill's topic is of unsurpassing importance but his writing does not meet expectations. I still think he is a very talented writer, but I think in these last two books he is having trouble in deciding exactly what he wants to say"},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"Oh wait -- that's another matter.Thomas Cahill's third outing on the hinges of history brings us to Jesus Christ, and appropriately so, for so much of the word 'hinges' on this person (and we'll define that word more closely in a moment) in many, often unknowing ways. Obvious hinges are the calendar which, even when modified to be BCE/CE rather than BC/AD cannot escape the fact that break is with this phenomenon.Cahill has taken up the task not of showing who Jesus is, either as person (and that can be God-man, special prophet, political activist, or mythological figure) but rather to show some of the differences, a before-and-after, if you will, of what the world was and came to be due to the influence of this person, which obviously requires an examination of the influences on other persons, too.Cahill uses ancient historians, modern scholarship, Biblical texts, and simple logic and reason to show influences and changes brought about by the Jesus Movement/Christianity. Packed with details written in an interesting manner, Cahill manages to interest, challenge and enlighten all at the same time.Put together with the other two books (Gift of the Jews, which might serve as a prequel, and How the Irish Saved Civilisation, which carries Christianity further), this trilogy is a good introduction to the history of modern theology, philosophy, intellectual sensibilities, and how the world owes so much that is never quite realised to so few."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"Cahill is a fine writer but I thought Philip Yancey's &quot;The Jesus I Never Knew&quot; actually achieved what Cahill attempted and failed at here."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"Thomas Cahill's book may do a Christian more harm than good.

Check it out."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"Someone who knew of my interest in history gave me this book. They hoped that I would enjoy it. Unfortunately, I have to say that I was not impressed. Cahill's goal in the book is to evaluate the cultural impact that Jesus has had on Western culture. Surely, this sounds promising. However, the bulk of the text is concerned with providing the reader with background on Jesus and summarizing the New Testament; more chapters evaluating the impact of the Church and the like would have been more interesting. To briefly explain the title of the book, it is based on Genesis 49:26 and Cahill understands it to mean: \\"What could be the meaning of this phrase...? Is not the desire of the everlasting hills that they be saved from their everlastingness, that something new happen, that the everlasting cycle of human cruelty, of man's inhumanity to man, be brought to an end?\\" (page 8).Cahill begins with a few chapters that cover political and social developments that occurred before Jesus' time. This includes the conquest of Alexander the Great, the subsequent fragmentation of his empire, the rise of the Romans and what all this meant for the Jews living in Israel. I found this section boring because it was almost completely review for me. For a novice who knows little or nothing of ancient history, these chapters may be of some interest. Yet, the part on the inter-testament period (i.e. 300/400 BC to 1 AD) was somewhat interesting. The last chapters on Jesus' impact are of some interest. The rest of the book summarizes the content of the Gospels, Paul's letters and Revelation.Though Cahill presents a fairly liberal understanding of Jesus, he does maintain some balance. For example, he acknowledges on page 74 that John Dominic Crossan's controversial ideas about Jesus are in the scholarly minority and that Crossan's and other extreme liberals often base their ideas on weak evidence. One of the most interesting parts of the entire book is the way Cahill interprets Revelation. His approach is to identify the various metaphorical references of Revelation to historical figures such as Nero. This interpretation stands in stark contrasts to the wild, bizarre \\"end days\\" that have been so popular of late.Cahill's method of documenting his sources leaves much to be desired. Frequently, he will write something like, \\"[s]ome scholars have seen this abrupt ending as proof that Jesus was not 'raised' and that Mark is merely recounting a wild rumor.\\" (page 110; note that Cahill goes to say that this idea is quite wild indeed), but my problem with this is that there is no footnote, no explanation of who exactly these scholars are and in what publication have they asserted these views. The book does have a 12 page section \\"Notes and Sources\\" where Cahill vaguely discusses some of the sources he used and their usefulness, this method lacks rigor. Where exactly did the significant ideas he discusses come from? Though the casual reader will probably not be bothered by this, but I expect rigor footnotes, bibliography from authors, especially when they are dealing with Jesus, a person who never fails to ignite controversy.All throughout, Cahill emphasizes the humanity of Jesus and how he cared for the poor, the powerless and so forth. While this is an important aspect to understanding Jesus' teachings, it is equally important to understand his divinity which Cahill only discusses a few times. For example, Cahill says that many people find the Gospel of John difficult to accept because it has the, \\"... the exaggerated God-Man... [and] not only the sure source of the exalted doctrines of later Christianity... but also a spirit of touchy exclusivity.\\" (Page 272) The \\"exclusivity\\" that Cahill refers to (e.g. see John 14:6) is part and parcel of Christianity and it is not found in John alone (e.g. see Hebrews 8: 6-7, 13), likewise the same can be said of Jesus' divinity (Mark for example has a strong Christology. Cahill is very uncomfortable with Jesus/Christianity being exclusive and he starts the book with a quote (from a Jewish-Christian dialogue at Fordham University, also reprinted on pg. 333):\\"The challenge that the Jewishness of Jesus brings to Christianity must develop a non-supersessionist theology that validates the Christian message and the Christian promise for Christians without at the same time de-legitimatising the Judaism for Jews. Christians must find a way to maintain Christianity's identity and sense of purpose without at the same denying Judaism a reason for its continued existence...The challenge that the Jewishness of Jesus brings to Judaism is that Jews must develop a theology... that validates the Jewish way without at the same time de-legitimizing the Christian message and Christian promise for Christians...\\"The problem with this is that it violates the New Testament (see John 14:6, Hebrews 8:6-7, 13 etc) and that it is illogical. For a more in-depth discussion of religious pluralism, see my review of \\"Dissonant Voices,\\" by Harold A. Netland. Other people have mentioned Cahill's \\"How the Irish saved civilization\\" as being a better book than this one; I may review it at some point in the future."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"This book is full of quotations from the Bible which is what makes Cahill's theme easy to follow. That is what does it for me, a Christian interested in secular history; putting people, places, cultural norms and language together with verbatim quotations from the Word of God. Cahill knows how to give the average reader flavor in an otherwise dull subject.Cahill refrains from over intellectualizing on this theme, a grand stroll through history that intersects with a history changing personality. I have been a Christian now 34 years. If I could have read a book like this early in my walk, it would have advanced my understanding of scripture by many years.Beware of the snobby intellectual detractors of this book. They either are envious of Cahill's success as an author or do not enjoy reading the actual scriptures.D M Murphy"},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"This book was an excellent read that I could hardly put down. I have little to add to the comments on the scholarly nature of this book other than that I would have appreciated an extensive bibliography."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"Cahill seems to have ruffled quite a few fundamentalist feathers with this particular volume. How could any self-respecting Christian not be upset to be labeled as belonging to a Messianic offshoot of Judaism? The whole point of this book, however, is perhaps to ruffle the rather puffed-up feathers of &quot;corporate Christianity&quot;. It saddens me that many devout followers of Jesus try to separate his earthly teachings from the Judaism into which he was born and taught.Cahill lets his own personal worldview seep through his rich, textured style. I fail to find this an unforgivable sin. Rather, I think-actually, I know-that what turned off a lot of Christians is Cahill's own translations of canonical and apocryphal scripture. A whitewashed Jesus could never have used harsh language, especially the occasional profanity, could he? I imagine that modern-day pharisees would be rather as put off by Cahill's interpretation of the Word Made Flesh as the original Pharisees were by Jesus' very presence.Will those who timidly puruse this book kindly attempt a rereading? You will no doubt discover that Cahill does not say a fat paycheck is unforgivable. Rather, the selfish use of worldly riches for self-indulgences rather than helping out those in need of justice and mercy is more of a sin than an occasional weakness of the flesh brought on by aching loneliness.Until a translation of the Holy Bible can be done without the doctrinal constraints of decades of Sunday School lessons, I must say that Cahill tries-as John Ciardi did with Dante's Inferno-to translate in the truest possible sense the shocking honesty of the man known as J'shua bin Joseph by all who truly knew him best."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"This book is not up to the quality of How the Irish Saved Civilization. Too much of his writing is merely quoting sources. Actually it is rather boring."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"Cahill's book is not for the serious reader. Cahill's \\"Desire of the Everlasting Hills\\" is full of humor and occasionally even poetry, but if fails to live up to its subtitle: \\"The World Before and After Jesus.\\" The author's portrait of first century Palestine is superficial. Moreover, in his breezy and offhand style, Mr. Cahill simply dismisses or glibly takes sides in ongoing debates about the historicity of the story of Jesus' life on earth. These debates are substantial and profound, and go to the heart of the meaning of Christianity, in Jesus' time as well as our own. I enjoyed long stretches of Mr. Cahill's book for their entertainment value, but kept waiting for the author to bring his arguments together and make his point. Ultimately, I was disappointed. Readers who wish a serious and meaningful introduction to the subject of Jesus' life and death should read John Dominic Crossan's \\"Who Killed Jesus: Exploring the Roots of Anti-Semitism in the Gospel Story of the Death of Jesus\\". Crossan's book is a serious attempt to explore the origins of one of Christianity's most shameful legacies. In so doing, it introduces the serious reader to the world of historical Jesus research. This book, along with Crossan's other books, does a much better job of describing \\"The World Before and After Jesus.\\""},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"Another entertaining and provocative book from Thomas Cahill. The author's method of showing the contrasting impressions of Jesus as presented in the Letters of Paul and each of the four Gospels, helps us to understand why there are so many competing versions of Christianity. The book will satisfy those who feel they want to better understand Jesus and the environment in which He lived. Much of the success of the book depends on Cahill's ability to fill in the blanks with an authorative voice."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"I found the book to be annoying and had a hard time finishing it. It felt like World History 101 sprinkled with some of Cahill's own personal bible translations. Jesus speaking of the &quot;S____hole?&quot; Hello, hello, Cahill, you say that's the literal translation?? For all the pretentious sophistry, I never got the sense that Cahill has a clue what Jesus and the atonement, or Judiasm for that matter, are really all about. If you want to learn what the New Testament has to say, pull out your old fashion King James version and read and ponder for yourself."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"If you were attracted to &quot;Desire&quot; by it's title and a genuine interest in the historical aspect of the world of Jesus, the Christ, please look elsewhere. Any irreverant college student could do this with a History of Civilization text, thinking he might be funny or perhaps even somewhat esoteric and at least partially intellectual. This attempt to paint great minds of the past in an intriguing yet entertaining fashion is an obvious flimflam for unsuspecting fools searching for some measure of truth hidden in the garbage. If you were interested in a modern analysis of the innermost shameful regrets and thoughts of ancient figures in a modern context, then you're on the right track if you fall for this spurious, shallow treatise on a subject so vital that Satan himself would love to have you squander your eternity for such sacrilege. If you're searching for truth, I'd suggest you start with the Old Testament and realize there was no conceivable or possible manner any human could have accomplished the fulfillment of the enormous volume of messianic prophecy, lived the blameless life, accomplished the fantastic miracles, or provided the priceless sacrifice for all humanity than did the Mesias, the Branch, the Holy one of Israel, Wonderful, Counselor, Prince of Peace, the Horn of Israel, seed of David, the Light, Way, Truth, Light, Lamb of God, Vine, Bridegroom, Word, Savior, Redeemer, the I AM of eternity past and future. Then really read the New Testament and realize the authenic and incomparable source of true wisdom and knowledge of Jesus, whose importance and trustworthy attributes Cahill &quot;somehow&quot; managed to miss."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"After having read and loved his earlier work, I thought that the subject matter, Jesus, would present Mr. Cahill with problems with regard to &quot;written&quot; evidence. However, he flawlessly handles and conveys a very compelling arguement for some missing gaps. Though they are no more than guesses, one can see where his thinking is going. His writing is clean and very easy to follow. I would recommend this book. Should read other works first."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"I enjoyed this book as much as his two previous ones in the series"},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"I am glad I didn't buy the book - I borrowed it. Cahill is in over his head. For example, he states that Jesus taught us to be kind and love one another and for this he lost his life. Earth to Cahill - Jesus lost his life because he said he was the \\"one who was to come\\" in response to the High Priest's question regarding his identity. By this he meant that he was the Messiah. Had he said \\"no\\" he would have walked out a free man. This is just one misrepresentation. Another is his discussion on \\"looking at women lustfully\\" - Cahill totally misses the point. Jesus' immense influence on history is an excellent topic and if you are interested buy Kennedy's \\"What if Jesus had never been born\\". Don't waste your money on this book.R. C. Lewis"},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"Having just read this book and read some of the reviews, I felt compelled to write one myself. A book like this will obviously have short comings and can be picked apart by anyone who has done any scholarly research on the subject, but for the most part it does a good job of providing a lot of information and putting the information in proper context. It's also a very readable book about subject matter that can be very boring at times. I found it pretty laughable that most of the negative reviews of this book were from people from the South and Texas, whom I'm sure have only read the King James version....and might even read the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series of books.........scary!!!! Without proper knowledge of the politics, history and culture of the world at that time, or the difficulties that the different translations can create.......no one can offer a valid opinion. Although, it's safe to say that all those bible thumpers from the South are reading the bible in the Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek.....right? This book does a good job of putting the story of Jesus in it's proper context. But, no hard feelings hillbillies....I mean....God's on our side, so let's bomb Arabs......yyeeeeeeehhhaaaaawwwwww!!!!!"},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"I haven't read tcahill for many moons but I remember ranking him on a level with Cruise O Connors the UN guy who made the Congo mess even bloodier and turned to pontification and/or self aggrandizzement.

Only at the end of his book do you discover what Cahill himself believes.Advice: keep a dictionary handy for the more obscure words which he peppers throughout his discourse. But if you like learning, this is the book to read."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"Thomas Cahill's book may do a Christian more harm than good. Cahill is obviously a learned man who examines Jesus from a &quot;scholarly&quot; viewpoint. He sees Jesus as only a man and certainly not God. In fact, he alludes that later Christians simply made up that Jesus was God. The problem with this approach is that, to analyze Jesus as only a man is to misunderstand Him. Jesus can only be analyzed as his total self-- God AND man, the God-man, God incarnate. Cahill's erroneous perspective leads him to many mistakes and &quot;veiled&quot; judgments regarding Christ. For example, in a section entitled &quot;Where is Jesus&quot;, Cahill dismisses the traditional notion of resurrection-- i.e. that Christ rose literally from the dead and sits in heaven today-- calling this view &quot;too cerebral to make a lasting difference in the ordinary lives of ordinary people&quot;. Instead Cahill insists on a more &quot;feel good&quot;, &quot;humanitarian&quot; approach to the resurrection. Christ, he says, is really resurrected in the poor and needy, &quot;incarnate in anyone and everyone who needs our help.&quot; This is the true value of Jesus' life to Cahill.This &quot;social justice&quot; approach to Jesus, concludes Cahill, is a good one because in reality he says, &quot;nonsectarian, agnostic [scripture scholarship] has brought believers new riches.&quot; (Christians will note that this idea is in direct conflict with 2 Corinthians 4:4). After all, he continues, the Gospels are really only a tale of a &quot;good human being&quot; and &quot;in the end, it has little to do with whether one believes Jesus to have been the Son of God [or not].&quot; His plea to Christians is to &quot;reassess Jesus&quot; since their sectarian, religious view of Jesus as the Lord and Savior has made Christians &quot;misunderstand Jesus in virtually every way that matters&quot;.This book is radically misaligned with Christian beliefs. It purports itself to be a &quot;scholarly&quot; look at the &quot;historical&quot; Jesus, but misses the lasting message of Jesus as Savior and Lord. There are many other mistakes, claims that fly in the face of sound, church doctrine, and frankly at times plain buffoonery-- too much to include in this review. Indeed, this may even be a dangerous book for the Christian who is not well-versed in apologetics and doctrine because Cahill cleverly disguises his bent of denying Christ's divinity until the end-- which could seriously confuse Christians. If you wish to know more about Jesus a better alternative book would be &quot;The Case for Christ&quot; by Strobel. Check it out."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"If you ever wondered what a vulgur human being like Andrew Dice Clay would sound like if he wrote a Christian book, pick up a copy of this book. Normally, when I describe the life of Jesus, I avoid use of the F-word, but I guess this is Mr. Cahill's preference. But even more importantly, Cahill takes the time to talk about the Savior genitals. I apologize for the blunt nature of my review, but if Amazon can sell a book that mentions it, I should be able to talk about it in my review. Never has a book left me with such a violated and angry feeling as this book. I could not even finish the book, which is rare for me. So Mr. Cahill, how do intent to explain yourself on judgement day?"},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"He has worked diligently to manipulate the Bible to agree with his world view. It IS interesting that he accepts Paul's writings as accurate, but believes the book of John was contrived. He says Jesus never declares himself divine in the NT? What NT is he reading? Read &quot;More Than a Carpenter&quot; by Josh McDowell for another opinion."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"...Cahill is an engaging writer, and there is hardly a dull pagein the book. Speaking of the four centuries spent by Israel in Egypt prior to the Exodus, he says, &quot;Enslaved Israel's brush with Egyptian religion, when the Israelites in the second millennium B.C. were forced to build mausoleums for dead Pharaohs, may have been enough to keep the Jews away from all that woo-woo 'spirituality' about the Mummy's Curse and the floating and immortal souls of dead kings and their retinues. Israelite religion was about land and progeny, thank you all the same--not the unreal realms of the dead, backed up by creepy movie music.&quot; He does go a bit too far at times: (&quot;Earth to Jesus: Hel-lo!&quot;). Of vastly greater importance, however, is the fact that Cahill's theology and exegesis are more of the same tired old liberalism which is found in most bestselling &quot;religious&quot; books and which was largely discredited decades ago. Seeking to get into the minds of Jesus and Paul in order to tell us what they really said or meant while at the same time aping the old Barthian and Harnackian theologians (Paul really didn't write the Pauline epistles) makes no new contribution to Christian literature. Read this book as entertaining writing, but with a watchful eye to its teachings."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"For someone like me, who has always looked at the church and religion with disdain, and therefore largely ignored it, this book surprised me -- it fully engaged my mind and heart. Cahill took a subject both enormous and detailed, and distilled it down to its purest ideas and neatest plot line, and did it like a novelist, not a historian. The book is a gift."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"This is a very detailed historical account of the world before and after Jesus. Starts with Romans and goes into Greeks, and then goes into the lives of many of the apostles, including Paul (Saul), Luke, John, and more. The section on Paul is a must for all Christians interested in Paul's works. Drives home the point that Christians are held together by a bond because of Jesus Christ, a bond that makes us brothers (\\"koinonia\\" in Greek) and should make us give freely to each other. For this reason, Christianity is a sort of communism; a great example of this is the group Cahill describes in Italy."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"Tom Cahill's extensively researched book is one that at the end, I found myself wanting to learn more about the Bible, its history, and its impact upon Christianity. Drawing from a variety of secular sources, Cahill tries less to side with any one side of Christianity and more to lead you to where the truth lies. I am looking forward to reading his other books, particularly Gift of the Jews. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"This is neither the desire of the everlasting hills nor the wishful thinking of the desperate, ignorant valleys. Mr. Cahill's enhancements and speculations are based on what? No clue here! Who was Jesus? Who the hell is Mr. Cahill?"},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"Cahill has brought us a view of Jesus from the perspective of several people, and their views reflect their different personalities as well as their own view of Jesus--views which differ as much as the personalities of the men who speak of him.And then, of course, there is Cahill's personality and his view, which must intrude into his writings as well.Neither Luke nor Paul, of course, knew Jesus first hand. Their impressions are based upon what others told them of him. Paul met him for the first time as an apparition, on the road to Damascus. Luke, the physician, came along long after his death.Cahill says, &quot;[N]one of the disciples who gathered around Jesus and then formed the early Church--considered Jesus to be God. This would have been blasphemy to them. Their belief in Christ was, after all, a form of Judaism; and Judaism was the world's only monotheism.&quot;&quot;By the end of the first century, however, the Fourth Gospel, the one attributed to John, had reached its final form;&quot; (Note that Jesus had been dead for sixty or seventy years by then) &quot;and here we find, for the first time, Jesus acclaimed as God.&quot;John the Evangelist, says Cahill, whose Greek is too good for him to have been the same John who authored the book of the Revelation.There is much to be gained by reading this book, whether you are a Christian or not. Cahill's scholarship is good, and his writing is clear and easily understood. You must decide whether to agree with his hypotheses.Joseph Pierre,Author of THE ROAD TO DAMASCUS: Our Journey Through Eternity"},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"I don't think I could possibly sing the praises of this book enough. It is an excellent discourse on just what is so special about Christ and about the faith, Christianity, named after him. Cahill is an intelligent, rational thinker and an articulate, nearly poetic, individual both at the same time. This is a very rare combination indeed, and one that leads Cahill in this book, as in the others I've read by him, to be able to work through problems logically, cogently explain the solution he's reached, and, even when you disagree with that solution, offer you some deep insights along the way."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"This book is an interesting look at the cultures, people, languages, and events that shaped the world around Jesus.

The book allows us to think about Jesus in new and exciting ways, including integrating the ideas of the Cosmic Christ into the writing. Cahill provides accurate historical insight into the life and times of Jesus by painting a picture of the harsh realties that would have faced average people in the Roman World. He also encourages the reader to think critically about the message of Jesus and how it relates to improving the lives of others."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"The book I ordered was recieved in excellent condition. I am very happy with my purchase!"},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"This book really casts a new eye on an old story. I think everyone will enjoy this book no matter what your background. Most of the book is pretty much a standard commentary on the gospels. The last part of the book is really outstanding. Cahill here as he does in all of his books provides exciting broad based description of the setting of the gospel story. He interrelates his comments, the scripture, and the historical events going on at that time to create an exciting new story. He also describes events in a very exciting way. He tells the story like you are reading it in a novel or the newspaper. That adds luster to the greatest story.Cahill also interjects little stories about the power of the gospel in shaping modern values we have today. Any believe will draw strength from that. The only problem with the book is we don't see enough of those stories.Overall everyone will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"This book was a wonderful introduction to the world of historical Jesus. I loved the way Thomas Cahill prepares for Jesus's story by giving a short but important history lesson on what was occuring at the time. For someone new to the world of historical accounts of Jesus, this book was everything I wanted it to be. It helped me to connect a face to the name Jesus. I also enjoyed how Cahill shows the different accounts of Jesus as written by the gospels. Each separate account reveals a side of Jesus that everyone can relate to. I would recommend it to anyone searching for more knowledge about Jesus Christ and his legacy."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"I loved this book because it challenged the picture I had of Jesus in my head but didn't challenge my beliefs of Jesus. It added a deepening and understanding of the divinity of Jesus. I love Cahill's books and not just because I'm Irish and we saved western civilization."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills is a somewhat interesting overview of Christianity and its impact on the world. Cahill has a gift for lively exposition. It's certainly not a boring theological composition. Ultimately, though, I found the work to be a disappointment due to the way in which the details are not brought together in a unifying fashion. Cahill divides his look at Jesus into separate chapters. There's, for example, the Jesus according to Paul(the cosmic Christ), the Jesus according to Luke(the gentile messiah), the Jesus according to John(the word made flesh). True, each NT writer brings his own perspective to the table, but one doesn't get the sense from Cahill that they're writing about the same person. The different portraits don't add up to a coherent whole. A careful reading of the gospels and Paul's epistles reveal one Jesus seen from different angles. As an analogy, take an elementary school teacher. She can be described by the various groups she interacts with: students see one side of her, fellow teachers see another, her family sees another, yet she's still the same person. It's the same with the various descriptions of Jesus.Cahill makes a number of assertions about various details without any backup evidence. For example, he dates the 1st letter of John to the early 2nd century. Now, this may or may not be the case, but surely a little reasoning is in order. Instead, in his endnotes he refers the reader to read the works of the eminent scholar, Raymond E. Brown, not something most readers are likely to do. Another problem is that throughout the book he seems to espouse the view that Jesus was merely a human exalted by God(Adamic Christology) in contrast to the view of pre-existence Christology(the view that Jesus was God before the incarnation). I don't think this view can be wedded to what is actually written in the NT. He does provide an explanation in the endnotes, but I would have preferred a more detailed explanation in the main body of the book.Cahill does seem to assume the general reliability of the gospel accounts with a few exceptions. He also seems to accept the resurrection(of one sort or another) and other miracles of Jesus but with some reservations. For example, he writes, &quot;...these stories accrued to Jesus in the course of development of oral tradition and that by the time the evangelists came along there were already set &quot;wonder stories&quot; meant to prove that Jesus was the promised Messiah. A careful analysis of the texts of the gospels, however, has convinced many scripture scholars that several, perhaps even a majority, of the basic miracle stories go back to the most primitive layer of the oral tradition - that is, to the testimony of the original eyewitnesses&quot;. He also takes brief jabs at the Jesus Seminar, Barbara Thiering, and John Spong.The best parts of the book are where he contrasts the tenor of the world before and after Jesus. He compares, for example, the warlike tendencies of the Romans to Jesus' message of love and compassion. Augustus was called the 'son of god', but he was certainly no 'Just one': compare pax romana to &quot;peace I give to you&quot;. He describes the church as the first egalitarian society. He also includes a defense (of sorts) of Paul. Christians will be glad to know that he apparently wasn't a misogynist and he didn't endorse slavery. In fact, as Cahill explains, it was the very writings of Paul which provided the impetus to abolish slavery in later centuries.Overall the book gives a mixed result. For those interested in Jesus and Christianity this is one of many books that can be consulted, but it shouldn't be the only one."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"Cahill is always a good read, and there is some new information and thinking here, but for Christ's sake this series is called &quot;Hinges of History&quot; and the subtitle to the book is &quot;The World Before and After Jesus.&quot; There is little if anything here about either of these issues -- C'mon Cahill, is the world different after Jesus? How? Why? Those are huge questions, sure, but it is a little disappointing that Cahill never manages even to brush up against them in the entire book. Still, a good read if only because of Cahill's engaging style.On last issue. I am a Christian, and I have no idea why any Christian would not like this book or should be afraid of it, as some of the other commentators seem to be."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"I think that my fellow reviewers have been much harsher on Cahill than they need be. What Cahill does--which is popular history in the best sense of the word--is very admirable, and the fact that he brings so much gusto and personal opinion to this account of Jesus is par for the course. I mean, which would you prefer--yet another dryly academic treatise on Jesus that summarized all the facts in 800 pages and showed little or no emotion (so that you don't even know if the author is religious or not), or something much more colorful, but that does away with the tight and uncomfortable trappings of scholarly tomes? If you prefer the former, I can only recommend that you learn German, since you can then devote the rest of your life wading through such awfully boring (please pardon my choice of word) stuff as, say, the maddeningly trivial dating of a certain event related in the Bible. But if you choose the latter, then I can say that I don't quite know too many books like Cahill's: concise, engrossing, interesting, and, yes, always fun. If the book does nothing else but engages the reader's interest, then I think it has achieved a noble purpose. Whether you agree with Cahill's opinions or not is of course something else entirely. But then, do you always have to agree with an author's opinion to enjoy his or her book or to benefit from reading it?"},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills, like Mr. Cahill's earlier two books, offers more information and insight than can be absorbed through a single reading. While I don't agree with everything the author (or Paul, for that matter) has to say, all of it deserves careful thought and reflection. As in The Gift of the Jews, Mr. Cahill sets the stage for the focus of the book by reviewing events that lead up to the main events. This isn't some &quot;Chariot of the Gods&quot;. The author provides not unfounded speculation, but scholarly explanations that are consistent with what is known about how people lived and acted 2000 years ago. Some readers may feel that -- by providing academic, popular, alternative descriptions of issues central to our religious and secular worlds -- Mr. Cahill is playing with fire. I for one welcome the light and heat these books provide. If this book helps readers understand people from other cultures, religions and times, then it can also bring us closer to understanding each other in our own time. And that might be Mr. Cahill's greatest gift of all."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"So much intellectual discourse has been written in these reviews about this book. Allow me to give you a layman's review! Thomas Cahill's book is a smart, collegiate look at the times that surrounded Jesus, and it doesn't disappoint.He examines the different Gospels and their approach to the story of the Jesus, and how each author tailor made the stories to suit a different audience (hence, the sometimes contradictions within the Gospels themselves), which I found delightfully enlightening.His section on Paul was riveting, painting a picture of how a simple man could be so transformed by an event to change his life entirely. He also works to dispel some myths about Paul, particularly his sexist bias in his letters. He also bravely takes on some church doctrines that are apparently &quot;Bible based&quot;, more power to him!I did find the first chapter difficult to get through at times. I felt that Cahill was using terms and historical names that I wasn't too famililar with, and therefore, left the reader in the dark by failing to explain these people/events/terms. The muddy water soon clears, so just steer a course through the words and trust that your comprehension will come back!Overall, Cahill's book summed up and affirmed much about what is known about Jesus and his times, and provides an inspiring look at Biblical events in the contexts of world history, leading to a deeper understanding of the Son that has transformed much of our own world."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"Thomas Cahill's \\"Desire of the Everlasting Hills\\" is an engaging but somewhat disappointing work. In short, Cahill's discussion of the \\"world before\\" Jesus is more carefully considered than that of the \\"world after,\\" with the author's treatment of the person of Jesus himself being an equivocation. Was Jesus merely human or was he both human and divine? I wouldn't have minded a clear argument for either position, but Cahill's narrative seems to hedge between the two. \\"Desire\\" sees Jesus as a radical visionary, to be sure, but does not have the courage to either affirm or deny the element of transcendence in the Gospel accounts. Ultimately, though hints of possible transcendence abound, the person of Jesus is reduced to what nearly everyone can affirm (that Jesus was a \\"great moral teacher\\"), and when I finished the middle chapters of the book I found myself asking \\"is that all?\\" It is true that during Cahill's later discussion of the \\"world after\\" Jesus, Paul is described as someone who unquestionably viewed Jesus as divine, but here Cahill fails to make a definitive connection between Paul's theology and the historical figure of Jesus. And the further the book proceeds into the \\"world after,\\" the more selective Cahill's scholarly sources become, a selection seeming to support a mostly negative bias regarding the institutional Church. This is especially apparent in his discussion of John's Gospel, which is impugned as being anti-Semitic, and is posited to be the primary inspiration for later anti-Semitism in the history of Christianity.Still, there is much to admire in this work. As I have said, I found the book to be engaging. Even when I disagreed or became frustrated with him, I never doubted the author's sincerity; Cahill seems to have a genuine desire to understand the impact Jesus has had on history. The discussion of the \\"world before\\" Jesus was excellent; I especially appreciated the way the description of Alexander the Great set the reader up for the inevitable contrast with the description of Jesus later in the book. And though I did not agree with many of the author's conclusions concerning the synoptic Gospels or the Pauline epistles, I was surprised to find such a thought-provoking and positive treatment of these topics. I recommend this book to those who are familiar with the New Testament from scholarly and/or devotional reading, and who are at least somewhat familiar with the history of Christianity; others might find it to be confusing or even misleading."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"In my opinion Cahill got it right. By 'it' I mean the voice and tone with which to discuss Jesus. Many of the critics of this book blame it for not being sufficiently 'academic.' Well, I applaud Cahill for choosing to write a book that can speak to the comman man or woman.I have never felt that the Hinges of History series were meant to be scholarly works arguing controversial positions. They are meant to be engaging and entertaining books that speak to all of western civilization. I feel that they are meant to BEGIN to wake us up to the depth of history that has shaped who we are, and to put in context the ideas, such as Christianity, that have such a profound impact on us today. After all, nearly 2000 years after the start of Christianity, how many Christians can say they really understand the origins of their faith or the world in which Jesus preached?Desire of the Everlasting Hills does an excellent job of painting a picture of Jesus and his worlds and the origins of the early church. To those critics who say that Cahill doesn't say enough about the early church: You are either blind or very unimaginative. Do you want a history of organized religion? There wasn't one. Cahill's presentation of theology is the history of early Christianity, which was decentralized and personal. Once THE Church comes onto the scene then the impact of Jesus as a person fades. In the end, Cahill's book is about Jesus and his individual impact on the world, not the impact of the institutions founded in his name.Cahill's relaxed use of footnotes and citation are a blessing to the common reader. Faith is a very personal idea, and to clutter it with the trappings of an uptight and suspicious academia is to kill it outright. Go back to your ivory towers. Cahill's goal is not to explain the word of God, but to give the reader a sense of the times, a feeling of the mood in this outpost of the Roman world at the time of Jesus. This goal he achieves with unmitigated success.I have seen reviews that say not to read this book if you are a Christian, and not to read it if you aren't a Christian. These people I feel, sadly, missed the point. Most are offended with Cahill's treatment of Jesus or his presentation of theology. Whether you believe Jesus was the Son of God or not, Cahill has to explain him and what he and the people around him believed in order to press upon the reader that Jesus was a man unlike the world saw before or since. It was ultimately this uniqueness that changed the way the world viewed morality, religion, and mankinds place on Earth. Central to this uniqueness was Jesus' faith. I never felt that Cahill's discussion of theology was an attempt to convert the reader, merely to explain Jesus' attempts at conversion.How do you emphasize a man's uniqueness while trying to place his life into a historical context? I do not know, but Cahill does it well. Those who cannot see that either cannot let themselves go enough to accept Jesus' uniqueness or the fact that he really did walk among us in a very brutal and gritty time. To anyone with the slightest bit of imagination and open mindedness, this book will speak volumes and open your eyes to a better understanding of yesterday and today.Cahill deals with a mighty task in a light and amusing fashion that rivets the reader and enthralls him. His detractors either can not let go of their biases long enough to hear Cahill speak, or are not able to come to grips with Cahill's non-academic goal: to spread understanding, rather than theory. Read Cahill's book for what it is and let it move you."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"Well I am sure that if you only accept orthodox theology, this book will either scare you or enrage you.

Great book....highly recommended."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"Thomas Cahill is a remarkable historian and this is a most remarkable book. Cahill has set himself the task of examining the pivotal periods in the history of western civilization; he wants to look at those periods, figure out what happened, and determine how that period led us to where we are now. Another effort of his is Sailing the Wine Dark Sea, an examination of the Greek contribution to Western Civilization.In Desire of the Everlasting Hills, Cahill looks at the Mediterranean basin in the years before and after the birth of Jesus. One things that is clear is this: without the Jews, we would probably not value justice and mercy as we do today. Though the Greeks were concerned with arete and the Romans with virtu, these concepts did not include mercy toward your enemies or justice for all, no matter their social station. Instead, those two defining values of the west come to us from the Jews through the Christians. Cahill, by the way, sees Christianity as a off-shot of Judaism.The final chapters, extremely moving chapters by the way, deal with the life of Jesus. Almost nothing about institutionalized Christianity of today came from Jesus's teaching, Cahill tells us. The patriarchy, the emphasis on sin, the denial of the flesh--all these things came later and after. What Christ taught was love and forgiveness. Everything else you think you know about Christianity is added on later by people who did not know Jesus."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"This book is a history lesson written by someone who is initmately familiar with the Old and New Testaments of the Bible. The book adds depth to the study of the life of Jesus Christ. We have the Gospels and the writings of the Apostle Paul to describe the life of Jesus. We have the messianic prophecies of the Old Testament heroic figues. Thomas Cahill gives us a learned retrospective of two millenia comparing the different mindsets of the writers of the New Testament books. Deeper understandings of the commonalities of the Christian and Jewish religions emerge. The person of Jesus Christ is better understood given an understanding of the Roman and Hellenistic thought that colored the writings we now call the New Testament. The Jewishness of Jesus is deeply felt. This book is a serious and scholarly work, yet it is unpretentious. The writer is passionate at times in explaining that Jesus came to minister to the poor, disinfranchised, the lame, and the powerless. The leadership of the organized Churches could bear reading this work. All of us could, believer and agnostic alike."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"This book is the 3rd in a series of \\"Hinges of History\\" by the author Thomas Cahill. For a book about Jesus, the writing style is somewhat cavalier; not unfunny, mind you, but in the context of the discussions, out of place. If the style is somewhat disconcerting, the contents are downright disturbing. This is not a scholarly book. Indeed, it is full of errors and oversights, and on occasion, bad taste. For example...\\"Since scholars can no longer consult it [the Aramaic version of Matthew], they have given to this putative source the name \\"Q\\"... (p. 75).\\" Nonsense. The Q document is not the lost version of Matthew. Q is a hypothetical construct designed to address the communalitiues in Matthew and Luke that cannot be found in Mark.\\"Its origins [the Gospel of Matthew] ...may well lie with such an eyewitness (p. 75).\\" That's right. Mark and Matthew both wrote their Gospels. And I have a bridge I'd like to sell you. It is fairly well established that the Gospels were written many years after Jesus' death, and the number of errors in them clearly show that they are not eyewitness accounts.\\"Gehenna...pyres were kept burning for this purpose [burning children]. (p. 80).\\" In fact, Gehenna was a garbage dump and the burning fires were used to dispose of the waste, which included dead people.\\"She [Mary] was..no more than fourteen or so... (p. 95).\\" The fact is no one has any idea how old she was, except that she was a \\"young woman\\" and that most Jewish woman in the 1st century BC married at the age of 12.\\"...kataluma which means a room occupied by human being. (p. 99).\\" Yes, but it also can mean a \\"cave\\" and there is a wealth of theory and literature supporting the idea that Jesus was born in a cave.Though this book is not without its merits, you have to wonder what its purpose is. While it is well written, there are much better written books, and while it purports to provide some facts, it hardly ranks even as a weak scholarly text. It provides nothing new, and its rewriting of the old is so full of mistakes that it doesn't warrant reading."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"I enormously enjoyed Cahill's earlier book, &quot;How the Irish Saved Civilization,&quot; and was looking forward to this one. But I was disappointed. This volume with the susbtitle &quot;Before and After Jesus&quot; (which I take to be modeled on F.M. Cornford's &quot;Before and After Socrates&quot;), appears to be about the effect of Jesus or Christianity on Western civilization. It proved instead to be a synopsis of the New Testament from a vaguely liberal (but carefully orthodox) post Vatican II point of view. Only part of the last chapter deals with the historical effects of Christianity, and most of that is taken directly from Donald Kagan's &quot;On the Origins of War and the Preservation of Peace.&quot; So if you are really interested in the effects of Christianity you would do better to buy Kagan's book than Cahill's.Synopses of the New Testament have a long and not very reputable history. The first effort was that of Marcion in Rome in 135 A.D. (See John Knox's &quot;Marcion and the New Testament.&quot;) Marcion undertook to eliminate the tensions and contradictions between the pro-Gentile and pro-faith oriented views of Paul and the pro-Jewish and pro-works oriented views of Peter by simply eliminating the Petrine, works-oriented texts from his proposed Christian &quot;canon&quot;.That did eliminate the tensions and contradictions, but it was untrue to the actual history of the church in a way that horrified the more conservative Roman church establishment. They declared Marcion a heretic and promptly published their alternative canon which included both such works-oriented texts as Matthew and the letter of James and such faith-oriented texts such as Mark and the authentic Pauline epistles. They also included the John and Revelation and (probably) edited and compiled Acts into its present form. Finally, they included the entirety of Hebrew scripture and declared that entire collection to be canonical. By so doing they (probably inadvertently) preserved a range of free choice for Christian belief. Despite the efforts of the later writers of the creeds, there would always remain a range of choice withing the Christian tradition which would make closure on any one consistent set of beliefs impossible. Yet Cahill is still trying to create a self-consistent synopsis. He does this by sticking closely to a conservative group of scholars (such as those behind the Anchor Bible Commentaries) and to Catholic scholars acceptable to the church. (He mentions the maverick Crossan but only to dismiss him.) Naive readers are given no inkling that they are being fed a straight dose of contemporary Catholic orthodoxy. For example, Cahill asserts in passing that both Paul and Peter were martyred in Rome, and that Peter was buried on Vatican Hill. One thing most church historians agree on is that there is not a shred of evidence that Peter ever left Jerusalem immediately before or during the Roman-Jewish war of 66-70 A.D. The most probably fate of Peter was that he died in the slaughter after Romans breached the walls of Jerusalem. The claim that he traveled to Rome is a myth created by the Catholic church as part of its effort to claim supremacy over other chruches, especially the one in Constantinople. The earliest claim that Peter died in Rome that I know of is made by Eusebius in the 4th Century A.D. Cahill even undertakes to deny that Paul asserted the doctrine of salvation by faith alone in a way that would contradict the doctrine of salvation by works. He does this by appealing to the love poem in Chapter 15 of First Corinthians, where Paul say love is greater than faith or hope. But none of these three are &quot;works&quot; in Paul's sense of the term. They are inner attitudes from which external works in accordance with the Law may or may not follow. So the reference is simply off the point of his argument. Luther's, Calvin's, and St. Augustine's readings of Paul stand vindicated. Finally, Cahill even reverts to church rellics to bolster his interpretation of the historical Jesus. He believes the Shroud of Turin and third and fourth Century icons enable him to determine what Jesus looked like. Of course the cloth of the shroud has been determined by Carbon 14 dating to have been made in the medieval era. Cahill's reasons for rejecting that finding are not convincing to anyone not already committed to the shroud on religious grounds. As for the third and fourth century icons, they seem plainly to be Hellenistic idealizations, like any Greek representation of a god. Cahill knows this, but tries to read the actual appearance of Jesus from them anyway. Cahill simply ignores the tradition of what he calls secular, academic&quot; biblical scholarship, such as that of the &quot;Jesus Seminar&quot; in the Society of Biblical Literature. Anyone who takes account of it will find they have to be much more agnostic about the life, teachings, and appearance of the historical Jesus than Cahill supposes. Of course we have known since Schweitzer's &quot;The Quest of the Historical Jesus&quot; that the loss of the historical Jesus is actually a religious advantage, for it frees one's religion to be based on faith not ambiguous &quot;fact.&quot; Since the book is so well written, I give it three stars. But the smooth prose coceals rather than reveals the ambiguities and conflicts in the historical record. So it stands condemned as a work which conceals the real challenges of faith from complacent and the comfortable. The book is an anodyne for the spirit, not a challenge for spiritual growth."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"I am stunned by the beauty of this book and by the mastery of this non-specialist. Cahill understands the work of New Testament scholars and presents the best of the best of that work in language that entertains and enlightens.

I enjoy Cahill's easy to read style, full of anecdotes that not only gets the message across but makes you want to read more. Ignore the detractors! Read the book for it's own sake...for a fresher insight into Jesus and the followers of the early Church. If you want a literary epic read Virgil's Aeneid in the original Latin, &quot;Arma virumque cano!&quot; If you want a down to earth fresh look at the Life of Christ pick up &quot;Desire of the Everlasting Hills&quot;. To the halfwits who wanted footnotes and a bibiliography, they must have closed the book before page 320 or they got it as a .99 Book Club deal, because 22 pages of this book are acknowledgements, footnotes, and references!"},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"Thomas Cahill introduced readers to the Old Testament of the Bible and the world of the ancient Middle East in &quot;The Gifts of the Jews.&quot; He continues this examination in &quot;Desire of the Everlasting Hills,&quot; which is subtitled &quot;The world before and after Jesus.&quot; But it is, in fact, Cahill's commentary on the New Testament. Book by book and author by author, he offers an insightful look at the background and contexts that shaped the New Testament. In turn, he looks at how the New Testament shaped later Christian societies."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"This book was given to me as a gift, so I didn't know what to expect. Here's what Cahill does:* He explains the historical/social context in which Jesus lived* He strips Jesus of all the glory/splendor/divinity that organized Christianity has championed, and writes about him as his followers saw him when they first encountered him* He studies the impact of this Jesus in light of today's cynical world, and basically concludes that the glory/splendor/divinity with which religions dress up Jesus is proper and valid.More books on Jesus need to take this approach: To not START with the idea that Jesus is God, but to examine his story objectively, as a scholar would, and then arrive at the same inescapable conclusion. It substantiates your faith, celebrates it, and gives it greater integrity and security.To do all this and be deliciously entertaining as well. It's funny, fascinating, chilling, and inspirational (especially his reporting on the Sant Egidio community). What a writer!I only wish he used scholarly footnotes to validate some of his surprising claims (eg, the synoptic authors would've thought it blasphemous to equate Jesus with God)."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"The strength of this book lies in the historical lead up to the birth of Christ. Not being well versed in that time period, I appreciated the portrait Cahill draws of the changes in empires and the tugs of secularism on the Jews. He did well in putting the birth of Christ in a historacle context.However, after the event of Christ's birth, Cahill devolves into his own interpretation of the gospels and interjects his own liberal understanding of the trinity, the divinity of Christ and the apocalypse, among others. What began as an interesting historacle portrait quickly became a detailed study in the language and wording of the gospels. These studies are justifiably important, but Cahill is ill equipted for this type of biblical interpretation.His historacle study in interesting and informative, but his book changes halfway through and Cahill departs from his strengths and employs questionable interpretations to material that speaks to the core of Christian beliefs.There are other books that the reader can reference for a better understanding of the subject matter that Cahill tries to tackle."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"After having read &quot;How the Irish Saved Civilization&quot; and &quot;Gifts of the Jews&quot;, I eagerly grabbed &quot;Desire of the Everlasting Hills&quot; as soon as I saw it. I wasn't disappointed. It's the best of the three.What Cahill does better than anybody I've read before is to put the ancient characters he's writing about into a historical context that makes sense to the modern reader. After reading this book, I felt I knew such famous historical personages as Paul, Luke, and Alexander the Great. Although Jesus himself will never be truly knowable, this book certainly asks the right questions for the reader to decide for himself.I've never seen the New Testament presented in such a relevant manner to the modern age.Truly fascinating, thought-provoking stuff from Cahill. I can't wait for the next 4 volumes."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"I enjoyed reading Desire of the Everlasting Hills, and all of this series of Cahill's books.Cahill does not hide the fact that he is giving the reader his view of history. Many historians present their view of history as fact rather than interpretation. They take themselves too seriously.Cahill writes for the contemporary reader and seems to worry not at all if his works will have a place in literary history or the classroom. I suspect he has as much fun writing as most of his readers have reading these snapshots of history. I find the books as informative as they are entertaining and I don't feel obligated to defend the scholarship or perspectives of the author.I am amused with the reviews of his Jesus book. His earlier books drew almost no criticism from readers. Most knew little of the topics covered. Because so many believe THEY know Jesus, amateur reviewers armed with the certainty that Cahill doesn't understand Christ or the New Testament often criticize this last book. JESUS IS MINE, say these critics, how dare you hold him differently!There is enough Jesus for all of us. We should be Christian enough to share, and enjoy our differences."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"Thomas Cahill, in Desire Of The Everlasting Hills: The World Before And After Jesus, looks at the birth, life, and death of Jesus as a \\"hinge\\" of Western history. How can I disagree with the importance of this man, Jesus, in influencing the next 2000 years? Alexander the Great may have conquered most of (his) world, but Jesus, like the Energizer bunny, is still going, and going, and going.I recently listened to a talk by Cahill, and in response to a question, he said he likes to make history come alive. I had not yet read any of his books (this is my first;How the Irish Saved Civilizationwill be my next). Now I have a better understanding of what his response meant. Cahill takes liberties in fleshing out people, conversations, and actions. They are educated \\"fleshings,\\" I grant you. But it would be easy to conclude that he is taking some creative liberties here. I've noted some examples of this below.In addition, I was constantly irritated by Cahill's acceptance of miracles, rehashed stories, and interpretations by people 1900 years ago. Examples of these are below as well.\\"When at last the irritated disciples would urge Jesus to send the mob on its way, we learn that his pity extends not only to the spiritual but to the physical nourishment of these 'sheep' - and this is what prompts the miracle of the multiplication of the loaves and fishes, a miracle that Jesus may have performed more than once\\" (p. 87). However, many scholars argue that this \\"miracle\\" was never performed at all.\\"Jesus was an ivory-tower philosopher but a down-to-earth man who understood that much of the good of human life is to be found in taste, touch, smell, and the small attentions of one human being for another\\" (p. 88). Remember my comment about \\"fleshing\\"? Here's another: \\"But Jesus was aware that, for ordinary mortals, grinding worry could easily take the place of arrogance and greed\\" (p. 193). And one more, at the resurrection: \\"The bright April sun must have made vivid the flowing robes and veils of the women, now wild and in full flight, and warmed their arms and faces till they could begin to suspect that something wonderful had happened\\" (p. 217).\\"For these [Paul's letters] are transcriptions of oral traditions that were current in the years following the crucifixion and may be fairly undiluted recountings of what people heard and saw during the lifetime of Jesus\\" (p. 173). This is missing this statement, for clarity (my words): \\"Of course, it may be that this surviving material has digressed significantly from any original meaning as well, since oral traditions ebb and flow with the tides of culture, environment, and need.\\" As Cahill writes later on the same page, \\"Though the Judaizing party remained an element in Christianity into the second century, it was ultimately unsuccessful for several reasons, among these the inherent complexity of its own program, the strength of Paul's influence, and habits of mind and heart that made Greeks and Romans relatively unreceptive to the arguments of the Judaizers\\" (p. 173-174). In other words, successful \\"memes\\" (sinsu Richard Dawkins) were maintained in the culture, while unsuccessful ones were not. Slight variants of those original traditions went through the same process; successful ones were propagated, and less successful ones were not.\\"There is no hatred so intense as odium theologicum - hatred for those nearby who are religiously similar to oneself but nonetheless different\\" (p. 184). This could be one of the mechanisms for the evolving memes noted in the paragraph above.\\"A careful analysis of the texts of the gospels, however, has convinced many scripture scholars that several, perhaps even a majority, of the basic miracle stories go back to the most primitive layer of the oral tradition - that is, to the testimony of the original eyewitnesses\\" (p. 211). An oral tradition that, like all oral traditions, evolves.\\"It is impossible to say, after two thousand years and in a world whose categories and measurements are so different from those of the first century, what the nature of these [post-crucifixion] appearances might have been. To set them down as a hoax would do a significant disservice to the teaching that surrounds them\\" (p. 220). Therefore, we should assume they are real? This is a historian's analysis? Later, Cahill writes, \\"Sometimes we blind ourselves to the consequences of our own thinking because we cannot face those consequences\\" (p. 233). Here, I agree.\\"'Traditions are born,' says Asher Lev [through Rabbi Chaim Potok], 'by the power of an initial thrust that hurls acts and ideas across the centuries.' In the case of Christianity, these acts and ideas have often been misidentified. This is because the radical society of friends, of free and equal men and women, that came forth from the side of the crucified was quickly overwhelmed by ancient patriarchy and has been overwhelmed in every era since by the social and political forms of the age\\" (p. 303). ...\\"But the 'ideas and acts' have been hurled across the centuries; and whenever an individual or gathering has had the courage to confront the Gospel anew, the society of its time has experienced transformation\\" (p. 304).But Cahill doesn't claim all modern interpretations of the New Testament follow the teachings of Jesus. \\"But it is also true that the West could never have realized some of its most cherished values without the process of secularization. The separation of church and state was achieved in the teeth of virulent Christian opposition, as was free speech, universal suffrage, tolerance, and many other values we would not be without. That these values flow from the subterranean river of authentic Christian tradition points up, once more, the paradoxical validity of the distinctions Jesus made between the religious establishment and true religious spirit\\" (p. 305).Sometimes, these earlier traditions are recaptured. \\"When in the late seventeenth century George Fox and his fellow Quakers began to read the gospels, Acts, and letters of Paul, it seemed to them as if no one had ever read them before, for they rediscovered there the blueprint for Christianity as the radical 'society of friends' it had once been and the theological courage to oppose slavery, prisons, capital punishment, war, and even the unholy union of church and state\\" (p. 304).I wonder if we can use newly emergent religions as a model for the processes of religious evolution that may have occurred 2000 years ago. For example, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Mormons) began over 150 years ago, and its texts, policies, traditions, and requirements have diverged from its initial roots, and will continue to do so, in spite of written records. Might a similar process have occurred with those original oral traditions?I notice that I am writing this review on Christmas Day. It is fitting that, on this day, I am contemplating the original acts, words, and legacy of the Son of the Most High God."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"As a Jew, I found Cahill's book enlightening and thoughtful. For me, it re-emphasized how much early Christianity drew from Jewish thought of the time and how Paul, especially, thought in Jewish categories.Most reviewers do not seem to have noticed Cahill's clarion call for Jewish-Christian reconciliation, his deeply felt belief that Jews and Christians are brothers, his rejection of and sense of shame over millennia of Christian anti-Semitism, and his quite convincing attempts to locate the source of that anti-Semitism at least partly in the Gospel of John.I don't have the background to express any especially well-informed views on the New Testament controversies on which Cahill takes a strong stand. It's clear that he is a believer in Jesus's call to social action and in Jesus's rejection of the importance of money and power. Cahill's Jesus is indeed a radical reformer and a champion of the common man and woman.Cahill accepts and venerates Jesus but hates much of what the organized Church has done in his name."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"This is a very interesting and educational book about Jesus.

At times, I couldn't read it because it was so tediously drawn out. Others, I had to put it down to marvel at the author's insight. Yet, its too long in some parts--did he get a lot of this stuff from his notes in college or what? What was the point in writing this book---besides the obvious? A commentary and historical outlook on the Bible. How original. The author is so bitingly sarcastic at times, I had to half wonder if it was just as hard to write this little tome as it was to read it. Frankly, when he changes his focus of the book half way through, (whatever it was in the first place, I am not too sure) to ONLY the Bible as a reference, it gets boring. Very boring. Fast. Lets get some outside sources in there, history or otherwise in this part. Yes, Cahill scoffs at and also acknowledges the Gnostic Gospels, but at least use some of them to, just to make it a WEE BIT MORE INTERESTING PLEASE, compare and contrast. Or whatever. It was just tedious to go over those same familiar passages of the Bible, yeah, just like reading the Bible, and analyze them. Honestly, I can do this at the Sunday sermon at church, or in a class on Christianity. I do not recommend this book for pleasure or curiosity reading. Maybe as a supplement to an introductory religious class for college. His first book was excellent. Hope his next few will turn around and head in the interesting and readable once more. Just looking at this book gives me a headache when I think about trying to finish the last two chapters.

His analysis of the four gospels and their particular distinctions are very well done. One can appreciate the differences between Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John without getting hysterical about their inconsistencies. He addresses the tough questions of Christianity and does a nice, even handed job. There is nothing offensive about this book at all, regardless of your denomination.

This is another incoherent nightmare from a bad revisionist author with a good publicist. The author does his usual politically correct rewriting of history.

His bashing of the book of John also seemed without any real explanation?As for his New Age version of Christianity, there is a total absense of analysis of the various cultures of the first century AD, the author is pushing revisionist breadth over scholarly depth. \\"How could the author, or anyone else for that matter put themselves in the minds or hearts of the apostles Peter or Paul?\\" PLEASE, don't waste your time or money."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"I am a big fan of Cahill's, having read the previous installments of this series and thought them brilliant.This book is fascinating at its start, but towards the end derails a bit. Nevertheless, I found the fascinating bits well worth the reading.The Good: I thought Cahill's presentation of the origin of the various Gospels compelling and reasonable. Of course, Cahill engages in some leaps of faith to draw some of his conclusions with regards to which Gospel is likely to have its origin in which of the original Apostles... but this is classic Cahill and as always creative and plausible.The real gem in this book, however, is the discussion of Saul-Paul and the Acts of the Apostles. I had never known so much about the man or his amazing travels... or, if I had, I had never really given him his due. But it is with Paul that we see that something completely radical indeed seems to have taken place. Here was a man who was so convinced... though not having seen the Christ or stuck his hand in the wound of Christ... who believed with all of his might. He was either stark, raving mad... or, altenatively, convinced way beyond a shadow of doubt that the Christ had come, died and risen. He ditched a comfortable existence to live like a refugee and scatter the seeds of Christianity from hill to hill. Cahill could have easily spent an entire book on the life of this remarkable man.The Bad: this book is not near as strong as its predecessors. Cahill seems unable to let himself speak as strongly about the paradigm shift heralded by Christianity as stridently as he speaks of the advent of monotheism in The_Gifts_of_the_Jews. I do not know if this is because Cahill is a Christian and wants to be extra-cautious in what assertions he makes... or alternatively because he is not Christian and does not want to give too much credence to the radical distinctions between Judaism and Christianity. It also could be, I suppose, that he doesn't believe the historical Jesus rose to the level of significance as the story of the historical Abraham.The Ugly: Cahill is a little guilty of playing too much to anti-Christian bigotry. I say this NOT because Cahill says anything bigoted or nasty about Christianity, but rather because he feels compelled to drag out the tired old disclaimer that seems mandatory anytime one says anything nice about Christianity... namely, Christianity is a great idea... \\"too bad the hypocrites who claim to be Christians don't always practice what they preach!\\" I see no need for this, nor do I understand the need for Cahill to include comments which make it clear that Christianity does not have a monopoly on acts of charity (as if it needs to be stated, lest Christians take all the credit for everything!). The reason these things jumped off of the pages to me is that he did not feel any similar compunction in either of his previous efforts in this series: Neither in his book about the Irish or about the Jews.So, while I love Cahill's series and intend to continue reading them, these comments seemed out of place and one has to wonder why he felt compelled to point them out. It should occur to Cahill that the Church (that is ALL of Christendom) is made of people. Each of us who believe are necessarily hypocrites. None of us is the perfect being we ought to be. But it is precisely that the bar is soooo high that the fruits are so plentiful. If the bar were lower, I imagine it would be easier to attain the perfection Christ implores us to work toward. But it is not to be. Even in Jesus's closest circle of confidants was Judas... so, should it surprise us that 8% of those who call themselves Christians is similarly corrupted/corruptable? I think not. That is a function of humanness... and should not serve as an indictment of the Word itself. That mankind has fauiled to attain perfection is completely disparate from the mandate to try. I say this: thank God for the hypocrites... I choose being a fool for Christ, with the full knowledge that I am a hypocrite, over playing it safe, believing in very little and living in a world of grays. The world will be the better for it."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"Like his previous books, the author offers an entertaining, but sometimes frustrating, glimpse of ancient history. He gives a nice recap of the period preceding Jesus and the impact he had on human thought. But the author does not really offer any new insights - a difficult task since the subject is one of the most analyzed in history.The big problem I have with the book is in the writing. Using two adjectives before each subject becomes tiring, and insulting, to the reader. Nor does Cahill's casualness (&quot;Earth to Jesus: Hello!&quot;) jibe with his subject matter."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"I enjoyed both _How the Irish Saved Civilization_ and _The Gift of the Jews_ and expected this to be more of the same--- a history of the early Christian church with perhaps a few easily overlooked &quot;personal&quot; comments in it, just as _How the Irish Saved Civilization_ had the odd sentence, of no interest to anyone but Cahill, about his &quot;Irish heritage&quot;.I was sadly disappointed. This book is nothing but an explication of the New Testament as interpreted by Cahill. It's nothing but one discussion after another about what this parable &quot;really&quot; means, or how what Jesus did at this point is so cool and ought to be known by the world.If you're not a Christian the two things that stand out are(a) it's easy to make any document mean anything you like if you're allowed to say &quot;Well sure the words mean this, but that's unacceptable to me, so obviously they're metaphorical and must mean that&quot;.(b) just like hearing parents natter on about their kids you have never met, reading excruciating detail about matters you cannot take seriously is boring beyond belief.I'd hoped for a real history book that described the early church and did not get it. Moreover, Cahill's next &quot;hinge of history&quot; better be a damn sight more interesting than this one if he ever expects me to buy another of his books."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"I was most excited when I found Thomas Cahill's work on the &quot;historical Jesus&quot; and felt that the attempt to provide an insight to this figure as a &quot;hinge of history&quot; should be quite thought provoking-a thesis with merit. It is extremely crucial to attempt to understand (as best as modern-day scholarship will allow) the world in which Jesus lived in order to get a more accurate picture of him and the relevance of his teachings from the perspective of social justice. Jesus was supposedly the key-player in this work, however, as chapters went by I saw less and less of Jesus (perhaps it would be best to call this a work on the historical Paul). The first segment of the book, which focused upon the historical/cultural aspects of the world which Jesus entered into was very interesting, and provided many insights into the setting of the New Testament. The scholarship seemed fairly sound, as well. However, perhaps the last two-thirds of the book was much more focused on theology, and less on the historical/cultural part of the issue at hand. As Cahill stepped more and more into theology (particularly that of Paul) his scholarship became more and more questionable. At times, he made statements that were absolutely false, but generally he wrote from a perspective of absolutism which only weekens a scholarly work. He even went so far as to imply that Paul was the real social justice pursuer here, not Jesus. So, why the three stars? It is a very interesting work to read and his writing is fairly entertaining. As long as one reads with a discerning mind it may well be a valuable source."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"Cahill's &quot;Desire of the Everlasting Hills&quot; is great reading! Images and ideas linger long after the book is finished. Most insightful, to this reader, is the gentle reminder that Christianity was but one sect of Judaism--And, that, still today, Christians and Jews have much in common."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"This book has a lot of good things to say about how Jesus revolutionized the way we see moral issues. But its take on how the early Christians understood Jesus is severely flawed - in essence, it's a rehash of the old Enlightenment-era theory that Jesus was simply a good man who was later deified by the Christian Church. Cahill says that none of the early Christians - Paul, Peter, Mark, etc. - considered Jesus to be God, and that the idea that Jesus is God doesn't even appear in the New Testament until the late-written Gospel of John.This is false. Colosssians, which is one of the earliest New Testament books written, says that &quot;In him the fullness of God was pleased to dwell (Colossians 1:19, NRSV).&quot; In Phillipians, Paul says that Jesus, &quot;through he was in the very form of God, didn't consider equality with God something to be exploited.&quot; The writer of Hebrews, a close associate of Paul, speaks of Christ with these words: &quot;Your throne, O God, will last forever.&quot; Paul calls Jesus &quot;God and Savior&quot; in Titus 2:13, and the &quot;mystery of godliness, who was manifest in the flesh,&quot; in 1 Timothy 3:16. Peter calls Jesus &quot;God and Savior&quot; in 2 Peter 1:1. Mark demonstrates Jesus' divinity by portraying him as the Lord of the Sabbath, Lord of the Scripture, Lord of the spiritual realm, and Lord of nature. Luke, quoting Peter, calls Jesus the &quot;Author of Life,&quot; i.e., the creator of the world, in Acts 3:15.Bruce Metzger, chairman of the NRSV translation committee, points out that not one word in 1,000 is doubted as to its authenticity in the New Testament text, and none of the remaining uncertainties about the New Testament text affect what the New Testament teaches. The bottom line is that the New Testament is replete with references to Christ's deity, and the only explanation for that is that the early Christians believed it, and Jesus himself taught it.The theory that Jesus was a good man who was later &quot;deified&quot; has no merit. If Jesus taught that he was God, then he is either a lunatic on par with Sun Myung Moon and David Koresh, or he is God. The Jews understood this clearly - that's why the Talmud portrays Jesus as deceiving the people through sorcery. If Jesus was a lunatic, then there is no reason to credit him with improving the course of history. If he is God, then we must respond to him as God. You can't respond to Jesus simply as a &quot;good man, a moral teacher.&quot; He didn't leave that option open. He didn't intend to."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"This book effortlessly paints the historical context in which Jesus and his early followers lived. It's very broad in scope, with an emphasis on trends and big ideas rather than painstaking detail (which I think makes it more readable--I wasn't looking to curl up with a dry \\"The Bible As History\\" textbook). Cahill does make a few convenient assumptions (e.g. Paul wasn't sexist, \\"Wives, submit to your husbands\\" was simply him playing to the attitudes of the times ?!?) and I suspect knowledgeable readers might find a few bones to pick with him. But he writes beautifully, with obvious passion for his topic. His respect for both the Jewish and Christian traditions is evident and, for me (I am Christian), broadens the appeal of this book. (Gifts of the Jews was great too)."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"I had read both of Cahill's earlier books and have been looking forward to this one. In many ways, the topic of Jesus and Christianity is much more complex than either the history of the Jews or the Irish but Cahill was not intimidated and used his fresh approach to breathe life into the story. In a postliterate, postChristian society, it is impossible to overstate the need and importance of accessible writing like this. Unfortunately, a reviewer from Missouri completely missed the point of the book, assuming that Cahill rejects the divinity of Jesus. I suspect that this reviewer tends to focus on the Gospel of John at the expense of the Synoptics. Reading Cahill's book will help readers understand what is going on here. Cahill does emphasize the humanity of Jesus of Nazareth as do the Synoptics and this will likely offend neoGnostics like some fundamentalists and new agers. Get the book and find out for yourself!"},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"I've read other books that Cahill has written, and this one is right up there with \\"The Gifts Of The Jews\\" which I had rated his best until reading this one. Now they are tied for first place in terms of both style and content, and in information delivered beautifully and sympathetically.Without being at all saccharine, sickeningly pious, all too predictable or doctrinaire (Cahill is a Roman Catholic), Cahill has written a serious study of the impact of the man Jesus of Nazareth on history. With his excellent literary style, reading the book is pure pleasure. Every student of history, anthropology, and of religion should read this book. Every seminarian should read it. Lovers of literature should also read it just for the sheer joy of confronting a master author at the height of his skill.As a practicing Anglican, I admire this book for more than its historical analysis and its treatment of the Savior; Cahill has presented the Man From Galilee with polite reverence, but as dispassionately as a historian should. So I recommend the book both to Christians, and to non-Christians who desire to learn more of Jesus of Nazareth from an historical perspective. It would be an excellent beginning book for anyone considering Christianity. You will not be disappointed in this book."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"I have enjoyed all the books in Mr. Cahill's &quot;The Hinges of History&quot; series and I look forward to the next one. After covering &quot;How the Irish Saved Civilization&quot; and &quot;The Gift of the Jews&quot; Mr. Cahill has moved on to basic Christianity in a book subtitiled &quot;The World Before and After Jesus.&quot; This book is a solid introduction to the history of the time and I found in it a gathering of a lot of current information that I have read elsewhere in more technical journals and books. For that, I think it needs to be applauded.Mr. Cahill is writing this book to a tough crowd. Because of the dominace of Christianity in its various forms in Western Civilization, everyone has an opinion on it no matter how much background a person has and these people are hard to please. Because his first book covered a much lesser known period and place and his second covered a much less widely known religion (despite the fact that Christianity is descended from it), they are more easily received. This one deserves real consideration too, no less because it is a book for the popular crowd and not for experts."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"What if Jesus wasn't divine? What if he was just a good man -- possibly a perfect one (whatever that means), but definitely mortal? This is the hypothesis I remember most from the book. There are others, which doubtless future reviewers will discuss.Bible scholars have long known that the first three gospels --- Matthew, Mark and Luke --- are fundamentally different in content and presentation than the fourth. While these present a vivid picture of a very human Christ, John's book is full of imagery and theology; as for instance in the famous 3:16 verse &quot;For God so loved the world that he gave his only Begotten Son...&quot; or in the words of Christ himself &quot;I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life...&quot; -- that sort of thing. It is John's gospel that has given rise to the divinity of Jesus. Cahill points to evidence suggesting that John's book was written by a Pentecostal-type preacher in an isolated church many many decades after Jesus' crucifixion. Long enough to ensure that what we've always accepted as gospel truth may in fact be merely words placed in the mouth of a legend.Think about that. If the book has been left out, Christ would be on par with the Buddha --- an ordinary man who led a good life and was in some way enlightened. None of this Holy Trinity stuff. (I am of course being simplistic, but you get the idea.)Of course such arguments have turned up before. But this time, the author is a Christian. Sickeningly so in places --- I almost threw the book aside when I got to page 306 and found that &quot;Mankind's most effective check on the Alexanders and the Caesars, the Universal Declaration (of Human Rights by the UN in 1948) could have been issued only from Judeo-Christian sources...&quot; Well, maybe I'm taking that out of context. But there are certainly chapters were you can almost hear the author yelling that it's us, the Christians (assuming the reader is one), versus the world.Still, he makes up for it, putting aside what often seems to be Christianity's most fundamental tenet -- that it is the ONLY source of truth and goodness and urges us to do what seems right as human beings.I've often felt that Christ was okay and that it was the Christians who were the question mark. This book says its okay to think that, possibly even correct. (I'll admit it, I'm biased whenever an author agrees with me!) Hopefully there will be more books that deal with rethinking Christianity, whose intolerance and false morality through the centuries has caused a lot more suffering than most wars."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"And he makes us think often about things that we already assumed we knew plenty about. His portrait of the living Jesus in ancient Judea is respectful, historical, thoughtful, and yet surprising. He gives the early Christian church a context, a fabric that makes sense. His erudition is impressive, and his faith is undoubtable. Yet he asks questions fearlessly. This is another of his superlative looks at history that still matters today."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"Now have all the Thomas Cahill Hinges of History books and, although a little heavier reading, all are wonderful. Anyone interested in history will love these books."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"This will be short. It was a book that accomplished what I desired -- a good historic look at the world before and after Jesus. It was very well researched and written and I found it most insightful. I recommend it completely."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"What I appreciate about this particular work is that Cahill has undertaken a deep, rich historical study of Jesus and approached his person from the differing viewpoints of key people who surrounded him (his mother, Peter, Paul, Luke, Mark, the cultures of the Greeks and Romans) and also taken a look at how he has affected western culture after his appearance in history, which is the main theme of the series and this book.I am continually amazed at some of the new insight I am gaining with each chapter and the different perspectives I read. Early church culture, Paul's perspectives which, according to Cahill seem to be the first written religious ideology on freedom of women and slaves, and the background perspectives from which each gospel account was written have all made an impact. This author writes without so much of the \\"christian-eze\\" that we have come to be inured to from the church. He writes with an historian's perspective and language and it seems evident that he is not out to discredit Jesus but rather to present a balanced account between history, faith, science and reason. I appreciate someone who presents material and trusts the reader to form his/her own opinion.I actually started reading this book a few years ago and put it down because I thought much of it was going towards more of a secular (anti-faith) perspective of the history of Jesus; this time, actually reading through the book, I find my faith renewed, deepened and strengthened by having walked through some of the issues that cultural historians would bring up with respect to the person of Jesus and the authenticity of the writings we now call scripture.Cahill is the former director of religious publishing at Doubleday, so he is no fly-by-night and has a knowledge that is pretty deep and wide. The other books I have read by him from this series are equally as intriguing."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"The book came promptly and was in escellent condition. I am reading it now so I can't say for sure but I don't like it as well as his first book, probably because he considers the Bible from a secular historian's perspective and I consider it to be the word of God."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"The book is a biography of Jesus before he was famous. It traces the origins of this simple, but revolutionary person who was destined to transform hearts, ideals, civilizations and the very fabric of time. Thomas Cahill sets out to capture Jesus, who he was and what he taught before he became an icon that would be used to justify oppression to those who have different beliefs. However, Cahill did not merely present a historical Jesus, he presents Jesus as the culmination of God's promise to the Jews and to all humanity by virtue of our heritage as Abraham's progeny. The first part of the book deals with events prior to Jesus, from the conquest of Alexander of Macedonia to Caeser Augustus. The second part of the book deals with the life and teachings of Jesus. The third part of the book deals with the early church, specifically the missionary works of Paul of Tarsus.The book is at heart a testimony to the continuing relevance of faith in this changing times, but it is a faith that is self-aware and not blind to the injustices perpetrated in the name of religion. It is a book for the ages; it a book for all of us because, despite all the advancement of science and technology, deep in our hearts we still echo the desires of the everlasting hills."},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","review":"I have really enjoyed all 5 books in Thomas Cahill's The Hinges of History series and hope he gets around to writing the last 2.

And the big insight is that this is all one flowing of history built on helping the poor, compassion for the weak, and the power of love - not dogma and rules and exclusion.

She has created alot of wonderful drapes that also serve as creative artwork.I have never made a curtain or drape in my life, but I am an experienced sewer and in my opinion Ms. Luke takes the time to explain everything in an orderly fashion in order to familiarize the reader with what to expect as well as providing you with a break-down (both in metric and U.S.) for how to measure your windows or doors with acuracy as well as how much fabric to buy. In addition, she also gives instruction for how to do various hems, tiebacks, valances, and interlinings. She describes the different types of drapes you can make to get the dramatic looks you want. In all honesty I will probably have a professional make a pair of drapes from the book for me before I do it myself because I want to make sure they are done with precision, however, that takes nothing away from the instruction that Ms. Luke has provided- what I want I don't have the time to do right now.I would gladly recommend this book to an experienced sewer or an adventurous beginner."},{"Title":"Creative Curtainmaking Made Easy","review":"Great, creative curtain designs, marvelous for inspiration.

In the first four chapters, Maritain lays out the development of philosophical thought from various schools of thought around the world in ancient time, through the pre-Socratics and through Aristotle. Then in the next four chapters he shows what philosophy is, how it is related to the special sciences, to theology, and to common sense. That is all part one of the book. In part two of the book, he examines and explains each of the main divisions of philosophy inluding: logic, philosophy of mathematics, philosophy of nature, epistemology, ontology (to which he devotes four chapters), and the philosopy of art (i.e. ethics).The chapter on the relation between philosophy and the special sciences (i.e. physics, chemistry, biology, etc.) is by itself worth the price of the book. Maritain does an excellent job showing that philosophy (per se, not de facto) is a science, and that by its very nature, the science of philosophy should govern the special sciences. Maritain here provides the antidote to the 'scientism' that is so prevalent in academia. Here we learn why ontology is not at the mercy of the special sciences, and thus why we need not be reductionists, physicalists, or eliminativists. This was standard fare many years ago, but has largely been lost in the aftermath of positivism. Ironically, if I had to pick any one book that I think would be most helpful to the Western philosophical community, it would be Maritain's _An Introduction to Philosophy_. So many of the debates in contemporary philosophy are founded on errors that are pointed out in this intro book."},{"Title":"An introduction to philosophy","review":"In November 2005 Sheed and Ward reprinted Jacques Maritain's An Introduction to Philosophy. This primer, which Maritain first published in 1931, is a bit different from standard introductions to philosophical thought such as Will Durant's Story of Philosophy, Bryan Magee's Story of Philosophy, or Frederick Coppleston's exhaustive multivolume History of Philosophy. Maritain's focus is to explicate a particular view of the endeavor of philosophy and to point out the cornerstones of his thought.To start with, Maritain is a Thomist, following in the intellectual traditions of St. Thomas Aquinas, who in turn draws upon Aristotle. Maritain's approach in this book is to first trace this history of philosophy up to Aristotle. For this, he posits primitive traditions, discernable from both theology and a reasonable induction from historical evidence, which contain wisdom that is common to all mankind globally. He seeks remnants of these traditions in pre-Greek Indo-European civilizations: Persian, Indian, and Chinese. After surveying these, he proceeds to Greek thought: the pre-Socratics, the Sophists, Socrates, Plato, and finally Aristotle. Maritain sees the ancient Persian, Indian, Chinese, and pre-Socratic Greeks as derived from healthy primitive traditions (although in corrupted form). The work of philosophy, in part, is to recover the ancient wisdom and ground it in a system of reason and dialectic.Upon stating in brief form what he sees as Aristotle's achievements are, Maritain changes his method. He does not follow, as most historical texts would, with a discussion of late antiquity and modern philosophers. For example, do not get a sketch of Descartes in historical context. Rather, Maritain discusses the structure of philosophy as a body of knowledge. That structure is itself determined by Thomist philosophy. Maritain discusses the boundaries of philosophy -- how it is distinct from the empirical sciences, for example, and how it relates to them. He contrasts the Thomist view on philosophy with alternatives in modernity. He then gives an account of the fields of philosophy:I. Logic (a sort of preamble to philosophy proper)II. Theoretical philosophy (speculative, related to understanding of the world)---1. Philosophy of mathematics and nature---2. Epistemology---3. Ontology and metaphysics---4. Natural theologyIII. Practical philosophy (related to human action)---1. Philosophy of art and technology---2. EthicsWalking through these fields (philosophical categories which themselves follow from his Thomism), Maritain points out both the Thomist and Aristotelian positions, and the modernist positions, which are usually contradictory extremes which the Aristotelian mean reconciles.It's a very rigorous and systematic book with a good deal of common sense. It explains a lot of Thomism in a very detailed way and makes an excellent reference for those looking to understand this point of view. Thomism can be a bit dry. Maritain goes a long way to guiding the reader to see motivations and connections. For example, one can struggle Aristotle for years and not find as clear an explication of metaphysical terms such as essence (being inasmuch as it can be understood), substance (being inasmuch as it primarily is), and act and potentiality (being inasmuch as it is the subject of change and motion). For anyone interested in Thomism, this book is a find."},{"Title":"An introduction to philosophy","review":"If one needs an introduction to the field of philosophy, they could no better than to start w/ Maritain's text.

Maritain browses over the history of philosophy in his work - a good start for further investigation on philosophical thinking."},{"Title":"An introduction to philosophy","review":"Although concentrated on Western philosophy, this book will bring a good basic understanding of philosophy as a whole"},{"Title":"An introduction to philosophy","review":"This book is not an introduction to philosophy as such, but rather to the philosophy asserted by its French author, Jacques Maritain (1882-1973), who converted to Catholicism in 1906 when he was in his mid twenties. Originally interested in the philosophy of Benedict de Spinoza (1632-1677), then in the philosophy of Henri Bergson (1859-1941), the author became a devotee of St. Thomas Aquinas (c. 1225-1274) two years after his conversion to Catholicism, and eventually renounced his previous interest in Spinoza or Bergson.It is no coincidence that Maritain advocates Thomism, the philosophy and theology of St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas is a doctor of the Catholic Church, specifically known as \\"The Angelic Doctor.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia states that doctors of the Church are \\"writers [who] have received this title on account of the great advantage the whole Church has derived from their doctrine.\\" In fact Thomism was so valuable to the Catholic Church that in 1879, just three years before Maritain was born, Pope Leo XIII ordered that it be taught in all Catholic schools as official Church doctrine. This order was issued in an encyclical titled \\"Aeterni Patris\\" (\\"Eternal Fathers\\"), about which the Catholic Encyclopedia writes that \\"Its purpose was the revival of Scholastic philosophy, according to the mind of St. Thomas Aquinas.\\"The Catholic Church exercised editorial control over the content of this book. In 1917, as Maritain finished a year lecturing at the Petit S&eacute;minaire de Versailles, he was commissioned by the Church to write a series of philosophy textbooks for Catholic secondary schools, colleges and seminaries. One result was this book, which received an Imprimatur from the Church -- as must all Church textbooks. The word 'Imprimatur' is Latin for \\"let it be printed.\\" An Imprimatur is granted by a Catholic bishop to indicate that the text has been thoroughly reviewed by a Church panel and deemed to contain nothing contrary to Catholic faith or morals.Therefore the title of this book is misleading, because it has been translated into English without qualification as \\"An Introduction to Philosophy.\\" In the context in which this book was originally published in France in 1920, as \\"Introduction g&eacute;n&eacute;rale &agrave; la philosophie,\\" it was assumed that the reader was a Catholic student, and that he already knew the philosophy in question was Thomism and that it was official Church doctrine. Hence there was no need to add any qualifier to the original title in French. But for us in the English-speaking world 85+ years later -- and many of us will not be Catholic, and will have no interest in becoming such -- we cannot assume knowledge of the context and purpose of this book.However, the problems with this book do not end with the title. The book's manner of exposition itself is offensive. In Chapter One, Egyptian and Semitic cultures are needlessly denigrated as \\"scornful of human wisdom and the achievements of pure reason.\\" Buddhism is unnecessarily attacked as \\"cowardice\\" and \\"an intellectual plague to humanity.\\" Hinduism is \\"counterfeit.\\" Chinese culture and history is \\"diseased.\\" Zoroastrianism is a \\"failure.\\" It is only in ancient Greece, and ancient Greece alone, claims Maritain, that \\"the wisdom of man found the right path.\\" The Greeks are \\"the chosen people of reason.\\" Having read this, how can one expect Maritain to do justice to those with whom he disagrees?This book lacks critical reflection about its subject matter. Maritain lauds Aristotle (384-322 BCE), claiming that \\"he founded for all time the true philosophy.\\" Aristotle \\"saved whatever was true and valuable, not only in Plato, but in all the ancient thinkers of Greece.\\" But to my knowledge Maritain says nothing of Aristotle's claim that the Earth is the center of the universe, or that rocks have an innate desire to move to the center of the Earth. And nowhere does he appear to discuss the limitations of Aristotelian syllogistic as a vehicle for mathematical reasoning. How can a syllogism demonstrate that 1 + 1 = 2? These are serious, long-recognized problems for Aristotle. Maritain discusses none of them, to my knowledge.This book ignores significant facts about its subject. What about those ancient Greek philosophers whom Maritain does not cover? The Hellenistic philosophers? The Stoics, Epicureans, Cynics, and Skeptics? The Megarians, who developed a propositional logic long before George Boole did in the 19th Century? Maritain remarks tersely that they \\"in essentials would deform philosophy.\\" This is needless insult for legitimate, Socratically inspired philosophical traditions which have much to offer. How can we trust someone like this to speak with authority about philosophy as a whole?This book misrepresents its subject. For Aristotle, theology is not a separate discipline from philosophy. But we are never told this in this book. For Maritain, contrary to Aristotle, philosophy is subservient to what Maritain calls \\"supernatural theology.\\" Maritain had converted to Catholicism, had embraced the official philosophy and theology of the Church, was on faculty at a Catholic university, and intended this book for Catholic students. It received an Imprimatur from the Church. He obviously is not talking about Hindu, Jewish, Islamic, Protestant, or even Orthodox supernatural theology. In other words, for Maritain the Catholic Church ought to have absolute veto authority over all philosophy, as the Church did in fact have veto authority over the content of Maritain's book. This is an extremely controversial claim with which probably the majority of philosophers disagree -- including Aristotle himself. Ignoring these facts, Maritain asserts without argument that philosophy must reject \\"as false any philosophic affirmation which contradicts a [supernatural] theological truth\\" -- i.e. alleged truth, as to assume it's true is to beg the question.Maritain calls such alleged truth \\"science\\" -- a use of the word completely alien to modern ears and again seriously misleading. Maritain means \\"science\\" in the medieval Scholastic sense of the Latin word \\"scientia\\" and the Greek word \\"episteme,\\" i.e. a system of allegedly self-evident axioms plus the theorems derived from them by means of Aristotle's syllogistic. He does not mean \\"science\\" in the sense of empirical conjecture, falsifiability, and probabilistic reasoning which we in the 21st Century call genuine science. \\"Certain knowledge of causes is termed science,\\" writes Maritain, contradicting hundreds of years of experimental scientific practice which has provided us with probabilistic, but not certain, truths about the universe that were unimaginable to Aristotle or Aquinas. Indeed, this conflict between \\"science\\" as understood by the Church, and science as practiced by scientists, led the Church to burn Giordano Bruno at the stake in 1600 for heresy, to condemn Copernicus posthumously in 1616 for heresy and ban his writings, and to imprison Galileo for life in 1633, as well as condemn him for heresy and ban his work.Perhaps we can excuse this book's hostility to other traditions, and its lack of critical reflection about its own tradition, by attributing it to the prevailing prejudice of French Catholicism 85+ years ago. But it is not 1920. And this book has been translated into English and republished for a wider audience, among whom will be many who are actively offended or misled by the content of this book.In summary, this book is misleading and offensive. It ignores certain significant and relevant facts, while misrepresenting others. It needlessly insults other cultures and religions. It does not even attempt to give an unbiased account of philosophy. Nor does it appear aware of the limitations of its own prejudice. I find it useful primarily as an antiquated Catholic account of the history of philosophy. If you want to get an idea of St. Thomas Aquinas's philosophy, without Aquinas's logical rigor, then this book might be useful, but only if you can put up with the author's unwarranted prejudice, his explicit hostility to other traditions, and his lack of critical reflection about his own tradition. Maritain is no Aquinas, and this book is no state-of-the-art introduction to philosophy or its history. It is an 86-year-old French Catholic textbook, written under contract with the Church in the wake of a 19th Century Papal encyclical, exclusively advocating a 13th Century worldview which contradicts modern science. Caveat lector!"},{"Title":"I Pledge Allegiance","review":"One of the most horrifying aspects of this tale, a horror story, is the apparent blitheness with which these ordinary people entered into an enterprise that ultimately yielded them hundreds of years in prison.It goes like this: you meet an old navy buddy for drinks and he tells you he's got a business proposition for you. He admits it's a little illegal, but notes too the chances of getting caught are slim. So it makes good business sense-low risk/reward ratio, opportunity galore, and anyway you've sort of been at loose ends since retiring from the navy. Heck, you've got to be bold and take some risks to get anywhere in this world.Or it might go like this: you're a young man and you admire and respect your dad. Nothing unusual in that-he's your dad! He was in the navy and he wants you to follow in his footsteps, so you do. And he says he'll pay you good money for classified documents-sure it's a little risky, but if you want to be a Man you have to take a risk now and then. Or, you could live your life as a wimp. It's your choice. So that leads to the most bone-chilling scene in the horror story: Dad smirking and wise-cracking while his son, his own and only son, is gets life in prison. Well, 25 years, but to a 22-year-old, that's life.Howard Blum did a lot of research for this book: countless interviews, reams of technical documents on law and espionage and naval procedure, letters. But it doesn't read like some legal tract or academic research project. It reads like a B movie script, tawdry and melodramatic, with much attention given to the day-to-day problems of international spies and their families: the alcoholic wife, the wayward children, the ... struggle for respect. And when it's over there is the melancholy realization that the alcoholic wife and the wayward children were the lucky ones, if you can call it that. They avoided the lure of the psychotic monster at the center of the drama. The son was next luckiest.

What I received was quite different, but quite wonderful, and an indispensable resource as I study theology and philosophy as they relate to postmodern ideas.The text, edited by Sim, who is a professor of English Studies at the University of Sunderland, has dozens of contributors drawn from the academy and professional ranks. They provide an insight in the broad and varied diversity of postmodernism, which is far from being a monolithic enterprise. There are two main sections to the book - first, a series of 14 essays on sources and developments in modernism, and the second, a critical dictionary of names and terms.The first section of essays includes essays such as Postmodernism and Philosophy, Postmodernism and Politics, etc. The topics deal with feminism, science and technology, art and architecture, many aspects of popular and current culture (cinema, television, literature, music, lifestyles), as well as the general idea of postmodernity vis-&agrave;-vis modernity and traditions of criticism and dissension. Each of the essays is interesting and engaging, brief enough to be read in one sitting, yet thorough enough to be the sort the interested reader will return to again. Postmodernism can be defined in various ways, but Sim gives the definition out of Lyotard as the rejection of \`grand narratives' and universal theories -- the sort that science, metaphysics, mathematics, and other such disciplines have tried since the Enlightenment (or even further back) to support and impose. There is a strong antifoundational sense to postmodernism, that often makes it controversial.One of the really useful aspects of the essays is that the text includes words (names, terms) in boldface when they are included in the general dictionary in the second section. There are brief biographical sketches of key intellectual players in postmodernism (Derrida, Lyotard, Barthes, Baudrillard, Foucault, etc.) as well as creative and artistic types (Pound, Carter, Rushdie, Vonnegut, etc.) contained, as well as figures who, while not postmodern themselves (Kant, etc.) nonetheless provide necessary and significant pieces to the postmodern project.Rare is the book that will contain references to both Derrida and Heidegger's destruction/deconstruction as well as MTV and the rock band U2. This is truly postmodern! The cross-referencing makes this book a real pleasure to use; both the index and the bibliography make this of real value to scholars as well. The text is difficult at times (given the subject matter, there is no escaping that) but not needlessly so; the careful reader will find value regardless of the lack of previous critical and philosophical training.I began my interest in postmodernism as a piece of theological investigations arising out of narrative theology. This book goes much further afield than that narrow disciplinary focus, but I am grateful for that, for it opens up a broad vista on the subject, and asks questions that need to be addressed in intellectual pursuits and cultural/creative tasks across the board."},{"Title":"The Routledge Companion to Postmodernism (Routledge Companions)","review":"This is the single most essential volume for anyone who wants to familiarize his or herself with the huge field of postmodern theory. Most people realize that postmodern theory is incredibly controversial with opinions ranging from the positive to the negative to some theorists who claim postmodernism doesn't even exist. Some of my professors have gone as far as to claim that the term \\"postmodern\\" itself is meaningless, that it cannot be defined. Anyone who reads this book will understand exactly why that is a ridiculous statement: there are plenty of answers available and even if there is a multiplicity of interpretations and understandings, there *are* definite, defensible positions and you'll discover them here.I must stress that this is excellent as an introduction: of course no one would use this as their only source on postmodern philosophy. The point is, this book introduces you to the influential theorists, their ideas, and their work. Following that, you can go and explore them on your own. The best thing about this book is that it gives you a manageable overview without reducing a rich field of discourse to a few key ideas and people. There are shorter guides to postmodernism, but they're typically the work of a single author from a single perspective. Stuart Sim does a great job compiling articles and dictionary entries here.The articles are largely descriptive so you don't need to worry about hidden agendas and biased information. The writing style is conducive to understanding and communication. Concepts learned here will help you tackle the more difficult primary sources later when you're ready for more specific readings.It's also a great reference. Even after studying postmodern philosophy for a few years, I still return to this book to remind myself of certain facts. I've recommended it to a number of friends who found it very useful as well. This is great for students and for those with a casual interest in continental philosophy, postmodern theory, or our contemporary world.

Unfortunately, Spiritual Unfoldment 1, is far from that.The book starts with a chapter called &quot;A Simple Approach&quot;, which discusses the need for correct health, breathing and posture forspiritual attainment. I found this chapter to be fairly good and instructional. The second chapter discusses the aura and the third discuses communication between the two worlds. It was after these last two chapters that I realized I had a book very different from &quot;The Quiet Mind&quot;. Although I have read alot about spirit communication and auras, I have not yet found a book that I feel adequately explains the phenomenon and this one is no exception.The book continues with very short, single chapters on still more spiritual concepts... your spiritual guide, clairvoyance, divine love, reincarnation, karma and spiritual healing. Although each of these chapters were interesting, they were not discussed in-depth enough for the reader to walk away with a good understanding or belief in the subjects.My idea of a great book is one that leaves you thirsty to learn more, that makes you think deeply, that makes that &quot;light&quot; go on in your head with a knowing... YES! This book did not do any of those things for me... so I would not recommend it.Although there were a few interesting passages, I recommend you spend your time reading and re-reading &quot;The Quiet Mind&quot;, also by White Eagle instead.

I mean, that is why I purchased the thing but you know what?, I found that I didn't really need it...at least not this edition of it. This is because the ANA is the, ahem, gold standard when it comes to grading coins so practically any current book that you buy concerning the grading of coins will use this information as the baseline. Thus, you can buy books on the hobby that may focus on a topic more exciting to one and which are interesting reads as well, but which nevertheless will refer to the standards elucidated here as the starting point of any discussion of coin grade. What I am saying is that the information contained here is critical to establishing a coin grade so you probably already know what you need to know about these standards from other coins books you have read which purport to help you to establish grade bcause they use this book as a jumping off point. So, use this book as a reference manual, especially if you want to become a professional grader and all the while hope that the ANA comes out with an easier to read and more useful edition soon. Either that or read the other books out there by well-respected coin experts who use these standards and help you &quot;how to use&quot; the standards laid down in this book. The reason that I'd rely upon experts who write books on the hobby for such guidance is that they understand what makes one coin more desirable than another even though each ostensibly meet the objective standards contained in this book, and they tell you how they know and try to instruct you how to do the same. The best way that I can demonstrate what I am talking about is that I bought a coin on ebay that was slabbed by NGC to be a 1938 D/S buffalo nickel. I returned the coin to seller because the '8' in '1938' had been sheared off at the mint. Yet, this coin was in MS-65 condition according to the standards laid down in this book.

To them Luther could do no wrong because he saved us from the big, bad Catholic Church.I am tired of people apologizing for Luther's comments, saying that he is being taken \\"out of context\\". How do you take it \\"out of context\\" when you read that Luther said that we should round the Jews into their synagogues and burn it down? Is there a way that can be taken in a nice way? I have read how the apologists for Luther explain away his quotes, such as when he said we should \\"sin boldly\\". It doesn't stand up to scrutiny.Or how can this be taken out of context?\\"Christ committed adultery first of all with the woman at the well about whom Saint John tells us. Was not everybody about Him saying: \`Whatever has he been doing with her?\\" Secondly, with Mary Magdalene, and thirdly with the woman taken in adultery whom He dismissed so lightly. Thus even Christ, who was so righteous, must have been guilty of fornication before He died\\"How can that statement be taken out of context? How can it be, within the right context, that it is all right to say that our Lord was a fornicator?The author was not a Catholic. He did not have an axe to grind. He does nothing but quotes from Luther to speak for himself. The quotes are extensive. Even if half of the can be explained away, it still shows a very dark side to Luther.By contrast, the apologists for Luther are Lutheran or at least Protestant. I would like to see a non-Protestant defend Luther. Then their arguments would carry weight.Luther was a very complex individual. One minute he could write something very beautiful, the next minute he could write something very ugly. His apologists try to explain away his uqly quotes. His detractors ignore hisbeautiful quotes. But the truth is that he was capable of saying both."},{"Title":"Martin Luther Hitler's Spiritual Ancestor","review":"The concept of nuance is lost on the ideologue, as is that of context with the fanatic. If any endgame be established at the first, and the agent of action is determined, the whole truth tends to be the victim, and even more hapless still any mind which happens upon said agent's propaganda without an appropriate perspective. For instance, say I were to cite a remarkably scary set of statistics concerning child abuse, citing the most egregious cases for specific examples, and referring to the whole span of instances without any due diligence being paid towards the countless households who have not been victimized by such a sorry turn of events, all in the name of recommending that mankind ought not procreate. Though I uttered nothing non-factual and could rightly claim to have facts on my side, I would be rightly called a liar and dismissed as such for the distorted picture of reality I had used to sway the opinions of others.This handy little abridged piece of quasi-history conforms to the hyperbolic example given earlier all too well, laying out a very limited picture of an all too touchy subject, so much so that a new entry to the list of logical fallacies has been added to denote it. \\"Martin Luther: Hitler's Spiritual Ancestor\\" paints a bleak picture of a crazed lunatic that, against all odds apparently, managed to alter the entire ebb and flow of western history. Even the notion that a man lauded by the likes of Thomas Jefferson and credited with the rise of religious liberty in the closing days of the medieval era could also be an inhuman monstrosity should cause one to question the logic of the premise and inquire for a broader understanding. And ultimately those who would seek a fuller picture will find this book an insult to their intelligence, written in the politically hysterical aftermath of World War II. An era where the Germans found themselves the villains of history no less, while the barbaric hordes of the Soviet Union who raped and pillaged Eastern Europe and the Allies who carpet-bombed Germany into cinders and their flag bearing leader the USA dropped 2 atomic bombs on citizen populated cities were exalted as gallant heroes.There are 3 principle lines of attack at this book's disposal which round out the lion's share of the author's argumentation. The first and probably the most infantile is the continual referral to Luther's personality traits, in a multitude of differing contexts yet assumed as a singular one, referring to his most coarse quotes and giving not hint as to what inspired them. Similarly, constant reference to Luther's varying emotional states and frequent arguments with the devil are thrown to a modernist audience taught to view such things as the behavior of a committed asylum dweller, without so much as a singular mention of the parallel mysticism rampant throughout medieval Christendom (East and West), to speak nothing for the bold face absurdities that often passed for civilized behavior in the various cult religions beyond the Christian nations. The very nature of this book lends itself to an audience that has a great interest in modern history and little in previous events, so dishonest intent on the part of both the author and even more so the present publishers can be rightly considered.The 2nd mode of attack, and seemingly the one meant to inspire a surprised sense of outrage from the intended readership deals with the various Anabaptist and Peasant uprisings in Luther's day. Taken on their own, his tracts on the subject appear reprehensible, but this would assume that both groups that were on the receiving end of Luther's polemics were comparable to modern liberals, and Mr. Weiner even goes so far as to make a boldface comparison between the Anabaptists and modern socialist movements, the apocalyptic superstitions and constant resorts to violence of the former conveniently not withstanding or even being mentioned.Further expanding on the political intrigues of Luther's time in the German provinces, Mr. Weiner slips up a bit in providing a well thought out argument rather than simply casting aspersions and conflates Luther's sense of nationalism with that of the Nazis. A favorite point of derision employed by those supporting polycentric government against those pushing more monolithic forms is that Hitler's own writings expressed a heavy disdain for the concept of provincial and municipal sovereignty as it gets in the way of the unity of all Germans, which does not gel with Luther's favoritism towards the rule of the princes of the various German provinces, a part of Luther's exploits that Weiner actually manages to get right in spite of this. A consistent proto-Nazi would most likely not empower municipal magistrates and would seek the favor of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, who held a higher authority over all German lands.The 3rd and final line of argumentation brought out by this narrow little fantasy novel deals, in great depth, with Luther's alleged anti-Semitic writings. It is necessary to point out that anti-Semitism is most often qualified in racial/genetic terms; something which was not on the radar of Christendom where what was paramount was one's confession of faith. Ironically, despite Weiner's fondness for repeatedly quoting \\"On The Jews And Their Lies\\", he misses a fundamental part of the tract which deals with the fact that the Rabbis of the time (and going back to the days of the Gospel) taught that God's very favor rested upon their \\"blood relation\\" to Shem. It becomes difficult to consistently argue Luther a hereditary bigot when he is mocking teachers for perpetuating the very same bigotry on the grounds that it is a lie.Anyone familiar with the Babylonian Talmud and the early documented exploits of Rabbinic accomplices in Roman suppression and persecution of early Christianity will see how Luther, right or wrong, came to the views that he did. He was fluent in Hebrew and a scholar of history and theology, so all past encounters between Judaism and Christianity were available to him. Yes, his proposed measures to solving what he saw as a threat to the church in Germany were extreme even to the very princes that he allegedly incited to butcher those helpless Peasants who were also looting and burning down churches, but in the context of the time was a typical approach to problem solving. Deep differences in religion are still the subject of continual strife between Israel and Palestine to this day, both sides accumulating a history of atrocities in its name, and both falling on the crutch of past oppression to justify themselves. If nothing else, Luther's self-asserted magnum opus \\"The Bondage Of The Will\\" proves to be a universally correct assessment of man's behavior, and he himself fell victim to his own fallen nature many times in word and deed.The subject of Martin Luther, both the revolutionary and the prototypical medievalist, is worthy of better scholarship than this pile of useless citations and misleading assertions. Yea, history itself should never be subject to such sophomoric mockery. The intricate history of Germany's development as a modern nation should be subject to much broader study, rather than laying the entire creation of Nazism at the doorstep of one man, even if his writings on government did reinforce the proto-Erastian concept of passive submission to arbitrary state authority that most medieval Germans showed their rulers and continued to do during the reign of Bismarck and later Hitler. Speaking as someone who is not a Lutheran, nor a Romanist, nor a Fundamentalist, I don't have a dog in the continual conflicts between all parties with regards to Luther's status as a new apostle, a heretic, or a villain of allegedly the most odious nature, but as a confessing Christian I am still very much interested in the antics of the American Atheist Publishing company in resurrecting a debunked pile of intellectual rubbish and filling the minds of trustees of modern pop history with it. During the 1940s when this was written, there was a response book that directly debunked its claims, which is conveniently not in print anymore and extremely difficult to track down, but suffice to say, an education untainted by modernist revisionism (a rarity at present) provides the needed answers to Peter Weiner's charges and also eliminates the necessity of reading it beyond debunking the fools who quote it as if it were gospel."},{"Title":"Martin Luther Hitler's Spiritual Ancestor","review":"&quot;Hitler's spiritual ancestor&quot; is a short book that tackles some very large questions. The author Peter Wiener wrote the book towards the end of World War II and was a Christian of German origin. The huge questions that he tackles include: &quot;How could the German people allow Hitler to lead them into a war that was so brutal, destructive and remorseless?&quot;, &quot;Who was Martin Luther...really?&quot; and &quot;What part did Martin Luther's teachings play in the horrific genocide of the second world war?&quot;. Although the author doesn't answer all these questions completely (then again who could?), he brings up some excellent points and allows the reader to &quot;see for themselves&quot;.This work does not portray Luther as the &quot;Great Reformer&quot; that many theologians remember him as. The author does an excellent job of portraying Luther with 'warts and all' and he does this by using Luther's own writings against him. He argues that Luther set the scene for the bloodiest genocide in human history. His teachings, and his philosophy were instrumental in paving the way for a German nation filled with people that had a warped idea of Christianity and humanity. In fact the author portrays it as a &quot;pseudo-political German religion&quot; that puts the nation first and Jesus second. After hundreds of years of being indoctrinated by Luther and his unbelievable theology, it is no wonder that the people of Germany were so easily able to accept Hitler and his maniacal, nationalistic ideas of ethnic cleansing."},{"Title":"Martin Luther Hitler's Spiritual Ancestor","review":"This is a fantastic book based on Luther's own writings. After reading it, I began to understand more of Luther and his reformation movement.Before reading it, I was confused about the topic.&#9679; If Luther was sent by Heaven, why so late (A.D.1517) ?&#9679; If Luther was right, how did Christians before Gutenberg printing press was invented get access to the Bible ?&#9679; Why did God allow the Church to be split into thousands of denominations ?The book is consistent with what others say about Luther and the Reformation, e.g. Plinio Correa de Oliveira in his \\"Revolution and Counter-revolution\\".Now the picture is clear, as clear as glass."},{"Title":"Martin Luther Hitler's Spiritual Ancestor","review":"Luther was a deeply disgusting man who is venerated by millions in Lutheran churches all over the world. This book should be widely read because it reveals the truth about him. Typically of an anti-Semite, the words and phrases he used to smear, denigrate, condemn the Jews were absolutely applicable to himself, which strongly suggests that anti-Semitism has its roots in self-hatred."},{"Title":"Martin Luther Hitler's Spiritual Ancestor","review":"To be fair, it is obvious that Peter F. Weiner did extensive research before he wrote his 104 page book on the relationship between Martin Luther and Adolph Hitler; however the implied promise of the book is never truly realized.Weiner does a fairly admirable job of showing that Martin Luther was not the heroic and blameless champion that many Germans and Lutherans from all over the Western world claim him to be. And indeed he piles up more than enough evidence to show that Martin Luther was extremely anti-Semitic and an advocate that gave his blessing for kings and princes and other authority figures of Germany to arrest, torture, oppress and even execute all of those \\"inferior\\" beings such as the Jews and the peasants that might be found on German lands.He also proves beyond a reasonable doubt that Martin Luther was a strong proponent of war and that he had a great hatred of the French and the English. He hated foreigners and was a great believer in Germany over all.And then after dedicating most of the pages in his book to Martin Luther, Weiner (almost as an afterthought) writes a small amount about Adolph Hitler and makes some small effort to connect the dots and explain why Hitler's hatred of the Jews, contempt for all non Germans, and belief in the use of brutal and deadly force was something that Hitler acquired from Martin Luther.To be fair, Peter Weiner does at least BEGIN to build a case for how Martin Luther is Hitler's \\"spiritual ancestor\\"; however he never really finishes the job.He very briefly mentions German anti-Semitic preacher and politician Adolph Stoecker who was influenced by Martin Luther and he strongly hints that Hitler growing up in the time that he would almost certainly have been influenced by Stoeker.However this is a weak argument as are Weiner's brief mentions of Friedrich Naumann.And of course the fact that Hitler was raised as a Catholic and remained a Catholic his entire life is never analyzed. If Hitler was truly the spiritual ancestor of Martin Luther why did Hitler never convert to Lutheranism? Also, Weiner never investigates the many anti-Semitic popes and other anti-Semitic Catholic leaders of the past 400 years. Why couldn't one of THEM have been responsible for the way Hitler turned out?In all fairness, 104 pages is probably not enough to make a strong case for Martin Luther being to blame for Hitler's paranoia, German nationalism, anti-Semitism and bent for bloodthirsty conquest, however if Weiner was unwilling to write a longer book that was able to \\"connect the dots\\" in a satisfying manner than it is my opinion that he should have chosen a different title for his book.Perhaps \\"MARTIN LUTHER: WARTS AND ALL\\" or \\"MARTIN LUTHER: NOT A HERO OR A GERMAN DEMI-GOD\\" or perhaps \\"MARTIN LUTHER: AN HONEST LOOK AT A DEEPLY FLAWED MAN\\"."},{"Title":"Martin Luther Hitler's Spiritual Ancestor","review":"This book was originally written in 1942 by an English University professor who emigrated from Germany as a child. There are some generalizations in the book accepted as fact due to this experience. This is a very eye-opening book, as I explained to another fellow, what Luther said Hitler did, (and, as the book points out, Hitler was a Catholic.) But I was reading a book on Paul and the author kept repeating the point that the Lutheran Paul had lost credibility in light of recent historical events. I put Luther and Jews in Google, and found this book and the book Luther wrote, The jews and their Lies."},{"Title":"Martin Luther Hitler's Spiritual Ancestor","review":"!!!!Mr. Wiener is playing on people's ignorance of Martin Luther to sell books.Just looking at the photo on the page is enough to convince any thinking individual that the author has an obvious ax to grind and is willing to try and color the publics rational thought process by any means, especially guilt by association, to effect a negative opinion of Martin Luther, the great Protestant reformer whom we owe so much to this day.Martin Luther was one of the most courageous spirits in human history who at the same time never lost his humanity. When all the world was sucked up into Catholicism's inconsistencies and power, Martin Luther stood alone and said God was not owned by the Catholic Church, thus allowing a freedom that had been denied to Christians for hundreds of years before and enjoyed hundreds of years afterwards, to this day. Perhaps the freedom we now enjoy is enjoyed too recklessly and in vain as evidenced by such books as Wiener's.It is absolutely asinine to try to link Martin Luther to the holocaust and Hitler.Martin Luther in truth was the spiritual ancestor of nearly e-v-e-r-y-one today. Hitler distorted so many truths and perverted every good thing he could, falsified so much and smeared so many, I don't see how you can blame the victims of such mischaracterizations or use them as a scapegoat.Even the Bible has been used for evil. I don't see how any one can blame Martin Luther if Hitler found something in Martin Luther's writings to pervert. But that is the book game these days---try and smear someone's good name in order to sell books.After a while those who are truly interested in the truth will understand what a grave injustice Weiner has tried to do to a person who has done so much for humanity, even still today, while others like Wiener are only interested in destroying for destructions sake which leads you to ask the question, \\"Is Hitler Wiener's ancestor?\\""},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Mandarin Phrasebook (Lonely Planet Language Survival Kit) (French Edition)","review":"Anyone who has gotten this far to check the reviews and knows LP for their work, knows that you can't consider travelling in China without the LP China book.

In today's business environment, information is the most critical resource of an organization. The success or failure of any organization depends on how well it manages its information resources so that the employees can take better decisions, reduce response times and quickly react to changes in the marketplace. Information is the key.Webster's dictionary defines the word knowledge as \\"all that has been perceived or grasped by the mind; learning; enlightenment.\\" Information is not knowledge. Knowledge is something more than information. Information combined with practical experience and wisdom becomes knowledge. Being informed is important, but being knowledgeable is critical. Because with mere information decision will not be made, actions will not take place and goals will not be achieved. For all these to happen knowledge is required; so one can say that it is knowledge that makes or breaks the organization. With knowledge, people are involved, human element is present.Knowledge management is the art and science of utilizing the information, making it available to the right people, in the right form and at the right time, so that they make better decisions and thus lead the organization to success. Knowledge management allows one to increase productivity and reduce costs throughout the organization.This book is a practical, no nonsense guide to applying the theories of knowledge management. It explains the various tools, techniques, methodologies and practices of knowledge management. In this Internet word, the book's emphasis on the Internet and web based technologies of knowledge management is very timely.The book is designed in a very pleasing manner and the layout and the usage of color and space is very pleasing to the reader. The book is amply illustrated and contains a lot of flowcharts and diagrams that makes the concepts clearer. The authors' don't waste any words and even though the size of the book is small, it covers a lot of ground and that too very thoroughly. While the features like \\"Case in Point&quot; and &quot;Why Is It Important?&quot; and the real-life examples add tremendous value to the book, the quotations and figures add a lot to the readability. The 90-day action plan is a very useful feature and will help in giving the initial boost for starting the knowledge management efforts.So if you are a manager or an entrepreneur and if you want to succeed in the business environment of the next millenium, then I suggest you read this book.

Surely KM is about knowledge creation, not just distribution and access to content? 2) What about people and KM? Surely people not content and publishing is at the core of KM? 3) Do you really exchange knowledge when you distribute content? There are many reasons why some of the deepest thinkers believe it is information that is being transfered and knowledge emerges from people to people interactions, dialog and apprenticeship.Most companies soon discover that leveraging knowledge is actually very hard and is more dependent on community building than information technology and content publishing. This is not because people do not read or are reluctant to use information technology, rather it is because they often need to share, create, test knowledge that is neither obvious nor easy to document, knowledge that requires a human relationship to think about, understand, share, and apply appropriately.If you are looking to leverage the knowledge within your organization, following the advice of Managing knowledge may help you with the first baby steps, help you show some fast positive ROI and maybe please your sponsor. However if you wish to gain sustainable competitive advantage from KM, you would well advised to take a deeper look at people rather than the content, enable practices such as dialog, build and support learning communities, concentrate on making meaning and distinctions that matter, support knowledge sharing through recognition, raising the level of awareness and increasing critical thinking.I found chapter 6 to be the most valuable part of this book. The authors are spot on when they say &quot;One of the very early steps you need to take is establishing the common terms that will be used across all the content in all the repositories you are seeking to manage&quot; (p78). The reason is a common vocabulary and agreement on meaning assists with dialog. Knowledge and all action emerge in conversations, not in the indexed repositories.In the looming knowledge economy, the premium will be on making distributed, fast, intelligent responses, building connections and relationships, holding open communication in community, fostering strong critique, driving knowledge creation, being agile and cultivating awareness of market shifts.You will not find one of those terms in the index of this book!"},{"Title":"Managing Knowledge: A Practical Web-Based Approach (Addison-Wesley Information Technology)","review":"The authors are quite specific when explaining for whom Managing Knowledge has been written: \\"This book is for those people who have read some of the academic literature on KM [Knowledge Management] and who (along with their bosses) are convinced that they need to go down this path....Our purpose is not to address the nature of knowledge. Rather, we want to help you get the right information to the right people so that they can take effective action....Everything we say in this book assumes that you are (or are going to be) leveraging Web-based technologies to move data, information, and knowledge.\\" Their purposes could not be clearer.The book is divided into four sections:Part One: Getting Started (Strategy and Profiling People)Part Two: Organizing Around Information (Storyboarding Knowledge and Mapping the Knowledge Network)Part Three: Knowledge Architecture (Hiring People, Mobilizing Content, and Building the Technical Architecture)Part Four: The Ninety-Day Action PlanThis book provides both the structural design and the operations manual needed by any organization to achieve these objectives:1. To evaluate the information it now has2. To identify the information it needs...but does not (as yet) have3. To formulate a Web-based system to manage knowledge more effectively4. To set in place those best qualified to manage that system5. To facilitate and encourage knowledge sharing throughout the organizationIn Part Four, the authors wisely recommend that an organization choose a single business cycle that can be improved and begin the \\"Ninety-Day Action Plan\\" with a knowledge audit; next, begin building a core team and select an appropriate technology (or technologies); then during Day 61-Day 90, explain your team's efforts throughout the organization (\\"to communicate the benefits of a KM system and to sell the concept of the knowledge architecture\\") while constantly updating the content under management.Given its stated purposes, I rate this book very highly. It is well-organized, well-written, and comprehensive in terms of material covered. Contrary to what some reviewers may suggest, I think it provides the knowledge needed to manage knowledge effectively. If your organization has the aforementioned five objectives and has not as yet achieved them, I suggest that its key executives read this book immediately and then launch a collaborative effort to implement the \\"Ninety-Day Action Plan.\\" Why wait?"},{"Title":"Managing Knowledge: A Practical Web-Based Approach (Addison-Wesley Information Technology)","review":"A Review and Synopsis of Managing Knowledge - A Practical Web-Based Approach by Wayne Applehans, Alden Globe, and Greg LaugeroIn knowldgWORKS News Volume 1 Number 12 KnowBits pointed you to a series of World Wide Web links on the Microsoft Web Site. The links consisted of a series of case studies offered by Microsoft as examples of how their technology could be used as the basis of knowledge management efforts. Most of the case studies had very little to do with knowledge management, but quite a bit to do with Microsoft technology. One of the case studies distinguished itself. This was the case study describing the knowledge management effort at J.D. Edwards. The description of the effort was so rich that I sprang for the book by the people responsible for the work at J.D. Edwards.My overall opinion: BUY THIS BOOK !Without equivocation this book is the best compact description of what knowledge management is about. The book consists of practical information and advice about conducting a knowledge management effort. It is short, to the point, and has lots of great diagrams. Here is a synopsis.This book begins with a series of assumptions. They are as follows:Assumption 1: (my favorite) &quot;Knowledge management does not have to be profound.&quot; Assumption 2: You have a champion and are figuring out how to get started. Assumption 3: Document management concepts, technologies, and procedures provide the basic disciplines to kick off a successful effort. Assumption 4: Yours is a mid to large size company with an intranet and extranet and an internet presence. Assumption 5: Your business is consciously preparing for the internet economy.The parameters of the discussion are clearly set forth by these assumptions. But consider that even if you don't meet all of the assumption criteria, the information contained in this book is still extremely valuable.One of the challenges of any knowledge management effort is explaining why your organization might want to do knowledge management. Consider adopting these reasons :1. Ease of partnering 2. Ease of managing expertise turnover 3. Ease of decentralizing decision-makingEach of these reasons represents a competitive imperative.Any book about knowledge management needs to define the term. Remember my own definition goes, &quot;Knowledge Management is the process of controlling, using, manipulating, and communicating that which enables us to do things.&quot; Consider the authors's definition of knowledge.&quot;Knowledge is the ability to turn information and data into effective action.&quot;The authors go on to say this is a tactical definition &quot;because they are not interested in esoteric debates about the nature of epistemology.&quot; (Hooray ! )With regard to managing knowledge, Applehans et al give the following definition.&quot;managing knowledge means delivering the information and data people need to be effective in their jobs.&quot;This book does not mince words. It tries to keep things fairly simple and straightforward. The authors represent the trichotemy of data, information and knowledge as a pyramid consisting of data at the base, information in the middle and knowledge at the top. Interpreting this figure, one can infer the relationship between data, information and knowledge fairly easily.The book is divided into four parts and several chapters. Part one, &quot;Getting Started&quot;, focuses on strategy and profiling people. Part 2 creates the basis for relating knowledge to the business and covers storyboarding the knowledge and designing the organization around the knowledge it uses.Part three deals with the topics, &quot;Hiring People,&quot; &quot;Modeling Content,&quot; and &quot;Building the Technical Architecture.&quot;Lastly part four presents a 90 day action plan.One of the most interesting parts of the book is in part two where business process is attached to the informational needs and people involved in the process. What this breakdown gives you is the ability to see where the knowledge resides and how it is used in the business. The relationship of knowledge to process to people grounds a knowledge management effort in the business.Given the success of the author's effort at J.D. Edwards, I certainly believe they are on the right track. Given J.D. Edwards, size one has to wonder if the process scales down to smaller organizations. I would argue that, regardless of the size, the processes apply. The technical architecture may be substantially different for a small organization but that does not change the desired results, and the process proposed by the authors should scale up and down for businesses of all sizes."},{"Title":"Managing Knowledge: A Practical Web-Based Approach (Addison-Wesley Information Technology)","review":"\\"Managing Knowledge - A Practical Web-Based Approach\\" is an easy to read and apply guidebook for a complicated process.

This practical guide to implementing knowledge management techniques can be used on one process or an entire organization. Though, the authors do recommend picking one process/cycle to begin the implementation process.The authors are straight forward in explaining that the nature of their book is not to explain knowledge management. It is assumed that you have read other books on knowledge management prior to using this guide. I found the book was well written enough that you really just needed some basic understanding of knowledge management, along with the foresight and desire to improve the formation and flow of data, information and knowledge. The book's subtitle states \\"a practical web-based approach\\", yet many principals of this book can be used in non web- based applications. Before I finished the book, I was convinced that my organization should implement the needed changes for managing knowledge, and that my organization would benefit greatly from retooling its self for the information economy.

Two of the four communities portrayed have changed. One has become extinct, and one, San Francisco, has changed radically. Jerry Falwell's has survived, but it now seems less significant these days. Age-restricted communities have grown in numbers and scope. Frances FitzGerald is right to see the development of all four as peculiar. She stresses the role of life-style and religion. All of the communities are totalizing, meaning all-encompassing, experiences. All of them represent changes from former lives and so are explicable in terms of liminal states and rites of passage research. All require extreme commitment on the part of the participants. All are sheltered from the world in certain respects, or could be said to represent new versions of reality. Perhaps only the homeschooling movement of today requires similar exertions of will.Reviewing history, it is noted that the Castro in San Francisco in the 1970's became part of a vast redevelopment project. Harvey Milk, though, and others were powerless to overcome the forces of gentrification. On November 27, 1978, Harvey Milk and George Moscone were shot and killed. This was eight days after the mass suicide at Jonestown. AIDS hit the Castro hard by 1984.The next section bears the title, &quot;Liberty Baptist--1981.&quot; Television evangelists came at the time of a change in American religious life in the 1970's. Conservative evangelists were attracted to television as a medium. The patriotism was no surprise, but the launch into electoral politics was surprising, even to their audiences. By 1980 Bakker and Robinson retreated. The risks of political involvement involvement were too great. Only two superstars, Robison and Falwell, remained. Robison was a Southern Baptist. Falwell was a pastor of an independent Baptist church. Falwell was head of the Moral Majority. Falwell was most characteristically an organizer and a promoter. Fundamentalist pastors had been identified as part of a new coalition, the New Right. Falwell was leading a radical movement.Lynchburg is a small city of sixty-seven thousand. The city stands between Appalachia and Washington D.C. In the 1950's it was still a mill town, but it was being transformed into one of the cities of the New South. Lynchburg is really a collection of suburbs. Developers are still at work at the edge of town. It is not a graceful city. There are over a hundred churches. Falwell's church on Thomas road is block away from Lynchburg College.The Thomas Road Church is a vast and mightly institution. It includes Liberty Baptist College. It is a church advocating separation from the world. It tries to be comprehensive. Success and how to get it are main themes in Thomas Road preaching.Jerry Falwell was an ambitious school boy. He attended Lynchburg College for two years and then made a career decision and transferred to Baptist Bible College in Springfield, Missouri. In 1956 he decided to start his own church in Lynchburg. He began broadcast activities immediately. In a year his congregation went from thirty five people to eight hundred sixty-four. His preaching style and theology are conventional. He is pithy, old-fashioned. He has organizational talent and enormous driving energy.He built up his church's capacity for saturation evangelism. He has never had the money to complete any projects he has begun. He is always out ahead of himself. His church and college have been in financial crises. The author finds something a bit exotic about Falwell's congregation. Liberty Baptist College students refer to their school as boot camp. The Civil rights Movement showed Falwell preachers could be politically effective.The next section is labelled, &quot;Liberty Baptist--1986.&quot; In 1985 the college was renamed Liberty University. There is a plan to develop professional schools and a full range of graduate programs to equip church-influenced students to compete in the secular sphere.&quot;Sun City--1983&quot; describes retirees. It is an age-segregated community. Sun Citians see very little of their Florida neighbors. Sun City is an island of wealth in the midst of rural poverty. There is something child-like about it. Twenty years ago couples settled in Sun City. At the present juncture there are couples and widows. The developers who built Sun City made no provision for sickness and incapacity.Finally there is Rajneeshpuram, the attempt to build a Hindu city on an Oregon desert. The Rajneeshee came to Oregon from Poona, India via Montclair, New Jersey. The author heard of the Rajneeshee in 1983. The leader, the guru, was fighting deportation. The Rajneeshee were a major political issue in the state. Still, they remained quite mysterious to the Oregonians. The settlement, given the setting, was outlandish. Experts could not determine whether the settlers were pursuing good agricultural practices. The followers had had wordly successes. They were people of accomplishments. The ranch was awash in the Human Potential Movement. One observer thought that a traditional Oriental despotism had been created at the ranch. Through a series of miscalculations-- political, financial, public relations-- Rajneeshpuram in 1985 was a half ghost town.There is a last chapter in the book entitled &quot;Starting Over.&quot; It brings together strands from the previous chapters and opens up new areas of discussion in treating the matter of the Burned-over District. How such a variety of movements could arise in such a short time and in such a restricted geographical terrain of a few counties in New York State is an historical puzzle. The author suggests the Swedenborgians and Mormons and Abolitonists and the Fox sisters resemble some of the communities and movements she portrays in her book."},{"Title":"CITIES ON A HILL","review":"I read this many years ago and want to read it again. It was written in the 70's but I think the subject will still be relevant."},{"Title":"CITIES ON A HILL","review":"This AMAZING one-star review is my personal protest against authors (publishers?) who use descriptive adjectives about the quality of the book IN THE BOOK'S TITLE! It reminds me of people who post personal ads where they describe themselves as \\"very good-looking.\\" I'm pretty sure we can all be the judge of who is good-looking to each of us, and which books we find BRILLIANT. Evidently this book was not all that brilliant to begin with--two reviews in the last 10 years, and countless used copies at $0.01."},{"Title":"CITIES ON A HILL","review":"The author looks at four cities across the US in the 1980s. The most important chapter is on San Francisco. This was during the rise of the AIDS controversy. Nowadays, this chapter seems outdated. But at the time, it was quite interesting. I think urban studies majors or journalism majors may find this book quite useful."},{"Title":"The Everything Online Auctions Book: All You Need to Buy and Sell with Success--on eBay and Beyond (Everything (Business & Personal Finance))","review":"The book covers most of the culture surrounding auctions from both the buyer and sellers point of view.It provides a very good guide for reducing hassles between buyers and sellers.Though it was published in 2008, more than half it's content is out of date.The author covers eBay, Yahoo, Amazon, and uBid. He goes into gross detail on how to work in each system.Unfortunately, two of the four are no longer conducting auctions in the US and uBid requires the seller be an actual business and a lengthy process just run auctions on its site.I call books like these \\"books of the moment\\".They maybe true when the author wrote them but not necessarily true now.The sign up process for eBay can change considerably since the book came out.For this book and others like it, to provide this much detail is only setting themselves up for a very short shelf life. The book is easy to read but towards the end began reading like a brochure. If you get the book, don't read it end to end like I did. Much of it is obsolete but you will gain some interesting insight on auctions that can be useful.Borrowed the book as a Prime Member"},{"Title":"Yet Another Introduction to Analysis","review":"Mathematical analysis is a refinement of calculus, and a pathway into further branches of mathematics, including topology and advanced topics in algebra. Analysis, however, may not seem to be at all related to calculus at its initial stages. An introductory course on analysis can render an unprepared student, even with experience in other branches of mathematics, perplexed and challenged to an extreme. Only later in the analysis course are even the most basic topics of calculus introduced.One of the most important considerations prior to taking an analysis course is the level of background and understanding of mathematical logic. Set theory, a branch of mathematical logic, is in fact the basis of calculus as well. Due to an emphasis upon computations, however, the highest grades in calculus are possible without understanding, or even knowing of, this underlying foundation.This work is unique among those introducing analysis, in that it does not require a background in set theory. It in fact teaches numerous fundamental concepts of set theory, without stating that it is doing so. Examples provided are based on daily concrete experience, yet are altered for purposes of mathematical instruction. These descriptions are sufficiently general as to prepare the reader for when formal set theory is introduced in more rigorous textbooks.In addition to being an extremely readable and accessible work, solutions and hints are provided for every review question for every section of the book. This is in stark contrast to textbooks on the subject, which, while costing several times more, are typically designed for a classroom setting, and so leave all questions unanswered. This self-testing of the understanding of each section is crucial for subject matter requiring such attention to detail and precision.The numerous illustrations throughout the book are rendered clearly and with instructional purpose, yet are often drawn by hand, adding to the sense of familiarity with the author. All of the basic subject matter for a course on analysis is provided, yet has been specifically tailored for a reader in the stages of preparation, of review after completion, or one who is simply inquisitive as to what is required to comprehend analysis successfully.The softcover edition is durable and portable, and the book remains in excellent condition through numerous readings, which it will almost certainly go through.If you have been required to take an analysis class but left it with only a vague sense of its underpinnings, you may wish to go through this work when time permits. For the price of the book, the information and instruction provided is truly outstanding. This text receives the highest marks in all categories."},{"Title":"Yet Another Introduction to Analysis","review":"This is a text for Real Analysis at the Junior Level (American university level). It goes to extreme lengths to make analysis understandable to people who have no prior exposure. The organization is good. Completeness is introduced early as (the &quot;piggy in the middle&quot;). Proofs are written in detail with fill-in-the-blank spots to force the reader to follow the argument. It has good exercises making it an easy book to teach out of. Excellent for the absolute beginner. Good candidate for the classroom."},{"Title":"Yet Another Introduction to Analysis","review":"While there have been countless introductions to mathematical analysis (calculus) this is my favorite. The author does a brilliant job of making the subject matter interesting and very understandable with excellent exercises along the way which have solutions in the back ! A must read for bright highschool seniors and college freshman that are taking calculus or will be."},{"Title":"Yet Another Introduction to Analysis","review":"Bryant builds the basic concepts of a first course in mathematical analysis upon the notion of numerical sequences. This approach gives an unified vision and amazing insights. Infinite series, limits, derivatives, Riemann integral are studied in an integrated vision. Clear ideas, illustrations and humor are found across all its pages. Good and illuminating exercises, too. An excellent introduction to basic real analysis."},{"Title":"Yet Another Introduction to Analysis","review":"Victor Bryant's informal, conversational text, Yet Another Introduction to Analysis, offers an engaging, well-motivated introduction to real analysis, but it is not a full substitute for a more formal, more axiomatically structured approach. However, Bryant's text is a great companion text, and is especially suitable for self-tutoring purposes, or as pre-read prior to taking that first rigorous analysis class. The reader need only be familiar with first year calculus.As is so often said, mathematics is not a spectator sport, and Bryant clearly expects his readers to work the problem sets; the text frequently makes direct use of the results of previous problems. Bryant provides full solutions to nearly every problem, another reason why this book is so good for self-study. (The solutions section is 67 pages.) Bryant's problems were rarely difficult or overly time consuming, and are most notable for clarifying key points in the text.Bryant begins with a brief examination of real numbers, looking at why the irrational numbers so out number the rational ones. (The completeness axiom is introduced in the short first chapter.) I particularly enjoyed the next section, Bryant's examination of whether a series converges or not and ways to determine the sum of an infinite series. (I had not previously been all that interested in the study of series, but Bryant's approach peaked my interest. I have now purchased a more advanced Dover reprint, Infinite Series by James M. Hyslop, for follow-up reading.)A longer section examines the familiar concept of a function from various perspectives, using the inverse relationship between exp and the log as one of the key examples. The final two chapters focus on a primary topic of analysis, the basic theorems of differentiation and integration. Familiarity with partial differentiation and multiple integration is not needed.Some readers may find Bryant's conversational approach to be too wordy and occasionally digressive, but I personally enjoy his leisurely style. I also recommend Bryant's short text titled Metric Spaces, Iteration and Application, published by Cambridge University Press.Another good choice is Maxwell Rosenlicht's Introduction to Analysis, available in an inexpensive Dover edition. It offers a more traditional, structured approach to analysis that is suitable either as follow-up to Yet Another Introduction to Analysis, or as a stand-alone self-tutorial text. Although Rosenlicht's text emphasizes generality and abstraction to a greater extent, it is still more concrete and less terse than many standard texts on real analysis."},{"Title":"Yet Another Introduction to Analysis","review":"I found this book an excellent introduction to real analysis. The math courses I took during my US undergraduate engineering degree (your standard Calc I - Calc III) focused more on computation than theory. This book gave me a deeper understanding of the real number line, sequences and series, functions, differentiation, and integration, as well as some much-needed practice in writing proofs.I was a bit worried starting the book that it would be too difficult, but fortunately, the book started at just the right level for me and continued at a good pace. The book is written in a friendly and conversational style and all the concepts are well-explained, with lots of graphs to make things clear.The exercises often have you proving some key theory that is referred to later on, which gives a strong motivation to work through all the exercises. For someone with little experience writing proofs like myself, the exercises were not overly difficult, but provided a good challenge. The book provides full, worked-out solutions to all the exercises, which makes it great for self-study (I used the book to get some background on analysis over summer before I started my master's).Overall, I found this to be an excellent book. I highly recommend it for self-study or as a supplement to a course."},{"Title":"Yet Another Introduction to Analysis","review":"Bryant's book on analysis is a great illustration of what a textbook should be. He takes what many upper level college mathematics students consider to be the most tedious and boring topic - analysis- and presents it in a clear, interesting and effective way. Calculus at the college undergraduate level is usually taught in 3 semester long classes where integrals and derivatives are seen as tools for finding areas under curves, or volumes of objects, etc. which is the way engineers are made to view Calculus during their scholastic careers. Past that introductory level, in their junior years students of pure mathematics must be reintroduced to Calculus in a rigorous proof-driven way - thus enters the dreaded subject of \\"analysis\\", also sometimes called \\"advanced calculus\\" and thankfully, thus also enters this book. Bryant starts off assuming that rational numbers behave as we know from elementary school and then constructs the real numbers by adding a completeness axiom. From there he introduces the concept of limits and also the epsilon-delta technique in an accessible way before going on to the topics of differentiation and integration. Even though this is a mathematically rigorous book, the author manages to keep things interesting by introducing topics and theorems in bite-sized chunks. Basically, the book doesn't go beyond the analysis of calculus normally taught at the undergraduate level, but rather reintroduces it properly and puts it on the rigorous plane with which all graduate mathematics students shall become familiar. Along with all that, there's an excellent selection of interesting exercises with solutions at the back. These exercises range from the rather simple to the very tricky. If you are a mathematics major, you will probably not be lucky enough to have this as your textbook in analysis class, but you should buy a copy and read it before and during the class so that you know what is really trying to be conveyed."},{"Title":"Yet Another Introduction to Analysis","review":"Unlike many of the other reviewers of this work, I found Dr. Bryant's informal writing style a hassle. While I can appreciate the conversational approach, I found his writing to be very lacking in detail and too casual to yield in-dpeth knowledge. I suppose this work was intended to introduce Analysis in a non-scary, casual style, but so much substance gets left out because of it. I've always been fond of rigor, and I deperately need rigor when learning higher math. Some people equate rigor with obfuscation, but I have found that you can have rigor wth clarity. I found Kosmala's \\"Advanced Calculus: A Friendly Approach\\" (now called \\"A Friendly Introduction to Analysis\\") to be a much more rigorous and complete introduction that is also very \\"friendly\\" indeed. Although this book will serve as a \\"breezy\\" (and somewhat shallow) introduction to Analysis I would recommend Kosmala's work over this one to anyone who wants a complete and in depth treatment of the subject that also gently guides the first time student through it."},{"Title":"Yet Another Introduction to Analysis","review":"Just right!This is the real analysis book for all us Goldie Locks out there."},{"Title":"Yet Another Introduction to Analysis","review":"Look inside the book!

Before I read, re-read and loved &quot;Light in August,&quot; I had tried books like &quot;Absalom, Absalom&quot; and &quot;The Sound and The Fury&quot; countless times only to get bogged down in the convoluted grammar and personal symbolism as well as the dialogue. For some reason, when I was ready to really read and concentrate, it was certainly not easy, but it was a great, distinct pleasure....one that has stayed with me. Faulkner is, as novelist and essayist Ralph Ellison calls him, &quot;...the greatest artist the South has produced.&quot;This Modern Library compilation of some of Faulkner's short stories is a perfect place to start to read this author, or to keep returning for his keen insights into the heart and nature of the Southerners he created from the Southerners he knew. There are thirteen stories here and they include one of Faulkner's most famous, &quot;A Rose For Emily&quot; a tale of great love and, perhaps, necrophilia. My personal favorite, depressingly sad though it is, is &quot;Dry September&quot; which tells of the extreme violence not only of small town whites to blacks but of whites to whites. Every one of these superb stories is a gem, masterfully written. Most were intended for magazines and so are much more straight forward and &quot;simple&quot; than the novels.My only complaint and it is with Modern Library, is that, except in two cases, we are not told when Faulkner wrote the stories nor when they were published. Even so, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."},{"Title":"Selected Short Stories of William Faulkner","review":"Since reading \\"A Rose for Emily\\" as a boy, I have been hooked on Faulkner. I kept a worn out copy on hand to show to my teachers who accused me of using run-on sentences (some of his sentences took an entire page.) He is a true master and when I feel homesick, after being too long in some foreign country, I read a Faulkner story and remember the South where I grew up.\\"The past is not dead. In fact, it's not even past.\\" --W. Faulkner\\"Faulkner is the greatest artist the South has produced.\\"--Ralph Ellison"},{"Title":"Selected Short Stories of William Faulkner","review":"Just as most athletes excel in one particular event, so many writers find their greatest work in one genre , primarily. Faulkner is an impressive storyteller but the work he is most remembered for is his long- distance works, his novels, \\"The Sound and the Fury\\" \\" Light in August\\" \\"Absalom, Absalom\\" among others.The stories here nonetheless provide a real sense of Faulkner as a writer. The unmistakeable Faulkner style with its complex and Latinate sentences , its cumulative enveloping rhythm, its penetration of the inner lives of its characters, in grotesque and often extreme relationships, including those in which there is often real violence, is here in these stories.Among the stories in this collection are \\"A Rose for Emily\\" \\" Dry September\\" \\"That Evening Sun\\" \\"Lo\\" \\"Red Leaves\\".Turnabout\\" .I would say to truly know Faulkner at his best and fullest it is necessary to read the novels. But the stories too give the feeling and flavor of this great American master's work."},{"Title":"Selected Short Stories of William Faulkner","review":"This is a great collection for someone who hasn't read much Faulkner. Everyone needs to have at least read &quot;A Rose For Emily&quot; and &quot;Red Leaves.&quot;"},{"Title":"Selected Short Stories of William Faulkner","review":"This is a great set of classics that I intend to read again. It is from this prolific novelist that we have a countering view that the American good ol' days of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, especially in the South, were actually not so desirable after all.It is by reflecting upon this perspective that I found \\"A Rose for Emily\\", \\"Barn Burning\\" and \\"Dry September\\" to be the most memorable stories. These particular three had a sequence of developments that focused and reflected upon ugly truths that were hidden behind public veneers of \\"Southern niceties\\". In essence, the outcomes were essentially America's fictional and somewhat factual answer to the rampant pornography throughout England during what was regarded as the pristine Victorian Era.Also, Faulkner had an uncanny way of depicting how societies with unwritten rules of proper mannerisms would be unraveled thanks to a bullying, uncouth citizen or family. His writing style was that of using actions and events that set the transition from what each person was like at the surface to what he or she was really like all along and how those around him or her would be affected in the aftermath.If you are interested in stories about how a person, individually, might have either gotten along or contrasted with the norms and tones of an immediate culture, especially in rural America, Faulkner is the ideal author. And again, this is an excellent collection for those who want to start reading Faulkner. A slight word of warning: some of you might find it shocking that there were troubles and prejudices that set parts of America on edge, especially if most of your exposure to U.S. History has been largely sanitized.As a recommendation, if you enjoy the stories but find some of the terms unfamiliar or the endings ambiguous, I suggest purchasing William Faulkner A to Z as a reading companion."},{"Title":"Selected Short Stories of William Faulkner","review":"I have been reading Faulkner since I attended late High school. That was about the time I started experiencing life's disapointments, loneliness and heartache. Before that time I was just a school girl untouched by betrayal,and soul degradation. People should read Faulkner when their lives have been through turmoil-then one can understand his characters. The first story I read was a \\"A Rose for Miss Emily\\". It was one of the most shocking accounts of a woman who was desperately lonely and as a result, engages in necrophilia to stop the emptiness inside of her. But I suppose a dead man is better than no man and thru the years, laying with that dead body or whats left of it, I dont think Miss Emily knew the difference.Sad and depressing as his stories are. Faulkner digs deep into the dark psyche of his characters. Lets face it, we all can relate to Faulkner's characters but we dont want to admitt that we do. Faulkner scares us but one thing I can say about Faulkner, he understands the human condition and he writes about it in an elegant prose. His writing reminds me of placing a beautiful piece of lace over a hideous and disturbed entity.I will continue to read Faulkner only because his stories force me to look at myself a little more closley and as a result, I am better for it."},{"Title":"Selected Short Stories of William Faulkner","review":"Faulkner is one of Americas best, if not our best, story writes ever. This short, but sweet, book contains some of his finest short stories. Well worth the cost for anyone who loves southern gothic stories.

I was not disappointed. This book will keep me busy on and off for weeks. I especially like the Paint By Numbers section, which is a mental logic problem of multiple simultaneous equations that really captivated my mathematical mind. I also enjoyed the crossword puzzles. My only complaint is that some of the clues are somewhat dated; they refer to people and events that were current years ago. Now that I think about it, I guess I have another complaint; my husband keeps picking this book up and writing in it, in pen!For an excellent variety of puzzles, from easy to difficult, from crosswords to cryptics to logic to wacky wordies, this is a great choice.

This is due in no small part to the fact that Michael Wireman, the main character is a believable person. He's not superman and he's not Jojo the idiot circus boy. He's just a guy in the right place at the right time. The right ancestry couldn't have hurt. Wireman's the son of the president of the solar system., not that it means much on Alpha Centaur. It seems Earth and the solar system are under \\"Invader\\" control. The only thing his father presides over is a government in exile that the centurians could care less about. Then one day the situation changes...since I didn't see a synopsis provided by Amazon (unusual) I'll copy it down here: Wireman came back to a vanquished Earth on a mission to save it. What he learned was that the guerrillas were corrupt and the average citizen would just as soon be left alone. And he wasn't in very good shape himself.1991 paperback synopsis"},{"Title":"The Falling Torch (Vintage Pyramid, G416)","review":"Algis Budrys' The Falling Torch (1959) is on the surface yet another simplistic brave oppressed mankind rebelling against the alien invaders who have conquered Earth novel &agrave; la Aldiss' Bow Down to Nul (variant title: The Interpreter) (1960) and the ilk. And I was deluded into thinking it was until a third of the way through and then inklings of a deeper, albeit not entirely redeeming, purpose/meaning emerged. The message is laboriously and inarticulately conveyed -- shackled and hampered by its time worn and altogether too restrictive plot.Budrys attempts to wiggle within his confines by creating a character study charting the coming of age of our less than heroic main character who emerges from the artificial constructs heaped on him by his exiled parents who look back on free Earth with nostalgic longing. However, like the author's unsuccessful articulation of the work's themes, the \\"growth\\" of our \\"hero\\" isn't entirely evident unless the plot demands that he has indeed evolved.The Falling Torch is clearly trying to evoke the post-War environment of Budrys' Soviet homeland, Lithuania. However, the equation of Soviets with aliens which look like humans but can't breed with humans again is evidence of the painfully clunky nature of the work.Brief Plot Summary (limited spoilers)Earth has been conquered by the human-like Invaders. However, Earth's colony of Alpha Centauri has remained free. Many years have passed since the conquest and a government for Free Earth still exists on Alpha Centauri. The Centaurians are reluctant to give outright support to the government and its vague and unsustained attempts to free the home planet.Budrys established the Centaurians as detached from the sufferings of Earth due to their distance from the home planet which has resulted in not only in a different dialect but an entirely distinct culture. Here the work is at its best -- showing the complications seldom addressed by the traditional narrative. However, with the growing threat of the Invaders on Centauri territories they are pushed into action.The President of Free Earth on Centauri is an old man. His entire cabinet is beset with the more pressing concerns of daily existence in a foreign society. The Centaurian System Organization (C.S.O.), a military organization, offers to clandestinely ship weapons to various separatists which still exist in Earth's hills. The President delegates the task to his rather unintelligent son, Michael.By the time Michael arrives on Earth with the weapons he suddenly possesses much greater intellect, training, etc then he previously showed (i.e. the plot demanded it and Budrys didn't want to elaborate on Michael's evolution of character).Soon Michael realizes that the separatists on Earth are driven more by petty squabbles and rivalries than any real desire to free the planet from the oppressors, who really aren't that oppressive. Michael decided to surrender to the Invaders... And then...Final Thoughts (Some Spoilers)Without doubt The Falling Torch is more than the run of the mill push out the evil aliens that have brutally enslaved the planet. Budrys has Michael encounter people who have found a respectable place within the new society, he attempts to humanizes the aliens, and even suggests that their reign isn't that terrible -- for example, they allow the dissidents to run around in the hills as long as they don't attack and even administer a work placement test to anyone who wants a chance to assimilate.All the positives of the work are hampered by the banal plot. Also, Budrys skips over the difficult moments of the narrative: key moments in Michael's evolution of character and most importantly, Michael's entire eventual movement to \\"free\\" earth! At least the \\"freedom\\" has various complicating caveats.The work with its thought-provoking themes has the potential for a great novel. Unfortunately, The Falling Torch remains a work of unfulfilled promises."},{"Title":"The Falling Torch (Vintage Pyramid, G416)","review":"My comments are for the audiobook version, which I assume is basically the same.The book starts describing in some detail the Earth at a time after the Invaders were defeated and then backtracks to the \\"past\\" of how this came about. The portrayals of the characters and politics are excellent.The resolve of the exiled Earth president sets his son into action to return to Earth and help the ongoing resistance to the Invaders. The Invaders are portrayed as benefactors rather than aggressors by the Earth people who have grown accustom to their rule. Yet some human \\"exiles\\" raise a resistance of sorts, but primarily just fight among themselves. When the main character arrives he sets into motion events that lead to the attack against the Invaders at a critical time.The themes have to do with what an ordinary and initially highly moral person can accomplish when put into extreme circumstances. The psychology of his conflict between moral standards against murder versus survival and freedom are brought out well if not fully explored. Interestingly the Invaders play a similar role in bringing out this theme but more in the background.My biggest dissappointment with the book is that these themes are not explored further. The ending seems abrupt, but I suppose, if I'm left wanting more that may also be a sign of a good book."},{"Title":"Staying Healthy With the Seasons","review":"I discovered this book as it was part of my curriculum in Holistic Massage Therapy School.

I wanted to know which foods were seasonal (not being a farmer), and some information on what to avoid. I thought Animal Vegetable Miracle provides a lot of that latter information.

Famous Freudian Marxist Erich Fromm uses the \\"Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts\\" as well as \\"The German Ideology\\" to stress the importance of humanist concepts such as alienation, freedom, and creativity for Marx, and in so doing explains what these and similar terms mean in Marx' work. Fromm has clearly paid careful attention to Marx' philosophy, and this part of the book is quite good as a simple overview.The second half of the book covers the English translation of the aforementioned \\"Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts\\" by Tom Bottomore, as well as excerpts from various other works by and about Marx meaning to show his humanism, his good nature, and his sensitivity to culture. Of special interest are the excerpts from the memoirs of those who knew Marx, like his daughter Eleanor as well as Paul Lafargue. These works are often quoted, but rarely does one find a larger part in English, not even in McLellan's biography.Fromm goes a bit overboard here and there in stressing Marx' 'spiritual' nature. Although nothing Fromm writes is of itself incorrect, it may unwittingly reinforce the old canard of Marxism 'really' being a religion, and Marx a millennarian prophet, and so on. Fromm obviously rejects this old refrain, but should have made that clearer. In other aspects this collection is an interesting primer on Marx as thinker on human action and human nature, and sheds good light on this side of Marxist thought for those not familiar with it."},{"Title":"Marx's Concept of Man","review":"Marx? Communism? Please!That's the gut reaction of most of us. Why is this? Why is the man who's ideas stimulated nearly half the world to revolution automatically rejected without even being seriously looked at by most of us the U.S. today? What's that you say? \\"History shows us that communism is an impossible system that leads to the greatest tyranny.\\"The fact is Marx is much more than communism. His most famous work is not called Communism but Capital. (The manifesto was a small pamphlet next to the thousands of pages of the planned four volumes of Capital). He is strongest in his analysis of the very history and machinery of this economic system. In fact, it is in his critique of capitalism (not his proposition of communism) that he is most original.Today, we see yet another crisis in global capitalism. Almost all of us who seek understanding of this crisis do so using the very same conceptual tools of the capitalist doctrine itself. But what if there are incorrect assumptions that the governments, universities and media networks of the world continuously overlook?Marx's Concept of Man serves as an introduction to such an analysis. It is a compilation of various manuscripts of the early Marx and is quite digestible--especially after Fromm's preface. Erich Fromm--a significant 20th century philosopher in his own right--introduces us to some of the most timeless aspects of Marx's concept of man in a way that makes his thought significant to this day."},{"Title":"Marx's Concept of Man","review":"This book is an excellent book for anyone wishing to gain a readable understanding of Marxist thought. The first 92 pages are especially insightful. A must buy for anyone interested in Marxism."},{"Title":"Marx's Concept of Man","review":"Erich Fromm, displays a different profile of Karl Marx. According to Fromm, Marx is very different than the one told by the Russian Communists. Fromm tries to show the humanist ideas of Marx and he describes Marx's philosophy as a synthesis of humanism and naturalism. There are also good descriptions of what socialism means: \\"Socialism, for Marx, is a society which permits the actualization of man's essence, by overcoming his alienation.\\".Fromm describes the Marxist socialism as the heirs of propethic Messianism.This book is really interesting because Fromm tries to explain the humanistic values in socialism.Indeed, all the communist propaganda has claimed that their way is the real Marxist system; however Fromm claims that their system was just a crude communism which neglected human beings and humanistic values."},{"Title":"Marx's Concept of Man","review":"Fromm's analysis of Marx is incredible, finally someone truly understands Marx's writing. This is an excellent edition for someone looking for a side of Marx not often discussed."},{"Title":"Marx's Concept of Man","review":"This is a book that should, but given the existing political culture, won't be made required reading in schools and universities.Eric Fromm was a humanist writer who lived from 1900 to 1980, and exerted a strong influence on Baby Boomers with his popular books. This book about Humanistic Marxism shook the intellectual world when it was first published in 1961. It rattled the conventional wisdom at the time it was first published. The West had, as Fromm readily admits, a glaring misconception of what Marxism meant. They could hardly be blamed for this misunderstanding. The only example the West had to look towards to see Marxism in action was to observe the Soviet Union. The Eastern Block shares responsibility in misconstruing the meaning of Marx. Its monumental government apparatuses, unwieldy bureaucracies, its virulent oppression of human rights, all these characteristics were definitely NOT how Marx envisioned a communistic society.Fromm goes into great detail on the humanistic philosophy of Marxism. If Hobbes' Leviathan emerged to protect man from a state of nature, the true goal of society according to Marx is to provide the conditions by which man may reestablish his relationship with nature, with others, with society at large, and with himself. The impediment to this reestablishment is alienation, a common concept of Marx, which drives a wedge between man and the other elements to his life and to himself. As Fromm repeatedly reminds the reader, alienation does not simply exist in Western societies; it is equally prevalent in those countries under a so-called \\"Communist\\" form of government. Fromm states that the governments of Lenin, Stalin and Khrushchev were simple totalitarian states.There is a decided spiritual aspect to Marx, in that the goal of a person's life is self-realization. This self-realization, however, is one which allows a person to achieve their own personal goals, based on that person's abilities, talents and labor.Fromm was addressing a world in the middle of the Cold War, and published in an America just emerging from the crushing conformity of the 1950's. It has continued relevance today, where the societal pressures are hidden and the urge to conform reemerging.This is a short book and can be read in two or three sittings. It is a well worth read."},{"Title":"Marx's Concept of Man","review":"...someone dusted off Marx and took a good psychological look at the wealth in his writings! One needn't be a Marxist (I am not) to appreciate this fine book. My one concern is that Fromm is to Marx as Kaufmann is to Nietzsche: both men either ignore or euphemize the weaknesses in the visionaries they write about (e.g., Kaufmann's remark that Nietzsche's hateful, cynical, and demeaning remarks about women &quot;do him little credit&quot;). Nevertheless, this book provides a good compensation for the Western tendency to demonize a man very much misunderstood by those who turned his writings to political purposes."},{"Title":"WriterSpeaker.com: Internet Research and Marketing for Writers and Speakers","review":"With this book, writing books just became faster, easier, cheaper and a lot more fun.
