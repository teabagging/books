He loves to show off. I'd recommend this book to small children and any one who does not share. The book makes you feel like you're with the characters: like Rainbow fish and its friends.This book is powerful with greatness, selfishness, and rudeness. In the beginning, a small blue fish swims up to Rainbow fish and says \\"Rainbow fish, may I have one tiny, very small glittery scale?\\"Whith attitude, Rainbow fish says, \\"Who do you think you are? Why would give you one of my special scales?\\" sadly, blue fish swims way. This causes every one to dislike Rainbow fish.In the beginning, I felt like I would not be Rainbow Fishes friend, but probably in the end. Rainbow fish goes to a dark cave beyond the coral reef to Mr. Octopus and says, \\"Ah, I've been waiting for you, the waves have told me your story.\\" Rainbow fish thinks Mr. Magoo is an awful helper. I didn't much like the part that Mr. Octopus disappeared. But Mr. Magoo should have let Rainbow fish talk.Of course this book takes place in the ocean at a coral reef. Also I think any one, especially fish lovers, should read this book even when they are 52 years old. The pictures in this book are amazing.Strong is the word for this book. I personally think this book is fantastic! This book is perfect for all ages!"},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"Colorful, shiny pages and reading with lots of expression make this a winner at our house. --Spoiler alert--Yes, at first glance this book might appear endorse buying your friends. However, something occurs early on in the story. A little fish approaches Rainbow Fish and asks if he would play with him. That's all he asks. Rainbow Fish is too proud of his beauty and doesn't think he should associate with the little fish, he says some harsh things to the little fish, then swims away. The little fish tells his friends and THEN no one wants to associate with him. The story goes on from there. SO, it was Rainbow Fish's arrogance and pride that cost him friendship-not his unwillingness to share/the others wanting his possessions. Now, at the end of the story Rainbow Fish IS approached again and this time the others want something from him. He shares and everyone is instantly his friend. But, you must consider their first impression of him-how he shunned them. They finally saw that he was nice and willing to share. That's my interpretation and when we read this book together, that's how I explain it."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"My son (22 months) LOVES this book.

I read it to my kids verbatim only once, but after that made up an alternate ending in which Rainbow Fish refuses to give her scales away.

That's bad enough itself (I feel as if I've been a victim of the old \\"bait and switch\\" routine). But the story is so abbreviated in the board book, that the original message of the full-length book is gone -- which is what I suspect is bothering many parents here.I strongly urge anyone who is interested in the book to go to the library or bookstore to look at the full length version of the book, and THEN decide if you like the story.

Why can't the Rainbow Fish be utterly beautiful and still have friends? Why must she lessen her beauty to be happy? We all have gifts that make us unique and wonderful. She should be applauded and learn how to appreciate everyone else's gifts as equal to her own instead of destroying what she is and has.

My daughter sometimes asks me to read it to her and I must remember to get rid of it. I just use it as a tool to teach values that were not intended by the author.Allow me to add to the list of negatives by the other reviewers. For example, the blue fish should be detached and simply admire the shiny scales. It's rude to ask to have one of them. My daughter is four and I asked her if it's polite to tell her friend Emma that you like her stickers (yes). Is it polite to ask her to give you one of her stickers (no)? More important is not to backbite. The blue fish should not have gone to the other fish to tell them the rainbow fish wouldn't give away one of his scales. His backbiting caused all the other fish to shun the rainbow fish. The rainbow fish gave away his scales in order to have friends, not for the intrinsic \\"goodness\\" of the act.

They are simply ostracizing the rainbow fish for not giving them what they want. Even Beatles knew better to sing \`can't buy me love'; this book almost teaches that you CAN buy love. Friends swarming around you because of what you have are no friends at all.At the same time there IS a lesson to be learned in this book. The rainbow fish's attitude in the beginning is full of pride. He thinks lowly of those who don't have beautiful scales like his. The pride drives others away, and in the end he humbles him self by giving what he has.When I saw so many 1 star ratings I was a bit surprised. I see the parents concerns about what kind of message this book is sending but I think it's up to the parents to guide their kids to find the right message. I focus on the \`humble' aspect, that bragging would turn off friends. Another good message I got from this book was even though the rainbow fish didn't have anything to give the friends stayed.I think this book is beautiful in its self and my daughters love this book. They pick out this book quite often for me to read to them, and I do."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"As a child therapist, this is a concept I work with regularly, and this book is a beautiful way to help the children learn."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"ISBN 1558580093 - It's a rare thing that I read a childrens' book knowing full well that there is an actual critical debate going on about it, but The Rainbow Fish is one of those. With that in mind, I'll begin with those parents. The message any child gets from a book that is read to them is more dependent upon you than the contents of the book. If you're going to be all freaked out by some wacky idea that this book teaches socialism, you're going to convey that to your child and you will do more harm than the book, all by itself, ever could - in that case, just pass up this book. No harm done to anyone. While I think you're crazy, I think you have the right to make that choice.If, on the other hand, you can manage two things: to actually read the book and get the message (which isn't socialism/fascism/communism and isn't really sharing, either) and to understand that you are not 4 years old and your 4 year old doesn't think the way you do, then this book is worth picking up.A beautiful, conceited fish lives in the deep part of the ocean. His scales sparkle and shine as he swims through the ocean - alone. The other fish attempt to befriend him, but he ignores them until one day when a small blue fish approaches him. The small blue fish tells the Rainbow Fish how beautiful his scales are, and asks for one of them. Horrified, the Rainbow Fish refuses and swims on, puzzling aloud over his loneliness. A crab directs him to an octopus, whose advice is simple: give away his scales to the other fish and he will be happy. After some thought, and a second request from the small blue fish, the Rainbow Fish takes the octopus's advice and finds friendship and happiness.Let's face it - this book has a large number of 5-star and 1-star reviews for a reason. Here's my two cents on those reasons: One, look closely at reviews and you'll notice that many negative reviews are for the board book edition, which is truncated to suit the format. The book has already been translated from its original language (Swiss) and then it's edited to fit a smaller book - of course there is going to be missing information in that version. Two, adults are reading this book, assessing it by their own standards and forgetting that children see a very different story here. Adults see the scales as what they are in the real world: a part of the body of a living creature that doesn't talk. In this book, which isn't the real world (as evidenced by the talking fish), the scales are more comparable to clothing or jewelry - a possession, not a physical feature. Adults also seem to fail to see one glaring thing: while their eyes are on the \\"give away your possessions\\" issue, they forget the way the story starts. In the beginning, the Rainbow Fish is vain and lonely, concerned only with his scales and their beauty, certain that he should be liked for his beauty alone (\\"I really am beautiful. Why doesn't anybody like me?\\").The idea that the message here is about sharing is easily proven false. The summary inside reads \\"The most beautiful fish in the entire ocean discovers the real value of personal beauty and friendship\\" - not a single word there about sharing. The message in this book is more about not letting your possessions possess you, about understanding that others won't like you just because you're pretty, and about recognizing that friendship isn't about someone else adoring you but about sharing something, even if all you share is play time (not necessarily possessions). For that alone, if those are messages that you're able to convey to your child, the book is worthy of the shelf space. Add in the lovely pastel illustrations (and the person saying this usually despises pastel illustrations) by Marcus Pfister with the scales that actually sparkle and you've got a winner. The worst I can say about the book is that, perhaps, something is lost in the translation by J. Alison James. Children will enjoy the story and be very happy that, in the end, the Rainbow Fish isn't alone anymore.

Having read both, I can more readily agree with the naysayers' point of view when applied to the board book. The text is simplified in such a way that makes it easy for a vigilant parent to misunderstand the message.However, I found the hardcover book to be perfectly lovely. In this version, it was more clear that the reason the Rainbow Fish had no friends was because of his arrogant attitude and unwillingness to share - not because the other fish were envious, or needed to be \\"bought\\" with gifts. The sharing of his scales was not to \\"buy\\" friends or to promote communism - rather, it represented his learning three important lessons: 1) that his identity need not be tied into his appearance or his possessions, 2) that he shouldn't consider himself to be superior to the other fish just because their scales were a different color than his, and 3) that sharing your blessings with those around you makes you - and them - feel good.I highly recommend this book, in its original version."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"A great children's author (who, for the sake of her privacy, shall remain nameless) once commented that \\"The Rainbow Fish\\", was the third in the triumvirate of picture book mediocrity. The first two being, of course, \\"Love You Forever\\" and \\"The Giving Tree\\". I don't feel like explaining why this statement is not only brilliant but sublime, so instead I'm going to review this seemingly innocent little picture book. Here we have a very dull book with a very poor message. In my humble opinion, it hardly deserves much notice.Originally a Swiss picture book (who knew?), \\"Rainbow Fish\\" tells the tale of a little sparkly fellow below the sea. The Rainbow Fish glitters and glides in the ocean's depths, ignoring the calls of the other fish to come out and play. One day a little fish asks for one of his shiny scales. The Rainbow Fish is not exactly polite in his refusal, but for some reason this is the comment that causes all the other fish to make him a social pariah. The Rainbow Fish is a little upset by this and asks the advice of a wise old octopus. Unfortunately the octopus is of the opinion that Rainbow Fish should give away the very things that make him special. His shiny scales. Once he has given a scale to all the other fishes he'll look exactly like everyone else and be happy. He does and then is. The end.I suppose if you looked at this book from a religious context it might make a little more sense. But even then the moral would still run along the lines of give-up-your-worldly-possessions-and-everybody-will-like-you. Hm. What makes this book so offensive to some readers is the simple fact that it's is preaching a kind of same = good mentality. Tis better to meld with the crowd than to hold onto that which makes you an individual and unique, it sayeth. Then there are the illustrations to contend with. In an interesting marketing technique, the shiny scales Rainbow Fish sports are small hologram-ish cut-outs that line his body. Little kids will, presumably, see the shiny things on the cover of the book and immediately grab it. But how stand the rest of the illustrations? Certainly the colors in this tale are luminous and lovely. Pfister has developed a lovely watercolor technique wherein the blended shades of the scenes work perfectly within the context of the story. Unfortunately, the actual illustrations themselves are fairly hum drum. Don't expect the breathtaking loveliness of Eric Carle's \\"Mister Seahorse\\" or even the originality of a similar seaside tale, Irene Haas's, \\"The Maggie B.\\". Characters here never change expression (except that once in a while their little fishy mouths curl either up or down as appropriate). As a gimmick, the shiny scales work well. Just don't pay much attention to anything else in this tale.The best advice I can give regarding \\"The Rainbow Fish\\" is to recommend Leo Lionni's classic picture book, \\"Swimmy\\". Like The Rainbow Fish, Swimmy's a little guppy who's different from everyone else. But rather than, oh say, changing his scale color to blend in, Swimmy uses his unique position in society to help those around him while remaining true to himself. A powerful statement that \\"The Rainbow Fish\\" sorely lacks. I'm not saying this is the worst picture book ever written, mind you. Just a mediocre one. With all the wonderful picture books out there, why not grab the best and leave the rest? Or, if we're going to take the advice of the Rainbow Fish to heart, do what everyone else is doing and strive for mediocrity. Hey, it worked for him!"},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"Yes, I know some will feel that those who dislike this book are analyzing it to death, and if you are one who dislikes analyzing, you may really enjoy this book, and you can skip the rest of my review. Having said that, though, I found the story line for this book to be very disturbing. On the surface the story is about sharing, and indeed that message is conveyed. However, several other themes come across as well, and I think they are more prominent. First, if you refuse to give up what makes you special or beautiful when someone asks for it you will be rejected. Second, one is loved and valued for what one has to give away to other people. Third, it's not OK to stand out in some way - everyone must be the same.Despite the disturbing (to me) themes, I found the book to be beautifully illustrated. We have the bath book version, and the illustrations are much more beautiful and complex than your average bath book. The colors in the illustrations are all within the same color family, though (adjacent on the color wheel for you artists) - purple, blue, green. This color scheme is appealing to me, but my daughter finds it boring, and doesn't really like to look at this book.I don't read the story to my daughter because the themes concern me, but if your child likes the colors and pictures it's a nice book just to look at together. We &quot;read&quot; the things in the pictures rather than the story (&quot;Look it's a pretty fish with shiny scales&quot; &quot;Where's the seashell?&quot; etc) and that works fine. I wouldn't buy the book for myself, but I didn't throw it away when someone gave it to me either.Bottom line for you fish lovers: What happens when you take away a fish's scales? Answer: It dies."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"We own this book only because my wife ordered it from a book club. Had we looked at the book, we never would have bought it. My two-year old has not seen it, nor will he. He has enough good books. And this book is bad. The book is so bad, destructive, immoral, and wrong that I have trouble figuring out where to start. Well, let's start with the \\"moral(s)\\" of the book, which can be summed up as follows: (1) being special is evil, and worthy of hatred; (2) if you do not give your possessions away to others on their demand and pursuant to their coercion, you will be rightfully hated; (3) you will be happy only if you are mediocre; (4) you need to bribe people to be your friends. And the message here is not about sharing. Notice, the Rainbow Fish does not \\"share\\" his scales (sharing would imply that his friends were going to give the scales back when they are done.) No, the Rainbow Fish is compelled (by emotional coercion) to give away that which makes him special. What part of this story is supposed to be edifying? It is garbage."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"This book is very pretty. I've read it to a group of children (not my choice - a teacher asked me to do so) and to my own child, who got it out of the library, and I've certainly seen its appeal to young children. They can't sit still. They just have to reach out and touch the lovely, shiny, foil scales. (Although the look of disappointment on their faces when they find out it's just a flat surface is also obvious.)I think getting children interested in books at a young age is crucial, so ordinarily I would love a book with this kind of appeal, even if it wasn't a book that especially appealed to me. I perfectly understand that sometimes children and adults have different tastes.But this book, despite its prettiness, is awful. A beautiful fish, different from all the other fish because of his glittering, jewel-colored scales, has a hard time making friends, because the other fish don't like the fact that he does not look like them. In order to win friends, he gives away his scales, one by one, until all the fish in the ocean look alike. I understand that the book is supposed to be about sharing, but giving away everything you have isn't sharing, it's buying friends. That's something many young children are already prone to do, and it's not something any caring parent or teacher would want to encourage.The book's success also bothers me because it is a blatant rip-off of a much better book - Leo Lionni's classic Tico and the Golden Wings. In Lionni's book, a bird gives away the golden feathers of its wings. But the tone of the book is very different. Lionni's bird is born without wings, unable to fly. He wishes for wings, and is granted golden ones. As he flies around the world, he sees people living lives of great hardship and he gives each person one of his golden feathers in order to help them. Each time he gives away a golden feather, a real one grows in its place. In the end, his bird friends see him with his black wings and tell him that now he's just like them. But Tico realizes that although he looks like them, he is different inside.Unlike The Rainbow Fish, Tico and the Golden Wings teaches children to be generous AND to be themselves. It doesn't make it seem like it's impossible to be a unique individual and still get along with others."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"This book has won several awards and is beautifully illustrated, thus I made the mistake of purchasing it for my daughter without reading it all the way through. Don't make the same mistake.This is the story of a beautiful fish who is hated and ostrasized by all the other fish in the sea because they envy his beautiful silver scales. I assumed that the moral of the story would have something to do with everyone being beautiful in his or her own way, and that eventually the other fish would come to recognize their own beauty. Unfortunately not. Instead, the Rainbow Fish is harangued and harrassed by his fellow fish until he has given away all but one of his silver scales. In the end he is very happy because he has become popular.The morals of this story are pretty shocking: 1.) It suggests that children should give in to peer pressure. 2.) It teaches children that friendship can be bought. 3.) It says that it is not only right, but a moral imperative, to sacrifice the very essence of yourself for the sake of popularity. 4.) It suggests that popularity is the ultimate good, and that one cannot be happy without it. 5.) It teaches that envy will be rewarded. 6.) It teaches children that it's okay to ostrasize people who are different. 7.) It teaches that rude behavior is acceptable if it gets you want you want. 8.) It suggests (to younger readers in particular, who may not be capable of grasping metaphor) that only outer beauty matters. 9.) It teaches that happiness can be achieved by tearing down or destroying what belongs to others. 10.) It preaches a kind of social Marxism: that there is no value in the uniqueness of an individual, that his worth and his happiness depend on his desire to conform to the values and demands of his peer group.Frankly, I am astounded that anyone saw fit to confer any honors upon this book."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"I had heard alot about the famous rainbow fish books and when I saw the 10th anniversary book out, I decided to buy it for my 2 year old.

Sharing is one thing, but when you have to give away the one thing that makes you unique in order to cultivate friends suggests that the only way friendship can be had is through purchase. The little fish asks a second time for a scale, even though he was refused the first time after which he alienated all the other fish from rainbow fish.

This simple premise is ripe for many wonderful stories and valuable lessons (e.g., individuality, acceptance of others who are different, sharing, etc).Unfortunately, this book not only fails to produce such a story or lesson, but rather teaches us several undesirable lessons. And make no mistake -- this book is not about sharing.First, we are taught that we should simply ask others, who have more than we do, to give us something for nothing. And not just ask for \\"something\\" but ask for the very thing that makes the other person feel special about themselves and that which they value most in the world. Apparently, we have a right to what others have.Second, we are taught that if someone asks you to give him something free of charge, we shouldn't ask why but rather should just give it away -- even if it is the very thing we prize most in this world.Third, we should be appalled if someone scoffs at or refuses such a request to give us something free for no apparent reason. And we also learn that it is appropriate to ostracize such an individual. Indeed, we are taught that ostracism based on envy is perfectly appropriate.Fourth, we should understand that others, who don't have what we have, will ostracize us. If we want their friendship, we should give them what we have -- even if it requires that we give away our most prized possession in the world. Only then can we have friends.Fifth, we learn that we can indeed befriend someone if they give us what we want and ask for. Indeed, buying friends is perfectly appropriate.Finally, we learn that being unique is wrong.

I really loved (and still do) fish. Plus this book has some beautiful pictures. The only thing I didn't like was the ending. It always made me really sad. Now I know why it made me sad... IT'S COMMUNIST PROPAGANDA! The fish starts out all shiny and pretty, it's way better than the other fish, but the greedy other fish don't want to be friends with it. Instead of being happy with what they have, they want to be beautiful like the rainbow fish. They want to have shiny scales too. So the rainbow fish redistributes his scales to all the other fish until each of the fish only has one shiny scale and nobody is very pretty. He gives up his individuality for the good of the collective. This book has evil communist morals! The author equates individualism with possessive selfishness and promotes collectivism as the correct morality. He depicts the fish's scales as possessions that other fish are entitled to (ie...redistribution of wealth). I can't believe my parents read this book to me.... It does have pretty pictures though."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"I am training to be a elementary school teacher. When my professor recommended and read this book to us, everybody thought it was great, including me.However, now that I am writing a lesson plan using this book, and writing my assignment based on this lesson, I have my doubts.Rainbow Fish (RF) starts out OK, the problem begin when a fish with no shinning scale asked RF to give him one shinning scale because the scales are wonderful and he had so many. Now, is that what we want to teach our children - go out there and ask for something that you do not have?Next, the fish who was rejected started telling all his friends what happened and naturally RF is left with no friends. Isn't this horrible? I don't think RF did anything wrong, the shinning scales are his and RF has every right to refuse to give them away. Are we telling our children not to be friends with people who are rich because they refuse to give us their money when they have so much?RF then goes on a journey to discover the \`truth'. \`wise' creatures of the ocean advice him to share his shinning scales - give one to every fish. The outcome is, RF would have little scales left but much happier.Of course, RF takes the advice and started doing charity - giving away all his scales and left one for himself and he becomes friends with all the recipientsAre we telling our children that we can only be friends with people who gives us things? Or that if we want friends, we need to share the most precious items with them. Never mind that all the recipients only want the shinning scales because they look beautiful.I can only agree to helping or sharing with people who need help but in this case, all the other fish do not need shinning scales. It is as though we are telling out children that if we don't have better things in life - go out there and ask for it.Now, I don't feel comfortable reading this book to my class."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"Synopsis: The Rainbow Fish has lots of shiny scales. All the other fish won't play with the rainbow fish. Then the wise octopus says give away your scales. As soon as the rainbow fish gives away his scales, the other fish play with him. The end.Analysis:1. I do understand that this is *supposed* to be about sharing, but I think that pulling parts of yourself off and giving them away is not a good idea2. It seems rather socialist to me--everyone simply must have a shiny scale whether or not they have the capacity to grow their own shiny scales or not.3. Why should anyone have to pay people to be their friend???I don't think I like this book at all. The lessons it seems to be teaching are questionable to me."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"This book is pure socialist rhetoric. It would teach children that there is something wrong with being prettier or having more. It suggests that someone could not be accepted or valued because they have more and should simply give away what they have to get friends. There is no exchange in this book at all...the little fish simply complain and the \\"government\\" tells the rainbow fish to give his shiny scales away so that he'll be liked. It's a horrible lesson to teach children. Not only does it teach them to just give their stuff away to earn friends, but it also suggests they should not like those who have more, are prettier or work harder and should expect a handout without any effort or exchange."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"I was looking for a cute fish book for a little girl to remember her trip to the aquarium. I picked this up and read it in the bookstore. I was shocked at this book, why is explained below, and I strongly suggest that you carefully consider the book's message. Please keep in mind that I did not come into this book with any preconceived ideas and I did not read a single review prior to reading the book. But after one reading, I realized this is not a book about sharing but about discrimination, conformity, bullying, self-mutilation, etc. I am sure the author did not intend this, but let me explain to you why this is the message of the book.Summary of the book:The rainbow fish was born with a natural gift of beautiful sparkly scales (note its a genetic trait the same as blue eyes or blond hair). Because of how beautiful she was, the other fish discriminated against and mocked her (note they were not punished for that bullying). The rainbow fish therefore could not make friends and was terribly lonely. So the only way to make friends was to rip off all but one of her beautiful scales and give them away to those who had persecuted her (self-mutilation). Only when she bribed others by giving them things, could she have friends and be happy with herself. Seriously that is the story in this book but written in more colorful words with pretty pictures.So what this book actually teaches are the following:1. You should be ashamed of your natural beauty, talents, giftings, etc. and others have the right to hate you and discriminate against you for them.2. In order to make friends you have to destroy yourself or bribe them because having friends and not being lonely are the only things that can possibly make you happy in life.3. No one can get along unless everyone is exactly the same and has exactly the same things.All of this is totally the opposite message we should be giving to our children! Diversity in talents, skin color, hair types, abilities, giftings, etc. is what makes our society INTERESTING and children should never mock others because of those differences and no child should feel ashamed for being smart or beautiful or athletic. They should use those talents to serve others and work together as a team.Therefore find another book to read to your kid that actually deals with sharing."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"We bought this little book a while ago, and my kids like it because it's shiny. They are in no danger of sharing so radically as to promote communism. They are in no danger of sharing at all unless they absolutely have to. They see the pretty fish, they see him give some of his beauty to his friends, they run their fingers along the shiny scales. They ask to read it again. They're no less perceptive than any other children, but for some reason communism just doesn't occur to them while reading board books."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"This is a book that hides a hideous message under its brilliant illustrations. No one will disagree that Pfister can draw up a storm, though I wonder about his sly pen name, derived from the Latin root for fish.But the book celebrates ostracism that drives a fish with colorful scales to tear off his scales and give them one apiece to the ostracizing herd---so that aesthetically he is dragged down to their level and so that the masses gain only a marginal improvement by completely destroying the appearance of the standout.Sounds wonderful to me!"},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"This book is simply terrible. It claims to be about sharing, but the real message is that you can buy friends if you give them gifts. It also teaches children that fish can remove their scales and attach them to other fish. While adults know this is rediculous, children think they have just learned something new. I would be thoroughly embarrassed if I were the author of the book to have my name on it. Seriously."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"I have a one year old and this book is too long with their short attention span, but she likes to play with it."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"This book is beautiful to look at and the story is sweet.

The pictures captivate the attention and imagination of even very small children. The story is both thought provoking and sensitive. We discovered that by reading about the problems of a selfish little fish, we were able to limit bouts of selfishness around our home by using the comparison. This tenderly written, almost magical story allows the readers and listeners to see both sides of the problem and feel both sympathy and empathy. the illustrations are so beautiful with soothing colour blends and textures that is as worthwhile to read as it is to just look at"},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"I am one of the countless many that think this book is for the trash-bin.

If you believe your child should lower his standards or be embarrassed for possessing something others don't have then definitely buy this book.

She's 2 1/2 but has strong verbal skills. Books targeted for her age are often too babyish, and those for the 4-8 range often deal with subjects beyond her ken. The language in Pfister's books engages her perfectly. The stories are just complex enough to challenge her, simple enough to keep her connected.I read with interest the debate about Rainbow Fish's moral value. I share a certain amount of &quot;the shivers&quot; about the fish denuding himself for popularity. But at an age when such abstract conflicts are way beyond her, and every play date begins with a &quot;mine&quot; fest of collossal proportions, I appreciate an example that sharing enhances friendship. (But hey, I don't think socialism is so bad, either!)I'll also point out that Pfister's other books, like &quot;Rainbow Fish To The Rescue&quot; offer the same luscious illustrative quality with a less questionable message.I agree with the reader from Boston who points out that the book's message can be a good jumping off point for dialogue about issues of sharing, conformity, friendship."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"I agree that some reviewers are reading way too much into the story. The storyline is simple - a fish that has a lot of beautiful things (scales) snubs the other fish, so they don't want to play with him. (Who would?) Then when he decides to be nice and share his shining scales, he feels good about sharing and all the fish enjoy playing nicely together. When you discuss the story with your child, you can make that a simple good message - it's nice to share and when you do others will want to play with you. Or you can read way into it and make it more complex and evil than it needs to be for a sweet children's story. It's up to the parents to emphasize the appropriate moral. If you want to teach your child that it's nice to share, then definitely buy this beautiful book."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"This is a great story but I really expected the book to be a little bigger. I thought I was buying the hardcover but I ended up with a very small board book."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"I think this book only deserved 4 stars because it showes kids how to share but it does it in a serious way and most kids dont enjoy serious stuff that much.

I will NOT allow my children to read this trash. Each and every person and animal on this planet is different, and for someone to actually waste the paper to publish a book like this absolutely disgusts me. Differences should be accepted or even celebrated. This book teaches the very opposite.What a waste."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"I think this book has become the victim of some advocacy group's \\"write in\\" campaign. Too many people saying the same (highly innacurate) things. This is a simple story that can be twisted or embellished in a number of ways. I don't know about you, but when I read to my children (or a group of children I work with) I discuss the story with them and the meanings in the book. This book is only anti-anyting if you make it so.When I read it, this book is about learning how to be friendly and how to be kind. No, Rainbow Fish does not have to give away his \\"specialness\\" -- is he only special because he has a lot of sparkly scales? Isn't he special (like everyone) for what is inside? It definitely isn't a communist manifesto as some people have implied. I emphasize that Rainbow Fish is happy himself when he helps others around him be happy too. Helping other's be happy does not necessitate subjugating yourself. Wouldn't it be nice in this culture if a few more people with an embarrassment of riches enjoyed helping those around them?It's just a simple kid's book people."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"Whenever I choose a book for a child I buy the \\"The Rainbow fish\\" as it tells a inspiring story children can learn from and is beautifully illustrated.

Vandenburgh and similar reviewers - this is a story for children. A very good lesson on sharing and being kind to others. The preschool set is not looking at the broader political agenda. They see a fish sharing what he has, instead of hoarding it. There is something to be said for finding happiness in sharing what you have. I think it's a great message."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"Well this book inspires creative art activities and our kids love the illustrations. It leads to good discussion about friendship and bravery. It seems like it is more for adults than kids. Other than the art that they don't like the book. It is long and really not a good book for our boys. There isn't enough action. I believe that when boys are old enough to really pay attention they are no longer interested in this sort of story. Now if it were about trucks they pay could listen for around an hour. I notice more girls than boys like this book. If we had a daughter I would rank this book higher for sure."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"The Rainbow Fish is the story of a beautiful fish who was covered with glittery silver scales. The Rainbow fish would never play with the other fish because he thought he was too good for them. One day when a small fish asks for one of the scales, the Rainbow fish yells at him, saying, &quot;Who do you think you are?&quot; The little fish ends up telling the other fish how mean the Rainbow fish was, and from then on,the other fish ignore the Rainbow fish. This bothers him, and he asks a wise octopus why no one likes him when he is so beautiful. The octopus tells him to give a shimmery scale to each of the other fish. It is hard for the Rainbow fish to part with his scales, but he does, and seeing how happy the other fish are, he feels good inside. The story ends with the fish all playing together! This is a wonderful story, and the book contains silver foil on each page to make the scales stand out! Follow-up:This book can also be used in a unit about colors. Children can paint their own rainbow fish afterlearning about the primary colors and color mixing. I have children mix each of the primary colors on paper using watercolors. For example, I tell them to put blue on their paper. Then they put yellow on top of it. They are amazed when they see green. After an activity like this, they could paint their own fish by mixing the primary colors."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"Won't you take off those protective scales that grow on you so that I might look good wearing them. NO? Then not only will I not talk to you any more, but I will go and tell everyone else that they should not have anything to do with you either. If you want to be my friend, you'll have to give up whatever you like about yourself, give in to my demands, and follow me.Of course sharing is good and right, but sharing is not in response to demands that say \\"Give me what I want or I'll make your life miserable.\\" The positive feeling that comes from giving should be about doing what is right, not about buying friends or paying off enemies."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"I was looking for a cute fish book for a little girl to remember her trip to the aquarium.

Even though this was about 15 years ago, I distinctly remember feeling confused at the end. The scales were sparkly and oh-so-pretty, but the fish gave them up? That was crazy! But of course I did not say anything, because I knew that the teacher was trying to teach us to share. So even though I knew that it was nice of the fish to give his scales up, I didn't think I'd do the same. Such is the selfishness of humanity, especially in a 6-year-old. I think the part where my teacher went wrong is that we didn't really discuss what the book meant. Sure, sharing is good, but it should be stressed that in the beginning, the fish was selfish and materialistic -- and alone. (And no one is really happy when they are those things.) When it was read to me, I felt bad for the fish because it seemed like he gave up his happiness just to make everyone else happy. I didn't realize that the fish truly could be happy without any of those pretty scales. Those other fish didn't look like -that- much fun to play with. I thought he must be delusional or just pretending. So I got a lesson in sacrifice, while it could have been a lesson about finding your own happiness through selflessness. (This is much deeper than Chicka Chicka Boom Boom, huh?)At the time, I wasn't too disturbed by the fish's odd actions. I shrugged it off as another sharing speech and paid most attention to the pretty, sparkly scales. They were fun to look at. (Ironically, if the scales were less pretty, it might have made the fish's happiness more believable.)I'm still very much a capitalist. I wasn't scarred for life. The true lesson simply didn't stick with me because it's something that needs more explaining than the book alone provides. I think this book has good potential. It has to if I remember it after all this time. You just can't expect the book to explain the moral clearly, because it won't. That's your job. And I'm just going to throw this out there: Even if this book seems to have a socialist-like message, I don't see why that's so detrimental when kids in the U.S. are constantly bombarded with the opposite. Doing something for the good of the group instead of yourself is something that we all should consider from time to time, even if your kids think the idea is \\"crazy\\" like I did."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"I just got this book from the library. It has awards on the cover, so apparently someone liked it. Then, I read it and really disliked it. My curiosity led me to check the Amazon.com ratings because I wondered if I was missing something. To me the message is striking: you have to give away your possessions to make friends. Really, I am not trying to overanalyze -- it really stands out at me. The fish in the book just go up to Rainbow Fish and ask for his nice scales, and only when he gives them all away do the other fish like him. It was almost downright depressing! Granted, he was a little rude to the initial fish at first, but the fish DID just come up and ask for a scale. My preschooler is struggling to learn how to say no when other kids just come up and demand what he is playing with. He's also learning about friendship. I am trying to teach him how to be polite but assertive. You don't have to be exactly alike to be friends. Imagine when people only like you for your things. You have to give away not just one nice thing, but almost every single one, to be accepted? By the end of the book Rainbow Fish has given away every single scale but one. It's almost pathetic that he feels he has to do that to make friends. Ack! I guess I \\"get\\" the intended message of the book, that beauty isn't the most important quality, etc. etc., but that message seems to get mangled here. Back to the library tomorrow!"},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"The author depicts the beautiful Rainbow Fish as constantly and impolitely snubbing the other fish until they no longer want to play with him. Thus, he shares his scales with all the other fish so that he's no longer special and they all look alike. What?! This is not good.The message should have been that however you look, you should be humble and kind to others, not that you should rid yourself of (or share) all that makes you special and unique. Rainbow Fish should have kept his gorgeous scales and learned some manners. This is a bizarre and disturbing book whose popularity baffles me."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"I was relieved to see so many other bad reviews of this book, because I had thought I was crazy. I knew this was a very popular book (posters, puppets, etc.) so I bought it and was shocked at how bad the story was.

Thanks to a wise octopus, he discovers the only way to win friends and be the \\"happiest fish in the sea\\" is to give away his scales. I'm a teacher and a parent, and this is just a really bad lesson to be giving to a child, especially one under three years old who has little experience interacting with other people and forms ideas and expectations about the world based on books, tv, familial messages, etc. It is just beyond bad if your child is already sensitive and non-aggressive.I changed the words to this book, but my daughter is almost three now and can pick out certain words (that she knows I'm not reading!) and asked me to read the \\"real\\" story. I explained that I wasn't crazy about the story, and promptly disposed of the book. I did not even consider donating it to the library or selling it to a used bookstore, because I don't want to be part of perpetuating this story! It is that bad.Please do your children and society a favor and skip this book. Unless \\"give other kids all of your special, favorite things or else they'll all hate you and you'll be lonely and sad forever\\" is a moral lesson you want to teach your children, you'd be better off choosing one of the gazillion excellent children's books out there. Try anything by Richard Scarry, Byron Barton, Sandra Boynton, Eric Hill, Eric Carle, Dr. Seuss, etc. etc. etc................"},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"The only reason you would get this book is for the glittery effects of the fish scales. The message of the book is bad for young children. The message is you have to give away stuff to get friends. Stuff in this case means the beautiful rainbow fish has to give away his scales that made him beautiful and different in the first place. It is not about being nice to other people, sharing and caring, it is about giving away things that you have to make friends. There is a definite socialist message here and I certainly don't want my child getting brainwashed into this type of doctrine. Who knows they will be giving all their lunch away at school to make friends, giving their clothes away, their possessions everything they have. In fact rainbow fish is only left with one glittery scale and a whole pack of \\"user\\" friends\\". Frankly I think we could all do without friends who only like us because we gave them something material. For those who said you can explain the message to the child and offer a different view point forget it, they're dreaming. Let your child read this book when they are 16 and are adult enough to form an opinion. I like the pictures, I hate the message."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"This book must be properly framed for a child, otherwise they will take away the lesson that fitting in is much more important than finding out what it is that makes us all different and unique. The book reads just fine up until the rainbow fish is told (mandated, nearly) to share with everyone the very thing that makes it unique - hence, to dillute itself and bend to the whims of others.I would have preferred to see the authors take a harder line against this, but I suppose that it's fitting in this day and age to teach our children that fitting in is #1, and realizing what makes you different, or special, or unique, is secondary and expendible.A real shame."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"I saw this book listed at bargain book price and jumped at the chance to buy it for my son. I remember the librarian reading this story to me in elementary school and absolutely falling in love with the story and beautiful illustrations.

It's a childrens' book that highlights sharing, modesty, and humility, all values that I DO wish to instill in my household.As an elementary school teacher reading these reviews, I've found it's no wonder we have a problem with children having a \\"me first\\" attitude in school.

Still, I thought I'd throw in my shimmering scale too! And for those who think the book is some sort of insidious left-wing plot -- sorry, I'm as progressive as they come, and I hate the lousy thing too.The book's \\"Give up what makes you special and bribe your way to friendship\\" message has been adequately dissed in other reviews, but even leaving that aside, this just isn't a very good book. The text is insipid and the illustrations (once you look past the very lovely hologram foil effects) are weakly executed.

Then why would you applaud a fish giving away its scales?

For the life of me, I cannot understand how people can write about communism and politics in reference to this book. It is utterly ridiculous. My daughter is 4 and she loves this book. She talks about how it makes the rainbow fish feel nice to be able to share with his friends. What more could I ask for out of a book? I almost didn't buy this book b/c of the reviews, and it was my daughter who asked me to get it. She had read it in her preschool class.

The ending -- in which the Rainbow Fish, having given away all but one of his scales, ends up the happiest fish in the sea for having as many &quot;friends&quot; (who are only friends because he paid them) as the other fish -- is horrible, suggesting to children that happiness comes through buying &quot;friends,&quot; conformity and monotony. The inevitable subsequent plight of the former Rainbow Fish when his &quot;friends&quot; realize he no longer has anything to give them is left untold and unrealized. The message this book sends to children is a life-destroying evil one.That having been said, the pictures are really good, and maybe the message of the book will be ignored for the pictures, which is what gives it 2 stars rather than 1."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"I thought the art had a certain charm, and used strictly as a picture book for children who can't yet read, I think it's quite nice. (Too bad you can't make up your own story to go with it.) The moment the child starts to read, though--better hide it quick, because...Unfortunately, the book reads like a condensed Communist Manifesto for kids (as others have noted), or a Socialist agenda primer. I don't know for sure that's what Marcus Pfister had as an aim, and I'm not going to speculate on his politics. He has three kids and may raise them as he likes, and indulge in any such philosophical musings as float his boat.Yes, I suppose sharing is nice. Certainly sharing one's talents and abilities for the betterment of others is a great thing--but in America, we get paid for that (charity is voluntary, not coerced). Furthermore, stripping yourself of what makes you unique and interesting (not necessarily BETTER, just unique and interesting), or giving away all your possessions, is a lousy way to make and keep friends, isn't it? Is this book implying that somehow friendship can only be obtained by placating envy (a negative personal quality that should be dealt with by self-examination and intent to change, not pandering)? Is it saying that being interesting and having unique qualities is bad?Almost seems like it, at least to me. Furthermore, there's an overtone of \\"only by belonging to a group can you have self-worth,\\" which is as hoary a case of balderdash as ever I've seen. Of course, people who agree with that egregious sentiment will disagree with me, but that won't make them right.(The two stars, if you must know, are for the art.)"},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"This is the original Rainbow Fish story which is a simple moral tale designed for very young children. The Rainbow Fish is beautiful, but arrogant and selfish. He has to learn that superficial qualities such as beauty and wealth cannot be valued over friendship and happiness.It is at best an oversimplification to say this is a book about sharing, and I cannot agree at all with the reviewers who claim it is about being forced to give up one's unique identity in order to fit in with the crowd. To me that is yet another case of people impressing adult attitudes and ideals on to a children's book and I'm sad to see so many people seem to have missed the point, which is not that the Rainbow Fish gives away his shining scales, but that he learns humility. This is a charming and classic children's book from my home continent and I'm proud to have it on my daughter's bookshelf."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"This book was given as a gift to my infant daughter, who loves the illustrations. Once she is able to read, however, I think I'll put this book where she can't find it. This book claims to be about sharing, but it is really about buying friends - friends that feel entitled to have what is yours. The Rainbow Fish in the story is vain because of his beautiful scales. The other fish don't like him because he won't give them his scales. The way the Rainbow Fish makes friends is to give his scales away - there is never any mention of &quot;sharing.&quot; I think this book sends an awful message about entitlement and jealousy, and the only thing that makes this book worth a look is for the illustrations."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"So, I'm browsing for childrens books...and I see this one and remember it from when I was a kid. So I come to check it out...and what do I find...a bunch of nonsense about the underlying message in the book and how terrible it is. Another reviewer said it perfectly \\"four year olds don't think like you\\". Do you know what I remember about this book? HOW MUCH I LOVED THE GLITTERY SCALES. I was not scarred into becoming a socialist or ripping off my flesh to make my friends like me. Cheese and crackers people!"},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"A child will only interpret this book the way their parents do. If you want to see it as a negative book about giving into peer pressure and \\"buying\\" your friends, then obviously you will unintentionally teach your kids to look for these symbols & meanings in books as well.If you want to see Rainbow Fish as a selfish fish who ultimately learns that selfishness and arrogance leads to loneliness and that sharing is nice and makes everyone happy, then your kids will see that instead.Are parents not reading this book WITH their kids? When I read books I explain to children what is going on and answer their questions about friends, pride, and sharing. I have never once had a child ask me about communism or why RF's arrogance is not acceptable to everyone else.What I find awesome and amazing is that all of the negative comments about the book are written by people who CLEARLY didn't get the most obvious moral of the book: There is nothing wrong with being different but you don't have to be a dick about it."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"Although the book is quite attractive and catches the attention of younger readers, the subtext is somewhat concerning. The moral of the story could well be interpreted as encouraging children to share their toys with others or to put their talents towards service to the community, and as a parent I would be loathe to put that sort of moral pressure on them before they are old enough to make up their own mind about such matters. Otherwise, I and my wife fear, they might grow up to be the sort of person who donates money to victims of earthquakes or typhoons, or who asks what they can do for their country rather than what their country can do for them.The otherwise innocent story book also implicitly condones moral coercion by putting social pressure on individuals to comply with the social expectations of others, whereas we believe that the only legitimate incentives for encouraging proper behaviour are economic and legal. For example, we never put any emotional pressure on our children to discourage them from telling lies, or using bad language. Both their mother and I have made it a policy to give them chocolates or money to tell the truth and not to swear, that is, providing them with a carrot rather than a stick to encourage desirable behaviour. We recognising their fundamental right to choose to behave any way that they like as long as it isn't illegal (like jaywalking or stealing). We also both find it quite frustrating when other parents encourage their children to shun ours simply because our children have learnt to be assertive and are able to get their own way most of the time, and this book legitimises that kind of social coercion.There is also a strong undercurrent of promoting social conformity, which we also find quite disturbing. For example, our neighbours are stuck on enforcing some artificial notions of \\"decency\\" on us even when its hot, whereas we just take off our clothes rather than conforming to their behaviour. If we were to encourage our children to conform to social expectations in this way we are fairly sure they would end up feeling obliged to appear \\"professional\\" as adults in any employment environment rather than feeling comfortable with the idea of being able to express their individuality by how they dress.In sum, this book, despite being beautiful looking and being very easy to read, encourages self-sacrifice, unassertiveness and discourages individual self-reliance, teaching children that they should conform to the expectations of others rather than making their own decisions, and to appear like everyone else rather than standing out. In my grandparents Chinese culture they have a saying \\"The nail that sticks up must be hammered down\\" - and this is the dangerous social message that this book encourages."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"The story in this book plods along. Even for little kids, it's very &quot;preachy.&quot; My children enjoyed the shiny fish scales much more than the story. This book was a disappointment. It just goes to show, don't judge a book by its cover."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"If you're a parent who would like to teach your child the values of socialism then this is the book for you. The story suggest to the reader happiness cannot be had by those who have more than others.When the rainbow fish asked the octopus (the 8 greedy arms of big government) for advice he told the rainbow fish to give his scales away to the other fish. If you have doubts as to whether of not children books can be used as propaganda watch the movie Closet Land. Though the sympathy is meant for the heroine, there is a good argument made against her."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"This book IS NOT about buying friends, it is about making them. In the beginning, Rainbow Fish would not talk to anyone in order to protect his fins, but by the end of the story he sees that it is much more fun and rewarding to have friends than to have beautiful fins. This book teaches children that friends are more important that riches, and that sharing makes you feel good. I think that it is an important lesson."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"Some of the other reviewers are reading far too much into this book. It's important to remember that the target audience is toddlers and preschoolers and although they are certainly brighter than we think they, they also tend to take things pretty literally. They are not students of political science nor are they art critics (to those who complain the paintings aren't very good). Instead, they see a story about an unhappy fish who doesn't know how to share, but learns to be happy by giving up things he doesn't need. My only complaint about the book is that the language is far too flowery and sophisticated for the target audience.I wonder what kind of book those complaining about the so-called socialist leanings in this story. Perhaps they would be happier if the Rainbow Fish became rich by selling off his silver scales instead?"},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"This is a beautifully illustrated book which, on the surface, is a lesson about sharing. When you think about it a little more carefully there's another lesson: Conformity is more important than Independence. By the hero's sacrifice of the essence of what makes him special, we are also taught that mediocrity is to be valued above excellence. I think that it is neither wise nor desirable to teach our children to lower their expectations and do anything necessary to fit in with the crowd."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"I love the watercolors and the artwork created in this book; the shimmery scales surely catch the eyes of the children. This book is a story about a beautiful fish who has many glittery silver scales combined with her other scales. One day when a small fish asks for one of the tinniest scales, Rainbow Fish angrily replies, &quot;Who do you think you are?&quot; The little fish swims back to the others and tells them how Rainbow Fish had treated him. The other fish decide to ignore Rainbow Fish. Rainbow Fish becomes very lonely. Rainbow Fish then goes to the very wise octopus and asks him why no one likes him when he is so beautiful. The octopus tells him to give each little fish a shimmery scale. Can Rainbow Fish part with his beautiful scales? Will the other fish forgive Rainbow Fish for acting so selfish? This is a beautiful story to teach children about the importance of friendships and sharing! This is an excellent book to begin the school year reading to your students!"},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"The book The Rainbow Fish is a great book to own. This book is about a very colorful fish that had shiny scales. All of the other fish wanted one of the Rainbow Fish' scales, so they said that they would be the Rainbow Fish' friend if he were to give them a scale. Since the Rainbow fish had no friends he gave all of his scales away except for one. Then he looked like everyone else and he was very happy."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"Someone just gave this book to my 19-month-old. Art-wise, it's a beautiful book. But I was just appalled by the ending. Sharing is great - but the rainbow fish should have given a FEW scales away, not all (except one). I will not read this book to my daughter."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"I was appalled the first time I read this book. It was given to us for my daughter - I would never have purchased this for her.This book can be interpreted in three ways:1. Rainbow Fish will only be accepted by the other fish if he gives away his many shiny scales so that each fish possesses the same number of shiny scales - thus it is socialism.2. Rainbow Fish will only be accepted by the other fish when he is the same as all of the others by not being unique (especially uniquely beautiful). Rainbow Fish can not be more than the other fish in any way. This perfectly describes the philosophy of our modern educational system - everyone must be dumbed down to the same point - no one can be smarter than the others.3. Rainbow Fish suffers from the Ugly Fish Union. They will unionize to make sure they get what they want from Rainbow Fish. My apology to union employees - I'm a union member myself, but do not like the way unions are abused. Perhaps I should have likened the story to mob racketeering.The book claims to be about sharing, but is far too off base in its presumption. Sharing is what you do with things you possess. Rainbow Fish gives away his shiny scales - he gives away what makes him Rainbow Fish - this is not sharing, but rather is self-destruction.The key to any of these interpretations is that Rainbow Fish is not loved for being Rainbow Fish and the only solution is to minimize his uniqueness in order to be loved. This solution is far too simplistic (its totally wrong) to work in real life.This is not a message that I will teach my daughter. I want her to be secure and confident in her uniquenesses. I hope she will never feel that she needs to become someone other than she is to be loved and accepted by those around her."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"The illustrations are beautiful.The moral messages are not beautiful: change who you are so others accept you. Give what you have to others who don't have what you have so they will like you.This sounds like the author is a socialist. Coming from Switzerland, it's a real possibility."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"My daughter has always loved this book, and it's beautiful illustrations are no doubt why. The moral of the story is that if you are greedy and selfish you will also be lonely (not unlike the message Scrooge learned one christmas eve). The author took it a bit too far, in my opinion, when all of the fish see Rainbow fish sharing with the little blue fish, and every fish swims over and demands a shiny scale. The Rainbow Fish gives away every scale but one, and is surrounded by fish that didn't want to play with him before he gave them a scale.When I read this with my daughter, I always point out that the other fish are being greedy, too, and that it's not nice to play with someone only because they give you something. Rainbow fish should stand up for himself, he can share with his friends, but still keep some of his treasure, too. Talking about it doesn't change the ending, but I hope it gives my daughter something to think about. I have always wondered if something was lost in translation, or if it's my American point of view that changes the meaning of the story for me."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"My cousins, who live in a socialist European country, recently visited us in the U.S., and gave this book to my children as a gift. I love my cousins but think this is a horrible book. The message is clear: if you are better than anyone else, or rise above your peers in any way, no one will like you, and you will be lonely and miserable, as well as the target of envy and sometimes hatred. However, if you bring yourself down to their level, or pay them off, you will be most popular! The book reflects the mentality of the socialist, and demonstrates altruism at its worst. Everyone must be the same, and no one can excel at anything or in any way. The rainbow fish teaches children that it is good to strip yourself raw for the benefit of others, who were never your true friends to begin with, but only wanted something from you and based their acceptance of you on what you could provide for them. You know, kind of like that bad friend in school who loves you when you're down and out, but can't stand it when you lose weight and are looking good or happy or successful. Once the rainbow fish has taken off and given away all its beautiful scales, it is no longer the prettiest fish. The other fish, who each got a scale, are not elevated, but rather, they're all dragged down to the lowest common denominator. One scale each. Not enough to make anyone prettier than anyone else -- no one can really shine. It's not about sharing and love, but more like emotional bribery. I give this book one star, only because I have to, and the illustrations are pretty. Steer clear."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"Pros: colorful, easy read for beginning readersCons: gives the reader the belief that you must give away what makes you special in order to make friends.I personally don't want those friends, nor do I want my children to have them."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"Octopus essentially says \\"go buy your friends\\" by giving them your material possessions. Not by improving your manners or becoming more amiable, but by giving away who you are and bringing yourself down to the level of underachievers.Notice how in the end all was well because everyone was \\"equal\\" (equally ugly and poorly suited to their environment). Rainbow fish was the tall poppy so of course he is portrayed with a bad attitude (the evil rich) and of course he had to to be cut down by the octopus (a symbol for big government with all its tentacles). If this was about slamming materialism/narcicism, why not just throw his scales away. Why should he give them to others - wouldn't that mean the materialism is ok as a long as it is uniformly distributed. This is INSANE!!!!!If you have things others don't have, you can only be happy by giving them away. This is a book only Castro and soccer moms could love. At the end there is a group hug and everyone is happy and unoffended. Make sure your children's school teachers don't read this to your kids!!! If they do, make sure you tell them how wrong the rainbow fish was to give away that which made him unique. Talk about slamming individuality in favor of conformity. I thought liberals were supposed to be non-confromists..."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"Most (I hope) would agree that sel&quot;fish&quot;ness is not to be admired. However, I cannot admire a story which teaches that the best way to &quot;lure&quot; friends is by offering them some cool stuff.If nothing else, this book confirms that it is too easy to buy friends. It does not remind the reader that no one really wants to be friends with those people in the long run.Two points for the pictures."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"I got into a debate today with my co-teacher about this book. I went online to see if anyone shared my opinion, and I'm surprised to see a lot of people do!A lot of people (my co-worker included) say this book is about sharing what you have- but I have real problems with the way that story (if that is indeed the message) is told. Rainbow fish is vain- okay. He doesn't have any friends- okay. Little fish asks for a scale- this is where the story gets interesting. I don't think the book is promoting communism (*rolls eyes*), but every character in the story is placing a LOT of value on these scales. Some reviewers claim the book is saying possessions don't matter- I disagree- they DO matter, because A) Fish keep asking for them B) Octopus says this is THE ONLY WAY the Rainbow will make friends and C) all the fish become friends with him after they get the scales. Clearly Rainbow fish has bought his friends- he doesn't do anything to show them his inner character, like kindness or courage, AND he doesn't even learn humility! A writer could end this story in so many ways- why does Rainbow fish need to give his scales away? Even if the scales stand for possessions (as some reviewers suggested), why does this book tell kids to give away their toys to make friends? I see the message as: \\"Give away the one thing that makes you special so that you can be like everyone else and they'll be your friend.\\"Thought-provoking, but I'm not reading it to my kids."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"Rainbow Fish is a great book with bright color. In the book, Rainbow Fish learns to share with others and that's very good for a young age. The author is Marcus Pfister and this book has a setting of the ocean. The book Rainbow Fish is full of color and all the drawings look like a cartoon. I would so check this book out if I were you because even if you've read this book ten times you would still want more.The pictures to me are the best part because all the pictures are filled with wonderful color. Rainbow Fish's scales are wonderful shades of green, purple, blue, red, and best of all shimmering silver scales. I would say Rainbow Fish is a good book for young kids because the pictures are wonderful colors. I would also say Rainbow Fish is a good because the book looks like a cartoon. But besides the pictures the setting and plot are fine to.Some of the characters in Rainbow Fish are Rainbow Fish and Little Blue Fish. Rainbow Fish is a fish with wonderful scales and learns a very important lesson. Little Blue Fish was a fish that probably do anything for Rainbow Fish's silver scales. Little Blue Fish was also the first fish to have one of Rainbow Fish's scales.At the end of the story Rainbow Fish shares and the other fish want him for a friend again. I hope they write a Rainbow Fish 2 because the colors. I think it would be cool to have a second Rainbow Fish. I think it would be cool because the story of Rainbow Fish. And it is very good book for young kids. That is what I like about the book Rainbow Fish.Rainbow Fish is a book I would so recommend and read. This book is good for young children because of the pictures. With the plot, pictures, and setting this book should be a little Newbery book. The book Rainbow Fish is a book that once you read it once you would want to read it again and again. And I think everyone should read it."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"Illustrations are beautiful, but the story is terrible. Give away your shiny scales or none of the other fish will like you? I'm glad I'm not the only one who thought the story was bad. The illustrations aren't worth the message it sends."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"I have always adored this book, both the beautiful colors and shimmery scales of the artwork, and the message I always took away. It is true that the message of the book depends upon the interpretation of the reader, and I always saw the scales as a metaphor for sharing in general, and for helping others, even if it means sharing the glory. Those who are selfish and want all the glory and accolades for themselves will not be as happy as if they share their \\"beauty\\" which can mean objects, but also knowledge, information or skills. I discovered this book when my children were young and it became one of my favorites and they loved it too. I ended up buying it for one of my friends at my office because I told her she was like the Rainbow Fish. She was always helpful to her co-workers, sharing her amazing talents to help everyone around her. She never needed ALL the glory, because she got accolades from being a smart and hard worker, but she also wanted everyone else around her to succeed. That's not communism or socialism, it is called being a good person who is not totally self-centered and self-absorbed, as the fish had been at the beginning of the book. It is proven in studies that one finds true happiness by helping others. And THAT is the message of this beautiful book!"},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"This is such a classic book, I am glad I was able to get it in time for this week."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"This book was one of my daughters favorites, now that she is a new mom I wanted her to be able to share it with her son!"},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"This is such a cute story!

More than a mere anthology of some of the most popular works (from spooky to silly), it includes a rundown of the features and format of several different types of poetry, along with brief bios on the poets themselves (from classic to contemporary) that will interest just about everyone. Not only that, it also includes a glossary of poetic terms and techniques, AND a box on each page with quick definitions of more difficult words or phrases (which are highlighted) at a glance, so kids (and adults!) can read and enjoy without having to flip to the back of the book constantly. Often, the poems include a short historical explanation, so when reading one can envision the verse in context. All done in a kid-friendly, fun and lighthearted way, with colorful and humorous illustrations! To top all that off, it comes with a CD so you can listen as you read; or as I do, pop it in whenever just so the kids can listen and imagine while coloring, etc. The CD is soothing and delightful at bedtime for the kids, too.I believe my daughters, ages 10 and (almost) 6, will be entertained and inspired by this book for many years to come. Hopefully, it will spark an interest in kids to seek out further works of the poets included in this amazing introduction, discover others, and perhaps even create some poetry of their own!"},{"Title":"A Child's Introduction to Poetry: Listen While You Learn About the Magic Words That Have Moved Mountains, Won Battles, and Made Us Laugh and Cry","review":"I homeschool my children (ages 7 and 9), and I wanted to add poetry to their literature curriculum. I found this book at the library, and it was a perfect introduction to the many forms of poetry, with great examples for each. The biographies of famous poets in the second half of the book were also a very useful teaching tool. They were short, informative and interesting. (I learned a few things myself...)I kept the book in the car, and my children took turns reading (aloud and to themselves). They looked forward to their poetry lessons, and even memorized a few poems on their own accord. My son read Poe's \\"The Raven,\\" and commented, \\"I don't understand it, but it's scary, somehow.\\" I found it fascinating that a poem writeen almost 200 years ago could frighten a modern-day child.This book was a wonderful tool to pique my children's interest in poetry. I plan to buy or borrow other books on poetry to cultivate their budding interest.I can't comment on the CD as it was no longer included in the library book.

I have been trying to introduce poetry to my boys since they were toddlers and the only feedback I ever received was blank stares - maybe it was my reading style. But, for some reason, they just LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this CD. We listen to it in the car and fight over which poem we listen to first. Some of our favorites are The Pied Piper, Thomas' Do Not Go Gently into that Good Night, the limericks (I was a bit worried when it started with There was an old man from Nantucket. . . . - but it is actually the children's version, obviously) and Kit Marlowe's The Passionate Shepard to His Love. My 8 year old has several of the classics almost memorized.Our only complaint is the reading of Lewis Carroll's Jabberwocky.

The book and cd waste a lot of space with some of the most commonplace forms of poetry - Mother Goose rhymes and limericks - to which many parents will have already introduced their children. The book veers from nursery rhymes to multiple poems involving death to Shakespearean sonnets. The choices of poems within each form introduced could have been improved upon - many are downright uninteresting. Finally, I reached for the CD, hoping the purchase could be saved by the careful, luscious reading of selected excellent examples on it. Alas, alack. Two \\"professional\\" actors read - neither, unfortunately, possessing either the gravitas or the tonal depth to make the poems ring.

This is a well thought out, thorough introduction to basic poetry forms, with familiar poems--a comfort to the parent who may want to read this material to the younger child. The drawings are really fun, with enough on the page for the jaded 21st century eye to look at. If that weren't enough, there's a CD of the poems, so the reader can also hear them spoken, an important element of poetry.I think the breadth of the poetry styles chosen, including the nursery rhymes and limericks, is just right, and can be expanded on by the parent or teacher by reaching beyond the book.

I found it extremely useful, especially when I could do the questions with friends. The questions are challenging and integrative (ie: cell physiology questions had cardio stuff in them) and are framed in the, \\"54 year old male complains of...\\" type of format, which is great practice.The only reason it's not a 5-star is that there are lots of mistakes in here. Mistakes ranging from things as simple as wrong answers (ie: answer is \\"e\\" but the explanation clearly says \\"a\\" is the answer) to utterly incoherent explanations. I would say this happened about once every 15 questions or so. This is also why it's great for group studying because you can go over difficult concepts and also try to catch errors.Haven't used the 12th edition but my friend had the 10th and the differences from that and the 11th were huge."},{"Title":"Physiology: PreTest Self-Assesment & Review (Pre-Test Basic Science Series)","review":"This is a great resource for Shelf Exam prep....my physio class didn't do an adequate job of preparing me for the shelf (the first one I took), but Pre-Test helped me get a very good score."},{"Title":"Physiology: PreTest Self-Assesment & Review (Pre-Test Basic Science Series)","review":"I used this book to prep for a physio miniboard exam (NBME subject exam).

FreemanThousands of years ago, a dark and twisted cult existed known as &quot;The Black Day&quot;. A sinister group whose sole purpose was to resurrect their banished lord from the abyss in order to bring about his fearsome dominion over all. A gift was bestowed upon these dreadful followers of a sentient text meant to lead them to their desired goal. Before this could be accomplished, Haziem, bent on revenge for the murder of his father, stole the text and killed the shadowed priest reading aloud from it. For this, Haziem was condemned to a life of immortality, never to die except at the hands of the Black Day. He wandered the desert for decades desperately trying to destroy the book, to no avail. Finally, he established a link of protectors for the text, to keep it from the hands of the &quot;Black Day&quot; or worse, from the twisted creation called The Dark Rider, who ceaselessly pursues and searches for this unholy object.Through the next few millennia the text is passed from one protector to the next. Destruction, pain, and terror are its legacy and all that touch it are not exempt. Futile attempts are made to destroy the Dark Rider but, like Haziem, he is immortal. His sole purpose is to obtain the stolen object. Finally it reaches the hands of its protector in the twenty-first century, Jeremy Maxwell, a spoiled wealthy young man.Jeremy has no idea that this great burden and grave duty will fall upon his unsuspecting shoulders. Soon, his own dark past reaches out to him, catapulting him into a fight for his life and that of the known world. An ally he did not know exists will assist him, but even so, it may not be enough to stop the destruction of all he holds dear.This is a sharply twisted tale of darkness, fanaticism, and hopelessness. Brian Knight weaves a compelling story, drawing you into the lives of those involved willingly or unwillingly with the Black Day cult and its lost artifact. This story is not for the faint of heart. The scenes are sharp with graphically violent descriptions. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys the horror genre, but urge younger readers to avoid this. I would read more of this author, but definitely would keep the light on at night!"},{"Title":"Accounting Information Systems","review":"Unlike many of the other AIS textbooks still being sold, this textbook was well written to begin with and was seriously edited and re-written where necessary to improve its teaching quality in this 5th Edition.The only criticism that I have of the text was the failure to clearly address the problem of how to code database entries so that a statement of cash balance could be generated using the direct method.I would recommend a different graphic artist for this next cover, but the authors are right up there with Charles Horngren in my book for writing easy to read and understand Accounting textbooks.Excellent for self-study when learning this in a classroom is not a viable option.The only worthy competitor with this textbook is &quot;Accounting Information Systems&quot; 3rd Edtion by James A.

The Toonies Invade Silicon Valley is worth 5 stars and many more.I was introduced to Betty Dravis on a fellow author's blog [...]. As it were, the timing was perfect-I was getting ready to go on a trip to Guam and was looking for a book to help pass the time on a long flight.When I received The Toonies, I realized that it would not make it past the flight to Houston due to the length, so I also purchased Betty's two other books (1106 Grand and Millenium Babe) for my trip.As hard as I tried, I could not resist reading the first few pages of The Toonies as I prepared for my trip. After those first few pages, I was hooked and no choice but to sit down and take the time to read the entire book in one sitting.Even though this book is rated as a young adult/children's book, it will also appeal to an adult as well. The characters are well developed and hold your interest from the beginning to the end. The illustrations are well done as well, kudos to Betty's granddaughter for a job well done. No matter how hard you try to put this book down, or try to limit the number of pages that you read, the book keeps pulling you back until you have come, unfortunately, to the end. The Toonies Invade Silicon Valley does what few books have been able to do recently-leave me wanting more.I urge you to purchase The Toonies and either share it with a special child in your life (in my case, it's my granddaughter) or splurge and buy it for yourself.

Hurry up Betty!"},{"Title":"The Toonies Invade Silicon Valley","review":"Do you remember when you were a very young child and heard The Brothers Grimm Fairy Tales? Well, get ready to add the \\"Toonies\\" to your list......I do not place this work in such company lightly --- Betty Dravis has written a masterful portrayal of the nature of evil in the person of \\"Dab\\" and the qualities of true heroism in young Jeremy and his friends and family..When I became older, I read the original versions of some of my favorite childhood fairy tales from The Brothers Grimm........ HOLY TOLEDO! Those who have read these tales in their original version understand why the versions presented to very young children are edited and toned down......and when this book is brought to the silver screen, it would be suitable for older chldren/teens/young adults with a PG rating as written..\\"The Toonies Invade Silicon Valley\\" is a story of good versus evil that is told at a deeper level than the cover art and synopsis on the back of the book indicates. This is a book for older children, middle school students, and high school students. The graphic and disturbing description of the nature of evil contained in this story might cause younger children to have nightmares....not a problem because very young children lack the reading comprehension that would allow them to read this book themselves, and the person reading the book aloud to them can easily skip over or modify the very few parts that young children might find disturbing. The publishers of \\"The Brothers Grimm\\" stories have proven that the same tale can be told very successfully to both younger and older children, teens, and adults depending upon the proper version of the story being presented to the reader at the appropriate age level.......Remember when you were younger and went on your first roller coaster? Some coaster designers will start the ride out tame, and then unexpectedly it starts to get more interesting.......the TOONIES reminds me of a roller coaster in this regard......after finishing the first chapter, I felt that it might be a bit on the tame and bland side......and, now that I've finished the novel, I can assure all that this is not a concern.....not in the slightest!.I very highly recommend this book --- it's clever, thoughtful, and the portrayal of evil in the intensity of its brutality and semi-veiled threat is insightful and occasionally difficult to face....this is far from a cartoonish evil, and knowing that such evil exists in our world of reality is sobering. Knowing that the forces of good are ready to confront and defeat evil is comforting, and all who read this book would welcome the opportunity to be a friend and ally to Jeremy and his family and friends!"},{"Title":"The Toonies Invade Silicon Valley","review":"This writer is such a cool lady. She has the talent to draw all age groups to her books...YES they are that good! Give this talented writer and her books a chance...I promise you that before you finish this book you too will become a BETTY DRAVIS FAN!!! Happy Reading~"},{"Title":"The Toonies Invade Silicon Valley","review":"Betty Dravis is a sensitive writer, one who has observed the idiosyncrasies of today's youth and has found a manner to bring her fine-honed journalistic writing skills to the literary table. In a book directed towards the age 8 - 13 readership, Dravis has taken all the current obsessions (computers, blogs, emails, anime, fantasy, and the preoccupation with fractured families), aligned these into a storyline that is entertaining and well designed, interspersed some drawings/illustrations by the her granddaughter Kristy Soza Ardizzone, and in the end has captured the imagination of children 'of all ages' while gently being supportive of family values.Based on the concept that computer cartoon figures created by imaginative kids, whose concerns with their home and school lives encourage them to escape into the safety of the computer, can come to life - by stepping out of the computer screen and relating to their creators as innovative folk - Dravis has created a fable of good and evil in the tradition of Aesop but very much grounded in the language and imagery of today. She has the gift to create three dimensional 'real people' while retaining the imagination of transferring personalities to 'computer generated people', a trait that makes her story fine enough for anyone to suspend belief for the duration of the book.But the tender aspect of this little foray into children's literature is Dravis ability to say a lot about our current society problems such as broken homes, parent/child engagements, that omnipresent monster of corporate greed that threatens just about every aspect of our lives, and communication in general. And while Dravis has focused on a make-believe tale, she grounds her credibility for youngsters by placing the story appropriately in Silicon Valley, the birthplace of computer obsession, with specific sited as backgrounds for her action.This is a fine tale for parents to give their youngsters: my recommendation would be to take the pleasure of reading it first before passing it on in a shared gesture of love and respect.

This Kindle version is a 485 Kb download.Jeremy is a young boy with a successful cartoon series, but when one of the characters, Doog suddenly comes off the computer screen into Jeremy's bedroom things change forever. Doog's arrival sets in motion a series of events that include a rogue group of toonies that want to leave Cartoon Land and take over the world.Dravis has a wonderful style of writing that will appeal to both young and adult readers. The action, dialogues and story line are fast paced and interesting from beginning to end. Adults should be forewarned that there are a couple scenes in this book that could be very disturbing to a younger reader.Conclusion:A fast, easy read...I really enjoyed this unique little book. As a hard core fantasy reader I was pleasantly surprised that the author saw fit to put in a few scenes that were definitively graphic (violent). Well written and destined to become a classic within its own circle. 5 StarsRay NicholsonP.S.This is the type of work that if Betty Dravis were English, I could see a knighthood in her future.

By \\"suitable\\" I mean many characteristics:1.Full of free-flowing fantasy to allow young minds to go far away into safe mind-expanding places2.Morally acceptable but not promoting a certain sect that would be questioned by the public school administration3.Free of adult sexual encounters4.Not loaded with the-ends-justifies-the-means morality5.Having a plot line that YA readers cannot resist6.Logical in sequence7.Appealing to the imagination of young readers8.Not being a waste of time9.Encouraging readers to stretch their reading skills10.Showing the development of the characters in the novel11.Nurturing the character traits of the young tender minds12.Simply entertainingThe Toonies Invade Silicon Valley by Betty Dravis qualifies.I find it so appropriate that if it had been available way back then, I would have acquired permission to teach it to all my YA classes.It would make an unforgettable class project - an interactive unit that would lead the young people to learn. The students would love making their own pictures of the Toonies to be posted in the classroom. They could also draw their own Toonies cartoons based on the text. Reading facility would result.There are some questions I would like to discuss related to the story with young people:--What are some creative ways to deal with family conflict?--How did Jeremy use his creativity to gain peace of mind while his parents argued?--How else could the book end?--Why was the ending that Ms. Dravis chose the best one?--How did the different characters solve their problems?The author demonstrates in this book her skill and ingenuity. The Toonies is an enjoyable book for YA readers and for children of all ages. Thanks, Betty, for sharing!"},{"Title":"The Toonies Invade Silicon Valley","review":"I live in Florida, and am a confessed high-tech nerd who reads everything I can about Silicon Valley. When I saw the cover of TOONIES, it blew my mind. Doog, the little Toonie boy, looks just like me ... a few years ago.I didn't know what I was buying, and when I started reading, I was blown away by this clever book. It's the first time I ever heard of cartoon characters living in a computer. The way they enter our world is interesting and the trouble they manage to get into is hilarious. I like the way the author lets the kids solve their own problems ... with little interference, other than of the helpful kind, from the adults.Dravis takes a serious subject and laughs in its face with satirical features like: \\"Orange Computer\\" ... \\"Operation Chicken Noodle Soup\\"... and wait till you see why the teen humanoid girl makes little foil shoes for the main TOONIES to wear ... and what happens to Doog when he eats people food ... I could go on and on, but will simply say: Dravis has a great knack for description.What an imagination she has ... and to use the most famous \\"geek\\" of them all, THE WOZ, as a character in this book was a stroke of genius. And the scenes where he helps the kids and their parents capture the bad TOONIES is worth the cost of the entire book. It's stupendous!I don't mean to disparage Steve Wozniak by calling him a geek, but he's a humble guy, from what I hear, and calls himself that from time to time. (After all, look what that genius did with his \\"geekship.\\" His inventions changed the world, that's for sure!!)One more geek word to describe this book: WOW!reviewer - Burpin' Burt, the Florida Flirt"},{"Title":"The Toonies Invade Silicon Valley","review":"THE TOONIES INVADE SILICON VALLEY is probably one of the most charming, surprising, vivid and vibrant books I have ever read. And that statement includes everything I read as a child, and everything I've read so far as a \\"grown-up\\" (which is more of a physical classification than a mental one for me, at this point in my life... *smile*).Betty Dravis' novel introduces readers to thirteen-year-old Jeremy Kern, who lives with his parents in Silicon Valley. As his parents' arguments get louder and more frequent, Jeremy retreats into his bedroom, working at his computer on cartoons about a boy named Doog. Creating a world and a life for Doog allows Jeremy to escape from his own troubles...but the last thing he expects is for Doog's world to merge with his own! But a chance touch in the corner of a cartoon eye, and poof! suddenly Doog is out of the computer, on Jeremy's desk, his red hair shining impossibly brightly and his eyes twinkling whimsically. Jeremy and his friends are utterly taken with Doog and, later, with Uncle Wom, the leader of Cartoon Land, who follows Doog out of the computer to retrieve him. Uncle Wom is clear to express the dangers of traveling between the worlds, warning Jeremy to be wary of prying eyes on the computer screen. Uncle Wom and Doog tell Jeremy and his friends about the Mischief-Makers and their leader, Dab, the evil ape-bird feared by everyone in Cartoon Land. Under no circumstances, Uncle Wom asserts, must Dab be released from the world behind the computer screen.Unfortunately, Jeremy's father isn't around to heed this warning. Arthur inadvertently releases Dab and his followers from the computer and immediately, Dab seeks to put his evil plan into action: to take over Orange Computer, and then take over all the computers all over the world, giving him ultimate power and control over the human race. It will take a whole team of humans and good Toonies, including the help of a \\"Wise Old Zen,\\" to defeat Dab and his followers and restore order both to Silicon Valley, and to Cartoon Land.THE TOONIES INVADE SILICON VALLEY is, at its core, a story of good vs. bad. But you've never read a more creative take on that popular theme, I guarantee it! In Betty Dravis' world, \\"good vs. bad\\" becomes Doog vs. Dab, and the warriors are cartoons. From the first page to the last, TOONIES is pure entertainment, a joy to read. The text is accompanied by beautiful illustrations, serving to bring Dravis' characters and world even more to life. The prose is lively, and the descriptions are brilliant -- bright and dazzling and evocative of something magical. Dravis brings a world of color to a page of black and white, and her warmth and genuineness shine through in her writing. Deeply interwoven in the story is a larger theme of the importance of family. In a world where moral values are often overlooked, Dravis has written a novel that supports the good things in life: family, love, courage, fellowship. TOONIES is a book for both kids and adults to read and reread with fondness. The characters, human and toonie alike, are ones you'll want to keep coming back to again and again.THE TOONIES INVADE SILICON VALLEY is a rewarding, fun, dazzling and wholesome book.

When Doog (good spelled backward), one of Jeremy's cartoon characters, jumps out of the computer, Jeremy thinks he's gone crazy. But Doog convinces Jeremy he's for real, along with other Toonies from Cartoon Land, with its yellow sky, two blue moons and bright red stars. Doog, who hopes to help Jeremy deal with his angst over his parents, is soon joined by Uncle Wom (short for wise, old man), ruler of Cartoon Land. Uncle Wom warns Jeremy about the Mischief Makers, ape-like birds controlled by an evil tyrant named Dab (bad spelled backwards), who would love nothing more than to escape Cartoon Land and take over the world. Fearful that Dab will find a way out of the computer, Uncle Wom warns Jeremy to turn his computer off when he is not using it. Before Jeremy can tell his parents about these fantastic creatures, Jeremy's father inadvertently allows Dab to escape the computer, and before long, Dab has his own battle troops gathered around and ready for action. The humanoids, as the cartoon characters call them, aided by Doog and Uncle Wom, quickly engage in a frantic race to find Dab and his mischief makers before they can wreak havoc on the world.With creative wizardry, Betty Dravis has written an excellent story here; one that will be enjoyed by children and adults alike. Packed with intriguing characters, vivid visual imagery, an exciting and suspenseful plot, morality issues relayed in a sensitive and subtle manner, and brilliant illustrations, THE TOONIES INVADE SILICON VALLEY is one book this reader thoroughly enjoyed and would love to see in libraries and homes throughout the country.

In addition to the sympathy which Jeremy effortlessly elicited, his spunk endeared him to the reader; and the author's natural ability to create a realistic portrayal of Jeremy's age-related behavior closed the deal.While the Toonies were getting OUT of Cartoon Land and into the \\"real\\" world, the reader was simultaneously getting INTO Jeremy's world a la Betty Dravis ... who happens to have (who would'a guessed) a healthy collection of kids, grandkids, and great's providing continuous, contiguous, and concurrent contributions to the spark and spirit of her writing.As appropriate and effective as Toonies is as a young adult offering, it is carefully sophisticated enough to capture the attention of seasoned readers as well.Some of my favorite parts of this sagacious yet serendipitous story include:1. --- The way Dravis made up a sort of mini set of \\"Laws of Physics\\" or game board rules for how Cartoon Land residents were limited or enhanced in our world.What I liked most about this interesting set of rules (which, not over or under done, was just right in complexity) was how Dravis worked, played, and built from them. She accomplished a masterful weaving there, with simple, yet ingenious solutions to several quirky problems.Note, for example, how the characters used tin foil to further the effects of the laws of gravity, how they used food and other basic necessities (and body parts) as weapons. The processes and solutions Dravis applied to further her precocious plot gave an already good storyline a feel of being an engrossing game-board in addition to being an entertaining fantasy.2. --- The way Dravis wove her ethical systems (\\"moral of the story\\") into her laws of physics.For example, as the opening of the story quickly exposes, sympathy unlocks the gateway between the human world and Cartoon Land (Cartoon Land exists inside the world of computers). Sympathy felt by a Toonie for a human allows the Toonie to speak to the human. A second, ingeniously related \\"procedure\\" allows a human to release a Toonie to step through the monitor, into the reality of flesh-and-blood. Of course, the ways of returning to Cartoon Land are equally intriguing and easily acceptable, with a few fun additions to the \\"ways\\" exposed at the end of the story.3. --- The way the author gradually and delicately introduced unique concepts of magic from Cartoon Land, with an ingenuity which would give the sorcery set ups in Harry Potter (love that series, too!) a run for their wands and gizmos.Be sure to catch the nuances in the story's conclusion, as Dravis pulls a few surprises out of her hat about exactly how the gizmos work, and how their necessity \\"evolves.\\"4. --- The way Dravis mentioned or brought in cultural icons from the Valley, and from the \\"times\\" in which the story took place, thereby seating the story into its societal framework of popular foods, activities, and even a BIG Icon from the valley, Apple Computer's \\"The Woz\\" (and of course Apple, in Toonies, is translated to Orange, which certainly fits the surrounding vicinities).As an example of the foods and activities, here's a quote:>> While munching pizza and guzzling sodas, they watched TV, and by the time Wheel of Fortune ended it was eight o'clock. &lt;&lt;5. --- The author's use of biblical concepts for Good Vs Evil, expanding them into creatively unique angles of interpretation.I was impressed and relieved that Betty didn't push any religious concepts to a point which would turn off readers with different belief systems.For example, my beliefs about \\"666\\" do not see that number sequence as a Badge of Evil, as an infallible sign of \\"The Beast.\\"In fact, strangely, the publishing house which put out my novel, THE ROSE AND THE PYRAMID (a trade paperback fantasy which has a few intriguing parallels to TOONIES) has 666 in all of the ISBN's of its books. When I noticed that number sequence in my novel's ISBN, I had asked the publisher about it. I certainly didn't, and don't see AUTHORS UNLIMITED as an evil entity. And, even though the part of my novel's ISBN which has a triple 6 in it is the \\"brand\\" from the publishing house, rather than a brand on my novel, I was not concerned with any type of negativity through that connection. Quite the opposite, in fact.Which brings me to mention that I believe all numbers can be used for either high Good or high Evil (even though many professional Numerologists give positive or negative meaning to numbers). From my way of looking at the essence of energy patterns (which numbers evoke), 666 can be as much a true blessing as it can be used to evoke pure negativity.Having noted the above \\"disclaimer,\\" I can easily say that I was impressed with the way Dravis played subtly on the Biblical concept of 666 heralding evil, impressed with the way she intriguingly designed that \\"omen\\" into Toonies, especially through the arch-villain, Dab (loved that that name's letters are the reverse of \\"bad\\").Without giving away any essentials in the plot, I'll move on to mention another part of this novel which I liked, i.e., the way Dravis showed, developed, and evolved the fact that the other Backgrounders were not truly Evil in the sense that Dab was. The concluding events and scenes beautifully worked out the redemption and \\"saving\\" of the good guys on both sides of the 666 gateway, along with, of course, executing the \\"comeuppance\\" for irredeemable evil.Betty Dravis has offered a telling exposition on the variations, levels, ways, and means of Good Vs Evil in a very entertaining venue.As if that wouldn't be enough to satisfy any finicky reader's need for brain stretches, Betty also developed and grew the relationship between Jeremy's parents into a resolution appropriate to the story, which ran full circle to its opening, as sympathy for Jeremy's plight opened more than one gateway. My favorite opening was the one which allowed me to slip right into the read, and be carried through to the end, with interest, warmth, and humor ever present and abided.Cartoons and Color Crayons (electronic or oil) Rule, and Personal Computers Rock!Linda G. ShelnuttP. S. Though I'm an admirer of Bill Gates and use Windows, I can understand the appeal (and symbolism) of Apple products, especially in view of the interesting Biblical persuasions and allusions. Some of the reviews of THE PIRATES OF SILICON VALLEY (which is a gem of a movie, on video and DVD; it continues to haunt my memory banks) expressed this \\"division\\" interestingly, and the historic facts dramatized in that movie added depth to my enjoyment of Toonies."},{"Title":"The Toonies Invade Silicon Valley","review":"THE TOONIES INVADE SILICON VALLEY is a very fun, extremely charming YA fantasy novel by versatile author Betty Dravis. TOONIES is based on the original premise that if humans are sad enough and in need of sympathy, then the cartoon characters on your computer screen can talk to you, can actually leave your computer, and can join you in the real world. Dravis is clearly a very talented and imaginative storyteller. She not only makes this wild and wacky idea completely believable, she makes it plausible as well. As Dravis weaves her wonderful web of words, you find yourself immediately drawn into the vivid world of the story, caring for her colorful characters and their predicaments, and quickly turning the pages to see how it all turns out.As the parent of two daughters, ages 11 and 3, I would like to commend Ms. Dravis for one important aspect of this YA novel. In almost every story where the kids are the heros, the parents are either dead or they are evil (think Harry Potter or almost any Disney story, both of which I love, btw). However, in TOONIES, the parents are not only alive, they talk to their son, he goes to them for advice, and they have a wonderful family relationship based on love and respect. Yes, the family has its issues and misunderstandings, but they work together to resolve their problems. I am absolutely thrilled to see such positive family behavior and values modeled here. This key element alone would have me singing the praises of Ms. Dravis from the highest mountain tops. The fact that it comes wrapped in a grand adventure is just the icing on the cake.I am going to give this book to my 11 year old to read next. I am certain she will love it. I think you will, too. THE TOONIES INVADE SILICON VALLEY is highly recommend for children of all ages."},{"Title":"The Toonies Invade Silicon Valley","review":"My friend across the country from me took this and another book to Guam, and when she got back she sent them to me to take on my trip to Australia. It was our little joke, a \\"Sisterhood of the Traveling Books.\\" I thought it looked like good airplane reading so I started it in Maine and finished it over the Pacific. What a fun book!Betty Dravis tells a great little story about a teenaged cartoonist named Jeremy Kern whose characters step out of his computer. Your attention will be grabbed by the delightful inhabitants of Cartoon Land, but the top-notch human characters more than hold their own. Jeremy and his friends Buddy and Ashley practically jump off the pages themselves, their issues, interests and dialogue are so vivid. They're smart, inquisitive kids with nurturing natures and a sense of responsibility -- and what an adventure they have! Wouldn't you like all the kids you know to be just like them?The Toonies are enormous fun. Their characteristics and background are described in enough detail to engage and entertain the reader, but by no means overwhelm the rocking story line. The good and the bad Toonies have their own culture, history and idiom -- golly-by-golly, they do! I wonder if anyone else will be reminded of THE BORROWERS, the Carnegie Medal-winning classic by Mary Norton? TOONIES has the same delightful feel while being thoroughly modern. (Hint, hint: there were a number of sequels to THE BORROWERS -- we sure would like to see more of the Toonies! Where are they going to turn up next?)TOONIES deals with some tough issues and models some excellent approaches to them. Jeremy's parents Arthur and Jessica are having problems, but they drop their squabbling to get involved in the Toonies crisis, supporting their son all the way. Along with Steve \\"The Woz\\" Wozniak, Jeremy and his family and friends use all their creativity and courage to fight off the evil challenge of the Mischief Makers.TOONIES is aimed at kids aged 8 to 13. When I was that age I loved stories with a strong sense of place, and I still enjoy that in a book. Somebody's sure to see a fun movie in it, but don't wait for that because the book is so rewarding. Kristy Soza Ardizzone's illustrations are the perfect finishing touch and will inspire your own imagination.Here's a win-win idea -- read TOONIES to a child this month, or take turns reading it to each other! You'll have some giggles and some excitement, and maybe a chance to talk about a few things kids should know about the world."},{"Title":"The Toonies Invade Silicon Valley","review":"I liked how Dravis gave an aura to the good TOONIES that pop out of the computer. It was cool how Doog had green light around him.Kayla, Brentwood, Californiaage nine"},{"Title":"The Toonies Invade Silicon Valley","review":"In this charming story of good versus evil, author Betty Dravis introduces us to the Toonies. Small beings who live in Cartoon Land, the world inside of our computers, the Toonies, like humans, come in good and bad form. Although some of them look a lot like us, others, such as the Mischief-Makers, resemble ape-like birds. But I bet you're wondering what the heck Toonies have to do with Silicon Valley, aren't you?Thirteen-year-old Jeremy Kern is a young cartoonist/illustrator with his own very popular cartoon, \\"Doog Days.\\" Absolutely enamored with his Apple computer, nicknamed \\"Wiseguy,\\" Jeremy spends a lot of his time creating and updating the characters involved in his \\"Doog Days\\" cartoon. The world of the Toonies provides a reprieve for Jeremy, since his parents seem to be constantly arguing ever since his dad lost his job.But the day Doog, the main character from his cartoon, jumps out of his computer and enters Jeremy's real life is a little bit beyond imagination. Doog is on a mission, though, and he won't quit until he convinces Jeremy that the world he has created is more than just fiction.It seems that, in Cartoon Land, there's a Mischief-Maker named Dab who will do anything to stay in the real world. He plans to take over all of the computers he can -- hoping, one day, to even take over the world. But Doog, working under the guidance of the leader of Cartoon Land, Uncle Wom, is on a quest to stop Dab and his fellow Mischief-Makers before bad things start to happen in the real world. Along with his fellow Toonies, they need Jeremy's help, and his expertise, to stop Dab.This is a great science-fiction fantasy story for kids of all ages, or for those who are young at heart. Although the story of good versus evil has been told thousands of time, it's never been told quite like this. You'll appreciate Ms. Dravis' insight into the behind-the-scenes workings of a young teenager's mind, and laugh-out-loud at the humorous scenarios her humans and Toonies find themselves in.

Her voice is smooth and easy to read, making this an ideal book for children of all cultures to learn about children in Silicon Valley.This is a story that brings out some problems that children are dealing with in Silicon Valley and all over the world. Dravis touches the heartbeat of the high-tech, computer industry ... with a twist that's all her own.The \\"alien beings\\" in her world of make-believe do not come from outer space, from the depths of the earth, or from under the sea. Instead, they come from inside a computer. What an imagination!And can you believe, they're cartoon characters. Sweet, smart, lovable cartoon characters that she dubbed TOONIES. That is, most of them are lovable. Even the Mischief-Makers ... except for their evil, ape-bird leader, Dab, who wants to take over the computer companies.It's up to our young hero, Jeremy--from whose computer they gain entrance into Silicon Valley--his friends, his parents, and the \\"good\\" Toonies to capture them and send them back into the computer.Another original twist--that I found easy to believe due to Dravis's skill in writing--is that Steve \\"The Woz\\" Wozniak is helping them round up the \\"bad\\" Toonies. The water-sprinkler scene is hilarious. And the \\"special brand of fireworks\\" will amaze you.Jeremy's parents help, also, but they won points with me by letting Jeremy and his friends solve their problems in thier own way; which is good for the kids' self-esteem. (When you learn how chicken noodle soup helps solve their problems, you'll see how ingenious this author is.)And then there's the good Toonies--Doog, the teen with bushy, red eyebrows, and the Cartoonland leader, Uncle Wom, and his magic. They will steal your heart away.Due to this author's fantastic descriptive skills, this novel would readily adapt to animation. If Hollywood doesn't make a movie of this book, I'll be very surprised.Dravis is a sensitive writer who seems to know what children want and what they enjoy reading. That is not to say this book is just for kids. It's one of those rare books that both children and adults are raving over.

And the ape-birds sounded pretty gross, especially their evil leader Dab.Betty Dravis is a rockin' fine author and I hope she does a series of these books.

I bet they would find problems to solve wherever they visit ... some of the problems of their own making, no doubt.I wish she would have them visit Cincinnati where my grandparents live.

The so-called Toonies have escaped from Computer Cartoon Land, and are ready to pounce on anything that catches their eye. Dab, however, has other plans. He refuses to leave the real world, and has evil plans to take over Grape Computer, Orange Computer, and, eventually, the entire world.

Whilst working on his cartoon, Jeremy accidentally releases the cartoon Toonie Doog (good spelled backward) into this realm! It isn't long before Jeremy becomes charmed by the adorable little creatures that formerly dwelled within his computer. Soon he meets Uncle Wom, the benevolent leader of Cartoon Land and discovers the myriad fascinating secrets of the Toonie realm including a revelation concerning cartoon land's sinister citizen the menacing ape-bird Dab (bad spelled backwards) who has plans for the destruction of Orange Computer and then the world! Things get rather hectic when Dab and his band of like minded minions, called the mischief makers, escape through the computer into the real world, ready to reek their vengeance against the world, and Orange Computer of course. The ultimate adventure begins with Doog, Uncle Wom, Jeremy, his friends, his parents, and Steve \\"the Woz\\" Wozniak desperately fighting against time and the malevolent Dab's sinister machinations. The fight to save Orange Computer and the world has begun! Who is too win this battle between good and evil, Dab versus Doog.Charming and witty, heartwarming and endearing, and just plain enjoyable, The Toonies Invade Silicon Valley is both meaningful and memorable. Whether read by child or adult, this novel will reach the child in all of us presenting a rollicking adventure, lovable characters, and a vicious villain. Never once allowing the story to stagnate, the author continually presents new and interesting circumstances maintaining the reader's interest and stimulating their imagination. Sure to provide many memories of enjoyment, this novel is simply a must.The characters namely Doog, Uncle Wom, Dab, Third, Jeremy, his parents, his two friends, and The Woz were all highly well developed allowing their personalities to transcend the barriers of fiction and embed themselves in the reader's minds as though they were actual living beings telling their story directly to the reader imbuing the text with deep emotion and charming wit.The writing style was well employed and conducive to the tale. While well written and elite, the tale was presented in a manner that younger readers will be able to understand while at the same time not loosing any of its charm and vivacious atmosphere. The style portrayed the characters' emotions in a vividly touching manner and was highly descriptive and evocative of the cheerful yet deeply meaningful theme of the tale. As with all Betty Dravis' works, this tale presents a strong, cheerful personality sure to enthrall its audience whether young or old.The general theme of the story was far more than just an entertaining read; it concentrated on the battle between good and evil in a manner that children can understand while at the same time presenting a heady concept that far transcends the boundaries of a simple story into the realm of morality. Unlike many modern children's stories, this tale concentrates on a heavy life issue that even perplexes adults, yet through some seemingly effortless magic, the author showcases the truth about good and evil in an efficient yet overwhelmingly brilliant and convincing manner. Well done!The only slight warning I have concerning this brilliant tale is the evil portrayed through the character Dab and his disturbing actions. The author portrayed evil through the personification of the malignant ape-bird Dab so well that his vitriolic aura hung heavily upon the reader's mind. Also, some segments of the novel were quite gory namely the scene where Dab gruesomely kills a guard of Orange Computer gouging out his eyes with his sharp beak and the poisoning him with his red feathers. This more honest depiction of evil is heavily reminiscent of the classic compilation known as Grimm's Fairy Tales. However, this direct approach might prove too much for children with a sensitive disposition or for very young children. Therefore, it might behoove the parent to skim over these sections or water them down when reading aloud to a child. Still, this is only a minor complaint and certainly is not grievous enough to degrade my star rating or cause the reader to loose any enjoyment.As the exciting story dramatically continues, presenting the protagonists with seemingly insurmountable odds, allowing the endearing characters, especially the Toonies, to command a place in the heart, and portraying the battle of good verses evil in a simplistic yet heavily effective manner, it becomes apparent that a no less grand conclusion will be forthcoming. This reader was not disappointed. The conclusion was dramatic, tragic, heartwarming, and forever memorable leaving the reader satisfied but at the same time longing for more tales of Doog and Uncle Wom and all their merry friends.The illustrations presented throughout the tale, and on the front cover, rendered by the extremely talented artist Kristy Soza Ardizzone were charming, well drawn, and accurately captured the aura of the characters and the intensity of the story. Sure to impress any child and charm any adult, the illustrations were a magnificent addition to this tale allowing the readers to get a glimpse of some of their favourite characters as the author envisioned them.Every aspect of the tale was well presented from the finely developed and lovable characters, to the adventurous dramatic conclusion, the elegant yet easy flowing writing, and the epic battle between Doog and Dab, good versus bad. Wondrous and charming, memorable and affecting, this unique tale cannot fail to capture the imagination and tug at the heart. Highly recommended.Ravenova"},{"Title":"The Toonies Invade Silicon Valley","review":"Toonies is what I would call a modern, high-tech fairy tale, probably one of the first of its kind. Hans Christian Anderson, you of the old school, eat your heart out!The narrative is interesting and easy to follow, briskly paced and engrossing. There are many clever fantasy story devices and flashes of imagination, like the whole premise of cartoon land and its inhabitants and \\"secrets,\\" like the idea of clicking on a cartoon character's right eye to get him out of the computer, or Toonies eating ink rather than human food.Betty Dravis also uses a lot of \\"young\\" terminology that will appeal to kid readers, especially. Additionally, that whole plot involving the Mischief-Makers was very suspenseful and kept me turning the pages, especially as the story wound down at the climax.Good character development; I got a good sense of what most of the main characters were like: Oh that Dab, he was just PURE EVIL. I'm glad he was stopped from carrying out his malevolent plan. I also like the parents subplot or Orange Computer subplot. My only minor criticism is I would have liked to see this subplot more developed.I also like how Uncle Wom always says \\"Golly-by-golly,\\" and I like the \\"Pronto-Toronto,\\" the \\"Hmph-by-hmph,\\" the \\"Sheesh,\\" and \\"cheep-cheep,\\" and words like \\"girlykins,\\" \\"kiddo,\\" and so on that are peppered throughout. Uncle Wom has a unique vocabulary, slightly reminiscent of Olde English, which makes him very endearing.In conclusion, the Mischief-Makers remind me of the demons who joined Lucifer (Dab) in rebellion against God (Uncle Wom). Just a symbolic or metaphorical interpretation behind the literal one."},{"Title":"The Toonies Invade Silicon Valley","review":"My Dad got this book from the Reno library for me. He thinks it's real clever. Me too ... I liked the way the TOONIES got into our world. Jeremy is a smart kid. I'm glad his parents let him solve his own problems. That was way cool. Wish mine would do that.Maybe this author could write another one, and let the Toonies visit Reno next time. Good job, lady!Tucker from Sparks, Nevada"},{"Title":"The Toonies Invade Silicon Valley","review":"I love all types of fantasy, but this tale is particularly close to my own heart. In fact, it is my favorite type of story: Vivid characters and events are first grounded in reality to make them believable so that the jump into the fantastical draws us in completely. After we are a part of the story, the imaginative events take over to both amaze and amuse us.Ms. Dravis' ability to present real people, places, and things in the midst of a fantasy story is very close to what I strive for in my own writings. Characters with last names and problems who live in real places, but still have fantastical things happen to them, make for a wonderful story - truly a modern James and the Giant Peach or Charlie and the Chocolate Factory kind of tale. I am also impressed by how well a female author is able to portray such a believable boy character. All of the characters are engaging and real, with their daily struggles and triumphs; and this helps make the story real as well, though it is also a lovely escape.In fact, it is so well done I am tempted to compare it to one of my favorite television shows - Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends, which to me is entirely plausible, given the vast number of very real imaginary friends I have known in my life. This book has the power to appeal to all ages and types of people. I would definitely recommend it.J.H.

Was he imagining things? Or was this funny little cartoon character for real?\\"\\"The Toonies Invade Silicon Valley,\\" written by Bay Area author Betty Dravis, stimulates one's imagination by cleverly melding real life situations with the age of technology in a book where good triumphs over evil.During a time in which one computer, if not more, is as common as TV sets in households across the country, and kids are able to maneuver in and out of computer programs like previous generations mastered the paddles of Pong, Dravis draws on those technological aspects to take her reader on a fast-paced adventure; one that pits good Toonies (computer characters) over evil ones, who are on the loose determined to first destroy Silicon Valley, then the world.\\"I got part of the idea for Toonies way back in 1992, when I was sitting before my computer, starting to go online,\\" said Dravis about her 2005 published young-teen novel. \\"Some garbled voices issued forth, startling me.\\"It was the sound of voices, instead of the gurgling of her modem, that got the wheels of her mind churning - \\"Toonies\\" was born.\\"This started me thinking about who could live inside a computer,\\" she said. \\"My imagination soared from there and I started typing.\\"When asked what she does to create such interesting characters, she said, \\"I let my characters take over. In that way, I think they become more real.\\"She said she also visualizes her books in her mind, like she's watching a movie. \\"I actually see them in full color, which certainly helps me with details of how they behave, how they dress, etc.\\"Details that some students in Brentwood really appreciated after a reading of \\"Toonies.\\"\\"I thought it was funny when Doog (the main cartoon character) jumped out of the computer and Jer (the main human character) could hardly speak,\\" said 8-year-old Shelby.Kayla, 9, said she liked how Dravis gave an aura to the good \\"Toonies\\" that pop out of the computer. \\"It was cool how he (Doog) had green light around him,\\" she said.Steven 8, said he liked what the Toonies had to eat. \\"It was kind of funny how they had to drink ink to stay alive,\\" he said.As for Dravis' ideas for Toonies, she said that she \\"came up with the idea of cartoon characters living inside the computer and then had to figure out how they came to be there. One thing led to another and soon I had a full-fledged plot.\\" A plot which turned Apple Computers, Inc. into Orange Computers and features \\"The Woz\\" - brainchild of Apple Computers Steve Wozniak - as a person sought to help conquer the menacing Mischief Makers.\\"The perfect setting was Silicon Valley and since, even back then, high-tech people were being laid off, I worked that and the effect it often has on families into the plot - and ran from there,\\" she said.Dravis said she has had lots of her readers tell her that they bought the book for their kids, but got pulled in by the creativity of the storyline that they ended up reading it themselves.So, what do kids think of the book?\\"It was a good story,\\" said Melissa, 8. \\"The characters were awesome.\\""},{"Title":"The Toonies Invade Silicon Valley","review":"A story about this book was on the front page of the Los Gatos newspaper and it sounded like a true Silicon Valley book.

He writes and illustrates his own problems on his comic strip with Doog, the red haired boy with stars and stripes suspenders as the main character.One particularly unnerving day of parental disagreements, Jeremy blocks his ears with his hands to try blotting out their fighting.Jeremy pushes his chair away from the computer in exasperation, when suddenly a voice summons him. It's Doog, straight out of Cartoon Land. Jeremy is startled and distracted when Doog and Uncle Wom (a.k.a. wise old man) Jeremy learns that he must keep The Toonies a secret. Only Buddy and Ashley meet them, until...Jeremy's unsuspecting and curious dad marvels at his son's cartoon drawings, then turns on Jeremy's computer.This is where the Mischief Makers led by Dab (bad spelled backwards)are let loose into the Kern's home and Silicon Valley.Mischief and mayhem follow in a funny and very, very original story.One of my favorite events is when Jeremys mom Jessica and friend Ashley make shoes out of tin foil so the light weight little Tonnie Doog can walk more like a human than hop around.Through Betty's highly descriptive, skilled writing, we envision the comical, colorful Toonie characters, all of whom have distinct personalities and charms. The dialogue is hysterical and we quickly become absorbed into The Toonies adventure.This is a classic!I recommend this book highly to both young adults and children. It will steer young people into dealing with stress in a productive manner. Because its extremely insightful, it can have a therapeutic effect on children and teach them new coping skills. For parents, this book will remind them of how positive influence can have a great impact on children."},{"Title":"The Toonies Invade Silicon Valley","review":"A friend gave me this book after she had finished reading it and I was thrilled she did after I had read the story.

I kid you not! Even 'big kids' like myself, will absolutely love this book. &quot;Toonies Invade Silicon Valley,&quot; is a story that belongs on the 'big screen.&quot; Yes, it's that good! My daughter, Michelle and I had a lot of fun reading the chapters together.The well-developed characters with fun names like, Toonie Doog (good spelled backwards.short for do-gooder), and Jeremy Kern, Doog's creator, and wise beyond his years, (Uncle Wom)...kept us anxiously reading long after Michelle's bedtime. The dialogue was equally as impressive, so much so in fact, we didn't want to put the book down...not even when our eyes got so tired it was almost impossible for us to continue reading...BUT the interesting and well-told plot wouldn't let us. What can I say...we were reeled in and hooked until after the last page had been read.Writer Dravis, is an amazing storyteller with a 'unique' style all her own. I can't rave enough about this book. Kids of all ages will love this story.&quot;Toonies Invade Silicon Valley,&quot; has it all...a kids book that tells both a story that challenges a child's imagination as well as teaches them a lsson or two about 'real life' and 'problems' they must learn to deal with sometimes.If you are in the market for a fantastic book for your kids that are both entertaining as well as teach, then, &quot;Toonies Invade Silicon Valley,&quot; is the book for you.

It's also heart-warming to see such a fine collaboration between a grandmother, the author, and a granddaughter, the artist. This book could easily become an animated movie if the right people read it. I can envision Jeremy, Doog, and Uncle Wom romping around the big screen to the delight of children and adults.

One of my \\"many\\" dates took it from me and he's passing it around to all his friends at the Comedy Center. I've never read a book that has such universal appeal; girls, boys, teens, women and men are all taken with the concept of cartoon characters coming to life and entering earth through a computer. How original is that!!!This author even has a real, live human running around with her fictitious characters. When Steve Wozniak, the beloved co-founder of Apple Computer, comes into the mix, it's like the cherry on top of the coke! And when the plot unfolds with the \\"bad\\" Toonies trying to take over Orange Computer--despite the obvious danger--it's a laugh a minute. ... Well, read for yourself!I'm blown away by the clever plot, the twists and turns, and the ingenious way this author lets her young teens solve their own problems. The main character, Jeremy Kern, a 13-year-old boy (humanoid), comes up with a solution that will make everyone LOL while shaking their heads at the concept! It involves chicken noodle soup ... every Mom's quick fix for everything. Enough said, other than to say: Kudos, Ms. Dravis! Super-Clever!I bet Betty Dravis had as much fun writing this as I do when I write a new joke for my comedy routines. I'm tempted to write the good Toonies, DOOG and UNCLE WOM (with his purple undies) into my act ... if Ms. Dravis would allow that."},{"Title":"The Toonies Invade Silicon Valley","review":"In saying this author speaks my language, I don't mean she speaks French. I mean she writes how I wish I could write.I discovered her when I made a trip to Silicon Valley to train under a famous area chef. My countrymen are beginning to acquire tastes for American food, so my popular cafe sent me over ... all expenses paid. Can't beat that!At any rate, I stayed at Toll House in Los Gatos and spotted a story about Dravis on the front page of the Los Gatos newspaper. One thing led to another, and I purchased a copy of this very unusual fantasy adventure. And I can tell you: it's not only for kids. I loved it!Great characters, fantastic description ... and even though Uncle Wom, Doog, and all the rest are make-believe characters, the author described them so well that they became alive for me.

I sat down and read the entire book from cover-to-cover over the course of a morning. While my kids are older now, I definitely recommend Dravis' book to anyone with kids in the 8-13 year age range.

Jeremy started the strip as a way to deal with some of the problems he was going through. He never thought it would take off like it did, but his strip became a huge success. But Jeremy's parents are fighting alot and thoughts of divorce are being thrown around. Jeremy doesn't know what to do. Until a couple of characters from Cartoon Land start speaking with Jeremy. With Jeremy's help, they leave Cartoon Land and try to help Jeremy with his problem. But the act of kindness by a couple of toonies sets into motion a series of unfortunate events that causes the evil Dab to escape from Cartoon Land and attempt to take over our world.THE TOONIES INVADE SILICON VALLEY is written as a young adult/children's novel and readers that age and younger will probably enjoy the story very much--I know when I was younger I wondered if it was possible to bring cartoon characters to life. The story is fairly short and easy to read. Also, though it is set in Silicon Valley, the story has a warm and friendly, down-home feel to it that appeals to a wide variety of readers.Some of the dialogue seems a bit stale and there are some references in the story that anyone not familiar with Silicon Valley might not understand. However, some of the ideas in the story or creative (characters from Cartoon Land eat ink) and as a whole the book appeals to not only children, but the child in all of us. A nice, little tale that can spark the imagination in young readers."},{"Title":"The Toonies Invade Silicon Valley","review":"The Toonies, is a fun and original story. The cartoon characters and everything else that is rejected on our computer screens does not go away but dwells in the computer in a space called the Background Acres. These Mischief Makers seek to destroy the humanoid world that rejected them. Led by Dab (bad spelled backwards) they conspire to escape their computer world to do just that. It is up to Jeremy and his creation Doog to prevent Dab for achieving his goal.A funny aside is that the story really began when Steve \`the woz' Wozniac and Steve Jobs created the first affordable home computer and suffered injury from a screw driver. A computer character Uncle Wom (the self-proclaimed Wise Old Man) spoke to them through the computer screen but at his request they have kept him secret to this day.Betty Dravis has a wonderful play on words in the dialogue throughout the book with phrases such as \`Pronto Toronto!\\" and \`Golly-by-golly!'

Long story short, \\"The Toonies are Invading Silicon Valley\\" is the book I decided to read and I'm sure glad I did.Ms. Betty Dravis has written a fun and engaging book, and a book I intend to pass along to my son and daughter. In this book, cartoon characters live inside computers, in a place known as Cartoon Land, and can enter our world. The book at its heart is fairly simple, it is a story for 9 to 12 year old, but it has many fresh ideas and is simply a fun read.In Cartoon land, there are good Toonies and bad Toonies. The bad ones are called Mischief Makers, and they're led by a tyrant named Dab (bad spelled backwards). I loved that and wondered if Betty got the idea from Stanek's Dragon books which have servant spelled backward as tnavres for one of the key characters. Betty's imagination is wonderful, and she brings the story to life. I particularly like that the Mischief Makers were discarded cartoon creaturesThe story is about the cartoons, but it is also about Jeremy, a young cartoonist who draws a comic strip on his computer. Jeremy is living through the typical adolescent nightmare called parents (being a parent, I can sympathize with his predicament). Jeremy's life changes when the \\"star\\" of the comic strip, Doog (good spelled backwards), comes out of Jeremy's computer and starts talking to him. Uncle Wom, the leader of Cartoon Land, comes out next, and this is how Jeremy learns more about Cartoon Land.I enjoyed this book, and am glad it was recommended to me. I look forward to reading more of Betty's books."},{"Title":"The Toonies Invade Silicon Valley","review":"This book has a clear and compelling writing style and great sense of storytelling and adventure. It was pure delight to envision Steve Wozniak running around the lawn and through the sprinkler system, helping the humans and good Toonies capture the \\"bad guys.\\" The hilarity of the adventure reminds you a bit of the Beatles having fun in The Yellow Submarine movie. It was a little stroke of genius for the author to have the foresight to write Woz into the plot. i really was swept along fior the ride as I wanted to see if Doog would get rescued from Dab and the Mischief-Makers with the help of Wom and his magic, that was fun.

I loved the characters in the story, but human and Toonies, especially the wise old toonie and the evil minion known as \\"third.\\"This is a story that is really hard to classify as being for any one particular group of readers. I think it would make a great book to be read aloud by an adult to the family or to a classroom. There is an appeal that would cross ages in the characters and their unique personalities. They also deal with very common problems in ways that are quite uncommon.The author considers the fact that Steve Wozniak gave her permission to use his voice as one of her speaking characters to be a selling point of the book, and it is, but once you have read the story, the \\"Woz\\" and his partner Steve Jobs will not be the ones who have won your hearts. The point where the book takes a side journey out of reality and the world where the two Steve's created Apple Computer, vanishes into a fantasy land with \\"Orange Computer\\" dominating, is really the point where you know this is, and isn't our world, but would be a fun place to visit."},{"Title":"The Toonies Invade Silicon Valley","review":"My Dad bought Toonies for me at a book show in my city Elk Grove.

The Toonies, Mischief Makers, Uncle Wom, and the evil Dab that jump from the computer into Silicon Valley are vividly described ... with great flair.Can you picture birds with twisted beaks and \\"humped\\" shoulders? A Toonie teen so thin that a gust of air can blow him over? Characters that balloon up like beachballs when they eat \\"people\\" food? An orange-faced old man with a flowing white beard and hair who, from a distance, looks like a \\"pumpkin floating on a while cloud?\\"You'll be able to picture them clearly while reading this book because Dravis is wonderful at description. The characters come alive!Besides all that, she has managed an exciting, yet educational plot, drawing on many high-tech and familiar family problems encountered by the youth of today.Betty Dravis let her imagination run free when creating what I think is the most original plot of 2005 ... and perhaps of 2006. That remains to be seen. 2006 will bring us new books from both the beloved, familiar authors as well as from some talented new authors. It will be a satisfying \\"reading year\\" if I can find at least one book as original as this one.Awesome job, lady.- Dora Dalrymple, pet groomer"},{"Title":"The Toonies Invade Silicon Valley","review":"The Toonies Invade Silicon Valley proves that Betty Dravis has more than enough talent to spare. Dravis writes this book with all the energy that will attract a curious, fun loving child and once children start reading this they'll never put it down! Betty Dravis writes well and she also uses her extensive knowledge of computers to keep the story spirited, interesting and timely.The action starts when a young boy begins to see and interact with cartoon characters that pop out of his \\"Orange\\" computer! We soon find out that even in the world of cartoon characters there is both good and bad; and although there are a few darker passages in this book children shouldn't be too frightened of them. The Toonies Invade Silicon Valley is THAT good.I should also mention that the illustrations are very carefully done and they enhance the book very nicely.Overall, Betty Dravis scores a homerun with this imaginative, clever children's book. I notice that Toonies is out of stock at the moment; only selling on the secondary market. The good news is that it's being republished with a new cover in the very near future. I'm happy to hear that because every child should have a copy of this on their shelves to enjoy over and over again.

While reading, the characters came to life for me. It's a wonderful satire of Silicon Valley, and using The Woz to romp around with the Toonies and help save Silicon Valley from the evil Dab and the Mischief Makers was hilarious ... a touch of genius.

A serial killer is targeting child prostitutes in the Leeds/Bradford corridor of Yorkshire and the police investigation is hindered by the fact that nobody wants to admit something as seamy as child prostitution is going on.When Detective Inspector Handford is driving home one night, he spots a young constable throwing-up at the mouth of an alley. The killer's third victim has just been found. In a pocket of the unfortunate young girl is a fifteen-year-old photograph of a man Handford knows - his boss DCI Stephen Russell. Against his will he is ordered to investigate Russell and he turns up the possibility of more murders a decade and a half earlier.This story is gritty and grim stuff, but Horton has the ability to make us care about her characters, both the authorities and the victims. She keeps the tension building in this bold and controversial novel and even though it may at times be a little squeamish, I predict that you won't be able to put it down."},{"Title":"Hitts & Mrs.","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. It's much richer and pleasantly different than most of the love stories out now. The author does a great job of painting a complete picture of the characters--Melanie Hitts wants to be more than just a Mrs., but doesn't think she can be the kind of wife her mother trained her to be. I love her fiance, Will. Finally an author who doesn't bash the brother! Will is gentle and patient (there is a dinner scene in here to die for). He really loves Melanie even when she breaks his heart. And you can feel how much Melanie loves him, even though she runs away. John Carlson is an older, white man who is bored with his job and his life. When he and Melanie get together to work on a hotel you can feel the attraction coming off the page. I've never read a book where the writer managed to capture the chemistry between characters so well. And I've never read a book about a love triangle, where I wanted the woman to be with both men. And when Sharon, John's wife finds out that her man is with a sister,watch out! And Candace, she's the girlfriend we all have. The one we just shake our heads at and love anyway! There are lots of twists and turns in this great story. I give Ms. Bryant-Woolridge 4 stars for her outstanding writing ability and one extra for taking the same old story and giving it a little somthin somthin extra! Highly recommended reading."},{"Title":"Hitts & Mrs.","review":"HITTS &amp; MRS by Lori Bryant-WoolridgeHITTS &amp; MRS. by Lori Bryant-Woolridge is the story of a young successful African American woman who is torn between her ex-fianc&eacute; and her boss. The story sounds simple but it is more complicated than that. Melanie Hitts has just gotten out of her engagement to highly eligible bachelor Will Freedman, feeling that she's being rushed into marriage to a man she has known for only a few months. Her sense of independence has been taken from her, and when she finds out that he has bought them a house as a surprise clinches it for her. The fact that he didn't even consult her on this purchase was enough for her to call the engagement off. And she does this in front of the entire room full of friends and family at their fancy engagement party.While Will tries to figure out how to win Melanie over again, Melanie moves back to New York City to continue with her highly successful career in interior design. And it's through this job that she meets her soul mate, John Carlson, the head of the internationally known architecture company Carlson and Tuck. Everything would be wonderful if only John was younger, John was not married, and John was black. Melanie doesn't know which is worse, that he's married or that he's the wrong color.Melanie and John grow together in their platonic relationship, but at the same time Melanie still loves Will. She's never stopped loving him, but she could not marry him under the conditions of their current relationship. Something needs to change. John was everything that Will wasn't, yet both had qualities that satisfied Melanie's needs. With this in mind Melanie wonders if she can have it all, a loving friendship with John and a marriage with Will? As far as she's concerned, there is nothing wrong with that. She's not doing anything wrong, although she and John do love each other, but they have sworn not to push their relationship into the physical.Although I didn't find this book the perfect book, I am rating HITTS &amp; MRS. 4 stars. I enjoyed the story line and found the book such a fast read that I finished it in two days. Some of the characters didn't' quite ring true for me, including John Carlson's wife Sharon, who I started out liking a lot but had my doubts about some of her actions at the end of the book. The issue of racism obviously comes into play in this book, but it is so subdued and doesn't' really become an issue until the second half of the book that I think it should have either been written in as a main plot line, or not used at all. I would definitely read other books by Lori Bryant-Woolridge and I recommend HITTS &amp; MRS. to those who are fans of romances, African American Lit, or both."},{"Title":"Hitts & Mrs.","review":"I wish this book came in hardcover because I know it is one I will read and reread many,many times. Lori Bryant-Woolridge has written a great love story here. I totally fell in love with Will and was cheering him on as he pursued his woman. At the same time I could understand Melanie's delimma. The author did a wonderful job with painting her into an emotional corner with John. I agree with some of the others, what's so great about it is that it is not the same old stuff we get in books these days. This has alot of substance as well as just being a nice, quick read. Also the author has a really nice writing style. It's smooth and you feel like you're the one experiencing everything. Definitely treat yourself."},{"Title":"Hitts & Mrs.","review":"Hitts &amp; Mrs. explores the feasibility of being married and genuinely loving your spouse and another person at the same time. Melanie Hitts is a beautiful, intelligent and ambitious career woman. She loves her job and her beau, Will Freedman. But when their relationship hits a bump, and she finds herself attracted to John, her married white business partner, Melanie is taught important lessons that will have you turning the pages to see what happens next. The fact that Melanie likes John and vice versa is something that is interesting to witness. Their attraction to each other is compelling and the supporting cast helps to richen the plot.Lori does a fine job using fire-hot, on point relationship analysis, and lively language to explore this unique and refreshing storyline. Hitts &amp; Mrs. is well written, funny, sensual and thought-provoking. For those who want a change of pace and have a strong desire to become emotionally involved in another facet of male-female relationships, this is a highly recommended read."},{"Title":"Hitts & Mrs.","review":"I started reading Hitts and Mrs and simply could not put it down.It was a realistic, thought provoking, romantic storyline. It was easy to relate to one or more of the characters and compare their actions to your own possible actions. The book explored various levels of friendship and love and really made me ponder -Where does friendship end and infidelity begin? The interpetations and responses to that seeming simple question can be easy or complex. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and I have already recommended it to many of my friends."},{"Title":"Hitts & Mrs.","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I couldn't put it down and finished it in 24 hours. Lori Bryant-Woolridge has an easiness to her writing. Her characters were well-developed and more importantly believable. She didn't put them in fantastic and down right senseless situations, she didn't have them agonizing and she didn't have them spew insipid remarks.Despite the human frailties that she allowed her main characters to have, as a reader you still felt a sense of compassion for them. It was so refreshing to see intelligence and strength in the black female character, Melanie Hitts involved in an interracial relationship with a white man, John Carlson who shared those same characteristics. And although, the conventional attitudes that we are all accustomed to screamed out that the relationship was wrong because he was married, I also felt that little twinge of guilt because I wanted them to get together.The author skillfully made John and Melanie's relationship so much more than just about sexual attraction. She also gave them a common ground in that they both had souls fuled on creativity. It was also refreshing that the author did not put the old cliches in John Carlson's mouth, of his wife not understanding him etc. which propelled him to look for attention outside of his marriage. There was honesty and dishonesty present at all times in all the characters.Mrs. Bryant-Woolridge shows how when it comes to love, feelings are not always crystal clear. They are often times quite hazy and very complicated. How can you be in love with two people at the same time but, still the author was able to reveal to the reader that there was never any sense as you read the story that despite the love, mutual respect, adoration, acceptance and sexual attraction John and Melanie had for each other, that John was leaving his wife, Sharon after 24 years of marriage for Melanie. He still loved his wife, he knew what he wanted and where he needed to be.You also felt that in spite of the love Melanie felt for John, that she would never make him choose. Melanie knew she belonged with Will Freedman. There were twists and turns but in the end everyone ends up in their proper places. The journey with these characters was well worth it. Read this book!"},{"Title":"Hitts & Mrs.","review":"The book raised some thought-provoking points about many issues that are important--especially to African-American women. Topics such as: the importance of career vs. relationships, finding one's identity independent of a man, the definition of a true friend, gaining respect in the workplace, the possibility of a platonic relationship with the opposite sex and of course, interracial dating are all covered in the book. The fact that John and Melanie had a deep, loving, non-sexual relationship helped the highlight the importance of finding the right qualities in the man of your dreams--many which may go beyond race or socio-economic status.While all of this may sound \\"heavy\\" the book moves along smoothly and is a page turner. Great to take on a long weekend away or on a long plane ride! Once you finish, you'll find yourself thinking a lot about what you read."},{"Title":"Hitts & Mrs.","review":"Melanie Hitts is a woman that has the world by the tail, or does she? In Lori Bryant-Woolridge's, Hits and Mrs., Melanie is engaged to Will, a successful, handsome, caring and considerate man who worships the ground she walks on. At the beginning of the book Melody finds herself at their engagement party making an announcement that she has decided to forego marriage much to Will's embarrassment. Immediately, she leaves Washington, D.C. and rushes off to New York City to pursue a career as an interior designer. When a prominent, Caucasian, and very married architect named John Carlson takes Melanie under his wing, they find themselves sharing more than career interests. As their friendship grows, Melanie must do some soul searching and decide if she will give into the ever persistent Will or into her forbidden desires for John.Hitts and Mrs. is a well-crafted romantic novel. The characters were believable and the book held my interest from beginning to end. In additin, there were several sub-plots which were well-developed; each exploring relationships on several different levels. Overall, I found Hitts and Mrs. to be witty, exciting and wonderfully entertaining. Bryant-Woolridge does not disappoint.If you are looking for an enjoyable romantic read, I say do not miss picking-up a copy of Lori Bryant-Woolridge's, Hitts and Mrs.T. RHYTHM KNIGHTAPOOO BookClub"},{"Title":"Hitts & Mrs.","review":"Appropriately labeled as \\"chick lit,\\" Lori Bryant-Woolridge's Hitts & Mrs. is a suspenseful romance of sorts spread out over nearly 400 pages of a grainy plot and inconsistencies. This is a topsy turvy story of Melanie Hitts coming to realize that love doesn't have to suffocate her budding career. Of course, the story wouldn't be complete without Melanie juggling two love interests; the man she is in love with and thinks is her soul-mate, Will Freedman, and the unconventional older man of a different hue whom teaches her how to love, John Carlson. John is married to Sharon Carlson, which makes for a tense situation in the book. Will Melanie and John get caught in their non-physical, but intimate affair? This question alone is what may keep readers struggling to the end of the book.The true suspense and drama of the plot lies in Candace Bennett, Melanie's best friend and wild child/vixen of the novel. Woolridge's scenes depicting Candace's 'love scenes' with various men are Zane worthy when it comes to how graphic they are. Candace's rags to riches transformation to a hot shot lawyer are also intriguing when it ties into her views on relationships.The main thing that kept me frustrated with this book was how Woolridge left things hanging when it came to Candace. The story of Melanie ultimately \\"coming to her senses\\" concerning her love of Will appeared to be stretched out with meaningless filler of the daily grind of Melanie's career as though Woolridge were trying to make a page quota. I'm not a lover of romance novels which may play a role in my feelings toward this story, but if you're a reader who loves tales of \\"enchanted love\\" with a little character development thrown in, you just might find yourself enjoying this book more than I did.AnnaR.E.A.L. Reviewers"},{"Title":"Hitts & Mrs.","review":"Meet Melanie Hitts, an individual who has been known to turn more than a few heads, not only with her looks but with her talent too. Melanie is in a tangled web and can't decide whether or not to become a Mrs. or remain Ms. Hitts. She managed to get Will Freedman's attention and a marriage proposal. They have a whirlwind relationship that escalates a little too fast for her, as a result she calls off the marriage at the most inopportune time - during the engagement party. Suddenly there is an overwhelming feeling that getting married would impede on her dream to become a top interior designer. Feeling the need to get away from the mess she's made, she moves to New York to follow her dream and attempts to make a name for her in the interior design business.While in New York, Melanie gets another man's attention. A presentation to one of the top architectural firms tests Melanie's ability to be spontaneous, yet it also gives her an opportunity to strut her stuff and show them what she's working with. While giving the presentation, she meets the head honcho - John Carlson, an older, married white man who manages to ruffle her feathers a little and vice versa. The end result is more than either ever imagined.There's a (not so obvious) message regarding insecurities people have a tendency to deal with. Sometimes we don't know they exist until someone else brings them to our attention. The people you associate with can either make you or break you. Melanie's relationships proved to bring both fulfillment and disappointment. As a result, she's forced to decide which is most important.Hitts & Mrs. incorporates a few subplots: Candace (Melanie's best friend) and her inability to keep a \\"good\\" man, Sharon (John's wife) and her struggles with voicing her opinions and Amanda (a troubled teen) who has issues with her mother. Bryant-Woolridge almost lost me with some of the subplots but somewhere in the middle managed to save herself and skillfully tie them into the story. In the end, it all worked out and hence the story won my approval.Reviewed by Esther \\"Ess\\" Mays of Loose Leaves Book Review"},{"Title":"Hitts & Mrs.","review":"Melanie Hitts didn't expect this to happen, especially after she broke off her engagement with the man of her dreams.

The characters are rich and well developed. I couldn't put this book down. I found myself caught up with everything Melanie was going through whether she was happy or sad. After reading it, I understand the title Hitts &amp; Mrs(great concept). I highly recommend this book. Don't borrow your girlfriend's copy, buy your own. This book would make a great movie. Thanks again Mrs. Bryant-Woolridge!!!"},{"Title":"Hitts & Mrs.","review":"I loved the book,this is my first time coming across Lori Bryant-Woolridge's work and it was a good read. The main emphasis of loving two different individuals in various ways allowed me to think outside the box. The shock of Melanie having doubts about her own engagement that allowed her to call of her wedding to her finding love with another man besides her ex-fiance was intriguing. I enjoyed how Lori allowed the reader to look deep within to see how we can love another on a more deep, emotional and intimate way without the physicalities that can be involved in a relationship. The notion of having just one soul mate comes into question while reading and questions our own thoughts on the subject.

Go back to what you know best."},{"Title":"Hitts & Mrs.","review":"I love it buy it and read it over and over again. That's all I can say!"},{"Title":"Hitts & Mrs.","review":"Peeyew! What stinks?!? This book. I was willing to ignore the author's habit of telling instead of showing. Many times we're asked to believe Melanie feels nervous/depressed/anxious/confused simply because the writer tells us so. I was willing to ignore the cesspool of dead cliches and stale metaphors. Eyes always search rooms &quot;hungrily&quot; and characters' hearts constantly &quot;pitter pat&quot; with anxiety. I was willing to ignore the convenient plot points undertaken so that the author wouldn't have to engage in more muscular writing. For example, not one but two main characters (Mrs. Carlson and Will Freedman) are orphaned when their parents die simultaneously in catastrophic accidents. No need to write about the in-laws! Whew! I was even willing to read past the fact that the author expects us to like a main character (John Carlson) that engages in patently unlikeable behavior before we learn anything really charming about him. Next time, the author should try to make us like John Carlson before she has him shouting things like &quot;What the hell are you doing here?&quot; at a teenage girl. But what finally stopped me cold were the glaring editorial errors such as &quot;Timberland&quot; boots being described as &quot;Timberlines.&quot; That's just sloppy. If her editor wasn't willing to read the book -- and I don't blame her; the plot is drier than zweiback toast -- why should we? This book is amateurish, written by someone who doesn't read very much for people who don't expect very much."},{"Title":"Hitts & Mrs.","review":"This book could not hold my attention,I would try to read it and fall to sleep don't waste your money on this book it is not worth it."},{"Title":"Hitts & Mrs.","review":"This story was crafted very well. It will keep you attention throughout its entirety. There is poetry and it leaves you with the hope of romance without physical gratification, but these things happen between two people who have other people in their lives, a spouse and a fiance'. Melissa and John claim that the love they have for each other showed them how much they were in love with their partners. I don't know how true that is, but it lead to a great story line, of love, passing racial lines and infidelity, I guess you can call it infidelity even though nothing physical happenened, everything was emotional.So if you would like to read something touching I do recommend this book.Later...."},{"Title":"Hitts & Mrs.","review":"In Lori Bryant-Woolridge's sophomore novel, she explores love in its many forms; the capacity to love, who we love and the fine line between friendship and infidelity. Melanie Hitts is an up-and-coming interior decorator who has received some notoriety, has a handsome, successful fianc&eacute;e' and the kind of life a well educated woman from an established African American family is expected to have. But in front of friends and family in Washington D.C., she breaks off her upcoming nuptials at her engagement party and returns to New York on the pretense of furthering her career. Will is devastated, as is Melanie's family, not understanding why she did this. Will, despite his humiliation and the public rejection will not give up on the woman who has captured his heart. Melanie, meanwhile has snagged a plum assignment with an internationally known architectural firm run by John Carlson, a powerhouse in the world of architecture.It was her sharp tongue, drive and the fact that she was not intimidated by him that drew Melanie to John. This beautiful, intelligent, witty young African American woman, eighteen years his junior intrigues him and fascinates in all the ways that should and should not and shakes up his white bread, privileged life. Melanie feels easy with John despite his being Caucasian and older; he complements her and feeds her artistic side in ways that Will, though as loving and attentive and perfect as he is, just does not. What is happening here? Is it possible to be in love with two men? Is it love that she feels for John? Ironically, Melanie has chastised her best friend; materialistic, self-centered Candace for indulging in affairs with married men. But this is not an affair, is it?Both John and Melanie rationalize their need for each other as a friendship that is beneficial for the both of them that still allows them to love and appreciate their respective mates even more so. Now sure of herself, Melanie feels she is ready to be Will's wife. But will he understand if she keeps John in her life? John's wife, in many ways, a typical upstate suburban wife, has lived in her husband's shadow; repressing her need to express herself, and allowing him to make major decisions, the most recent, uprooting her from her safe haven in the country to move into New York City. Her need to nurture brings her in contact with a young teen-ager who lacks parental guidance and is prone to getting into trouble. Meanwhile high-maintenance Candace, falls in love with Will's best friend, Griffin, a struggling actor whose career is starting to take off and who is also performance poet. These secondary characters complement the leading characters, rounding out a plot that approaches issues of love in subjective and objective tones.At her appearance this past April in Oakland, Bryant-Woolridge talked about what she wanted to convey in this novel. How people come into our lives, challenge us, change us and the different kinds of love that are available to us and the need for all them in our lives. How those that love us should be willing to share us with others that we love. Admittedly in a perfect world, this would be ideal; there is a lot of love to be shared. But would your mate understand the need for you to have another person in your life that makes you happy? This book will no doubt spark debate about the age old debate regarding men and women being \\"friends\\". This reviewer is pleased to have given this book a try, sold by the author's eloquent sales pitch, not relegating it to just one more interracial story that has saturated the market. This is so much more as this book allows readers to look past the superficial things that trip us up in such a story. A big plus for this novel was the poetry of Teddy Bell that was sprinkled throughout the book. The handsome Bell, who accompanied Bryant-Woolridge at the reading and recited some of his poems, is possibly the inspiration and model for Griffin character who has the same last name. This book has been declared one for the top chick-lit reads of 2004 and is a worthwhile read. I am looking forward to Bryant-Woolridge's next offering.Dera WilliamsAPOOO BookClub"},{"Title":"Hitts & Mrs.","review":"I have dark circles under my eyes this afternoon for pulling an all-nighter to read this book!!!

But I had a problem with it towards the end. I don't buy the character Mel's denial that she had an affair with John. (...) . John and Mel had an emotional affair. I do believe you can love two people at once. I also don't think Mel would have liked it if Will, her on and off again fianc&eacute; found someone he connected to in ways he couldn't with her. I couldn't understand how she thought everyone should just chill and see things the way she sees them. I just didn't like the hypocrisy of the her character, that at times came off as self-righteous. She had no empathy for John's wife and what she must be going through in discovering that her husband also loves another woman. And please, I'm so tired of the line: I'm not in love with him, I just love him. That's such a cop out in not taking responsiblity.I also think the author took the easy way out by making the character Candy lose everything. Because she's sleeps around with married men and is materialistic it's okay that she gets hers. She's expendable. I think the novel would have been much stronger if Mel paid the price for her relationship with John. Her story ended so clich&eacute; with a fairy tale happily ever after. I just didn't buy it."},{"Title":"Hitts & Mrs.","review":"This was not a romance novel by any stretch of the imagination. What we have in this book is a mentor/mentee relationship.

The flow was well paced and the main character Melanie Hitts was well developed as well as John.I found the subplots (which is essential to a good story about contemporary life as most folks have more than one thing going on at a time) to be a great diversion from the storyline when, at times, you just had to step back from John and Melanie so as to be able to really ponder what they were doing-was it right or wrong.I recommend the read for someone who wants to wrap their minds around something with some texture while traveling etc...Ms. Woolridge-Bryant did a great job and I look forward to reading more of her offerings."},{"Title":"Hitts & Mrs.","review":"I thought it was nicely written with very interesting characters.

Well, this book explores their feelings in depth. I truly believed they were in love, yet they knew they would not be together. I also liked that every storyline (especially Candace and Griffin) didn't end up in a nice way with everything wrapped in a pretty bow.

Love isn't always tidy and all of the characters Will, John, Sharon, Griffin and Candace define love differently and deal with it differently. Even at the end, there are some open questions about love that despite her journey Melanie couldn't answer. That too was like real life. This is a really good book.

The book covers the Army of Northern Virginia fairly well and in a very detailed manner, but for this reason, I felt the author sometimes digressed a bit from Stuart's story. Nevertheless, the parts about Stuart are definately colorful. Includes many of Stuart's letters to his wife during the war, as well as some interesting stories about the people around him. Also includes some interesting ink sketches by the author."},{"Title":"Jeb Stuart","review":"As a military officer and artist Thomason presents a unique view of a most complex and larger-than-life Civil War legend in this reprinted version of his original book (? 40's).

It trails off often about battles, and if you want information, you really have to look for it."},{"Title":"little town on the prairie","review":"It's wonderful to see how my children love listening to these books over and over, now that we've been collecting the CDs. The little details really stick in their heads, and have been surprisingly useful tidbits of information on several occasions, as they hear or read other things that relate!When I first bought the CDs, I was unsure about Cherry Jones' accent, but it just brings a nice, down-home aspect to the reading. Of course, the readings are unabridged - the only way to go, I think!My favorite part of the CDs, though, is hearing the songs, often accompanied by a fiddle. As a child, I remember skipping over the songs as I encountered them in the text, especially those I didn't know, and it has really added to the experience of the books to hear an actual tune for them. Often, the songs reflect the mood of the moment exceptionally well. Cherry Jones sings them out (usually as Pa!) in her low alto voice, and you do really have to hear a few of them to get used to it, but we love them."},{"Title":"little town on the prairie","review":"What shocks me in retrospect is how young Laura Ingalls was when she was given so much responsibility. As this novel of life in growing DeSmet the spring and summer after the long winter shows, Laura at age fifteen was already in possession of a license to teach school, and she was being courted by a man well into his twenties. I think just how young fifteen is escaped me back during my first reading when I was nine. This book tells about Mary's preparations for enrollment at a college for the blind, about Laura's becoming a teacher, about the boon to the family well-being the acquisition of a kitten is, and as always is the case in the Little House books, it charms us with its positive reflection of life in frontier America."},{"Title":"little town on the prairie","review":"I have to admit that I never really cared to much about this series.

If you're reading these books out loud to your kids, do yourself, your voice, and your children a favor and listen to the audio books featuring Cherry Jones. Outstanding! (If pricing seems high to your budget check out your local library. We've borrowed most of them but I'm buying this one)."},{"Title":"little town on the prairie","review":"I'm now starting to get into my favorite books of the Little House on the Prairie series. For those of you not familiar with the series, they were written by Laura Ingalls Wilder about her life growing up with her Ma, Pa, and sisters while traveling to different home sites. They traveled from the Big Woods of Wisconsin, to Indian Territory, to Minnesota and then finally to the town of De Smet further west. They encountered many hardships but stuck together as a family.This book they are still in DeSmet and it is the summer after the hard winter in which there were blizzards for seven months. They have returned to their land and the claim shanty to begin farming their piece of land when Pa decides that they will go back to town for the winter. While the winter is much milder there is a new sadness for them. Mary will be moving away to go to a College for the blind and Laura must begin studying hard in order to go be a schoolteacher so she can help provide money to keep Mary in school. There are so many things to distract her though, parties, socials, literaries, and the handsome Almanzo Wilder has started taking an interest in her. On the flip side though, her old nemesis from Plum Creek, Nellie Oleson, has moved to the same town and continued to be her rotten self. With all this going on, its hard to say if Laura will be prepared to teach school when she turns sixteen.The characters (I call them such since they are somewhat embellished) are well described. Laura really grows in this book and its nice to see her make the transition from child to young woman. Although I do have to say the descriptions of corsets and hoop skirts make me cringe. Mary is largely absent from the book since she's in college but they do give her mention and Carrie plays a small part. Poor Grace though is hardly mentioned. What I especially liked was that this was the book Almanzo started taking an interested in Laura and it was fun to see the courtship as it was in those times.The writing is perfect for children but not too juvenile for adults to read. Wilder really makes you feel as if you are living in those times. However, I do have to note that there is potentially some offensive things in this book. Ma still doesn't like Indians, but what really stood out is a scene in which Laura describes a play put on at a literary function when they played \\"darkies\\" and danced around. I could be construing it the wrong way, but it definitely could offend. If this scene were removed though, the book would be near perfect.I've always enjoyed reading these books as a child and adult and as I said before this book starts the favorite of my series because of the addition of Almanzo. I'm always a sucker for a romance, even in a kid's novel I guess.Little Town on the PrairieCopyright 1941307 pagesReview by M.

Laura, though she would rather do anything but become a school teacher and though she hates the idea of Mary leaving to go to school far away, begins to study earnestly to earn her certificate so that she can help send Mary to the school for the blind. Her life isn't all study, though. She still enjoys playing outdoors near their claim, going to social gatherings with her family and new school friends and even attending the exciting horse races with Pa. Best of all, perhaps, she catches the eye of a young man in town! To Laura's delight and confusion, Almanzo Wilder, the owner of two beautiful brown horses, chooses to escort her home! Life in the Ingalls family certainly undergoes many changes in this book but its underlying message of the importance of family ties and moral living remain the same. Though I don't think it's the best book in the series, it is charming and often funny and I enjoyed listening to it very much!"},{"Title":"little town on the prairie","review":"I received the little House collection and I have started reading the first of the collection.

After a difficult winter full of one blizzard after another, Laura is happy to be back on the claim shanty with her family, away from the hustle and bustle of town. But she knows that her family will most certainly head back to De Smet to live in the shop before winter comes again, to protect them from the harsh weather that may lie ahead. Weather aside, however, Laura can't believe how many new things are arising. Especially the most important one of all - changes for Mary.Laura couldn't be happier to be back in school again. After so many months of studying on her own, she is thrilled to be back in the classroom with her old friends Mary and Minnie, and Ida. But there's someone new in the classroom. A person from Laura's past who makes Laura shake with anger - Nellie Oleson. Laura, however, is determined to ignore the nasty Nellie and study as hard as she possibly can in order to gain her teaching certificate, and help to send Mary to college. But even without her being a part of the workforce, Mary is able to go off to college, and Laura couldn't be happier - or more devastated. But seeing how much Mary loves college, Laura resolves to study even harder, and begin earning the money to assist in keeping her there. Of course, Laura never imagined that things could possibly stand in her way. Such as the selfish new schoolteacher who thrives on taunting and humiliating both Laura and Carrie in front of the other students; and working as a seamstress in town. But the most shocking of all, is Almanzo Wilder's sudden interest in young Laura. Almanzo is a handsome fellow, whose Morgan horses are the talk of the town, and now Almanzo seems to have taken a fancy to Laura - something that leaves her confused and excited at the same time. But no matter what, she must remember to continue her studies, or else Mary may have to return home before her education is complete.It seems strange to bear witness as someone ages, but that is exactly what readers have had the opportunity to do as Laura Ingalls grows in age, height, and maturity. The love she holds for her family is so refreshing and charming, and truly keeps the reader's interest peaked; while the constant maturity Laura displays in each and every one of her decisions is just unbelievable. Laura has completely grown up before our eyes, and each year she just becomes more and more lovable. The inclusion of facts regarding the changes taking place during this era are interesting, and present a fun learning experience for readers; while the sudden budding romances springing up around the young people of De Smet indicates just how much older these characters have become. Almanzo Wilder has grown on me over the past few books, and I love reading the scenes where he is present; and Nellie Oleson, as nasty as she is, will always remain a fun character whom you absolutely love to hate, but hate to love. This series just gets better and better!Erika SoroccoFreelance Reviewer"},{"Title":"little town on the prairie","review":"i ordered Little TOWN on the prairie for a good friend. i got little HOUSE on the prairie, because they are a sweet and wonderful person, my firend didnt mind, turns out they needed that one too. but it wouldve been nice to get the product i ACTUALLY ordered!!!!!! i was extremely disappointed with this order and the product i got!!!!!"},{"Title":"little town on the prairie","review":"I really wanted \\"The Little House on the Prarie\\" and carelessly ordered this instead.

Part of this was of course due to her youth, but as Laura moves into womanhood, she is able to enjoy and do more things, and be treated more as an adult, including getting jobs to help raise funds for her sister to go to a college for the blind. Town life is also emphasized here, as opposed to living in the big woods and the prairie. And lo and behold, here's Nellie Oleson again! Yes, really! And she has the same bratty attitude as well, which makes for some rather entertaining parts in this book. Overall a great book in the Little House series, if you've enjoyed the other books you will enjoy this one too. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"little town on the prairie","review":"Like many readers, I enjoyed watching Laura grow up: putting her hair up and letting her dresses down, attending her first boy-girl party, and house-sitting for a week while Ma and Pa saw Mary safely off to college. Laura had good work ethic, and academic diligence beyond most girls her age. She sacrificed much of her spare time to study hard enough to get teaching certification. Though she did not especially want to become a teacher, she was determined to earn money for Mary's college tuition. I liked Laura best when her fun or fiesty side showed itself. She couldn't help laughing her head off when two town drunks made a fairly innocuous scene in public, and she was playful at recess when the boys wanted to take the girls for sled rides. She fiercely stood up to her teacher (and sister-in-law in the future!) when that woman was mean to little sister Carrie. In Little Town, Laura also learned about the repercussions of gossip, and how to remain neutral but respectful when caught in the middle of others' conflicts. She experienced the excitement of literaries, potluck dinner fundraisers, and the attentions of the older handsome Almanzo. One of my favorite things about this book was the way in which Laura and Mary bonded during long walks. They talked about their sibling rivalry as kids. They were able to talk about Laura's resentment toward such a 'good' older sister, and Mary's secret enjoyment of her role and others' praise. For years, Mary did chide Laura for not being absolutely literal when she described things, but Laura's knack for metaphor and simile led HER to lay the foundations for these wonderful books. I think both girls did much growing during the final books of the series, Mary in capability and Laura in self-confidence. It was a joy to read about the entire family's changes, and about the excitement of living in a fast-growing town."},{"Title":"little town on the prairie","review":"This is a great story in this series. I love reading about the little kitten that they got. I also like reading about Lauras new job."},{"Title":"little town on the prairie","review":"The town of De Smet is filled with relief! The long horrible winter is finally over. Everyone is so happy to be able to have fun outside and to eat real meals again!The Ingalls family is back out on the claim and Laura is thrilled! She loves to run through the grass and help Pa with the chores.The book starts with Laura accepting a job in town. She is uncertain about how she will handle being cooped up inside all day, but she is eager to earn money for Mary's schooling.Fourth of July comes and Pa takes Laura and Carrie into town for the celebration. The town is bursting with activity. The girls are nervous about being in such a crowd, but they are excited to drink fresh cool lemonade and to watch the horse races.All too soon it is time for Mary to attend college. They all know how wonderful it will be for her and how happy she will be to be learning and growing in a world that teaches her how to live blind. All of these good things do not diminish the aches in their hearts as they bid sweet, gentle, thoughtful Mary good-bye.When Laura and Carrie start school again, they are dismayed to see Nellie Olson appear! They do not want to have to deal with her again. True to form, Nellie causes trouble, which makes this section of the book very entertaining. Laura is such a spitfire that it is fun to read of her adventures.This winter in town is a far cry from their last winter. This winter brings laughter and gaiety in the form of name cards, literaries, a birthday party and rides with Almonzo with his beautiful Morgan horses.'Little Town on the Prairie' is a delightful book. It is interesting, entertaining and often funny. You will enjoy it! I enthusiastically recommend you add it to your collection!"},{"Title":"little town on the prairie","review":"This (and Happy Golden Years) is my favorite book of the Little House series. The Ingalls family is doing well; the town has recovered from the Hard Winter; and Laura is changing from a girl into a woman. The descriptions of the characters and the surroundings are vivid and real. I don't care if Rose Wilder Lane wrote most of the books or not - the Little House series is a gift to all readers, not just young readers! I'm in my 30's and I still love to read them periodically, but this is one of my very favorites."},{"Title":"little town on the prairie","review":"Twenty four years ago, I was a ten year old girl who saved every last penny to save $35.00 to buy the Little House on The Prairie boxed set by Laura Ingalls Wilder. It was my love of the TV show that started the savings venture...I heard it was based on a true story and I needed to know all the details. What happened when I received those books, and read them one after another that year changed me into a fan of the show, into a full fledge Laura Ingalls Wilder enthusiast. Why? Because of the simple beauty of the pioneer tales within. Stories that show that even when things are worse than you or I can imagine, family and faith still bring hope and contentment. Little Town on the Prairie is one of my two favorite stories. Even as a ten year old I loved watching Laura turn into a lady in this story. Its been several years since I read this one, and taking a break from my regular readings seemed a good idea. I noticed that I picked up new little things this time around. I can read different things into that meeting with Almonzo where he and Laura change cards, I can feel the shame and tension in the school house scene where Laura defends Carrie to Ms. Wilder (I think I felt this horror anew from a parents perspective) and I also noticed Ma's prejudices against the Indians more keenly as well. There was a scene I even felt uncomfortable with. In a social gathering at the school, some of the town's men dressed in black paint and acted like \\"darkies\\" to the amusement of the audience. I think Laura herself, would flinch from that in this day and age. But again, it only emphasizes the times the Ingalls family were living in, and how far this country has come. The country has made mistakes along the way (slavery and the Trail of Tears, for example). But where we are now is in no little part, due to the efforts of the brave pioneers like the Ingalls family. This is a historical, christian, pre-romance, and tale of growing from child to woman all in one and there is no doubt in my mind, why this remains a beloved story to children and adults everywhere today."},{"Title":"little town on the prairie","review":"First let me say that I read this in the full-color collector's edition, and it was lovely. Thick, glossy pages that could withstand much \\"love\\" and Garth Williams' lovely drawings enhanced with color. Very nice.In Little Town on the Prairie, Laura is about 15 and the Ingalls family spends most of the narrative in the town of DeSmet, South Dakota. Laura has adapted to town life (compare her discomfort at being surrounded by strangers in By the Shores of Silver Lake) and is experiencing life as a young lady in frontier society in the 1880's. The period detail is rich and rewarding in this book, and in its own way, Little Town shows Laura struggling with the need to \\"fit in\\" with her peers, just as every teenager experiences today. For Laura, it's having a chance to select her own printed \\"name cards\\" and exchange them with her friends. ($0.25 for a dozen cards, a princely sum by Ingalls' standards). She also experiences a bit of evil glee at seeing the tables turned on Nellie Oleson, who is now the poor country girl. On the other hand, we see Laura work steadfastly at a hated job of sewing sleeves on men's shirts, because of her dedication to giving Mary a chance to attend college for the blind. She also dedicates herself to studying for a teacher's license so she can further supplement the family's income, and at the end of the book achieves her goal, via a lie of omission (something that Ma surely would have disapproved!).In a remarkable section, Laura describes sewing an elegant winter dress for Mary to wear at college, and then casually tosses in that they made a hat to go with it! How on earth does one make a hat, and isn't it remarkable that Laura Ingalls Wilder didn't think hat-making merited any special mention?We also see the intellectual side of Ma and Pa, as they go head-to-head in a fierce spelling bee competition. Pa is primarly a businessman in Little Town, which is a delightful contrast to his handyman skills that were so prominently on display in the earlier Little House volumes. Pa also delights in creating Literary Society productions for Friday nights in town. There is a queasy-making (by modern standards) chapter describing a blackface show, which may provoke some important discussions between parents and children. Ma is ever the conscientious molder of young women's behavior; it's a thankless job but someone has to do it.Finally, Little Town is where Laura begins to be courted by Almanzo Wilder. He walks her home from the Literary Society several times, and gives her a sleighride behind his glorious team of horses. Tame stuff by modern standards, but Ma and Pa's tightlipped and cautious acceptance of this much-older man in Laura's life tells us everything we need to know."},{"Title":"little town on the prairie","review":"Little Town on the Prairie is my favourite book out of all the \\"Little House\\" series by Laura Ingalls Wilder. I enjoyed this book more than the other books because it was happier, for there were not so many depressing times the Ingalls family had to endure.The title is self-explanatory, a little town on the prairie, which is in Dakota, USA. The story is set during the 1880's. The Ingalls family, consisting of six people, was always moving from place to place. When they came to Dakota, they were very happy with it. Their little \\"shanty\\" that they stayed in during the summer was built into a new, improved house. Mary, the oldest sister, is accepted into the college of the blind, and Laura continues school and has a summer job. Things are going very well at the Ingalls household. There is enough food for everyone, and there wasn't another hard winter, like everyone expected. Most problems have solutions like when there were gophers eating their corn, they got a cat to kill them. The only problem is school, because of the new teacher, Eliza Jane Wilder. She is Almanzo Wilder's sister. She turns out to be horribly mean to Laura and her younger sister, Carrie, because Nellie Oleson (Laura's enemy mentioned before in \\"The Banks of Plum Creek\\") told the teacher negative remarks about Laura. Soon, a new teacher replaces her. All of the problems work themselves out somehow, which is what I like about this book.In my opinion, Laura Ingalls Wilder does an exquisite job captivating all her readers with her refined choice of words, meticulous detail, and up-beat plot. This is absolutely the best piece she's written. She does an admirable job of describing the setting so it makes you feel like you're right there, witnessing the whole scene. The book also has a good balance of good times and bad times, because if it was all bad times the book would seem depressing, and if it was all good times, the book would seem hard to believe. I would recommend this book for those who enjoy realistic fiction or historical fiction. I think a possible theme for this story would be hold on, things will get better. This theme is displayed throughout all the \\"Little House\\" series. This is my all time favourite book, and I hope you enjoy it, too."},{"Title":"little town on the prairie","review":"Since I've first read this book when I was a little younger than Laura, so I was really excited to read what life was like 'back then' for kids my age.The hard winter is finally over, and the Ingalls family finally moves out to their claim, where Laura enjoys the outside work and the sunshine. But then she is offered a job as a seamstress in town, and takes it even though she misses the outdoors. The work is hard, and the environment is unpleasant, but Laura sticks it out.Ma=ry finally has a chance to go to the blind college in Iowa, and while Ma and Pa take her there, Laura, Carrie and Grace clean the house.School finally begins again, and an unpleasant surprise comes along on the first day - Nellie Oleson from Plum Creek, who schemes and causes trouble. The high point of this situation is the troble between Laura and Ms. Wilder, the teacher, who only hears unpleasant things about Laura from Nellie, and Laura's short temper, especially where Carrie is concerned, does not help the situation... But Ida, the new girl, is nice enough to make up for Nellie's unpleasantness.Laura is grown up enough to want fashionable cloths and all other fashionable things other girls her age in school have, such as name cards. She is invited to parties and attends her first evening sociable.We start seeing the relationship between Laura and Almanzo Wilder start developing (even though I think her relationship with his sister, her unpleasant ex - school teacher, might give things an interesting twist)."},{"Title":"little town on the prairie","review":"I have recently started listening/collecting the Little House series on CD. This one, so far, has been my favorite. After finishing it the first time, I had no qualms about immediately plugging in CD 1 again!The book begins with Pa asking Laura, \\"How would ya like to work in town?\\" and thus begins Laura's career as an assistant shirt-maker. It is hard work for one who hates to sit still, but the money she is making for Mary's college education keeps her going. Eventually, the work ends and life goes on in a leisurely way that summer. They celebrate the Fourth of July, and Laura vows to one day ride behind Almanzo Wilder's Morgan horses. I especially loved how Cherry Jones read the Declaration of Independence.Mary does get to go to college in this book, and Miss Wilder comes to teach school. On the first day of school, who should show up but Nellie Olsen! Of course, that always makes the story interesting. It doesn't take long for the reader to find out that Miss Wilder is totally ineffectual at keeping order in the schoolroom. However, she seems to find pleasure at punishing Laura and Carrie (the ONLY students she EVER reprimands in any way) for things totally inconsequential. The children soon find great pleasure in irritating and mocking \\"Lazy, Lousy Lizzy Jane\\". One thing that Nellie Olsen brings \\"from the east\\" (or so she says) is the exchanging of name cards. Pa realizes how much Laura would like to have these, and so gives her the money to buy them. On the day that she picks them up, who should offer her a ride back to school but Almanzo Wilder and his team of Morgan horses! She tells him of her reason for going to the newspaper office, and he, in turn, shows her his name card. Not knowing what to do with it exactly, Laura asks him if he wants his card back. He says no, so she feels obligated to give him one of hers (after all, Nellie said that you must EXCHANGE them). I thought that part was very sweet.Eventually, Laura feels life settling into a rut. As the rest of the townspeople were feeling the same way, they set out to form a \\"literary society\\". Basically, everyone gets together every Friday night for some form of entertainment or another. The first night is a spelling bee, with everyone in town participating. Each literary just got better and better, and soon everyone was buzzing with excitement over them. This starts other exciting things happening, such as a New England Supper given on Thanksgiving night and a birthday party for one of the boys at school. Life continues on in a merry way, and the revival meetings came. Laura and her family attended faithfully every night, for \\"those who don't go to revival are ATHEISTS\\" (or so declars Nellie Olsen). It is at this time that Laura has the unexpected pleasure of Almanzo Wilder asking her every night \\"May I see ya home?\\"At the end of the school year, Laura gives a fine recitation of the history of the US. It happens that a man looking for a schoolteacher for his town is there. The next day, he arrives unexpectedly to ask Laura to be their teacher! She takes the examination and receives her teaching certificate. This is what she has been waiting and working for so long in order to help pay for Mary's college education.It is here that the book ends. I can't wait for the next one to come out. How will she do teaching at her first school? Will Almanzo Wilder continue to pursue her, or will the distance be too much?"},{"Title":"little town on the prairie","review":"I am a 54 year old man and just started reading these books to my grand children and I was really interested in the differences between the series and the books.It does not matter as to how old or young you are, get the whole series as I did and you will imagine you are living with the Ingalls on the prarie. I could not put them down. BUY THEM ALL"},{"Title":"little town on the prairie","review":"(...) But this next book, Little Town on the Prairie, is outstanding. The Ingalls have a short winter this year and everything seems to go right. But like we all know, even though we are warm and fed, problems just seem to come along. Now that Laura is 14 and 15 years old, she learns to care about and appreciate other people besides just her immediate family. She likes Ida, Cap, Mary Power and Minnie. She goes to a fancy birthday party for a boy named Frank. We see that she is becoming a beautiful young lady and she starts describing clothes and hairstyles in detail.She even buys the latest thing - name cards. And when she sees Almonzo,she says \\"I was just picking up my name cards\\". MY name cards. Like she was so totally in fashion forever. She is very smart and can do long division in her head. There are many fun social occasions in this book and some exciting power struggles with the teacher, Eliza Jane(Almonzo's sister), Nellie Oleson, etc. This is absolutely the most enjoyable book in the series. But I said that last time. Next will be \\"These Happy Golden Years\\". It can't be better than this one, but I've just got to see what happens! I can't close without again mentioning how much you learn in this book. This book teaches social history. You learn how to operate a corsett, hoop skirt, and what a lunatic fringe is, and how to curl your hair without a curling iron. You find out what to do when plagued by blackbirds and gophers, what to do when you're \\"home alone\\", and how to behave at your first paying job. This book is the beginning of the end of the little Ingalls family. Mary goes away to college, and soon Laura will become a teacher. We all have to face it sooner or later, our children will grow up. See how an ideal family handles it, with grace and love."},{"Title":"little town on the prairie","review":"As a teacher, I utilize the Little House audiobooks on a regular basis. So far, all of the other audiobooks have been tracked logically, based on chapter. However, the tracks on this CD set were organized rather haphazardly: chapters end and new chapters begin within a single track, without rhyme or reason. This may seem a minor detail, but to a teacher who assigns daily chapter readings, it's a real annoyance!"},{"Title":"little town on the prairie","review":"Little Town on the Prairie, by Laura Ingalls WilderAfter the long, long winter the shining sun warmed the Dakota prairie. The Ingalls moved back to their shanty on their claim, and life continued. Work took up all their time in the spring. Pa had a new plow for breaking the prairie sod; it spared the horses, and Pa too. After the planting was done Pa and Laura built the missing part of the claim shanty; now there was two bedrooms. There is a new problem in the cornfield; gophers ate half of the kernels. A good cat would help here. Pa loses some of his hair to a mouse. The many new settlers resulted in the need to organize a county. When Pa returned he brought a kitten for them to raise. Pa worked as a carpenter in town building the new church. Laura hoped she could get a job teaching school when she turned sixteen. Pa could not hunt game, but could only buy meat. Mrs. Brant would give a setting of eggs, so they would have chickens (if hawks or weasels or foxes didn't get them). Better times were coming! Their little kitty killed its first mouse. Pa tells Laura she could work in town sewing shirts for bachelors. Laura had never seen a store that sold only dry goods. She also saw another type of family life. Laura also saw two drunken men.After six weeks of work, Laura experienced a lay-off. The Ingalls got 14 chicks, a gift from Mrs. Boast. The Fourth of July starts with a \\"BOOM\\", and Laura walks to town with Pa and Carrie (Chapter 8). They hear firecrackers and a speech. There is a threat from \\"Spanish needle grass\\", and blackbirds are eating the shocked oats. \\"Earthly life is a battle\\" said Ma (p.89). Chapter 9 tells of the complications in women's dresses. The blackbirds were devouring their corn and oats. Pa shot as many as he could, and they found they were good to eat. The new school year sees Mary going away to a college in Iowa. Laura and Carrie return to the town school, and note how it has grown in the last year. Laura is surprised to find Nellie Oleson at school! Nellie puts on airs, but Pa tells Laura that Mr. Oleson lost his business and is just like the other homesteaders (p.135). In the fall they picked and packed vegetables for winter in town. The town was prepared for a harsh winter. But little Carrie was thin and pale. The new teacher Miss Wilder seemed to favor Nellie Oleson. There is trouble, and Laura and Carrie are sent home from school by the teacher. The children resent this teacher, and were disorderly. Nellie was two-faced (p.172).One morning Almanzo offers Laura a ride to school, and they exchange name cards. The people in town start a literary society for their entertainment and education. Pa Ingalls suggests a formal organization could get in the way of the functions (Chapter 18). They chose sides for a spelling match. On Thanksgiving they attend a church supper. In late March they are entertained by a minstrel show. The new grass shows in April, and so does a surprise blizzard. Two newcomers from the East were lost (they did not dig into a haystack). Kitty caught more gophers, and some blackbirds. Mr. Owen, the new teacher, taught Willie Oleson to do better in school. The Ingalls family goes to the revival meeting. Almanzo walks Laura home from the revival meeting every night. Laura was invited to a sleigh ride. They celebrate their first Christmas without Mary, and feel sad. Laura meets Mr. Brewster, who is looking for a new teacher in their district, and wants Laura! Laura accepts this job offer, contingent upon getting a teaching certificate. The Superintendent of School tests and passes Laura to teach. Laura will start next week. Pa is on the school board, and knows Mr. Brewster."},{"Title":"little town on the prairie","review":"In this exciting tale of Ingalls, Laura and Mary grow up. Everyone is looking forward to Mary getting to attend the college for the blind in Iowa with a little help from her family. Now the Ingallses are moving from the Dakota prairie to the growing town while Laura gathers her courage to study. One night she meets and falls in love with a beloved horserider, Almanzo Wilder. But she keeps her feelings secret. In the meantime, Laura is relieved when she was one of the few people who would get a teacher's certificate.I believe that the characters of this story had so much detail I couldn't put the book down. Yes, it was more exciting than going to Great America. The charcters talk so you feel like their conversation happened yesterday. Yes, the cover is excellent.

Laura's feud with her unfair teacher (and future sister-in-law!) is hilarious!

Nellie wants to ride behind Almanzo Wilder's beautiful horses, but Laura ends up *marrying* the guy! (Not in this book, but you can pretty much see where it's going.) And the baby kitten, and Mary's desire to go to college and Laura's desire to sacrifice for that goal....Well, this is just a good, good book."},{"Title":"little town on the prairie","review":"When Eliza Jane was the teacher, in the beginning the kids were nice.

I think people should read this book to find out what happend when Eliza Jane was the teacher, and about how Mary went to college. Mom likes how they cleaned the house when the parents went away. Even Grace &quot;helped.&quot; And she likes the parts where Laura and Almanzo got to know each other."},{"Title":"little town on the prairie","review":"More adventures of the Ingalls family, full of the loving details that make these stories come alive.

I mostly agree with the other positive reviews here. But there is a teaching moment in this book that should not be overlooked. The parents in this book are paragons of virtue, and their behavior matches the highest standards - standards of 1880, not 2006. There is a short scene during one of the \\"literaries\\" where several men perform in blackface. Although it occurs with innocent intent, modern readers might find it in questionable taste if they don't allow for the historical context.If they're smart, parents and teachers will embrace this as an opportunity to open a discussion with children about changing standards, and the work it took to improve those standards."},{"Title":"Poil de Carotte","review":"...but the best thing I can say about this book is that it didn't take very long to read.

It is in this book that he famously defines love as \\"the drive toward the unity of the separated\\" (25). He also refers to love as the moving power of life and believes all love includes qualities of eros and agape.Tillich does not believe that one can speak of self-love in anything more than a metaphorical sense. After all, if love is the drive toward the reunion of the separated, it is difficult to speak meaningfully of self-love.In his exposition of the nature of power Tillich notes that love is the foundation, not the negation, of power. Love is the ultimate principle of justice, although justice preserves what love unites. \\"The basic assertion about the relation of God to love, power and justice is made, if one says that God is Being-itself\\" (109). However, everything that one says about Being-itself, must be said symbolically."},{"Title":"Love, power, and justice;: Ontological analyses and ethical applications","review":"Calvin O. Schrag (emeritus, Purdue University), while a graduate student at Harvard in the 1950s, was Paul Tillich's assistant. He humorously observed that Tillich was considered by some narrow-minded academics to be a &quot;thinker, not a philosopher.&quot; _Love, Power, and Justice_, now celebrating its 50th birthday from original publication, is a short volume that integrates Tillich's passions in philosophy, especially existential thought, and Christian theology. The result is in an exciting synthesis of strands of 20th century thought.I had long desired to do a careful read of this text, so I assigned it to my Ethics class. We went through it, chapter by chapter, and discussed the relevance of each of the volume's three major concepts to our core course concepts: philosophy, critical thinking, freedom, responsibility, and political justice. I believe that the text served its purpose quite well, and would use it again in a course. Teaching it gave me a deeper insight into the mind of Tillich as well as the important ethical concepts of love, power, and justice."},{"Title":"Love, power, and justice;: Ontological analyses and ethical applications","review":"I came across this book while searching for an answer to the question of how--if power comes from God--it can so often be used to destroy works of love and justice. Tillich shows that when power is separated from its ontological oneness with love and justice, it's another example of our alienation from God--of our free will at work in the worst way.\\"Ontological\\" means \\"the study of being.\\" Tillich says love, power and justice are united in the structure of being(using philosophical terms)or united in the heart of God (paraphrasing from his Systematic Theology--Tillich doesn't say much about God in this book).When love, power and justice are separated in a situation, it becomes unstable. \\"Being\\" (or God) is the power that drives the situation toward stability--that is, toward a situation where love, power and justice are in balance.In life, the attempt to achieve this balance is dynamic, ever-changing, shifting--sometimes creating a worsening situation, sometimes one that's improving. A Hitler may gain immense power (divorced from justice) in the short-term. Eventually, forces of resistance emerge to stop him.(Tillich doesn't try to explain why it takes so long to stop abusive situations or why so many people are hurt in the process: he was a philosopher/theologian, not God himself).There are times when love, power and justice come together in moments of transcendence. In his Systematic Theology, Tillich says that at times we experience the realm of God in a way that is \\"preliminary and in anticipation.\\"Because _Love, Power and Justice_ is based on lectures Tillich gave, it packs an incredible amount of insight into six small chapters. It is one of my all-time favorite books, highly recommended, and worth every penny."},{"Title":"Love, power, and justice;: Ontological analyses and ethical applications","review":"This classic text should be required reading for all seminary students, especially given the fact that so many Christians are uncomfortable with the notion of power. Tillich makes the point that love without power is mere sentiment, and power without justice and love is tyranny. Love, power, and justice are irreducible, indissoluble dimensions of God's own character. Thus, if we are beings created in the image and likeness of God, then love, power, and justice are intimately connected to the life we are called to lead."},{"Title":"Love, power, and justice;: Ontological analyses and ethical applications","review":"Professor Tillich uses ontology to discover the root meanings of love, power and justice. Ontology attempts to discover the common structure of everything that is. Nothing can be known without ontology because to know something is recognize it exists. Love, power and justice have an ontological dignity in that they are often used to describe the ontology of other things yet they can not be described ontologically by anything more basic.The emotional aspect of love can not be defined or commanded but is an expression of the total involvement of the being. Love is the drive to reunite with that witch has been separated. I think what Tillich means is that to love another person is to teardown the boundaries that separate us and treat the other as if it where part of the self.Love brings pleasure and happiness when fulfilled and pain and suffering when it is not fulfilled but to be motivated by the pain or pleasure is to live a corrupted life. Eros and agape are not two different types of love but two characteristics of the only one type of love. Without eros love of God becomes mere obedience of God. Phili requires familiarity with and therefore is only possible between equals. Self-love is only meaningful metaphorically for love requires separation of the subject that loves from the object of that love.Being can not be defined because every possible definition of being presupposes existence but being can be stated metaphorically as the power of being. The power of being is the power over nonbeing. Nonbeing is therefore not foreign to being. Being that contains nonbeing is finite. The self-affirmation of a being is proportional to its power of being. The power of being of an individual becomes apparent in its interactions with nature, other individuals and groups. The more centered a being is the more power of being it posses. Love is the foundation of power and \\"compulsion is the strange work of love.\\" The strange work of love is to destroy that which opposes love.An object grows by transcending itself. But in transcending itself a being risk losing itself. Justice is expressed in the form of laws. Power is expressed in the making of laws. Love is the highest principle of all justice. The law given by God is consistent with man's essential nature.The concept of God as all-powerful does not mean that God can do whatever He wants but that God is the power of being in all that is. In God love, justice and power are one."},{"Title":"Love, power, and justice;: Ontological analyses and ethical applications","review":"This book is a must for ethics and theology.

Speaking with understanding and power, he makes a basic analysis of love, power, and justice, all concepts fundamental in the mutual relations of human beings, of social groups, and of man and God. His concern is to penetrate to the essential, or ontological, foundation of the meaning of each of these words and thus to save them from the vague talk, idealism, cynicism, and sentimentality with which they are usually treated. The basic unity of love, power, and justice is affirmed and described in terms that are fresh and compelling. \\"It is one of the most thoughtful analyses of a basic problem of Christian ethics which we have had in our day.\\" -- Reinhold Niebuhr"},{"Title":"Snipe and Woodcock: Sport & Conservation","review":"If you think that snipe hunting is a joke, and are looking for a book of folklore, look elsewhere. This book is a 217-page, thorough treatment of the natural history and hunting of these game birds in Britain and Ireland. It includes about 100 B&amp;W illustrations, most of which are photographs or drawings of birds, dogs and hunters. The dust jacket has three beautiful, color illustrations of snipe (2) and woodcock (1).The author is a chartered biologist living in Scotland who had studied and published about snipe and woodcock for 25 years prior to publishing this book. The focus of the book is on hunting. There are chapters with advice about proper shotguns (double, side-by-side), gun dogs, and hunting techniques. The hunting advice, like the information provided about regional woodcock &amp; snipe abundance and migration, is specific to Britain and Ireland. However, general information about hunting techniques and the ecology of the birds will be of interest to anyone anywhere who would like to learn more about snipe or woodcock.The book is evenly split between coverage of snipe and woodcock.

All of Leo Tolstoy's great, great shorter works all in one two volume set! Leo Tolstoy was a perfect storyteller. When you look at a photo or portrait of Tolstoy in his later years, you see that lovable, wise old man who, when he is not helping others, sits on an old chair in the corner of the tavern, attracting all that pass by with his beautiful tales. He has touched many with his two great novels, War and Peace (1869) and Anna Karenina (1878), he has touched even more with his wonderful short stories. When you start reading these lovely short stories, you can just see that lovable image of the wise old Tolstoy telling a story, with his shaggy, long white beard, and his friendly eyes with a laughing fire in them burning out from beneath the bushy eyebrows smiling down at you, a small child, laughing on his knee.He was the perfect novelist, reveared by many, equally great and legendary. In his time, Dostoyevsky called him, \\"The greatest living novelist.\\" Virginia Woolf referred to Tolstoy as follows, \\"There remains the greatest of all novelists, for what else can we call the author of War and Peace?!\\"Tolstoy's short stories usually have a moral in it such as the lovely short story, \\"Where Love is, God is.\\" In that, there is a lonely old cobbler named Martin who finds God in the good deeds he does and is reminded of God's love for man.This two volume set is not perfect as it does not have Tolstoy's early 1862 masterpiece, The Cossacks. I guess that was just too big to fit into the Collected SHORTER Fiction.That is only a minor quibble. The beauty and marvel frothing and bubbling from the other stories in this precious set dwarf that complaint and make this reviewer forget of having even thought about mentioning it at all.Buy this set.

The pages are thin which makes reading difficult for the older reader."},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"Alistair MacLeod's \\"No Great Mischief\\" is a beautifully written, and terribly melancholy, story of Canadian Scots. Any number of times, you will well-up with tears, as you read about one sad episode after another, of life-changing misfortunes (mostly self-caused) that wreak havoc on the far flung, but emotionally and fiercely close clan MacDonald.My only complaint about this book is that the story as a whole doesn't really go anywhere. It's like reading a series of excellently serialized chapters published every Monday in The Globe and Mail newspaper in Toronto, or more likely, in the Halifax, Nova Scotia Chronicle Herald. The 43 short chapters are indeed well-connected, however, and never vary from the overall theme of immigration, hardship, family love and cohesion, together with individual and group despair. Despite the additions and deletions of various characters over the course of the story (birth, death, marriage, friendship), you could, in other words, pick up the story at Chapter 13 or Chapter 31 and become totally engrossed without knowing what came before or after. That's how I read it: two or three or four chapters at a time, often putting the book down for days after reading 30 pages or so. To achieve this, the author indulges in some repetition. It isn't a page-turner, no matter how gorgeous the writing is. In fact, it's quite a slow-moving story, by design, and one must accept the rhythm of the story-teller. The structure of the story and its narration are part and parcel of the ethnicity and now-extinct way of life on display in the tale.The main character and first person narrator, Alexander, a 40s something orthodontist, is rather dull, actually, in deliberate (literary, I suppose) contrast to virtually every other person in the story. All of the 15 or so primary characters are really distinct and unique.The touching part of the story is its absolute and unfailing dedication to \\"family and blood,\\" to clannish pride and prejudice, and to acceptance of fate, but with gratitude toward life itself.Page 56, \\"'She was descended from the original Calum Ruadh dog,' said grandpa when he heard the news, pouring himself a water glass full of whisky which he drank without a flinch. \`The one who swam after the boat when they were leaving Scotland. It was in those dogs to care too much and to try too hard.'\\"Page 176, \\"'It is difficult for a man ever to give advice to his father. Even if you try to think of him as just another man he is still your father and you are his child, regardless of how old you have become.'\\" All of us are better when we're loved, we readers are told, time and time again. It's true, and this book reveals many such truths.Though the scenes at the Canadian Shield mine location are fantastic, there is way too much death, violence, alcohol, and just plain bad behavior by way too many characters in the story for me to readily identify with any of them, except for perhaps \\"grandma and grandpa,\\" Alexander's father's mother and father - who raised his sister and him from age 3, and also his maternal grandfather. Both Alexander and his sister are, it seems, kind of half-dead and quite uninteresting - in part because of the life they themselves chose, an upscale, educated sanitized existence, far away from the grubby family roots of their siblings and grandparents.I did not like the final 40 pages - at all. Calum's crime and subsequent trial seemed contrived. Yes, it is fiction, but by the time I got to these ending pages, I didn't appreciate that contrivance. But, MacLeod had to tie all the loose ends up somehow, giving an explanation for the Calum's wasted life and Alexander's feelings of guilt.There's a sense of Ernest Hemmingway here, in MacLeod's parsimonious prose. It's also a kind of Canadian history lesson about the 1960s and 1970s, and of those who came from Scotland so long ago to Cape Breton, Nova Scotia.It's a 4 on Amazon's rating scale, and the reason I rate it that highly is because the author is a superb story-teller, and his writing is lyrical and very easy to read."},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"\\"We are all better when we are loved\\" - this is an oft-repeated phrase throughout this book, and one that resonates with the reader until the last page. The characters in this book were so alive, all the more so because of the time the author took to peel off their layers so that we could see them more clearly. Calum, the older brother, who, through a twist of fate, lived a life unimaginably more difficult than the narrator. Grandpa, who brought lightness and sexuality to this extraordinary tale. Throughout the entire story lies the thread of family and heritage, along with it's supreme importance throughout our lives. Being part Scot, so many of the euphemisms in this novel were familiar - I remember my father repeating them to me often. If he were still alive, I'm sure he would enjoy reading this story as much as I did. Don't read this novel because you are looking for a happy ending - you won't get one.

The life of the main character is touched by many of his relatives and we are able to become closely acquainted with many of them. The tragedies that befall family members touch us; deeply at times. We know that there is a pathos to the story right from the beginning as MacLeod jumps back and forth in time (sometimes going centuries in a single bound). Through it all, our narrator is witness to many things and it is his remarkable ability to bear witness that is the success of the book.The problem with &quot;No Great Mischief&quot; is that it trys to do and be too much. The story is best when the narrator witnesses an event. This enables him to share his feelings. There are too many places when the narrator tells of what had been told to him. This makes him &quot;create&quot; the feelings of others and he is much better when he sticks to his own. In addition, the author seems to be in search of a greater theme for his story. We are given scenes from Scottish Highlander history that are, apparently, &quot;recreated&quot; in a modern way; at least that's what I THINK the author was trying to do. The title comes from a quote out of the Battle of Quebec in the 1700's about aScottish military unit in the battle. I understood it to mean that the British general was dismissing the importance of his Scottish Highlanders. I understood that to mean that we were given a glimpse of the lives of people whom the world would otherwise dismiss as unimportant. All of this is fine but it is not necessary because the book stands better without it. On the other hand, those proud of their Scottish ancestry are free to disagree with this point. Read it and see what you think. I assure you, this is a book well worth reading."},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"It is amazing how many stories one can pack into a day. Alistair McLeod let's his protagonist's mind wander through the lifetime of several generations in just a few hours. What emerges is the absorbing family history and much more.At one level this novel is the story of Alexander MacDonald, his twin sister and their older brothers, belonging to a family of tremendous loyalty and commitment, steeped in tradition and history. We follow them from early childhood when tragedy befalls them, leaving them orphans, through their adolescent years and to adulthood.At a deeper level, it is a testament to 'blood is thicker than water'. The MacDonalds trace their roots back to the legendary Calum Ruadh (&quot;the red Calum&quot;) and his brood of 12 children who arrived in the New World in the 1770s as one of the early settler families in Cape Breton.The descendents of the founding father, Alexander and his siblings, remain cocooned in the close-knit family, protected by the strength of family ties and values which help them through the sometimes painful dramas in their lives. The past stays vividly in the minds of all its members; the grandparents reminding the younger generation constantly through stories of lives lived. Time seems &quot;to compress and expand almost simultaneously&quot;; events are repeated to allow the author to present them from different perspectives. Convictions are expressed almost like mottos throughout the novel: &quot;Always look after your own blood&quot; or &quot;We are all better when we're loved&quot;.While Alexander and his sister, living in the relative comfort of their grandparents' home, are encouraged and financially supported in their academic ambitions, the older brothers have to fend for themselves. Poverty is their primary school as they struggle to keep themselves and the farm alive. For the young twins a visit to the brothers is always an adventure where no grown-ups rules apply. McLeod portrays the different characters well - reflecting the particular affection that Alexander has for the grandparents. Most intriguing is the other grandfather, a quiet and withdrawn man, who lives by himself having lost wife and only daughter through tragedies. Despite his doubts about himself stemming also from the stigma of being a single mother's child whose father died before he was born, he exudes strength and compassion and plays an increasingly important balancing role in the life of the family.To escape increasing financial difficulties, the older brothers leave the island for the uranium mines of Ontario and elsewhere. However, the location of home is never in doubt and it draws them back forcefully. After one of the MacDonald team is killed in the mine, Alexander, having progressed well in his academic studies, drops everything to join the brothers to make up the required number. His action manifests the strong loyalty to the family while allowing McLeod to continue the narration from Alexander's perspective. Life in the mining community is well drawn in its crudeness and harshness. While there, the MacDonalds are pitched against a group of francophone Quebeckers. Tension and outright hatred between the two leaders add another layer of complexity and provide in the end an explanation for another major story line - the here and now of the day in the life of...McLeod's enthralls the reader with his portrayal of the land of Cape Breton, its history and mores. It would be difficult to find a more hauntingly beautiful description of the landscape, of the impact that the seasons have on the surroundings and the ever-present power of the sea. This is a book to treasure and to read more than once. Friederike Knabe"},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"Okay, normally I'm too lazy to take the time to type my opinion. Oh sure, I'm big at shooting off my mouth, but typing (four finger style) is labour intensive. This book is worth it though. Its central image is the Celtic ring: the never ending circle. Of all the ties that bind the clan is probably the most enduring. For the scattered Scots blood is the touchstone of existence. MacLeod's meditations on the family fabric is embracing of a very wide world: one that is in touch with all levels of society and the past is among the present's greatest possessions. Perhaps most endearing is his embrace of family foibles which is instructed by the wisdom of age and the passage of time. Oh yes...there are moments of exquisite comic sensibility, if you can see anything comic in the prospect of a frostbit...; a prospect which has to cut to the very quick of human sensibility."},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"Alexander MacDonald, the narrator of this warm and ennobling family saga, comments to his brother that \\"Talking about history is not like living it...Some people have more choice than others.\\" And there, in a nutshell, is the essence of this tender generational novel. The MacDonalds are, in many ways, an \\"ordinary\\" family on Cape Breton, but MacLeod creates a history for them so alive that the reader experiences it, too, feeling their sorrow and joy, admiring their pluck and independence, and celebrating their loyalty and bravery as they make the hard choices their lives require. They become heroes to us not because they have performed unusual feats but because they have achieved nobility within the collective memory of their own family.Alexander MacDonald, the speaker, no longer lives on Cape Breton. An orthodontist, he travels weekly to Toronto to visit his alcoholic brother Calum, named for the family patriarch who came to the island in 1779 from Scotland. As he travels back and forth and reminisces, sometimes in Gaelic, with his much less fortunate brother, many generations of MacDonalds come to life, and we see how these forbears have shaped the two brothers and influenced their different, but shared, destinies.MacLeod is very lyrical. Like a musician, he repeats certain themes. Gaelic phrases echo throughout, almost like a refrain. First names continue in different generations to remind the reader of historical resemblances and differences. And always, in every generation, he celebrates the dominance of the original Calum MacDonald and of Cape Breton in shaping their lives. MacLeod never stoops to sentimentality, however. His main characters are all macho males living macho lives, and he includes no romantic love story to soften the harshness of life. Still, he has created one of the warmest, most loving, and enduring family stories anyone will ever find. The book pulses with heart, and it's wonderful! Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"No Great Mischief is a book of images, characters, places and events. But most of all it is book of words. Beautifully concieved and written, it will make you laugh and cry and say to yourself, &quot;Yes, these are real people, people I have known and understood.&quot;Not since This House Of Sky, by Ivan Doig, have I read a book so true and so moving. And so full of the county and the people that settled it. Alistair Mcleod has done for Cape Breton what Ivan Doig did for Montana. They tell us about love and life and families that care for each other and everything around them.Read this book and it will be with you forever."},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"This book deals with the theme of the importance of family and anscestry (scottish). The author does a nice job of showing the importance of these themes to the characters in the book through the stories and analogies. The image of treeing being cut down in a heavy woods, but still standing becasue it was so intertwined with the other trees really struck me.However, there is not much of a plot to the book. The plot is more like little vignettes that show the importance of family and ancestry to the characters of the novel. But the vignettes did not seem connected to an overall plot arc to me."},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"Bought this book because we were going to visit Nova Scotia. Wow. Really gives sense of people and history. We visited Sydney, the biggest town in this story - an old town that has suffered from departure of industry. I say \\"poetry\\" because his choice of words and images is so fine. Take your time. Be patient at the beginning. It's worth the effort."},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"Alistair MacLeod's first novel about a Cape Breton family is both haunting and beautiful in its writing. Other reviewers have detailed the key incidents in Scotland, Ontario, Cape Breton, and the mines that are moving and memorable, so there is no need to repeat these here. The love and support of the MacDonald clan members for one another and their links to the lands of their ancestors on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean are what I will always remember. And there are also the descriptions of the omnipresent ice and snow, and their effects, which are unforgettable. This short novel is one of the best works of fiction that I have ever read."},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"For those of you that admire great writing, you'll enjoy this book. Alistair MacLeod is a master at describing great beauty found in some very ordinary people.Other reviewers found the book slow moving. Some people also find waiting for a sunrise a big waste of time, children giggling at the table - annoying, and vacations to Maui boring. This book is not for you if you seek the entertainment of a fast-paced plot. But, if you enjoy character development and thoughtful prose, you'll enjoy this book.The reason I rated this a 4 instead of a 5 is that I enjoyed his short stories in his book &quot;Island&quot; even more than this book."},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"Well written and interesting book about a family's difficult life - but certainly not something you want to read to lift your spirits or give you any inspiration.

I think this book deserves someone who can sit down for a half hour to an hour at a time. Repeatedly picking up the book made it hard for me to tell where I was in the story at times. I would try another book by this author."},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"The author grew up on Cape Breton and begins his book with an ode to this island and its people. An unforgettable tale of a night's walk across the ice, losing the parents and the oldest brother leaving only the ever faithful brown dog. The brothers then living their own wild life on the island. One wishes to go there and be part of it, part of this family where &quot;blood is thicker than water&quot;.That is where the author should have stopped the narration and gone home.Next, the brothers are seen in an uranium mine drilling through the hard rock. The oldest and strongest, the leader of the clan, goes to prison for ten years for a killing. He surfaces again as an alcoholic bum. Alexander, the narrator, and his twin sister become professionals. The one thing holding it all together is that some of them have black hair and the others red manes. And there always is a brown dog.The style of writing is beautiful; the story less so."},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"This wonderful tale of family is full of rich imagery and memorable vignettes. A great novel."},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"I selected this book because of the great review. While the book held my interest and was quaint, it was no literary masterpiece. It created a somewhat interesting weaving of the relationships of an extended family, but never really developed any of the characters to the point that you could relate to them. I found it somewhat shallow in this respect which would have been ok if the plot line carried the book along, but it to was light and unfulfilling."},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"One wonders how work like this ends up between covers and on bookshelves. &quot;No Great Mischief&quot; is a boring, slow-witted whine of a novel that wants to imply that the Cape Breton Scots at its centre deserve more than they get, but without ever saying why -- if anything, the no-hopers and dullards who languish morosely around the novel's pages do better than they should expect. Clumsy, cack-handed efforts to tie the current generation's alcoholism and failure to a grander politico-historical narrative go as far as the protagonists do: nowhere. MacLeod either doesn't know enough about Scottish history or isn't telling enough to make it worthwhile.MacLeod's characters never speak in a distinctive voice. One has to keep track of quotation marks to work out whether something is in the primary narrative, being said by another character or being retold second-hand. There is never any difference whatsoever in the grey, porridge-like, stilted prose. As such, the characters are bereft of identity and function as mouthpieces or proxies -- never more stupidly than when he has a Texas dentist manifest to represent the United States. &quot;Do you consider yourself North American first or Canadian first?&quot; the dentist demands of the narrator. Has MacLeod ever *met* any American people? Or any real people at all? Similarly, another US proxy, a Californian, meets some French-speaking Canadians and barks at them to &quot;speak North American&quot;. Cherish these moments of absurd, unwitting hilarity because that's the only sort of humor that MacLeod commits to paper.The &quot;acknowledgements&quot; tell us all we need to know about how this cumbersome, clumsy work came to be -- MacLeod thanks &quot;spiritual powers&quot; and some &quot;writers' retreat&quot; for his oeuvre. He needs less time retreating with spirits, and more time doing the tough graft of historical research and observing people."},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"Before visiting Cape Breton Highlands and since then I have tried to read everything I can about the area. It is one of the most beautiful places on earth. This book however, did not live up to my expectations. It seemed very disjointed, had nothing really to do with it's title. Had I not previously visited Cape Breton, reading this book would not have made me want to go there."},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"This is a tale told well and engagingly at times - but on another level - just another presumptive claim of superiority of one clan over everybody else. The writer &quot;cared too much and stayed too long&quot;."},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"Cape Breton in Nova Scotia comes alive in this tale about a Canadian family of Scottish descent, from the red-haired ancester named Calum Ruadh. The narrator of the story is, Alexander, now a successful orthodontic surgeon living in a suburb of Toronto. He is visiting his much older, sick, and penniless alcoholic brother in the inner city. As he does so, he journeys back in time to reminisce about his childhood and about the ancestors. He remembers the good times and the hardships, but it is death that alters the course of all their lives and charts their future. Death strikes strikes immigrant ancestors during the original ocean crossing in 1779. It again strikes Alexander's parents as they across thin ice one evening, and much later Alexander's namesake cousin in a mining accident. Ironically, death has benefited others: first from the family who sought a better life in Canada, and it also provided opportunities for a better life for Alexander and his sister. He must come to terms with this too. The story is also about the passage of time, about trying to hold onto one's heritage and sense of dignity, yet live in the outside world. He remembers the stories of old ancesters fighting a losing battle in 1692. Now in twentieth century Canada, the isolated idyll of Cape Breton, a self-sufficient fishing community, eventually gives way to the pressures of the outside world. Many are forced to go elsewhere for work, such as the mines. There, they meet people from other places, most notably French Canadians, who are another special community with whom they usually clash but sometimes form alliances. This is a lyrical and faithfully told story that will stay in your heart for a long time."},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"This isn't a book that should be read with expectations--just let it wash over you. Scenes and images will come back to you at odd moments--a child in a new parka fished out of the ice; a father finding his dead daughter's purse on the beach; three brothers laughing on a cliff as they sing to pod of whales; a dog waiting for a family that will never come home. There is a lovely cadence to the language that would be especially appreciated by those who enjoy reading aloud (and if you have a Gaelic-speaking Cape Bretoner to do it, I envy you!) .I am completely baffled by reviewers who lament lack of plot or depth of character in this book. I suppose we have become used to the all-pervasive Hollywood story arc. It is true that some characters are focussed on more than others, but the author is too methodical to have done this accidentally. It is more interesting to wonder why he has left things out. Why does he focus so much on Calum, his brawling but tender older brother, but not even bother to give his other two brothers names? Questions like this give the book more depth than the Hollywood story arc ever could.It's not a perfect book: long passages of dialogue between the narrator and his sister, though beautiful, are too polished to be believable. No one speaks like that. At times the repition of family myths becomes a bit oppressive. But this also underscores how unwilling the family is to break from the past. By reading them over and over, they become so well-known that you feel they are part of your own history.And you don't have to be Scottish or even Canadian to appreciate this history. MacLeod ties his characters' story and ancestry to the constant, ever-evolving movement and displacement of people everywhere. And all in fewer than 300 pages! A highly recommended read."},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"If you pick up this book and read the back you somehow think that this will be a historical novel - a story of a clan which has made its home in Canada and prospered there. Well this is true enough, the propsering part anyway, but the history is interwoven with a very modern story. This is not a criticism as such, as it is an engaging story, but it is not what I expected at all.It is in fact the story of today's McDonalds, told in flashback to our narrator's youth and the trials and tribulations that have made him and his family what they are today. It is difficult reading in places - the family have not always had happy lives, but there is a quiet splendour in the telling of that story.It is a good book - not a great book I fear, as the story rambles a little and there were times when I wondered where it was going. But it is an interesting book as are most books which observe families, and the little bits of history thrown in embroider the story nicely."},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"Alistair MacLeod is not a writer, he's a craftsman. Each word in this incredibly rich story is carefully rendered. Each sentence grows on the one just read, and each paragraph is a story all its own. MacLeod is a master of fiction. He has few peers.The story glides along, oozing with history and pain and sentiment. The MacDonald clan, through the eyes of Alexander MacDonald, comes clearly to life. We follow the clan for more than 200 years after they leave Scotland. To this family, history is all-important, and family is everything. The red- and black-haired and dark-eyed MacDonalds survive heartbreak and loss in the &quot;land of the trees&quot; -- Cape Breton -- and dig out a new life on the Maritime shores. Young Alexander and his twin sister live with their grandparents, near their other grandfather, and are eternally schooled in their family's past. I felt honoured to share in their history, to soak in their very lives. From the coast of Scotland to the hard-rock mines of northern Ontario to the bleary streets of today's Toronto, MacLeod takes us on a road seldom taken in modern fiction. Buy this book at any price."},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"Alastair MacLeod's book is an stunningly well crafted and beautiful novel.For me, the book that starts out confusing--why the characters are doing what they are today? and ends with a deep comprehension of bonds that form during a life.This is definitely not a book for someone wanting a breezy travelogue about the pretty vacationland on Canada's East Coast. MacLeod's novel has nothing to do with the tourist experience. Instead, it is about a harsh and demanding land that shapes the characters and their relationships much as the waves carve the shore.I'm not from Cape Breton, although I have been there 9 times and grown to love the place. The locals see MacLeod's writing as being very true to their heritage, and treasure it. His stories are often dark and quite sad. In particular his short stories (see \\"The Island\\") often leave me in tears.This is the story of some lives, tough lives in remarkable places from Cape Breton to western Canadian mines. In the end, if you are like me (and several of my friends), you will understand the brothers' bond, and applaud the extraordinary skill and beauty with which the author has told this story."},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"It had been most of 2005 for me without reading a good novel and then I opened No Great Mischief. In telling the generations-long saga of the MacDonald family, Alistair MacLeod moves seamlessly through time and place, creating scenes as indelible in their own way as those from quite different writers such as Annie Proulx in The Shipping News and Cormac McCarthy in All the Pretty Horses. It is true that his long chunks of dialogue, particularly between the narrator and his twin sister, can be stilted and read more like description surrounded by quotation marks rather than something a person would actually say. But that shortcoming is easily submerged by the numerous memorably rendered scenes of loyalty and love -- a dog swimming through exhaustion after a ship sailing from Scotland; a young man after loss spending a day with his old horse; a matriarch shaming a confrontation between the clan and the RCMP by bursting through a front door, \\"drying her hands on her apron\\" and saying, \\"This family has suffered a death and we would appreciate it if you leave us alone during our period of mourning.\\" Compact and direct, this is a novel that rewards careful reading by circling back on itself to moments briefly mentioned in the first chapter or two. Its unadorned prose is consistently entertaining and rewarding. You can't ask much more from a work of fiction."},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"Although I read a lot I tend to shy away from pure fiction as I find real life more to my liking.Just because a book is an award winner and particularly if it owes its existance to some grant doesn't mean it's for everyone.I found this a real gem.I had a little trouble trying to decide what I really thought of it.To start with I grew up in the center of Nova Scotia ,as opposed to Cape Breton.My ancestery is both Scottish and Irish as well as Catholic and Protestant.I went to &quot;X&quot; as did the author and lived among the Celtic descendents of Maritimers be they from NFLD,NB,PEI and NS.I am very familiar with the locations,highways,and experiences throughout the book;right down to the tavern beneath the Lord Nelson where we Engineers from &quot;Tech&quot; enjoyed a few cool ones.As with the author most of us left home and settled in Quebec,Ontario as well as scattering all over North America,mainly in the search of jobs.This was thesame as for our ancestors from Scotland and Ireland.While manyleft,many stayed behind.In fact the population of the Maritimes is still about the same it was 150 years ago.What this novel does is describe the way of life,hopes, fears,love,family,and trials and tribulations of a people and their life.This same has happened throughout history;and similar to what Steinbeck wrote about in The Grapes of Wrath.I am not surprised that some readers find this somewhat dull or boring and even though they lived through it; would just as soon leave it all behind.The only thing I found somewhat lacking was any reference to faith or religion ,a central component to the life of thesepeople."},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"No Great Mischief is a wonderful story of a Cape Breton family who are so connected to their past yet live in a modern world.Cape Breton Island is just of the coast of Nova Scotia in eastern Canada. They are very connected to their Scottish roots. Before reading this book, I didn't fully appreciate how connected they were.Set mostly in the mid to late twentieth century, we are told of the McDonald family who are descended from the man who first came to Cape Breton Island many years before. He is Calum Ruadh (Gaelic for Calum The Red).The protagonist is Alexander McDonald with various stories from his childhood through to later adulthood. He does well in the world and no longer lives in Cape Breton but always looks back to his family and their great loyalty and sense of pride.Even as the Cape Breton family members venture to the world beyond their home, they remain loyal to each other. They are very much like a tribe where it is all for one and one for all.There is tragedy, brotherhood, adventure and sentimentality.

This is a story with subtle power. It's about who we are. It's about memory, remembering, memorialising, tradition and continuity. It reminds me of a lady I met in a small depopulated country setting - she spoke of her ancestors, stating \\"they're all still here\\".The story is told with a sparse poetry rendolent of the landscape where the events take place. It is beautifully and carefully crafted. This book has touched me deeply."},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"Alistair MacLeod has created an incredibly well written novel, and an all out love letter to Cape Breton. Told first person, the book is like sitting down with a grandparent as they recount your family's colorful past. Moody and evocative it's the kind of book to curl up with in front of a fire and let it wash over you.Fans of the book &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; would probably enjoy this as well since it adopts the same steady slow moving pace, while reaching depths of emotion through memory. I only wished I knew the areas of Nova Scotia he was talking about, because that would of made it an even richer reading experience."},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"What a mouth-watering piece of writing! It has been years since I read such a wonderful book. I can't recall the last time I was aware of the shrinking number of pages remaining as I read the story, regreting that I was nearing the end.MacLeod has created a rich and detailed world inhabited by a Scottish clan come to Nova Scotia (Cape Breton in particular). He dances back and forth through time without ever seeming gimmicky. Moments of insight slip in with the gentleness of a falling autumn leaf."},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"MacLeod has been nominated for the world's richest literary prize for this novel (the International Impac Dublin Literary Award). I love this writer's nonpareil short stories so much that I hope he wins. This is an author who is vast and slow like a glacier -- just two volumes of short stories and now his one novel after a long lifetime writing.However, to me this was one very long short story. It is worth reading because MacLeod writes so melodiously, quite like the native accent of Cape Bretoners. As usual for MacLeod this is a tale of large, brawny men from western cape Breton in Nova Scotia, men who carry that wondrous isle with them wherever they go and whatever trouble they get into.Like so many of MacLeod's characters, indeed like Macleod himself, the narrator has left much of his coalminers/fishermen culture behind for a professional life based on being one of the few of his family to get higher education. The impending demise of his brother, a seeming ne'er do well living on skid row in the big city, brings the two together and thereby reopens the memories of the family's long history of struggling and battling.No doubt a great story but not really enough to sustain so many more pages than most of MacLeod's work. Half way through I had a pretty clear idea of how and why the central events would unfold. I would rather send those unfamiliar with Macleod and the Cape Breton of his memories to either of his earlier collections that have such great titles - &quot;The Lost Salt Gift of Blood&quot; and &quot;As Birds Bring Forth the Sun&quot;. See especially &quot;The Boat&quot; in the former.But this novel? Well you can't really miss when a man writes so well yet simply, minus the superfluous lyricism that afflicts so many emerging younger writers. Buying and reading it t'would be no great mischief!"},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"This novel is superb. The language is beautifully written, and the story is gripping. There are so many scenes that are so full of a stark beauty that they stay imprinted on my mind: the squalour of the rooming house in Toronto, the ice-bound island and the lighthouse family making its way across the ice, and grandpa also having his adventure on the ice, the horse meeting the fishing boat, the tooth being ripped out, winter in the village, the miners' sing-song in the camp, ....I could go on and on. There is a poetry in all of this that is seldom found in a novel today. The family connection across the seas between Canada and the auld country, across generations and across the different regions of Canada also gives the novel a unity and strength that is very powerful and affecting. All in all an unforgettable novel that can be recommended to anyone."},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"This beautiful book will penetrate to your bones. Don't miss it. I can hardly wait for the U.S. publication of Mr. MacLeod's short stories."},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"What a wonderful book. In spare, clean prose that wraps the reader in the beauty of the harsh Canadian landscape, Macleod tells the story of Alexander MacDonald of the Scottish Macdonald clan. His ancestors arrived in Nova Scotia at the end of the 18th century but despite the distance in time and space, the family is still very much a part of Scotland and its memories.While the title of the book may be from something that one of the Kings in Scotland said back in the 1770's, the title may as well refer to the book's overriding narrative--life happens without great mischief. It is, what it is.The book follows the good and the bad with a nostalgic, accepting and somewhat tragic narrative line that begins when MacDonald comes to Ottawa to perform his weekly ritual of bringing his oldest brother alcohol. His brother is an alcoholic but so much more besides. And part of the novel is spent in some way redeeming him or in providing him grace. There is no judgement about the alcoholism not from Alexander or from the author but rather acceptance of it as it is and, further, as at least somewhat Alexander's responsibility (blood is thicker than water, and, we might presume, alcohol).The novel weaves in and out of the visit while tracing the history of the family. Alexander was born a twin on Nova Scotia and his parents die falling through the ice when he and his sister are three. THey are raised by grandparents while there three older brothers live on an island by themselves. Callum, his oldest brother, is also the other brother's leader and takes them around North America as Uranium miners. He is convicted of manslaughter in a mining fight and sentenced to prison for life (which ends up being for 10 years).Alexander becomes an orthodontist, a fitting job for someone who seems distant and removed from the world while intimately connected, in a weird way, to his own emotional life.It's a wonderful, careful book."},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"I read a small amount of fiction, (as truth is usually stranger :) ) but this book is truly extraordinary. I can't quite put my finger on why, though I'm sure it has something to do with McLeod's sympathy with the scenario and his resulting descriptions of the locales. Sometimes when you walk out of a cinema during the day you expect it to be dark. Well I walked outside after reading this and started looking for the lighthouse.

He evokes the kinship of brothers, the importance of history , the impact of chance and the integrity of nature.His characters ring true and speak in voices you can hear across the table in a Cape Breton kitchen. It would be so easy for a book like this to fall into the toe-tapping, beer swigging , Gaelic caricatures so often served up. It weaves love and tradgedy with humour and grace.I sat in the hammock at morning chorus with the book and didn't leave until it was finished.

This is a family saga that will woo the reader gently and carry him/her along to a resonant end.I wax poetic (and I do it badly!), but it's hard to review a book many now hail a masterpiece work.

The sequence of events, the details and the family bonds allow you to live the storey and enjoy the joyride of emotions of sadness, happiness, failure and success.Above all, it demonstrates how nothing in life is achieved without sacrifice and committment by yourself, family and friends. An excellent read, deep and intellectually stimulating."},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"I've had this book on my radar for quite a long time. Ever since it won the IMPAC award really. I've never been much for Canadian literature, to be honest, and recently I've started to feel that was a shame so I've been making an effort to find some good Canuck authors. This book, unfortunately, was a misstep.The story revolves around an Orthodontist called Alexander MacDonald. While on a trip to visit his decaying, alcoholic brother in Toronto, MacDonald recalls the story of the first half of his life in Cape Breton, and the story of how his family came to Canada in the 19th century.There actually is some good writing in here, but you have to wade through a great sea of mediocrity to get to it. The narrator's grandfathers are probably the best developed characters, and the description of his parents' death and visits to his older brothers' house are highlights, but I don't think they alone are enough to recommend it.One of the first things you'll notice is that MacLeod has a tin ear for dialogue. The only way the dialogue between the narrator and his twin sister could have actually been delivered is if they were both stoned and one had nodded off while the other prattled on, or possibly if there was a hypnotist in the room, mesmerizing each in turn. The parts of the book that stuck most in my craw, however, were the descriptions of trips to Scotland.These descriptions, given by the sister and by the narrator, really come across as the pathetic wet dreams of an ex-pat. Just try not to roll your eyes as misty-eyed locals, seemingly equally as mesmerized as the main characters, approach any visiting foreign MacDonalds they happen across (recognizing them, apparently, because they have black or red hair and dark eyes), and instantly \\"know\\" them and accept them back into the fold. Welcoming them \\"home.\\" This book really should come with an Enya CD.Anyway, if you like that sort of mystical clan nonsense, and can look past the dialogue, you might get something out of it. I am still stunned that this won the world's richest literary prize. Perhaps all of the judges had red hair, dark eyes, and haunted, far off stares?"},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"This book is as I have described it; boring and depressing. The main characters emerge from a depressing background and merely enlarge their misery into a new country. They are alcoholic n'ere do wells who amount to little and serve only to perpetuate a miserable stereotype for all of Eastern Canadians. You could derive more entertainment from watching cows sleep.This book reads like a long tedious car trip with that branch of your family tree that would properly have been pruned, if there were such a thing as divine providence. The narrative is boring. The description of scenery is boring. By God, by the time I made it half way through, I had developed a drinking problem myself...Consider for a moment the \\"depth\\" of imagination required to name the environmental disaster that is a uranium mining company \\"Renco Development\\", please. Drunken monkeys from the local zoo could pump out more entertaining prose.This book most accurately represents the depths to which creative writing has sunk. If you cannot find a sobbing, sadly sentimental drunk to recount his miserable life, and really miss the thrill of this sort of story telling, buy this book. Better yet, save the money, invest in a bottle of decent scotch, get all (...) up abnd turn on a tape recorder. It can't be worse than this drivel."},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"After reading all the glowing reviews of this book, I was really looking forward to a good read, full of history and tragedy. What I got was an overwritten (where was the editor in all of this?), floridly descriptive, superficial story of a family that never interested me in the slightest. There was no depth of character -- everyone seemed almost to be different versions of the same person (did anyone count how many Alexander MacDonalds actually appeared in the book?), all slavishly obsessed with family history and Scotland. When Scottish history was being related (particularly between the narrator and his sister), I felt like I was reading an essay that had been plunked into dialog form. And what was all that stuff about the people picking fruit in Ontario? I wanted more of Calum's story -- he was the most interesting character. How did a vital, kind young man turn into a trembling alcoholic? It's all too conveniently brushed aside as a result of Kingston.This is an ambitious novel that has a huge scope -- and in it's attempt to say too much, it says nothing particularly meaningful."},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"The book arrived as promised and in good shape.

I am staggered that anyone can publish a book which displays such a lazy and banal opening and wish that both the publisher and I could have stopped right there. I resented every minute I had to spend reading this turgid, self regarding, badly written prose."},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"No Great Mischief is an understatement. Absolutely nothing of importance happens in this dark overview of a family clan's life stories. I found the reading to be pure drudgery and tossed the book in the trash about half-way through. This book should be titled \\"No Great Novel.\\" UGH!..."},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"I bought this book because I will be going to Nova Scotia for vacation for the first time next month, and I wanted to read some fiction that describes that part of the world. I did enjoy it and got a real sense of the place and the history of the Scottish people who migrated and settled in Cape Breton. There were some characters and elements that I thought could have been explained a bit more deeply, especially the animosity between the French Canadian and the Cape Bretoner miners. It wasn't always clear why each had so much distaste for the other, although perhaps that was the point. My French is not great, so I missed the significance of the French quotes (to all those bilingual authors...translations would be very helpful to readers like me...). I admired this author's writing style and language. I also appreciated that the book is not overly long -- I would have tired of this story if it had gone on for much longer."},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"This book followed the prescribed path for a memoir pretty well - there's some family history, some of which is funny and some of which is moving. The main character is one of six children, and pretty early on in the story, a big event happens in the family. Most of the rest of the book tells what happens to the family afterwards - how some of them, by luck, manage to get through difficult times, and how some of them just aren't that lucky."},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"This book is extremely powerful, for a book that is ultimately quiet and composed primarily of remembrances of things past. The book evokes the feeling of being connected to an ancestry stretching back at least as far as the Battle of Culloden in 1745, if not further, and how the ethnic divisions of those days still echo among the descendants of the combatants to this day. True, the book is about the Scottish people who settled in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia and their trials, but it speaks of something more than that: of the power of memory and ancestral connections that might be true of any culture that finds itself cast up on the shores of this modern eclectic world of mixed cultures and races. The final line says it all: All of us are better when we're loved."},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"This is a hell of a book. What is a family? Its people, its pets, its past ... and how humans support one another. In addition to the obvious Gaelic, dog, and historic Scotland metaphors, watch the effects of new and borrowed clothes. It's all magic.It helps that I have been to all these places except the heart of it, Cape Breton; so now I must visit there too."},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"The MacDonald clan may have arrived in Cape Breton more than two centuries ago but their hearts are still firmly anchored in the Scotland from which they came. Their family history has been so religiously passed from one generation to the next that Calum MacDonald, who brought his family to Canada in 1779, seems as alive to its members as the brother or cousin sitting next to them at the dinner table.For more than two hundred years the MacDonalds have made their livings with their hands and their backs, working as farmers, lumberjacks, lighthouse caretakers, and uranium miners, never afraid to take on the toughest or most dangerous jobs available to them. But no matter how difficult life at times got for some of them, the family always took care of its own and none of them ever forgot that they were part of the MacDonald clan. Their family loyalty was a fierce one and it was never questioned.No Great Mischief is largely told in flashback form by its narrator, Alexander MacDonald, a successful orthodontist who as the book begins is in Toronto checking on his alcoholic brother, Calum, who seems to be slowly drinking himself to death. Alexander's visits to Toronto involve sharing old memories with his brother and leaving a little cash and alcohol behind to help Calum make it through the rest of his week. How Calum has reached his dreadful condition is a long, sad story but it is only one part of the MacDonald family saga.No Great Mischief is a combination of historical fiction and family saga and it is a bit unusual in the sense that it focuses only on the MacDonalds who originally came to Canada and on those living there at the moment, with very little being told of the generations connecting them. But what a story it is because Alistair MacLeod has filled it with characters and incidents that will be long remembered by his readers.The present day MacDonalds are held together by the narrator's grandparents, two grandfathers and a grandmother, three people who despite their differences share a deep and loving respect for each other. The grandfathers could hardly be more different, one being an earthy man who loves his beer and his wife, the other living alone with his books and historical research. It is these three who get the next two generations of MacDonalds through the tragedy of sudden death that comes their way over the decades.The MacDonalds are not a family that will be easily forgotten but the highlight of the book is perhaps MacLeod's vivid recreation of life in the uranium mining camps of the 1960s. That unique, dangerous and insulated little world was a revelation to me, one of those places I am happy to have visited in a book and missed in the real world.But for one flaw, I would have rated this book higher than the 4.0 rating I settled on - some of the long conversations between the narrator and his twin sister have a staged quality to them. They are packed with so much historical detail, and read more as recitation than conversation, that the reader cannot help but feel a distracting switch in tone. Luckily, this does not happen often and can be easily enough overlooked."},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"To me personaly this is one of the most beautifully written, moving novels ever written. As I fnished it, I thought i had never read anything better. A set of three-year old twins lose their parents and one older brother; they are raised by their grandparents and never recover from the sense of loss. Their three much older brothers grow up half-wild and become uranium miners in the North of Canada.After college, the boy twin, one of many Alexanders in the family, join the brothers in the mines one summer, basically out of guilt for never having shared their rough lives. Tragedy ensues and the oldest brother, the leader of the clan, ends up in jail.Yes, there is a lot of stuff about Scottish history here and a family that seems doomed to repeat the tragedies of the past, a theme not congenial to my American students who want to think they are in charge of their own destiny. But as we read, we see that the oldest brother Calum is an old-fashioned tragic hero. Self-reliant and resourceful to a fault, the kind of guy you would want at your side to get out alive of Iraq, he is ultimately brought down by his refusal to live by the codes of modern polite society. The triumph of this novel is that by the end the reader has come to care deeply for a character who in real life most of us would probably cross the street to avoid. I truly felt enlarged by this novel and its generous and noble vision of some people who haven't quite caught up with the modern world. Beautifully written too."},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"I picked up Alistair MacLeod's No Great Mischief on the advice of one of my reading buddies (and you can never have enough of those!). I have never heard of MacLeod and when looking for more of his work, I was surprised to find that this Canadian is one of his country's most distinguished writers, although he has only two collections of short stories to his credit.Weaving the past and the present, No Great Mischief is a tale of family. There are three plot lines in this intricate, yet highly readable novel. In current day, Alexander MacDonald is a successful orthodontist who often has trouble with why people pay him so much to make them pretty. He is trying to care for his oldest brother, Calum, a dying alcoholic who fascinates and repels him.The second plot line is about Alexander's childhood. Taking place in Cape Breton, Alexander and his twin sister are raised by their paternal grandparents when their parents and one of their older brothers, Colin, falls through the ice as they make their way from the Cape to the lighthouse island where they live. Their three older brothers, now on their own, become loggers and miners in places around the world. They always go together and work side-by-side until one of them is sent to jail for murder.And the predominate, yet most subtle, plot line is the coming of the MacDonalds to Canada. From the Scottish Highlands, the Calum Rudah (the red-haired clan) weathers a nasty and ill-fated trip across the ocean.The story is almost, but miraculously not, confusing as different generations of MacDonalds are named \\"Alexander.\\" However, that is one of the strengths of MacLeod's writing. It has the ability to weave in and out and flash back and forth, all the while never losing the reader.At the heart of this novel, is family and loyalty. When the Calum Rudah leave Scotland, they try to leave their dog behind, but the dogs swims behind them until they can no longer risk her drowning and pull her into the boat. That image ignites the heart of the novel, as one of the dog's descendants waits for Alexander's parents to return to the lighthouse island in a show of loyalty.Armchair Interview says: A 5-star offering from Alistair MacLeod."},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"One the best books I have ever read. I don't normally read books that based on &quot;real&quot; life, but once I picked this one up I couldn't put it down. I laughed, I cried, I felt connected to the characters. I am now a huge fan and look forward to his future works! PLEASE READ!!"},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"As a descendant of Nova Scotia Scots (by birth and by marriage), I found this book very enlightening. It helped to fill in the gap between the history of the &quot;auld country&quot; and the lives of our grandfathers, both of whom emigrated to the US when they were young boys. I heard echoes of family stories and understood more clearly why they had to leave. The writing is wonderful--tight and descriptive."},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"I have read some great books lately but this one is, as so many have expressed is simply beautiful.I do not have much else to add that has not been said, other than this...While the family in question were nostalgic about their Scottish history and roots they were without a doubt newly connected and a part of, their Cape Breton home. The clans ability to acquire new skills and to adapt to the new world never left them, until it seems they are faced with the recent modern world. Some like the dentist move on in a fashion while others like Calum live and die in limbo, until once again they return home. There, values reassert themselves once again and they &quot;belong&quot;. Cape Bretoners and others from eastern Canada are famous in Canada for wanting to go &quot;home&quot;. This simple, humble, quiet story gives me a glimpse of perhaps why that is.I read it in one sitting and hated to see it end."},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"I was suspicious when I read the early acclaim for this novel, but just having finished reading it myself, I have to agree that this is a masterpiece and will be one of the novels that people will remember for a very long time. The quality of prose is so intelligent in this work, the story is so moving and encompasses so many different experiences in such an imaginative manner. The book is incredibly life- affirming and it not only speaks to the experience of one community of people as Steinbeck's great novel did decades ago, it also speaks to the entire experience of being an immigrant in the New World. I can't wait to read this book again. It's magnificent."},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"When more familiar sounds are heard, the above becomes, &quot;Look, the lamp of the poor.&quot; The lamp is the moon and the reference encompasses what those may do when the moon is bright that otherwise would require the means they do not have.This is a beautifully written story of the MacDonald Clan that spans nearly three centuries in length. How Mr. Alistair Macleod conveys this epoch of this Family in such a relatively short work (283 pages) is enigmatic. The Author accomplishes this in part I believe by using not only the words he needs, but the most appropriate as well. The reading is so rewarding because the Author gives you so much to absorb, to ponder, and at times to puzzle over.Prior to this work Mr. Macleod published two books of short stories that I have not read. Another Author stated, &quot;He is one of the great undiscovered writers of our time.&quot; A heady endorsement, but one I cannot argue with. Other reviewers have made reference to some literary talents whose work has become timeless and by extension classic. I agree without reservation.This book joins some others that never seem to receive the public acclaim they are due. I thought of &quot;The Banyan Tree&quot;, and &quot;Life Is So Good&quot;, and also &quot;No News At Throat Lake&quot;. It may be that these books don't have a publicity machine behind them, and if that is the case it truly is a loss to readers.One of the wise Elders in the story says.&quot; Music is the lubricant of the poor. All over the world. In all the different languages.&quot; Books like these and the people who write them provide the same comfort, encouragement, and incentive for readers to go on reading when there seems to be less books of this caliber offered.False muses, the French Ships that never came, and the body that moves inland while the heart was left at the sea. This is a book that will move and satisfy, and keep looking for the next great Author you have yet to find.Absolutely outstanding! Read it!"},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"Stellar writing by one of North America's greatest living writers, this novel is loaded with the same kind of emotional authenticity, lush language and courage as ANGELA'S ASHES. MacLeod brings the mythic, the historical and contemporary experience together in a way that is magical, poetic and yet unpretentious. MacLeod is also a wonderful antidote to the American writers who, I'm told, describe my experience. MacLeod is not Joyce Carrol Oates or E.L. Doctorow, thank God."},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"The title of this novel comes from a letter written by General Wolfe to Captain Rickson before the taking of Quebec. Wolfe was highly suspicious of his Highlander troops, due to the fact that he had previously fought and overwhelmed them on the battlefield of Culloden. Yet the fact that the Scots were old enemies ironically helped in the seizure of Quebec. One of the Highlanders, MacDonald, had been exiled in France before being pardoned by the British, and it was his knowledge of French that got them past the Quebec sentries. Such is the tale spun by the narrator's Grandfather.I suppose you could expect a wee bit of bias in a novel that is related by one of the MacDonalds of Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, but I'm more than willing to give Alistair MacLeod's account the benefit of the doubt. According to the dust jacket, MacLeod was raised in Cape Breton, so he certainly has first hand knowledge of the locale. I've been so enthralled by this novel, that I've looked a great deal into its historical background. Obviously, Macleod has had to change some names. Renco Development is a fictional company, but uranium mining did indeed flourish as an industry in Elliot Lake (&quot;The Elliot Lake story is a moral and human outrage&quot; wrote Stephen Lewis in his report to the Ham Commission). From a modern day perspective, uranium mining would seem to have obvious health risks, but MacLeod tends to concentrate more on the dangers inherent in such manual labour and the disputes of workers from different ethnic backgrounds. MacLeod does not insult your intelligence by covering such truisms; instead, he reveals new material from old history.My favourite character from the novel is Grandfather. It's from him that most of the family history is researched and passed on. A lonely widower who never knew his father, he seems compelled to fill up the gaps in his life. When he passes away, one of the regrets of the Cape Breton MacDonalds is that that they did not write down all of the songs that he kept in his head. I've never read a story that so authentically captures oral culture. There are lots of repetitions, which are just as familiar and comforting as a chorus, mantras by which the Macdonalds live their lives. Very resounding is the tales of the generations of the dogs &quot;who tried too hard&quot;. The Macdonalds keep the same family of dogs throughout the centuries - or rather, the dogs keep the Macdonalds.The recorded history of the MacDonalds is also very strong. Calum Ruadh left Moidart for Nova Scotia in 1779, a sign of defeat if ever there was one, since Moidart was the landing place of the Bonnie Prince in '45. It was a MacDonald who was made an example of in the Glencoe massacre, betrayed by the British soldiers who were supposedly his guests. What goes around comes around, would seem to be the nature of the history in this novel. More than one army has reason to lament the non-arrival of the ships from France, as MacLeod relates. &quot;My hope is constant in thee&quot; was what the Bruce told the MacDonalds at Bannockburn. However, it is the MacDonalds of Cape Breton that we take to our hearts in this novel.General Wolfe may not have grieved the Highlanders if they had fallen at Quebec (where he got his own comeuppance and finally achieved his long-cherished fame without realising it), but their relatives would have done. It is the twentieth century MacDonalds who do most of the living and dying in 'No Great Mischief'. Although the Nova Scotia land is rich, it is also hazardous, even for the experienced. The narrator, Alexander MacDonald, becomes an orphan as a result of one such tragedy. This novel encompasses the changes wrought by the twentieth century. The divisions between rich and poor are most marked here, if only because some members of the MacDonald family become more prosperous than even, say, their siblings. But the family link is far stronger than the family divide.The most compelling character in the novel is Calum, Alexander's brother. For him, his namesake Calum Ruadh's journey to the New World resounds with his own story. The attractions of this novel are many. Anyone from the Celtic diaspora will be able to recognise the characters in 'No Great Mischief'. I particularly identified with the MacDonald trait of bearing fraternal twins, as that is a habit of my family also. The roots of my family seem lost within the mists of time; with official documents seemingly contradicting remembered history. 'No Great Mischief' gives me a powerful insight into how my ancestors may have lived, of the culture that they shared. It is exquisitely written by a master storyteller. You'll never forget this great book once you've read it. There are scenes that resolutely stick in your mind, like Alexander's encounter with the whale. The MacDonalds still flourish in Cape Breton to this day, and I think it's the fact that MacLeod is a native that adds greatly to the feeling of authenticity in this moving novel."},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"This book is a remarkable achievement in that it manages to squeeze a 300 year family saga into less than 300 pages. For all that nothing is lost. The sense of period is retained throughout and at all times a cracking pace is maintained. The MacClouds have played a strong (and mixed) role in cottish history and that feeling of destiny is strongly conveyed in the book.People come first in this story and the sparse writing style suits this tale very well. The most vivid scenes are created with an admirable brevity.Coming, myself, from the English branch of an Irish family with strong links to Montana and Australia, I stongly empathised with the sentiments of the story (though our family history is much less dramatic). Links back to the 'homeland' remain even if they are buried for years by the distractions of the modern world.Aspiring authors would to well to read and absorb the style of this book. Existing authors should note that it IS possible to write a sweeping family saga in less than 1,000 pages."},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"I read a great deal...between a half dozen to a dozen books a month. There are books that leave one feeling dissappointed. There are books that leave one breathless. And then there are those books, like No Great Mischief, that leaves one feeling as though they will never find another book wonderful enough to surpass the experience they just went through.No Great Mischief is a family saga with a great deal of history - I even took the liberty of checking a few of the facts out and he is dead-on. The story is touching, the characters are wonderfully developed and the imagery the author conveys is haunting. You won't be dissappointed."},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"Beautiful is not a word I use often, but it is appropriate for short and moving novel. Every word, scene, and action in No Great Mischief seems to have been selected with the utmost care and artistry. MacLeod's themes are exile, family loyalty, and the destruction of traditional cultures by the modern world. MacLeod writes about the descendents of Scottish emigrants who settled on Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia, providing an unsentimental and eloquent picture of the traditional way of life of the poor fishers and farmers of that region. Their powerful family ties, their preservation of Gaelic language and Scots traditions, and the ways in which the modern world erodes these traditions is shown through the story of one extended Cape Breton family. Few will be able to read this book without having to pause to control strong emotions."},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"An exquisite work. Alistair MacLeod definitely ranks at the top for this gift to literature. His dynamic use of the language paints vibrant images of a family and its legacy and reminds us of why we read."},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"It is hard to find the words to describe the beauty of Alistair MacLeods novel &quot;No Great Mischief&quot;. It is truly, storytelling at its best. As you read, it is like you are listening. The trials, tribulations, loss, spirituality and love that the narrator experiences throughout his life are rich and poignant. So many times I had to put the book down because I was so emotional about the story. His descriptions of his grandparents, sister, brothers and their natures and personalities were tremendous. Although I am not from Cape Breton Island, I am Canadian and of Scottish descent and I felt that the commonalities between the narrator's family life and my own were uncanny. Alistair MacLeod is in my opinion the greatest writer of our time."},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"If anyone should doubt the book critics' relevance in guiding readers' choices, look no further than Alistair MacLeod's &quot;No Great Mischief (NGM)&quot;. If not for its constant appearance on their notable reads list, the publication of NGM would likely have gone unnoticed because it's a low key unshowy kind of book that's unlikely to attract attention. But thanks to them, I have discovered a gem about one's family, clan, and roots. Quiet, reflective, and lovingly narrated by a modern day MacDonald in Ontario, the story traces the history of the MacDonalds back to the 17th Century when its first immigrant parent arrived from Scotland to settle in Canada, desperate and poor. The author takes certain liberties with chronology - eg, toggling between scenes of the narrator as a successful dentist and a coal miner working alongside his older brothers can be a challenge - but it's consistent with the story's dreamlike quality. Recurring images or memories unfold like a chorus that locks you into the rhythmn of the song. There are many scenes that are simply unforgettable and will remain firmly etched in your mind, like that of the dead immigrant's wife being offloaded into the sea, the family dog swimming against the tide into the arms of its owner, the tragic ice accident that claimed his parents' lives, his brothers melting ice from buckets to make their morning coffee, the horrific decapitation of a MacDonald in the mines, etc. These floating images, coupled with the impression that the MacDonalds have multiplied like rabbits and all but conquered Ontario, only serves to reinforce the novel's theme of blood and kinship. If only MacLeod had been less presumptuous about his reader's knowledge of Canadian Confederation history and its Scottish anticedent, the references to how key characters fought for opposite sides at different points would have made more sense. Despite these slight misgivings, I enjoyed NGM tremendously. MacLeod's prose has a beautifully understated and intimate cadence to it that suggests an assuredness absent from much of what passes today as good contemporary writing. NGM won't change your life but it'll add to it. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"Not tediously long, like so many these days; well written with characters you can imagine.Scenes easy to picture, such as walking on ice, fruit picking, dangers of mining, and an inside look at the life of an alcoholic.I liked the moon being the \\"poor man's lamp\\" and also the suggestion that we dream in our mother tongue. Wonder what the multi-linguists do?"},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"So I've been accused by my friends of liking less-than-cheery novels, and this book would help cement my reputation. That said, this is a beautiful novel that is quietly and carefully written. McLeod's spare writing style is very evocative of the stark Cape Breton landscape and the generally taciturn nature of the Scottish clan who lives there. But the author also has the rare ability to write a few sentences that carry enormous emotional weight, then leaves well enough alone. But somehow the brevity of the writing only deepens the impact of what he's just told you. And if you're like me and a total putz for any story that includes canine loyalty symbolism, you can't beat this book. I won't give anything away, just read it."},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"Canadian fiction usually has at least one of two themes--harsh conditions of some kind, and family. This has both. This book takes harsh conditions to mean a few things: the terrain, the sadness of true life, and the things we must face everyday. It is an interesting story about a family who has not had the easiest life, and it continues to be difficult for everyone. It is a story about how a tragedy can bring a family together and tear them apart. It is full of courage, hope, and love for your family. It makes you think what you would do if this happened to you. This is a story that dates back to the narrator's ancestors and how the events and tragedies that happened to the ancestors and the actions of distant relatives affect the narrator and his family today.

Just as Faulkner made his mythical Mississippi county come alive, MacLeod does the same with the real Cape Breton Island, lush and lovely in the summer and inhospitable in the winter. The novel follows the fortunes of one family through several years, through joy and tragedy, through birth and murder. A compelling story in which the real protagonist is the time and place of Canada. Although the characters are very much alive, in many ways they are not quite as compelling as the landscape and the history. In that sense, MacLeod is not quite up to the level of Faulkner, but make no mistake, this is a remarkable achievement by a writer's writer.Now that Island is out in paperback, I intend to read it. I didn't buy the hardcover because of the poor quality paper..."},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"I just want to clarify a point about No Great Mischief. I am from Cape Breton where the story takes place.The story may be about the MacDonald clan but it is not exclusive to them. MacLeod tries to emphasize the importance of ancestry especially in the Scottish-Cape Bretoner context. In particular, he advocates the importance of &quot;the land&quot; to Scottish settlers. In highland-Scottish history this element has always been important. I think he points out his contempt for greed but does so to despite a way of life for the MacDonalds and other clans. If you interpret the book as a story about &quot;them&quot; then you will lose the meaning of the entire book; that history is a coming home, epitomized at the end of the book. . ."},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"The story of the MacDonald's he tells is so very closly related to my own that it's spooky. The way he describes Cape Breton and it's people couldn't be more correct. The details and experiences he writes about are so vivid I can actually picture exactly what's happening and where."},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"\\"No Great Mischief\\" toggles between present-day Toronto, a major metropolis that could be anywhere in North America, and Cape Breton, an isolated island off Canada's eastern coast. The author's skills are such that he's able to do it with graceful observations about both societies. I've never read a book that has so many pitch-perfect sentences to end chapters. So often, the final sentence (and paragraph) wraps up a vignette or a family story that deepens the understanding of the characters and brings a universality of themes.The story itself unfolds in the past. In other words, the \\"drive\\" of the book is the protagonist Alexander MacDonald thinking about his life, the lives of his extended family, and the stories of yore that he's been told. Those tales center around a family patriarch who migrated to Canada from Scotland with 12 kids in the 1800s. The family retained much of its Scottish roots -- language, family loyalty, appearance, violence, and integrity --- literally living on the windswept, storm-tossed edge of it.Alexander MacDonald and his twin sister are the first to to be truly assimilated. He's a highly successful orthodontist, and his sister is an actress who's married to an oil industry executive. Alexander tells his family's history as he interacts with one of his older brothers, Calum, who has descended into alcoholism after being released from a prison sentence for murder. Alex and his siblings lost their parents (and one sibling) to drowning when Alex was 3, but Alex and his sister were given a 2nd chance by being adopted by their grandparents. Calum and two other brothers were deemed old enough to live on their own, though they were but teenagers.The brothers' bonds were strong, but they represent the logical extremes of a family in which extraordinary physical strength, bravery and manual skill (carpentry, mining, fishing, etc.) were matched with a clannishness and distrust of much of the modern world. One brother has made it, and one has been destroyed --- yet, they ocmpletely understand each other.The story is a series of tales and memories, some of which Alexander has experienced, and some of which have been passed down by generations of family members. These stories stretch back centuries to the battles and massacres of Scotland, but each is as real to the MacDonalds as if they happened a year ago. Whether it's a dog that swims into the North Atlantic to join his master as he leaves for America or a brother who gives up an internship in order to replace his dead brother in a uranium mine, loyalty is the primary driver of the family. Brother-in-law sets up brother-in-law with a job as a hospital custodian; brother drives 1500 miles to meet a cousin at the airport; grandmother sacrifices to raise orphaned twins. And so on. It's bleak, but it's also warmed by the salty and raunchy humor of Grandpa, who merrily drinks his way through every occasion.It's hard to describe the book, except to say it evokes an intensity that would be hard to understand unless you lived through it. The weather is bitter cold, storms and ice can be fatal, men's hands are so calloused that they shave skin off with knives, and a warm beer is a rare godsend when working in the mines. Every moment is savored because it might be the last --- and that's a lesson for every reader."},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"Having purchased a used book at a more than reasonable rate I was surprised to find this a signed copy!No Great Mischief: A Novel"},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"The Battle of Culloden (1746) was the final confrontation of the 1745 Jacobite Rising. This conflict near Inverness in the Scottish Highlands was the last pitched battle fought on British soil.Hence a vast migration of Scots to the new world, in the case of some of the clan Chalum Ruidah to Cape Breton, and the beginning of this wondrous, harsh, tender and inexorable tale, beautifully written, in fact, awesomely so.A classic by any definition of the word, it belongs among the greatest works of world literature. Do I sniff a Nobel Prize in the future? I certainly hope so.There are so many elements in this story that they are ungraspable. It is deeply sad, yet at times joyous. By the time the reader has finished reading it, it most likely has gotten into his blood. The beautiful Gaelic lilt in the voice of the author, half-poetry, half-prose, seems to shine through centuries. Even the animals take on a life of their own, horses, dogs, even whales. But always, always sadness at the heart of it all. And yet there is no trace of self-pity, though some of the characters have miserable fates. One even wonders about the lead character who, along with his sister, fares better than the rest, at least to outside appearances; yet there is a strange passivity, an odd reluctance, even in this supposed person of success.An emigration story, a coming of age tale, the settings being Toronto, Ontario mineral mines, Calgary, and of course Cape Breton, this Clan is at heart very tender. One wishes they had been allowed to live easier lives. A cast of characters one can never forget."},{"Title":"NO GREAT MISCHIEF,A NOVEL","review":"Macleod's No Great Mischief, like Margaret Laurence's Bird In The House, is an essay disguised as a beautifully written story. Unlike Laurence's exposition on freedom, Macleod's novel revolves around loyalty. I love books like this. Once you unravel the philosophy of the author (or maybe just the narrator) the essay is a piece of art. Imagine reading someone's thesis that simply weighed the pros and cons of familial and cultural loyalty in point form. Needless to say it wouldn't be the most exciting read. That's not to say that anyone will be blown away by the action in this novel either. But the poetic language in this book, with such a bombardment of sybmolism and settings described better than in paintings, would be absent from the drier point-form essay.I was also amazed at how Canadian this book is. It is perhaps the most Canadian book I have ever read. And if anyone thinks it only relates to Cape Breton, they've surely missed the point. Canada is a multicultural country, not a melting pot and that is just the sort of loyalty Macleod examines, not just in the Cape Breton clan, but also in the French, the Newfoundlanders, the Jamaicans and the others which get varying degrees of mention. And while the setting mostly fluctuates between Nova Scotia and Ontario, British Columbia, the Yukon and a few other Canadian places pop up as well.At times, like in other Macleod works, this book can become a downer. Pervasive in everything he writes is the loss theme; loss of culture, loss of life, etc. So don't read this book if you're looking for a light fluffy book, but if you're in the mood for a thinker, give it a try."},{"Title":"The Golden Lion of Granpre (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"This little book (180pps) is certainly not Trollope's best. But even on this small stage we see displayed two of the author's favorite themes: the plight of women in a Victorian age who are treated like chattel and the conflict between inclination, on the one hand, and self-restraint and duty, on the other -- \\"aristocratic virtues\\" as de Tocqueville called them, and values we seem to have lost. We see Trollope's chauvanism at its worst, as the heroine must choose between the weak man her well-meaning uncle has selected for her and the \\"manly\\" man she prefers, the man who will be her lord and master and reduce her to the submissive position Trollope seems convinced women prefer.But there is no one who saw more clearly, or felt more deeply, the agonies of a Victorian age (for all its faults) that was in its death throes, with capitalism and industrialism bearing down and the sense of something outside the self, something to whom or to which we have a duty, weakening in the face of self-absorption. The book is worth reading, but not as a sample of Trollope at his best. For that I recommend The Warden or, perhaps, La Vend&eacute;e."},{"Title":"Call Me Kick!: Iliads/Odysseys/Ills and Odds Uneven","review":"Portraying youth and young love in the 1950s with a romantic and comedic nostalgia, Osander's first novel, &quot;Country Matters,&quot; showed an affinity to F.

When she wittnesses the death of one of the speakers, the widow seeks her out and offers her a small fortune to edit her husband's book in Florida. But more people die and Didi thinks she is next. The clues are obtuse and the motive undetectable. It needs to be explained in the final chapter.Back home Charlie is running amuck again.

The Upstate New York town is seeing more and more of the locally owned dairy farms going out of business. Dr. Deirdre &quot;Didi&quot; Nightingale, predominately a dairy veterinarian, knows for her to survive the onslaught, she must change her practice, which is why she is traveling to Atlantic City to attend the Eastern States Veterinary Convention. In Dutchess County where Hillsbrook is located there is many big horse-breeding stables that hire vets and she plans to become one of them.Didi particularly wants to hear the lecture of renowned vet Eleazar Wynn, who has had extraordinary success with lame horses. Didi happen to be in a shoe store at the same time as Wynn when an unknown assailant kills the latter using a letter opener. Wynn's widow offers Didi a large sum of money to complete her spouse's manuscript. Didi accepts the offer only to watch people near her being killed. Not wanting to become the next victim, Didi begins her own investigation.The long running Dr. Nightingale series continues its lighthearted, fun approach to reading due to an assortment of eccentric, hilarious secondary characters. DR. NIGHTINGALE SEEKS GREENER PASTURES is an enjoyable one-sitting read that holds the audience spellbound with its unexpected humor that fits comfortably inside a well-designed story line.

The editorial reviews provide a great summary of the plot of this complicated kidnapping story. Let me add that the book was nominated for three best novel of the year awards -- McCavity, Agatha and Barry. It deserves that type of recognition.What makes this book unique is that Irene is so normal. I'm getting a bit weary of the &quot;hard-boiled female PI&quot; that is so popular these days. The lonely woman with one (or more) major problems (alcoholism, anger, etc.)can be a bit hard to relate to, not to mention boring. Irene has grown from one of these characters to a newlywed. No small part of this book involves her trying to balance her professional needs with her need to save her husband. The fact that the search takes her back to his family and former girlfriend just makes things that much more interesting.The kidnapping itself is full of unusual twists. The kidnappers motivation lies in childhood trauma and the desire to force the determination of the unknown cop who caused that trauma. Interesting stuff.Bottom-line: A tight, page turner.

While the main action takes place in less than a week, there are flashbacks to earlier events related to a double murder in the past. Young men who have mental problems related to the past events form a group of urban terrorists. There actions at first seem like unconnected pranks until people start getting killed. When a police officer is kidnapped, and demands are made, their real purpose becomes evident.While the story is a stand-alone plot, it continues with characters from previous novels, primarily news reporter Irene Kelly. Various information emerges about people's pasts. Some people have hidden problems that cause bad dreams.The setting for the novel is somewhat before the present so, while there is electronic technology, technology is not quite up to 2004 standards (cell phones but no caller ID). One can wonder about a police officer and news reporter being able to afford a beachfront home in California, but perhaps it was purchased at some time in the distant past (or maybe they got incredibly lucky with investments).Overall, a good cops and robbers type story involving police, news reporters, and deranged killers.

They believe that a corrupt policeman was involved and are using Frank as a bargaining tool to obtain his name. Burke creates sympathy for the two villians. We feel real pity for them because she has shown us how they became the damaged creatures they are now. Frank and Irene are very likeable characters simply because they seem like normal people.

I always enjoy it when authors take the time to do research into the basis of their story and Burke did a great job in incorporating all the facets into a sensible whole.Burke's protagonist is different in that not only does she work in a newspaper, but she is also married. I rarely come across American writers who have married protagonists...makes you wonder if they think married women cannot possibly have interesting lives.

Since they met they have had a great relationship and they have only been married for a little while, but at the start of this novel things are rocky. Frank has just finished blowing a case wide open against two men that are supposed to be the ringleaders of a group named Hocus; a story has appeared in Irene's newspaper with information that should only be known by an insider.

This in turn has created some strain in the couple, and to make matters worse there was the issue of an old girlfriend asking Frank to visit her.When the action starts Irene has not heard from Frank all day and thinks he is blowing off some steam, but when not even Frank's partner, Pete, knows of Irene's husband whereabouts, things start to turn south. Is Frank in trouble? Is he alive? Besides these questions, Irene has to deal with the recent discovery of a troublesome secret on Frank's family. When she learns soon enough that Frank has been kidnapped by Hocus and that their demands are very peculiar, she has to embark in a dangerous and complex investigation to save her husband.As has happened before, Burke delivers a high intensity thriller that does not lack an outstanding use of narration and three-dimensional characters. One of the important aspects for me in a mystery series is how well the author develops the characters from one book to the next, and I am happy to say that Jan Burke excels in this area. In \\"Hocus\\" we advance considerably in our knowledge of Frank's family and the relationship they have with Irene, and we also get a glimpse of several events from their past. The different aspects mentioned in this review make this book and the series overall a great choice if you are looking for a good mystery to plunge into."},{"Title":"Hocus","review":"HOCUS, so far is one of the best books I've ever read. It is far superior to many mystery books because it draws the reader right into Irene and Frank's lives. Not only does the reader experiences Irene's pain of possibly becoming a widow, but the author was smart to include Frank's emotional and physical reactions to being so violently snatched against his will.We also see pain through the guilty party, although their actions are not excused.This book is one of my all time favorites also, because it is non stop action, conflict, suspense, and very deeply emotionally charged and believeable."},{"Title":"Hocus","review":"Hocus is the best of the excellent Irene Kelly series. Each book in the series provides continuous humor and suspense, along with clever and interesting character and environment descriptions, and leaves the reader with the fulfillment that comes from having definitely done the right thing by setting aside the time to read. This book transcends previous works by Burke in its keen use of quick, yet smoothly coordinated sequences of place and time movement of the reader. Do yourself a favor and give this book a read. You will find the urgency of other things you had planned for the day to fade as you fall deeper into the pages of Hocus."},{"Title":"Hocus","review":"Although I usually prefer the more hard-boiled writers such as Michael Connelly, Robert Crais, James Crumley, and Joe R. Lansdale, this book really packs a punch. Jan Burke has crafted an excellent plot that keeps you turning the pages well into the night. The love between Irene and Frank is very strongly portrayed, but the sympathetic story of the two &quot;villains&quot; is also very moving. Although there is no excusing their actions, you can't help but feel their pain, particularly that of Bret. This was my first &quot;Irene&quot; book; I can assure it won't be my last."},{"Title":"Hocus","review":"I found Goodnight Irene in remainders and found it and the following 3 to be pleasant light reading. However with Hocus, Burke has moved up the ladder. Hocus is a fascinating and heart wrenching book. Irene almost always holds onto her famous temper. Cassidy is an interesting character, and the story falls into &quot;no sleep until finished&quot; category."},{"Title":"Hocus","review":"Thus far, I've read three books by Jan Burke--Flight, Bones and Hocus. As a frequent mystery reader of authors like Deaver, Sandford and Cornwell, the thing that has impressed me most about these three books (and Ms. Burke) is that they are not only all good, engaging stories, but they are NOT all alike! It is SO common for mystery writers' books to start feeling like carbon copies of one another (to the point that you have trouble remembering if you've read a particular book), but I have not found this the case with Ms. Burke so far.Hocus involves the kidnapping of Irene Kelly's husband, Frank. This kidnapping isn't about ransome or making some political statement...it has a VERY personal reason. As the kidnappers lead Irene in putting together the puzzle of her husband's capture, we learn more about the kidnappers themselves and how their history and Frank's are connected. This sets up not only the obvious emotional connection of a wife trying to find her husband before the kidnappers carry out their threats but also the connection of the kidnappers to Frank. As the sad layers of this mystery unfold, police negotiator Cassidy helps Irene understand the mind of the kidnappers. Her sharp reporter's mind and his understanding of the kidnappers' psychology pull them closer to unearthing Frank's location...but will it be in time?While, like most any mystery novel, there is a little eye-rolling and suspension of disbelief involved, I found this a taut and engaging story with some great characters (loved the Cassidy character). Brought it home from work (where I was reading it on my lunch hour) when I got down to 50 pages since I couldn't wait until after the weekend to get to the end! :)"},{"Title":"Egoists, a Book of Supermen: Stendhal, Baudelaire, Flaubert, Anatole France, Huysmans, Barres, Nietzsche, Blake, Ibsen, Stirner, and Ernest Hello","review":"James Gibbons Huneker's &quot;Egoists&quot; is a diverting compilation of essays, exploring the personalities and lives of some of the greatest artists, poets, litteratures, philosophers and mystics who have advocated the creed of individualism, in opposition to the sentiments of equality, brotherly love and socialism. The essays combine entertainingly critical and analytical insights with a melodic prose style characterised by a sweep and grandeur of rhetoric, and many a flowery turn of phrase.

At four, before he could read, he memorized every word on every page and \\"read\\" the story to himself over and over. He's 24 now, and I have a 3 year old granddaughter, by my daughter, who is crazy for this story. I have it in a treasury book of Golden Book stories, but this is always the favorite story in the whole book.The story is about a cow named Emily who can't moo. Emily tries everything she can think of, she changes her diet and even asks other animals to help her, but eventually becomes sad and cries when she can't figure out how to moo. Then brown cow boosts Emily's confidence and shows her how to moo. Emily tries again and succeeds! Emily is so happy! All the other animals are happy for her too and congratulate her.The colorful graphic illustrations are so sweet and are not outdated even for today's children. The values lesson is a truly great one, but without any PC agenda. I'd give it more stars if I could. I really don't understand why it isn't more widely published."},{"Title":"Emily's moo (A Golden beginning reader)","review":"We just got this book from family friends, and my son (who is almost eight months old) loves it. It's probably his favorite book. And, luckily enough, I love it too!Emily is a realistic-looking cow who cannot moo, but we learn from the pictures that she CAN do things like climb trees--looking perfectly natural all the while!The story is fairly predictable, but the pictures really make it something special. Hooray for Emily's Moo!"},{"Title":"Sight of the Stars","review":"I read all the reviews and was astounded that no one seemed to see what Belva Plain was doing with this little book at all. I haven't read \\"Evergreen\\" but it hardly seems fair to knock Sight of the Stars for not being another book that you loved. I was about 3/4 of the way through the book on a plane flight from Paris to the US when I realized what the author's theme was and how skillfully she had woven her revelation of it through the lives of the Amring family members. Readers who were dissapointed with the \\"boring\\" plot and lack of a deep dark secret in brother Leo's life entirely missed the point. Or rather I should say, they demonstrate the point; which is, that it is all too easy for us poor humans to misjudge one another and miss the truth of the lives of the people we interact with. Adam makes a preliminary mistake in his assessment of every important character he deals with. His life teaches him how he was wrong and he grows wiser and more humble until in the end, just before he dies, he is willing to admit that perhaps he was wrong about Leo too. Perhaps he should forgive his brother and find him. Adam discovers this too late for a reconcilliation but the reader is allowed to see the \\"truth\\" about Leo. It is brillantly done, for the reader is brought to realize that perhaps they too had been wrong about Leo, imagining all sorts of dark perverted things about him when in fact his books were simply his refuge and the way he taught himself foreign languages etc. Those who were dissapointed that there was not some horridly wicked revelation about Leo in the end REALLY missed the point. The book is not meant to be one of those sagas that leaves you feeling as if you were forever entertwined with characters in them who had been brillantly brought to life. Rather, reading it is like solving an intellectual puzzle of masks and characters and motives revealed so that the reader turns from that puzzle instructed and more humble about the characters that inhabit his own real life and asks himself, \\"Do I know these people as they truly are?\\" In the end the puzzle for me became more than just intellectual and became profoundly moving, even spiritual. I loved this book for the way it stretched my mind and heart."},{"Title":"Sight of the Stars","review":"I too wondered about some of the things in this book, but there's an easy explanation. Belva Plain isn't the first author to use modern terms for old-fashioned expressions. Other authors have fallen into the same trap. Blame the editors for not catching this type of mistake. As for Leo taking credit for rescuing the abandoned dogs, this is what people with low self-esteem sometimes do to make themselves feel important.I've always enjoyed Belva Plain's books. She writes beautifully about everyday people caught in everyday conflicts. The passage of time in her books is written seamlessly, and sex is left to the reader's imagination. If you can't imagine it, then you know what you have to do."},{"Title":"Sight of the Stars","review":"I enjoyed reading this book, but found that it left me with questions. One of which, was stated on the blurb, that &quot;Arnrings' past begins to unravel, revealing a shattering secret that reaches back nearly a century&quot;. IT DIDN'T HAPPEN. I kept waiting for something spectacular to come out, but there was nothing there. If they meant the fact that he was illegitimate that appears in the beginning of the book. It also states that he went west....but he ended up in Texas??? I adore Ms Plain's books and will forever keep on reading them, but these mistakes should be caught before publication.Actually the book is stated as a generational book, but it takes us 310 pages with Adam's story, and leaves us with only 46 pages of the next two generations. I was confused with the story of Mr. Snow (Leo). It states that he picked up the litter of puppies abandoned beside the road, and it was in fact Adam's mother Eileen."},{"Title":"Sight of the Stars","review":"Adam Amring longs for adventure instead of working in the faily grocery store. Dressed in a new suit and with $150.00 in his pocket, Adam bordes a train traveling west.

This has been a LONG road downhill since Evergreen, whose pages I still re-read when in need of a classic.The Sight of the Stars has a boring, plodding lead, Adam, who performs not a single exceptional act in the entire book. Plain leads you to believe that it's his very decency that is heroic; but instead, even to the end, you're left wondering what great event is going to hapen to make this book worthwhile reading. Subplots concerning his strange brother, Leo and his other brother's fiancee, with whom he spends two cheating nights (not even detailed!) fail to arouse any interest. Even the last few pages, which I will shall not spoil by revealing, do not close the book satisfactorily.Oh, for another Anna, Joseph or Paul...

This story was wonderful, I especially enjoyed the character of Adam. Belva can write a family saga like nobody's business.

I have already ordered them and look forward to the cold winter nights ahead sitting in front of my fireplace reading another one of her \\"dishy\\" family sagas (only if it snowed in Los Angeles). How wonderful it would be to be snowed in with a fire in the hearth, lots of hot chocolate, and a stack of Belva's stories.

I kept waiting for something else to happen...the &quot;affair&quot; just did not live up to the claim of &quot;unimaginable betrayal.&quot; Unfortunately, that type of betrayal is all to imaginable in today's world and just did not make for an interesting read. Maybe Leo's blackmail was the act of betrayal, but again, it did not live up to the claims. Very disappointing."},{"Title":"Sight of the Stars","review":"What can any reader say about an author who hit big with her first book Evergreen during the 1970's. The story of a young immigrant who goes to work at the home of a wealthy family and becomes involved with the dashing son, also gave birth to several other books in a series focusing on these two eventual families. Evergreen was also made into a television movie with Armand Assante and Lesley Anne Warren which I still enjoy watching. To say that I loved and continue to love the book , Evergreen, is an understatement and so with each book that Belva Plain wrote I was first on line to buy a copy. But in the succeeding years her books which took place during present day and grappled with many of the ills of our society like infidelity, embezzlement and betrayal, failed to move or interest me and most likely the last book I will read by this author.The story of a man that goes from rags to riches in a retail operation beginning in the early 1900's, marries the girl of his dreams and has many children and grandchildren has certainly been told before and in my opinion better in books like As the Crow Flies by Jeffery Archer and A Woman of Substance. Plain fails to deliver memorable characters or anything else of much value in this book I'm afraid to say. Despite a rather odd brother and historical events like WWI and the Depression plus a dark secret about the main character's failed to interest me more than a ho hum and ultimately led me to rate this book as low as I did. In addition I wondered why errors like words which were never used in this time period weren't caught during editing .It was almost as if this book took place now and the author simply used the early years to create a sense of a generational novel.Perhaps once cherished author lie Belva Plain should know \\"when to hold them and certainly when to fold them.

Then he had some romance with the store's adopted daughter and a fling with a dressmaker. It definitely held my interest and has a surprise ending.

This book had a good basic plot, and I loved the time period, BUT.... something was missing--- actually alot was missing. Reading this book was like drinking skim milk when one is craving whipping cream!!! The plot, as well as the characters could have -no, make that SHOULD HAVE - been much better developed.

Surely she would have been either Mother or Ma. Mom is a much more recent name. And she speaks of people taking accounting classes. It would have been bookkeeping back then.

I'd be satisfied placing the book on the coffee table, fueling off the prism of cozy hope radiating from the design. I'm beyond impressed, more like gleefully shocked, that the novel lives up to the gleaming spirit graced on the cover.I regularly search the carnival of supermarket bookshelves (now I search Amazon) for novels with a character whose creativity surges, then sparks simply and perfectly into business success. I am so tired of seeing my sparks FIZZLE!! I love the way Adam gently leaves home, travels in simple grace to a strange town, exchanges a heated scene with the woman designed for him the first day and hour he descends from train to city street, then roots himself into a job preset for him to base line his talent and effectively seed a financial oak tree.Wow. Belva Plain, you have mastered the alchemy of vicarious.The handwriting in my DNA says that's how life should take rhythm from the soul and manifest into material glory.The writing style in this novel moves in simple prose through Adam's easily flowing consciousness; it reminds me of watching my Mom do the two-step with her brother, sliding in jazzy swirls through sawdust scattered on a bar room floor. Margie and Charlie, born in 1920 and 21, Italian to the core, would slip, twirl, and sidestep in The Waltz set free to dance a natural course. Circles and glides, dips and skips, the two moved with ease through patterns of the soul, designed by the times. Ms. Plain writes like that.Nearing page 70 of this heavenly release, I noticed that, through each passage I had been feeling, \\"Yes! This is how life was meant to be. Depth and grace, heart and style, rhythm and redemption. I, too, can get there from here. Yes, yes, yes. Even if not, thank you for giving me books like this to read.\\"There's so much I'd like to write about the joy this novel incites.

Harriet's narrative is instead a grueling series of escalating predations and degradations, politely told... because most people with no sense but some money do not have a Jane Austen heroine around to guide and protect them.the discomfort this novel creates comes not just from the horrors that are visited upon the heroine but also from the inclusion of classic characters and situations that are instantly recognizable from the range of light comedies of manner that have been read and re-read over time. greed is a killer and predators will do anything to rationalize their predatory behavior (even to themselves) - particularly in a milieu where polite conversation and manners are as important as currency.a dark and forgotten classic, one that is pitiless and passionless in its depictions of human cruelty. the novel is both subtle and furious in its underlying assessment of the avariciousness that can drive that cruelty."},{"Title":"Atemi - The Forgotten Art: Understanding of Grappling & Grippling","review":"The first thing that jumps out at me when I look at the cover of this book is the incorrect kanji (Japanese characters) going top to bottom on the right. The 5th character down is illegible, it simply does not exist in the scope of the Japanese, Chinese, or Korean languages. To further exacerbate matters, none of the characters make any sort of grammatical sense at all combines as they are, and I have trouble believeing that anybody who claims to have studied in Japan for over 18 years could commit such an embarrassing flub.The Quality of the photographs is decent, however the drawings in the book are just awful. Pages 201 and 205 also include nice drawings by Oscar Ratti which were used without acknowledgement, as is the reproduction Universal Kenpo sign from Ed Parker on page 15 and 16. As with other Soto writings, there are big problems with his claims to have studies or fought in Japan--he has not even a picture to show he has been, nor a photo in any periodical despite claiming to have been an 18 time bare-knuckle champion. Soto misspells the Okinawan art of Tui-te &quot;Tweeta&quot;, and incorrectly refers to Atemi as a martial art rather than the concept it is, and perhaps most damning, claims to have forgotten his Sensei's first name. I cannot recommend this to anyone who wished to study authentic martial arts."},{"Title":"Atemi - The Forgotten Art: Understanding of Grappling & Grippling","review":"I bought this book at a tournament a few years ago without really looking it over first, and was surprised recently to find it offered by a supplier like Amazon. I noticed many of the same problems the last reviewer did, and although I understand that it isn't politically correct to criticize people in the martial arts, especially teachers or those calling themselves 'master', being a teacher myself, I will be honest without being rude.While some of the techniques in this volume can be applied effectively by the average person, there are many impractical ones included in this volume as well. Technique wise, I would give it two to three stars. But overall, reviewer M.C. Busman below has a valid point with asking why the huge kanji mistakes on the cover and why the claims of tournament victories and studying with masters in Japan that cannot be verified by Irving Soto. I did not find his stories about sudying with a Japanese master or winning a huge number of tournaments believable either (a la Frank Dux, almost), he just made too many mistakes and said too many things in this book which make absolutely no sense about Japanese martial arts and culture. He is wrong on many points regarding custom, how he studies and got his rank, and so on. I also noticed that there are no pictures of the man he says he learned from in Japan, or Author Soto himself in Japan. This also strikes me as very suspicious, and has planted strong seeds of doubt regarding his veracity.That having been said, I question the motives of Irving Soto as a teacher and writer. So many things claimed by Soto in this volume don't make any sense no matter how hard you squint at them with an open mind. For what I received (this book), I do feel that I greatly overspent my money.

Find a teacher and do some research but stay away from Soto."},{"Title":"Atemi - The Forgotten Art: Understanding of Grappling & Grippling","review":"I am very disappointed with this book.The only forgotten art seems to be one of how to spell correctly. I appreciate the book is American, but one can only tolerate incorrect usage of the English language so far. I became completely disinterested in the book as soon as I read that the authour (no matter how proficient he may actually be) has attained in excess of over 40 black belts. Perhaps they are giving them away with Christmas Crackers over there, I don't know. The photographs in the book are poor and given the very brief descriptions provided for each set, some of the techniques are rendered virtually useless. The hand drawn diagrams are poor and make little sense. I am not suggesting that the very learned Grandmaster (yes 10th Dan Grandmaster - which he himself appears to suggest is a title 2 grades above 10th Dan) is not proficient at what he does, just simply that the book is very poor indeed. Perhaps the caveat is in the title itself 'Grippling' - that's a new one on me. Instead of searching for further enlightenment through my continued study of martial arts, I find myself wondering why the hell I bought this book in the first place."},{"Title":"Atemi - The Forgotten Art: Understanding of Grappling & Grippling","review":"ATEMI--the Forgotten Art is outstanding! I have read many martial arts books and this is by far the best. The author sheds light on the mysterious lost art of Atemi. This is an extremely well-written book. It's been translated into English language. Author Grandmaster Soto is 10th Degree Black Belt and World-Renowned Kumite Champion. The author does an outstanding job explaining the many techniques with pictures, detailed charting, diagrams, and explanations. He also includes a detailed history and philosophy of the art. Thank you to Grandmaster Soto for bringing it to the general public. I love this book. I recommend this book to both beginners and experts in the martial arts. This book deserves 10 stars.Also recommended: Atemi Cobra-Jujitsu"},{"Title":"German for Beginners with Cassette(s) (Passport's Language Guides)","review":"This really is the best book for beginners and it's a such a fast and fun way to learn the language. I have bought so many of these books for friends, and my private students (the French and Spanish versions too), and they have all found them very helpful and not too heavy going. Everyone learns better with pictures and the ones in the book are amusing and informative. There are so many other books to choose from but this one is by far the best for immediate self learning. Suitable for any age from 4 up to 84!! It really is. If you just want to learn a smattering of German then this is the book to buy. It will teach you so much in such a short space of time and you can prepare yourself to immerse yourself into the German culture and make good acquaintances right away. Always important to make a good impression in a country you are visiting, and to learn common courtesies :o)"},{"Title":"German for Beginners with Cassette(s) (Passport's Language Guides)","review":"While this book was probably intended for kids and teens, it works well for adults, too. As a tutor of German and Spanish (they have the same book in Spanish), I find that my beginning students of all ages enjoy these brightly colored, amusing illustrations and the simple, practical text. A complete beginner can stick with the text as printed. With the help of a tutor, a somewhat more advanced student can discuss the situations pictured, the names of the many objects on each page, his or her own activities, and more. The audio CD is a great addition. To sum up: This book is a very fun introduction to a complex language."},{"Title":"German for Beginners with Cassette(s) (Passport's Language Guides)","review":"This book is fabulous for teaching children, and even adults basic German words, phrases, and grammar.My nine year old picked up German easiest using this book. Although I had already known many German phrases, this book explained grammatical structure the best. Better than adult teaching books! I highly recommend this book for teaching the beginnings of German."},{"Title":"German for Beginners with Cassette(s) (Passport's Language Guides)","review":"I have used this book for years with my students.There are cheery illustrations that are silly and invite the invention of games and activities for interaction. If you can fully learn everything in this book, you have made a considerable start in learning German and in communicating in German.It is only about 40 pages, but offers a content rich, and easy to understand delivery of the basics: shopping, food and dining, families and friends, hobbies, weather, colors, clothes, and numbers and directions.The book is older (in DM not Euros) and does not focus on culture or geography. It does not dwell on grammar or repetitive, dull exercises. The basic grammar is not overwhelming nor intimidating for non-grammarians, but presented as an aside.The playful presentation amuses both young and old learners. The colorful pictures and situations are fun and that alone helps it stick. The thematic organization lets the reader wander through on your own. The useful phrases are ones that are used in the target language countries. I would like to see an updated version of this wonderful, little Gem. A great entry point for people in very short preview courses, in those of under 15-20 hours or for after school enrichment programs.It is a fun, sweet and well-organized introduction to learning German."},{"Title":"German for Beginners with Cassette(s) (Passport's Language Guides)","review":"Great buy, my husband and children love it. We are always trying to increase our vocabulary in another language-improve my German-and this has been a great help!!

Thank you!"},{"Title":"Odysseys Home: Mapping African-Canadian Literature","review":"The term &quot;African American&quot; doesn't usually invoke images north of the 49th parallel, but it should. Not only because Canada was the longed for &quot;Canaan Land&quot; of so many spirituals and therefore, the ultimate home of many escaped slaves, nor because Nova Scotia and New France also had slaves, but because black communities have been a part of what we now call &quot;Canada&quot; since the beginning. George Elliott Clarke , an award winning poet, playwright, critic and scholar , is very much part of the literary map of Canada; this book gathers together a representative selection of his essays and reviews published over a decade and demonstrates that African-Canadian literature is not a recent phenomenon. His map covers vast and diverse territory , including the status of African-American culture as a &quot;model for blackness,&quot; black and white racial metaphors in Quebecois literature, black women's search for history and more. This is a great introduction for newcomers, and a foundation for students in the field."},{"Title":"Odysseys Home: Mapping African-Canadian Literature","review":"The term &quot;African American&quot; doesn't usually invoke images north of the 49th parallel, but it should.

This is a well done study without the bias that colors much of the work on this topic. There is a generousity to Fontenot's writing style and curiousity that is most appreciated. \\"Secret Doctors\\" is a welcomed book for a wide range of readers--scholars, traditional healers, doctors, students and the curious. The book reviews some of the best literature in the field of ethnomedicine of African Americans but then opens the door to new ways of perceiving the research. The amulet section and healer's interviews are unique--a wonderful contribution to understanding African American magico-spiritual healing techniques as they relate back to West Africa. It is a slim volume in size but hefty in the contribution it makes to the field. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Amazing Graces: Prayers and Poems for Children","review":"In AMAZING GRACES June Cotner presents an inspirational, accessible anthology for youngsters and the adults who love them.

I got my USCF rating up over 1000 during that period. I met the author of this book at the nationals and got an autographed copy. He also look at one of my games and I would sit in and watch him work with other kids - its was great! I wish more strong masters would donate their time to help out kids at nationals like this guy.Well, even though I was impressed by this teacher after meeting him in person, this is not why I am saying good things about his books - I am also going to write about the other book he wrote (Unbetable Chess Lessons For Juniors).This book (Winning chess tournaments for juniors) I feel was a major help in me recently gaining over 200 rating points in just 4 months.I found the things recommended for doing at tournamets to be very helpful (I know of one thing in particular that got me a draw in a lost game). I found the Openings recommended in the charts to be very strong and an easy outlay for study. I found the tactics section helped me win at least two games due to things I recognized from it. What was fun were some of the stories and games of his chess students.This is a very useful book for you even if you don't play in tournaments."},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors","review":"This should be your first chess book once you have learned the most basic rules and strategy. It is part of what I considere to be the very best series of books that will take you from an absolute beginner to a very skillful player.Therefore, if you don't have the author's CHESS FOR JUNIORS book and aren't sure you have a solid knowledge of the basics then start with then get it first.I suggest getting WINNING CHESS TOURNAMENTS FOR JUNIORS as the second book in the series, followed by getting the author's UNBEATABLE CHESS LESSONS FOR JUNIORS (a most clear and easily understood book that has games with every move analyzed).Now about WINNING CHESS TOURNAMENTS FOR JUNIORS.What makes it stand out making it deserve 5 stars:#1) It is written at a reading level that an upper grade elementary school kid can understand (I am in 7th grade though). This also makes great reading for adults too! Some funny things and stories are in the book too.#2) It expands on important segments of the author's CHESS FOR JUNIORS book (which can be filled in with the author's UNBEATABLE CHESS LESSONS FOR JUNIORS) allowing for consistant learning. These include (listed in the order of the chapters in the book)-a) Tournament Conditioning - tells you all about what you need to do to prepare for tournaments, what to do at tournaments, and tells you how to improve you game, how and what to study, and makes further suggestions on more chess books to read.b) Expanded rules as needed by tournament players. The USCF rule book doesn't explain the rules for practical use - this book does, covering what is important for you to know.#3) The analysis is accurate. As a player rated over 1200 by the USCF I have found no mistakes in the analysis.c) Chess Pschology is covered in analysis (shows you why you make mistakes giving great examples) and over the board! I love this segment. It is very fun to read and very helpful for a player of any level.d) Developing an opening system. It tells you how to go about preparing any opening system and developing charts for fast study. It actually gives you a COMPLETE OPENING SYSTEM! This can be used in part or whole by anyone! It is like having a complete opening book too! The ideas behind these openings are covered int he author's other books (which is made clear by the author).e) Most important ENDGAMES for study are presented in the book (it assumes you know some of the most basic stuff which the author already covered in his CHESS FOR JUNIORS book). This saves you the need to immediately go out and buy a basic book on the endgames - between the author's CFJ Book and this one your covered!f) CHESS TACTICS (like an extensive workbook) make up almost 1/3 of the text. The author selects more tactics beyond his basic CFJ book that you should know as important patterns. There is no need to go out and buy a book on tactics until you finish these first since they focus on the most important ones!g) TOP KID CHESS CHAMPIONS are covered. That is the author tells about the lives of Six of his national champions, with photos and provides games from each of them with analysis (and sometimes comments by the kids on the moves).I got this book several weeks ago when it first came out and read it cover to cover! I know it well and have read the author's other two great books so I know what I am talking about. If you are a kid, a parent or chess teacher reading then get this book (and the entire CHESS FOR JUNIORS series). You will be very pleased!"},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors","review":"Daa - the kids on the cover of this book look very staged - with the boy off to the side to clear the board for the photo. Well I did not judge the book by its cover - well I found the book under the christmas tree and found it to be Santas Claws best gift for me.this is be\\"claws\\" I play in chess tournaments and want to put the advice given to a test. No school tommorrow so I am up late writting this.I have found some wonderfull advice. Like every detail on how to eat, sleep and drink before a tournament. But I like the tactics patterns and have not finished all of them yet. If you are a mom or a dad and are looking for a chess book for you kid who is not a super begenner then this book has so much stuff in it that I liked - I am 10 and have played in 4 tournaments winning a trophy in 2 of them.Again do not judge the book by the dorky kids on this cover - I love this book!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors","review":"This book has so many useful ideas it is hard to know where to begin. I decided to pick up a copy last week when I saw the author on Television.I am glad I got it. I don't play in tournaments yet, but I am glad I got this book before setting foot in one. That way I know I will be ready!"},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors","review":"This is far more than just a book that rules (that is that covers advanced rules for tournament players). It explains flaws in the rules, which rules are most important and goes into how to prepare to play in tournaments and what to do while you are there so you play better.Actually, a major part of the book covers neat openings and my favorite part is on PATTERN RECOGNITION where you try and find the best tactical solution.The book actually covers many different things and some things may be more important than others depending on the person. But I found every part of the book to have information that was very useful."},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors","review":"This is one of the most helpful books I have ever owned.

It shows you \\"how\\" to study tactics from not only this book but others.Opening Charts: A complete opening system is covered as an \\"example\\". There are some great suggeted lines here, but even more important is this chapter shows you how to prepare opening lines, what to look for and exactly how to study.Tournament Preparation: The books tells you the \\"dos\\" and don'ts\\" before and during tournaments to improve your tournament results - VERY USEFUL info - including a segment on the most important \\"advanced\\" rules not easy found elsewhere.Example Games and Lives of great scholastic players: This gives insight into the lives and games of some very sucessful tournament players. Interesting and informative.Engames: This chapter provides important study material for a player is just beyond the most basic mates and king and pawn endgame.Other Recommended Books to go along with this one - Polgar's Tactics Book, Unbeatable Chess Lessons For Juniors and 1001 Winning Chess Sacrifices and Combinations."},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors","review":"I moved from the third highest to the first highest rated chess player on my middle school chess team. The students go up to 8th grade and I am in sixth grade.What I did was read every page two times! And also I have been studying the openings in the opening charts. They are cool along with the tactical puzels in the book. I have already used a hole bunch of the patters in the tactics in the book to help me win.I also understand all about how tournament work and the rules are explained well. I tried reading the offical rules of chess but that book was boring. The winning tournaments book is more fun and explains things so I can understand them better.If you want to get really good then read this book."},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors","review":"THE SERIES IN GENERAL:There are currently three books published in what I consider to be the best series of chess books for ages 9 on up (this would include adults too!) that take an absolute beginner to an advanced level of play. I have noted that there will be a fourth, most advanced book in this series called \\"More Unbeatable Chess for Juniors\\" (expanding on \\"Unbeatable Chess Lessons for Juniors\\").BACKGROUND:\\"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors\\" was published in 2004 and is the third book in the series. The author, Robert Snyder's students won numerous National Championships. After doing research I found that the author is a strong master, rated USCF over 2300 and internationally over 2400. He also has produced 36 first place championship winners at national championships (a national record). His chess teams travel around the world and nation on a regular basis and compete. The author has extensive experience in introducing chess to beginners holding another record by having taught over 170,000 children at school programs over many years.STRUCTURE OF \\"WINNING CHESS TOURNAMENTS FOR JUNIORS\\": This is the perfect book to continue from the author's \\"Chess for Juniors\\" book. It is designed as a training guide and also provides a lot of structured material for study to compliment the other books in the series.There are eight chapters many of which cover a lot of material not seen in other books. This makes \\"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors\\" very unique! I consider this a good thing. I found that this book is just packed with information that will help you do much better in tournaments, and in many cases can make the difference between you becoming a great player or lapsing into a disorganized state. You are certain to be making many mistakes that this book will correct! Because of what \\"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors\\" covers it is difficult to explain its structure without looking at the material covered. I will say that this book contains some extreme humor that goes way beyond the basic \\"Chess for Juniors\\" book. Kids may fall out of their chair laughing.MATERIAL COVERED:a. Chapter One is all about what it takes to be a successful tournament competitor. It will help you know exactly what to look for when trying to find the right chess teacher for you. It suggests other books for reading and helps you to form a good, well rounded chess library. It covers how you should practice and gives good ideas and advice (i.e. it tells why playing irregular forms of chess like bughouse hurts your overall game). It explains how to condition your self for tournaments.b. Chapter Two tells you all about how tournaments work (parents should read this and the first chapter!). You will learn the inner workings of the most important tournament rules (including some complicated ones) that is guaranteed to help you do better in tournaments. Getting the rule book alone is not good enough. It doesn't explain how to use these rules to your favor or what to watch out for. \\"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors\\" will make you a shark in the sea of rules!c. Chapter Three is on Chess Psychology. I haven't seen any other books that cover the practical use of chess psychology that are directed at a scholastic player. I want to say this is the most useful chapter yet, but then realize just how important the other ones are - so I won't go there! Setting realistic goals in chess, building self confidence, what to actually do during play and the reasons why we make mistakes in analysis is the main focus of this absolutely fantastic chapter.d. Chapter Four is all about preparing an opening system. I found it to provide not only very important ideas in what to look for in your own openings, but how to set up the main lines of your system in chart form for easy study. An actual complete opening system is provided - so you in effect also find this book to be an opening book! It doesn't provide the ideas behind the moves in the system it provides, but you will find that the ideas behind the moves to the exact opening system it provides are found in the other books in the series.e. Chapter Five is a complete tactics workbook! It organizes the most important tactics for you to learn by type of pattern. It is rather comprehsensive and this is the largest chapter in the book.f. Chapter Six is on the endgame. The author continues with the most important endgames from where his \\"Chess for Juniors\\" book left off. I you combine these two books you have comprehensive coverage of all the basic endgames.g. Chapters Seven and Eight are on six of the author's national scholastic chess champions. Each player has at least one game with analysis along with pictures and information on the life of these superkids. You will find the games and players to be interesting.WHO IS THIS BOOK IS FOR:I would recommend this book for children ages 9 on up of average reading ability or better, or for adults (don't be fooled by the \\"Juniors\\" in the title in these books as they are just as much for adults). A knowledge of basic strategy (as covered in \\"Chess for Juniors\\") is necessary to get the full value of this book. If you are a player rated above 700 and under 1900 you will find you are at the right levels for this book. Consider getting the author's \\"Unbeatable Chess Lessons for Juniors\\" book as it perfectly compliments this one with additional and non-repetitious material (an advantage of reading the entire series by this author). I would recommend getting the author's most advanced book, \\"More Unbeatable Chess for Juniors\\" which I have been informed will be out in May, 2005 and will expand on \\"Unbeatable Chess Lessons for Juniors\\" with many current games and a heavy focus on opening theory but keeping the concept of analyzing very move in every game (I cannot wait until it comes out!)."},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors","review":"This book tells you exactly how a professional chess trainer's national chess champions did it! Besides providing actual training material on all parts of the game, profiles of the lives and annotated games provide an interesting insight into what the trainer has done to create a national record of thirty-six first place individual winners in championship sections at the national scholastic championships. There are some great stories - some very humorous.Along with the actual chess training methods provided is one of the highlights of this book, PSYCHOLOGY behind the training. Everyone who is either a chess coach, player, parent, teacher, whatever, this is a must read (Chapter three).A most interesting and informative book!"},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors","review":"\\"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors\\" will guide you through all of the most important aspects of knowing as a practical player how tournaments work.A SMALL EXAMPLE OF WHAT YOU WILL FIND:Tournament preparation, how and what to study, the inner workings of the thought processes which cause error in analysis, what to look for in an your personal opening system (the use of charts for study, neat sample system), endgame preparation, pattern recognition (over 100 important tactics set up as building problems to work on) and a look into the lives and games of top chess kids.NO OTHER BOOK HAS EVER BEEN PUBLISHED THAT CONTAINS SO MUCH USEFUL INFORMATION FOR PRACTICAL TOURNAMENT USE - A TRUE GUIDE TO CHESS TRAINING!As a gifted student with a 180 IQ I endorse the entire CHESS FOR JUNIORS series - Bravo!"},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors","review":"As a USCF scholastic tournament player for over 3 years I thought I knew alot about studying and playing in tournaments. I got my rating up to about 1000 after about 2 years. Once year ago I got WINNING CHESS TOURNAMENTS FOR JUNIORS and started reading it and followed what was in it. Now a year later my rating has jumped to over 1450 and I gained way over 400 rating points!Some of the things that this book helped me with is telling me about what to do to study and exactly how to study from material. I can see that most players do this wrong and will learn much more slowly. But this book will put you in the right direction.It helped with teaching why I make mistakes in how I think. It helps teach you to use rules to your favor (there was a lot I didn't know that the regular rule book doesn't explan well). I liked learning about chess psychology.There is a lot of study material on tatics, openings (it tells you how to prepare openings and gives you a complete system is very well thought out and useful), endgames and games from top kid champions that the author trained himself.I had as my first book on chess CHESS FOR JUNIORS. WINNING CHESS TOURNAMENTS FOR JUNIORS continues with the tatics, openings and endgames from CHESS FOR JUNIORS.Do you want to really improve quickly? WINNING CHESS TOURNAMENTS FOR JUNIORS did the trick for me and I would never have gained even half of the 450 rating points in one year without it! Every Chess Teacher and Parent of Chess Kids should read it and know it too (it tells how tournamnets work for parents and beginning coaches).One thing. It has a lot of funny stories about chess kids. It is written very clearly so a kid can read it.YOU WILL IMPROVE A LOT FROM THIS BOOK!!!"},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors","review":"I was wondering for a long time while playing in chess tournaments what was the best way to train. This was to improve my game and to make me perform better in tournaments. I had a lot of books that just had materials to learn from. But I wanted to know what to study, how to study and then when I get to the tournament what to do to put me in the best shape.WELL, WINNING CHESS TOURNAMENTS FOR JUNIORS, WAS THE BOOK I WAS LOOKING FOR. Not only did it cover all of those things, but it has some really cool material for actuall study. It was fun too because it used funny true stories like about the \\"Chess Genie\\" and what other kids try and do to disburb you while you play.But I liked also the stuff about the rules that isn't told to you in the rule book. And the parts about how the thinking processes make typical mistakes. This book shows you using real positions from actual games where you typically make mistakes under chess psycology.Though if you just want lots of great materials on endgames to study, a set out opening system (completely outlined), lots of tactical problems that are the most important to learn, then for this alone this book is great. I agree with the other reviews who say there is not another chess book like this one.Want to improve? Want to know how and what to study? Want some great material for study? Golly, I love this book (I do think the picture of the two kids on the front cover is cheesy and staged, so I am glad I didn't judge this book by the cover as I am certain those kids did not know anything about chess but the girl is cute and the boy is dorky looking)."},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors","review":"\\"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors\\" was the most useful single chess book I have read. One thing that hasn't been said in the other reviews, though implied is that this book helps you with ORGANIZATION and STRUCTURE in,Helping you prepare for tournaments.Telling you how to use many books, computers, methods of practice in ways that I never knew about.Making it so I understand the rules and how to use them to your advantage. I will not likely be taken advantage of again!Helping me prepare an opening system properly.Telling me what is important to know about endgames with the endgames to study.The importance of pattern recognition with many tactical puzzles to work on.What to look for in a good qualified coach and chess teacher.How psycology plays a part in chess and how you make mistakes when you analyze.My list can go one, but I think I have said enough for now. I thing this book is simply the best book to help you do improve."},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors","review":"I attribute the 200 point increase in my rating to what I got out of this book. I purchased WINNING CHESS TOURNAMENTS FOR JUNIORS in November, 2004. By mid April, 2005 my rating had jumped 200 points. I have been playing chess for many years and never had seen my game improve so quickly.This the best book written for a chess player rated over 800 who wants to see an immediate improvement in their results. I am going to break down how this book helped me improve:a. It gave me some nice ideas on how to condition myself. This helped me focus on the actual games and I was in good shape.b. Most players think they know the rules well. However, there is some great information pointing out some important things that are tricky. I won a game alone simply because I understood a rule better. It isn't the official rule book, but it tells you about the most important rules that players have problems with.c. I enjoyed learning about Psychology in chess. The three main immages that cause you to make mistakes (\\"retained\\", \\"intert\\" & \\"forward image\\") well help you understand what is wrong with your thinking! If you don't know these immages you need to get WINNING CHESS TOURNAMENTS FOR JUNIORS for this alone! Motivation, Self Confidence and Playing the Board Instead of The Person are fantastic parts of the section on Chess Psychology that everyone should know. I attribute the confidence I gained and knowing the most common problems I was having to part of my improvement.d. Preparing an Opening system was extremely useful. It tells you what to do and what to look for in your own personal opening system. It provides has about 8 full pages of charts of a suggested system that is very well thought out. Certainly not a complete opening book, but when you combine these charts with the author's other two excellent books, UNBEATABLE CHESS LESSONS FOR JUNIORS and MORE UNBEATABLE CHESS FOR JUNIORS you learn the ideas behind the openings and individual moves. I learned some new opening lines and was able to organize them for study. I attribute my improved openings to wins in at least two games!e. A Mini-Tactics Workbook is provided in the segment on \\"Pattern Recognition\\". This segment tells you how to study tactics and gives you about 130 of the most important positions to know for practical use. There are also some mini-games containing important tactics that build upon each other. This is a very well organized part of the book. Ah! Well, I directly used several of the tactics I learned here to pull off some nice wins!f. Endgames! The segment on endgames avoids covering the very most basic endgames that the author covered in his excellent beginner's book, CHESS FOR JUNIORS. The author continues with the most important endgames that a player should know in a nicely condenced form. In one game I reached a position with King, Knight and Bishop against a lone King. I did the checkmate I learned from this book (I would never have stood a chance if I didn't read it in this book).g. The author's national champions gives their games and the stories behind their ability. Though, the least instructive part of the book (don't get me wrong the games are still instructive!), it was one of the most enjoyable parts of the book.h. Humor and Style. You would think that a book covering these subject is dry and boring. NO WAY! The author's use of humor that ties into the material is wonderful. Take a look at the \\"chess genie\\" story on page 180 and the last paragraph on page 32 (some funny things kids do that distract an opponent).If you don't own a copy of WINNING CHESS TOURNAMENTS FOR JUNIORS and want to improve then this book is a MUST!"},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors","review":"This really helped me improve how I did in tournaments. I had read some other chess books, that helped. But this book was the most helpful because it helped condition me for tournaments.I especialy liked the chapter on psycology that teaches you about thinking mistakes during your play. Also what to be like eating, drinking, proper sleep during tournamnets and then about preparing.How to study and what to study is neat. It also gives a lot of study stuff, problems, games, openings and endgames.It also has some very funny true stories about players and things that happen. Very good book."},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors","review":"Besides giving you a lot of study material (tactic patterns, opening chart system, advanced rules that are important for tournament players, analyzed games of kid champions, psychologic thinking problem examples, endgames for study) this book really tells you how and what to study, what to do before, during and after you compete and tells you why.I have not seen another book like this one. If you want to improve you will learn a lot of important things from this book."},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors","review":"This book is so different than other chess books.It has eight chapters, covering \\"How to Improve\\", \\"All about Tournaments, rules, how to use them to your favor\\", \\"Chess Psychology - OUTSTANDING chapter\\", \\"Setting up an Opening System with a excellent sample system - good ideas here\\", \\"Tactics - lots of nice material in problem format, wish an entire book on tactics used this format, but still plenty of good stuff here\\", \\"Endgames - just beyond the very basics, the most important basics are covered in detail - a good focus\\", and \\"National Champions, profile of their lives and games - interesting, instructive games and inspiring!\\".The bottom line here is that there is so much material you will find in this book that will not be found in others. Everyone, from players, to coaches to the parents of chess kids should have a copy!"},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors","review":"When I first saw the book it looked like it was broken up into many different things and this seemed like a turn-off. It is not written like my chess for juniors book where Snyder has growing lessons with each lesson following the other.But as I went through this book even though it is different I notices that the openings recommended, the endgames and tactics all are follow up things from the chess for juniors book. This expands on it for a more advanced player like me. I liked the pschology section a whole lot and it is helping see where I think wrong."},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors","review":"Some of the advice in this book is on how do conduct yourself during games. One is not to be resigning. I was about to resign a game being a rook down. But, then remembers that the book suggested to play on and gave advice on how to play when you are lost. It worked. It person I was playing blundered and I won!The second thing I did was learn an important tactical idea from the book where I took advantage of an overworked piece just like in the books tactics. I won that game too because of this book which had the exact same idea in it.The third thing was that I have used the opening charts in the book and a player went right into the prepared line which game me a good enough position to eventually win.Because this book has already helped me win three tournament games I felt I should let people know how good this book is and how it helped me."},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors","review":"This book contains a massive amount of well organized material specifically designed to help a tournament player improve their over all games and to perform better in tournaments.Before you get a typical book containing checkmate or tactical problems reach the Pattern Recognition Chapter in this book first. It has about 135 of the very most important types of tactical situations that will most likely come up in practical play.Use the Opening Chapter to find out what you need to know to prepare your detailed opening system. It tells you what you should be looking for and how to go about contructing a complete opening system. A very nice example system is given, which you may want to use or borrow from.Looking for the right chess teacher? This book will provide information on what to look for in a good chess teacher.And, understand the rules much better. A lot of humor is used to give funny situations that have come up.

It is difficult to find a source of information that provides you or your child with easy to read information on the important tournament rules, how tournaments work, the rating system, how to get ready and what to do for tournaments.The chapter of chess psychology is extremely enlightening - you cannot be without knowing this information or you and your child will be lacking in what it takes to give you an important boost in performance and self esteme.Tactical Patterns are provided to give the most important positions to know in practical play. What a student should do to prepare openings and be prepared in the endgdame is provided. Championship winning kids are profiled with their games to provide an inspiration.The book contains a lot of interesting stories and humor to make it fun reading.This well rounded book is just fantastic!

There is no other book like this one. Every tournament play MUST own a copy. Even though this book may be directed at a scholasticThe material is is layed out in eight chapters.The first chapter tells you what is needed to make you a successful tournament competitor.

How to use rules to your favor is the theme. Once again, you will gain a lot of out knowing everything covered in this chapter.The third chapter is on practical chess psychology. The main focus is not so much on \\"psyching out our opponent\\", but rather improving your self confidence, setting goals and most importantly the three most common analytical errors - the retailed, forward and inert images! Know why you make analytical errors!The fourth chapter tells you what to do to set up a personal opening system and gives you a comprehensive example. The example system is actually very strong and provides some fantastic lines. There is a lot of great advice in this chapter.Now the fifth chapter provides what the author considers to be over 130 of the most important tactical themes. It is somewhat of a mini-workbook. The author tells you how to study tactics.The sixth chapter is on endgames. The author covers what he considers to be the most important basic engames. This chapter also explaines what is important to know in the endgame and why.The seventh and eighth chapters contain a wonderful insight into six of the author's national chess champions with games, pictures and a short bio on each player.Worth mentioning is the consistent use of humor throughout the book and the author's fun writing style. This makes the book even more interesting!Once again, this book is a MUST for every tournament player of every age."},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors","review":"This was just the book I was looking for. I got it for my birthday a couple of weeks ago. Once I started I could not stop reading it because I have learnt so much fromit.It tells me how to conduct myself at tournaments, helps me with my openings and gives me fun problems to solve.

By the way I'm one of Robert Snyder's students from Maryland. I have all of Robert Snyder's books."},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors","review":"As a chess coach and teacher who takes his students to team events and tournaments I have found this book to be invaluable! Not only does it greatly expand from the \\"Chess for Juniors\\" by providing additional problems and materials for classroom use, it provides all the information I needed to make coaching the students easy. This book will help a coach or student in tournaments avoid many typical mistakes. After reading this book a coach or student will feel far more confident when they walk into a tournament!"},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors","review":"If you are looking for a great book on Tactics (well about 1/3 of this book is a tactics workbook) that \\"builds on patterns from simple to complex\\" in most cases, and concentrates on the most important tactics in practical play, this book is a great start for a player who is not an absolute beginner.This book also provides a neat opening system for you and teaches you how to prepare openings and how to use \\"Opening Charts\\" for quick and easy study.The endgame segment covers the most important basic endgames beyond the very basic mates/most basic King and Pawn.Humor is abound in this book, which will sometimes bring laughter about some of the funny stories about things that have happened in actual play - no this isn't a joke book, but the author sure has some good humerous stories to tell!The lives and games of some top youth champions are covered at the end with actual comments from some of the kids on their own games.I enjoyed this book from cover to cover!!! And, there is no book I can recommend more for a player who is above beginner but below expert."},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors","review":"The author is a convicted child molester who fled from justice until recently captured with the help of America's Most Wanted. DO NOT PURCHASE ANY OF HIS BOOKS!"},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors","review":"Review by a 13-year-oldThis is a pretty good book, although I haven't finished it yet. It gives a lot of information and gives a lot of advice. I learned a lot of rules from this book, pyschology, and more!One thing that I would like, however, is a lot more of stuff on endgames, and less on openings. I think that learning about the endgame is a lot more important than memorizing openings.But aside from some things, I really like this book. It's nice to be able to plop down on the couch and review things from it without having to set up a chess board."},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors","review":"A Chess Master and trainer of 36 national scholastic champions tells the secrets behind his training methods and success. How can one trainer in less than a 18 year period personally train so many champions? That is a rate of 2 champions a year!In reality this is a very extensive training guide. Besides providing a lot of instructional material (tactics, openings, endgames, complete games of six selected champions) \\"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors\\" shows,1) How to train and condition before tournaments,2) How to use tournament rules to your favor (shows numerous faults in the rules so you will not be taken advantage of),3) How to conduct yourself during tournaments, chess psychology,4) The importance and use of psychology in chess (including the reasons why we make mistakes in analysis - critical images that affect our thinking process and having the right attitude),5) The lives and profiles of six selected national champions.Photos and humor based on true stories adds a lot of flavor to make this book a joy to read. No tournament player, chess parent or coach should be without this critical guide.

Since this book covers such a very large range of things there will certainly be opinions as to which chapter is most important. What I can guarantee is that unless you are a strong master you will learn many new things in this book.I have read the other reviews as well as this author's other books in his series (with his other 2 books being ranked #1 & #2 chess books on Amazon) and Robert Snyder's books are the most popular series without any doubt.Therefore, I will just point out without going into detail that I consider the chapters on Psychology, Pattern Recognition, Openings and How Tournaments Work to be very unique and outstanding. Each of these chapters deserves an award! This is because the information will definitely improve your game and performances in tournaments."},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors","review":"You will find that this book is loaded with useful information on how to improve your game and a deep insight into the advanced rules a tournament player should know to compete.The author, a highly rated chess master and one of the top chess trainings for youth in the country outlines an Opening System (going into detail on what you should do to study or organize your personal opening system), provides a unique chapter on Chess Psychology (the retailed, inert and forward images are covered showing you faults in the thinking process) with subjects such as motivation, setting goals and self esteme, Endgames that every tournament player should know and a great Tactic Work Book section (over 130 patterns).The book has an interesting biography with example games on the author's selected national champions, adding a real personal touch to the book.There are some enjoyable humor in the book as the author has a great writing style that both kids and adults enjoy.This book is part of the series I use in the classroom to teach."},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors","review":"I give credit to this book for helping me in many ways to win both my school championship tournament and then the county championship.It helped me win the middle school championship by giving me lots of helpful information.This is how it did it,First it taught me to use the patterns in the Tacitical Problems segment of the book. It focuses on the most important tactics that a student (of any age) needs to know. I had a book just on tactics, but there were so many it didn't really show me what was the most important.Second it taught me a great opening system, using simple charts to learn the moves (I have the other book in the series called Unbeatable Chess Lessons For Juniors, which covered the ideas behind the move in the system and more things too).Third it taught me how to prepare for tournaments and corrected some of my mistakes from the past.Fourth I won two endgames in the tournaments using the segment that covered what the most important endgames to know were.And finally Fifth just goin over what the authors other chamions did and their games was inspiring - and lots of fun to read.This book has CHARACTOR! Fun learning. There is some really funning things in the book like stories about the kid who attacked insects during his game and the other kid who flug buggers at his opponent and the kid who called on the great chess genie to help him. This book has some fun stuff for kids that other chess books doesn't have to help kids learn about how to handle themselves against other kids who do strange things during the game like I just mentioned. \\"Call the Tournament Director!\\".If you are a kid you will love this book, if you are a parent you will actually love it too!! This book is much different than the other chess books and will help you improve your game in a fun way!"},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors","review":"I have enjoyed reading EVERY page of this book - from cover to cover!!!As a 7th grade student at Summit middle School that won the state championship last year I will tell you why I THIS BOOK is the best book to get if you are just beyond the basics or have a kid that knows a bit about chess but wants to get better, or a chess coach at a school.It is a CHESS TACTICS WORKBOOK. It gives you a lot of problems to solve that the author has used to train many of his national chess champions. He uses building on problems from a more simple form of the problem containing a pattern to a more complicated useage of the same pattern.It is a book that teaches you about the very problems you have when you think and what to do to give yourself much better chances to win in the chapter on CHESS PSCHOLOGY.It teaches you all about OPENINGS. If you want a great book on OPENINGS then this book will cover an entire system for you. It helps you prepare your system for your own taste and tells you what to do.It has ENDGAMES as a complete basic book on this subject. You don't need to get another book on this subject. However, how to checkmate with King and Queen or Rook and the very must basic King and Pawn against King were already covered in the authors other book, \\"Chess For Juniros\\", so he says it wasn't repeated.It covers a lot of ADVANCED RULES for tournament kids and gives many pointers on this subject. You will not find this stuff anywhere else. So if you want to see what to do in tournaments you must own this book.One last thing. The part of the book on THE AUTHORS CHESS KIDS who became champions of the United States gives you a lot of knowlege on their life and games. Some pictures are there.Wanted to add - THIS BOOK HAS A LOT OF HUMOUROUS THINGS THAT MAKES IF REALLY FUN TO READ."},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors","review":"Robert Snyder's \\"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors\\" is very different from any other chess book I have ever seen. For one thing it covers a lot of material that you will not find in any other chess book.The book assumes you know the very basics (it recommends having read the material in the author's first book, \\"Chess for Juniors\\"). Assuming this the book goes into different aspects of the rules that are important for the tournament player to know. Just reading the \\"Official Rules of Chess\\" will not cover what this book does, as \\"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors\\" points out what is most important for any tournament player to know about the rules, exactly how to handle problems, and points out some problems with the rules (things the \\"Official Rules of Chess\\" doesn't do).How to prepare and condition yourself for tournaments is covered along with a huge section containing a chess tactics workbook (this workbook has well organized problems building on important tactical themes like many books on tactics fail to do), coverage on how to study endgames with coverage of the most important basic endgames (some not so basic - the book skips the very most basic mates covered in the author's first book), extensive advice on how to prepare openings along with a complete recommended opening system (this alone is worth the money paid for the book!), and excellent analysis of games by some of the author's great scholastic chess champions along with a small segment of pictures (adds some real personality to the book) and information on the background of these kids.I have the author's first book, \\"Chess for Juniors\\", which makes the introduction to chess very clear and easy to understand. I would consider this the best second book right after it, which maintains consistancy. However, even without the author's first book, if you know the basics \\"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors\\" would be fantastic for you!"},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors","review":"This book just has so much useful information and instruction that it is hard for me to even to begin to explain it all.

I like the story of the CHESS GENIE!! That is so funny. The authr tells all about some of the national champions he has trained and lets you know about their lives and what they have done to get good. I like the section that shows you how to use rules to your favor. This isn't pointed out in the rule book, but shows you how to make the most of rules. The author stresses honesty, but when you play chess you must be like a lawyer and do what helps you - as long as you are playing fair. The way to condition you self and learn about chess pschology is important and is covered in this book too.There is so much useful stuff in this book.

What stuck out was that the book shows with the correct training any kid, of average talent, can become a strong player. Most of these kids were/are nice people - not cocky abnouxious kids and were well rounded (involved with other sports and activities).

It covers things that the rule book doesn't get into. A must for an kid or adult who players in tournaments! The most important aspects of tournament conditioning are also covered - very nicely done.The author then shows you how to prepare an Opening System - what to look for in the system, setting it up for easy study by using charts and then gives a great example of an opening system (which contains a nicely prepared and very strong - a mini opening book in itself!).One of the nices features of this book is the Pattern Recognition segment, actually about 130 of important tactical problems to solve. This is a fantastic segment, which is almost 1/3 of the book (I would recommend reading this first before getting another book covering tactics).The Endgame segment takes the student from the point where the author's \\"Chess For Juniors\\" book left off (it covered the very basic mates with the Queen and the Rook and the most basic King and Pawn endgame) making the series a great way to student the most important basic endgames in a chessnut shell!The two chapters on the author's national champion students not only contains interesting fun reading, but gives you a fantastic insight into the lives of these champion kids and how they did it. At least one game from each champion with excellent analysis of each game is included.Some things which make this book excellent are the touches of humor throughout the text (some great little stories too!), but also important is the clarity with which it was written making it easy to understand for kids.

I recently had a big improvement just after reading this book after not having improved for some time.Here are the ways it helped me:1) It gave me some new ideas on the rules that other books don't touch on. Have used them two times in actual play.2) It taught me how to prepare and study openings and gave me some improvments in opening variations.3) I have learned how to study tactics better and some of the examples have helped me improve my pattern recognition.4) The endgame section is very nice and covers a lot of the most important endgames I needed to know (I noted the review before mine didn't note the entire endgame chapter because must not have gotten that far in the book yet based on not finishing the book - always best to finish a book before reviewing it!).5) One of my favorite segments in the book is on Chess Psychology! It not only helps you understand why you make mistakes in your thinking process, but teaches you to have self confidence and gives you some real good practical advice.6) It tells you what to do and what not to do to condition yourself before and during play.This book is very different from any other book I have seen. It goes very will with the rest of the CHESS FOR JUNIORS series of books - I especially like the \\"Unbeatable Chess Lessons For Juniors\\" and it's continuation book, \\"More Unbeatable Chess Lessons For Juniors\\".I feel this is a very excellent book!"},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors","review":"\\"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors\\" helped me improve my play and chess rating in tournaments in the following ways,#1.

In the same tournament I used the idea I learned in the pattern recognition - tactics section of the book to win. I ended up winning a nice trophy thanks to things I learned in this book.It also helped me improve my openings by giving me some new variations. The endgame chapter game taught me how to win a game I played in a King and Rook and Pawns endgame. I knew what to do.If want to learn a lot of new things all found in just one book then get Winning Chess Tournaments For Juniors."},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors","review":"So you are beyond a beginning level of play (if you are a beginner start out with CHESS FOR JUNIORS before getting this book) and what to get a book that covers at a book designed to teach you how to learn, plus provide the material. You are now reading the right review on the right book!WINNING CHESS TOURNAMENTS FOR JUNIORS is broken into eight chapters. The first chapter will get you started about how and what to study before going into more advanced rules that every tournament player should know (there are tournament directors who should read the second chapter). Then Chess Psychology on a practical level is covered (contains a lot of useful information including examples on why typical mistakes are made during analysis) before expanding on your opening system (lots of great advice to help you develop your own system with a sample system). What a book that will focus on the most important tactics and checkmating patterns without providing filler problems? The Tactics Chapter provides just that! Lots of problems to work on to improve tactics and checkmate patterns. You will also learn more about the most critical basic endgames. Analyzed games by national champion junior players are at the end.HIGHLY RECOMMEDED FOR ANYONE WHO IS JUST BEYOND THE BEGINNING STAGE!"},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors","review":"WINNING CHESS TOURNAMENTS FOR JUNIORS is a book made to help a player (of any age) improve once they have learned the basic rules and strategy of chess. Once you have completed learning the material in the same author's CHESS FOR JUNIORS then this book will take you directly beyond that.Here is what the book covers that I like,1) It tells you how to improve. How to read other books and make the most of them. What to look for when finding a chess teacher. It tells you how to practice and the dos and don'ts during games. It helps you prepare for tournamnets.2) Though it is not to replace the official rule book it points out the most important rules that a tournament player needs to know. It explains these rules in a manner that makes them understandable (unlike the official rule book). It also points out where there are problems or faults with the rules so that you can be aware of them. It teaches using the rules to your favor but makes it clear that you should never cheat and helps you be prepared for people who might cheat.3) It covers CHESS PSYCHOLOGY. This will help give you confidence and helps you with setting realistic goals to acheive. It also shows the most common reasons why mistakes are made in the thinking process. This is extremely valuable. Do you know what the \\"retailed\\", \\"inert\\" and \\"forward\\" images are? If you don't then for this reason alone get the book!4) It covers how to prepare your openings. It teaches you what to look for in setting up your own opening system. It then provides you with a complete opening system set up in charts. It doesn't give you the ideas behind the moves in this book but if you get UNBEATABLE CHESS LESSONS FOR JUNIORS and MORE UNBEATABLE CHESS FOR JUNIORS the ideas behind these openings, move by move are covered there!5) All the most important endgames that were not already covered in the author's CHESS FOR JUNIORS book are covered in an entire chapter here. If you go through them all you will have an understanding of all the most important basic endgames you will need to know up to expert level.6) Tactics and Pattern Recognition. The author expands on the most important tactics and checkmates that a player needs to know that weren't already covered in CHESS FOR JUNIORS. There are over 130 great tactical problems and checkmates to work on. And, they are well organized and very good to sharpen your skills quickly.7) Profiles of National Scholastic Champions. Six of the author's National Champions at different ages and levels have their games shown, styles discussed and information on their lives. This is interesting and inspiring. Though perhaps the least instructive of the chapters, the games contain some good instruction and analysis.So I say WOW! All this in one book! There is so much to be learned and material you will not find anywhere else. Regardless of you being a tournament or non-tournament player who just wants to improve this book is a MUST for anyone under expert level who beyond the beginner level."},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors","review":"I spent most of my time as a chess player in Germany. Now my kids play chess through their school chess club.There are very few books that offer advice on how to train and especially provide the informations that are needed to improve.Mr. Snyder's \\"WINNING CHESS TOURNAMENTS FOR JUNIORS\\" is the best book available on the subject of training chess kids.The segments on Psychology, Pattern Recognition, Use of rules, how tournaments work, How to prepare before, during and after tournaments, along with opening preparation and studying the endgame is most useful.This is a book that I would highly recommend for any student interested in either just improving their game, training others or doing well in tournaments."},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors","review":"Have you ever wondered what the players at the very top have done to get there? Well here it is!The trainer of over 35 national scholastic champions tells the story of how he trained winners of the NATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL, NATIONAL JUNIOR HIGH, NATIONAL ELEMENTARY, NATIONAL SCHOOL GRADE and NATIONAL YOUTH CHAMPIONSHIPS.This is an ideal follow-up book to the same author's \\"Chess For Juniors\\" book, which does an extensive job of covering the basics.\\"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors\\" will help students, parents and coaches understand what is important for them to know about the workings of tournaments, rules and what to do when problems arise (including examples of typical problems that occur and how to handle them). You will not find such good advice and material elsewhere.How and what should be studied for a student to develop into a well-rounded player (includes how much time and where the focus should be placed). Actual study materials such a sample opening system (what goes into a good opening system and how to prepare it), endgames and more follow-up tactics from where the same author's \\"Chess For Juniors\\" book left off.Half a dozen of the author's students are nicely profiled. First the background about each student is given (along with photos providing a personal touch). At least one analyzed game from each student shows their particular playing style. Some of the games have additional comments made by the student who was playing the game. This makes for a very inspiring book.Now here is a great kicker >>> CHESS PSYCHOLOGY as applied to practical usage! This segment covers what should be done for motivation (i.e. setting of realistic goals) and self-confidence. And then the most common reasons why mistakes are made when a player is doing analysis are covered. This includes negative images such as the INTERT, FORWARD and RETAINED images/ recognizing them is part of eliminating the problems created by them/ if you don't know what they are even the more reason for reading this chapter).If you want to improve efficiently and be at your best when you play then this is perhaps the most important chess book you will ever read!"},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors","review":"When I purchased Winning Chess Lessons for Juniors, I realized it actually contained much less instructional material then I had hoped for. Eventually I realized why and am puzzled as to why no other reviewer pointed this out. It is a companion book to Unbeatable Chess Lessons for Juniors, another book by the Author. This book by itself is inadequate, but I realized it is for owners of the previous book, Unbeatable Chess Lessons for Juniors. This book intentionally dodges around the material covered in Unbeatable Chess Lessons for Juniors so none of it is repeating (This is a good thing).This book is an add-on to Unbeatable Chess Lessons for Juniors, an upgrade if you will. This is a great book, but is to slim to be by itself. Get Unbeatable Chess Lessons for Juniors, and this book, and you should have no problems. As for the material covered in this book, it teaches you about tournaments and their rules. Chapter 3 is a psychology chapter, which is interesting and helpful, but nothing to rave about as other reviewers have. Chapter four shows you opening charts. While this did show me a new way to organize my openings, it didn't teach me much. The author mentioned for teaching that the reader should read Unbeatable Chess Lessons for Juniors. Finally, it has a thick tactics chapter full of useful tactical puzzles(about 100 of them). It contains a nice endgame study chapter, then some annotated games by the authors national champions.All in all a good book... for its intended purpose. I didn't take any stars away because for its purpose as an add on to Unbeatable Chess Lessons for Juniors its great."},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors","review":"As an experienced tournament player I can say with great confidence that this is an excellent book that takes a practical approach to improving your game. It is a well rounded book that addresses the most important things that most people need to know. This includes providing a clear understanding of advanced tournament rules (a must to go along with the 'Official Rules of Chess'). This book points out some of the flaws in these rules. How to go about finding the right chess trainer for you, how and what to study to improve along with much of the materials for actual study are provided (a great section on practical tactics, endgames, openings are provided). I feel the chapter on Chess Psychology is especially good and useful as it points out how typical mistakes are made looking at flaws in the thinking process with materials to correct them. Interesting are the two chapters on the author's great kid chess champions. I feel that anyone wanting to improve their game wil find this book of great value."},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors","review":"I started off with CHESS FOR JUNIORS as my first book by the same author. That is my favorite book for beginners. After reading alot more books after CHESS FOR JUNIORS I like WINNING CHESS TOURNAMENTS FOR JUNIORS more that I am now more advanced.This is because it has a lot of tactical positions to solve and learn from and because it gives me some good opening moves. The endgames are good too.This book is very organized and easy to learn from. It doesn't get overely complicated and takes more difficult ideas and makes them easy to understand. I especially like the games of the authors national chess champions. They have good notes to help figure out what is happening - they are easy to understand too. The author has taught 35 first place winners at the national chess championships. I like some of the funny stuff in the book to.This is a good book for not only me, but my father likes it too and is learning from it. I hope to be a good chess teacher someday like the person who wrote this book."},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors","review":"This is a very unique book. It covers a lot of material you will not find in other books. It is wonderful not only for kids who have a knowledge of the basics but for parents and coaches who want to become aquainted with how tournaments work and how kids (and adults!) should train to compete. This book is one of two books (the other being \\"Unbeatable Chess Lessons for Junioros\\") designed as a follow-up to the author's best seller, \\"Chess For Juniors\\". These three books together make a comprehensive series taking the student from absolute beginning to a proficient Intermediate level tournament player. This book is a \\"must read\\" for any student who is competing in tournaments.The first chapter \\"What it takes to be a successful tournament competitor\\" shows you what to look for in finding a good chess teacher, covers a lot of do's and don'ts, and tournament conditioning.The second chapter \\"How tournaments work\\" explains the inner workings of swiss system tournaments, the rating system, tie breaking systems, chess clocks, recording of moves, the drawn game, illegal moves and positions and more. What is unique is that the move simplifies and focuses on what is most important for scholastic players to know from the rule book. Some of the faults in the rules are also pointed out. If you don't want to spend hours studying the dry rule book then this book makes understanding the most important rules easy. Every parent and coach must read this section!The third chapter \\"Psychology in chess\\" goes into motivation, self confidence, setting goals, playing the board and negative images. Problems that players have with their thinking process and how to correct them are covered.The fourth chapter \\"Preparing an opening system\\" shows how to study openings and how to prepare them. A nice sample opening system is given with some excellent lines for students.The fifth chapter, \\"Pattern Recognition\\" is one of my favorites. This is actually a wonderful workbook containing the most important tactical themes that students need to know beyond the material covered in the author's \\"Chess For Juniors\\" book (which covered basic tactics). It explains just how to go about studying the problems presented in this book and other books containing problems. There is a lot of study material here!The sixth chapter, \\"studying endgames\\" continues with basic endgames for study continuing where \\"Chess For Juniors\\" left off. By the time you finish this chapter you will have learned all the most important basic endgames!The seventh and eighth chapters profile six of the author's national scholastic champions. They are very interesting and fun chapters to read. One or two games from each national champion is provided with some of the games with comments by the kids. It is interesting to learn about the lives of these kids and to note that most of these kids are very well rounded people!The book contains a good touch of humor like the author's \\"Chess For Juniors\\" book. As mentioned this book is a \\"must read\\" for any kid who plays in tournaments as well as the coaches and parents of tournament kids."},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors","review":"This is my absolutely, positively favor chess book of all time. It is like buying many, many books in one.Here is the scoupe:If you want to know what to do at chess tournaments it tells you neat and untold things about how to handle yourself, and how everything works.Though one of my favorite things is the about 130 tactical problems. I got lost in a maze of tactical problems in a couple of tactics books I got before. But this book PIN POINTS what is the very most important positions to learn. I can beleive it becuse the authors students have won more national championships before (I have only been to two, but am working on winning a trophy at least got at 4-6 score in my last - will go to the national 5th grade championships in Orland in December and hope to get a trophy).Let me tell you more. This book also teaches you how to prepare openings. I gives you a complete opening system too, which I like every move.For learning endgames it give you important positions you can trust will be the most helpful. At my school club I just won a game because the position was in the book and I wouldnot have known what to do without it.The section about chess psychology is very helpful. There was alot of stuff there I would have never realized.Last but not least are the last two chapters. The author has taught chess to many champions. This section tells you all about six of them (but his list shows many more). It shows games, and tells all about them. My parents say they might let me take internet lessons from the author and I cannot wait."},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors","review":"There is no other book like this one. It not only provides great information on how to improve your game and what a player should know to compete in tournaments but contains a lot of study material.The section called, \\"Pattern Recognition - the Key to Learning Tactics\\" has much of the problems where you start off with a simple part of a theme and then gives a more complicated use of the same theme. I especially like this format.Another part of the book on \\"Chess Psychology\\" shows you, using examples taken from actual play, of how and why we make mistakes in our analysis. This really helped me learn to improve my thinking process.Though these were my two favorite segments of the book, the Opening and Endgame parts were good as well. I recommend this book for players from about 700 to 1600 USCF playing ability."},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors","review":"As a chess teacher I most highly recommend this book for either a student who has recently learned the game (I suggest he/she has a knowledge of the material covered in the author's first book, \\"Chess For Juniors\\") or a chess teacher who is working with intermediate level students.I also hand this book to parents who are constantly hounding me with questions about how tournaments work (reading wall charts, use of clocks, how parings work, how tie breaking works, how ratings work, etc... - you get the point!). Before a student goes off to play in a major tournament he/she needs to know the material presented in this book.However, what is just as important, and even more important for the classroom, is the chess tactics problems and endgames that are used in the book. The MOST IMPORTANT themes are covered that were not already covered in the author's \\"Chess For Juniors\\" (it is nice to know when you buy the entire series, which included \\"Unbeatable Chess Lessons for Juniors\\" that you aren't getting redundent material) allowing the student/teacher to focus in a limited time on what is most important to learn (much getter than getting a tactics or endgame book that has thousands of positions). I found the opening charts to be useful in giving students an excellent start in forming an opening system. The games by the author's students adds a lot of personality to the book (he uses a limited number of photos and talks about these kids lives and what they did). Like in his first book, \\"Chess For Juniors\\" the author uses some great humor to enhance the reading by young players (warning: some of the stories are so funny you might have your students fall out of their chairs with laughter - you will see what I mean when you get the book!). BUY IT! YOU WILL LOVE THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors","review":"Though I really, really enjoyed reading Robert Snyder's UNBEATABLE CHESS LESSONS FOR JUNIORS I rank this book among the hundreds of chess books I own as the #2 chess book!Every student of chess, every chess parent and every chess teacher & coach MUST own a copy of this book or they will be missing material pointed out (in a very clear and easy to understand manner) that is not to be found in other book.One of my favorite chapters is on PSYCHOLOGY IN CHESS. The exact reasons why typical and often silly mistakes are made is shown to you! And, then the chapter on TACTICS/PATTERN RECOGNITION will help you correct these typical mistakes.Though this is not specifically designed as a rule book it covers the most important rules and helps you to focus on them that are advanced rules that apply to tournament play. If you are an experienced scholastic player like myself then at first you might think, \\"I know all that\\". But NO YOU DON'T! Some of the things covered in this chapter are so very important (some things you didn't know about if someone makes an illegal move where the official rules have a flaw).How do you prepare your openings? Well details on what to look for and hwo to prepare in the opening is a neat part of this book. It has an entire opening system outlined for you as well. You can certainly use what you like and discard what you don't - but the lines are strong and sound and awesome!This book is part of Robert Snyder's CHESS FOR JUNIORS series, simply the best series and best books on chess ever in print!"},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors","review":"I just completed a review on CHESS FOR JUNIORS (the basic book leading to WINNING CHESS TOURNAMENTS FOR JUNIORS in this great series) and will do one on IDEAS BEHIND THE CHESS OPENINGS.After finishing with CHESS FOR JUNIORS I obtained in this series WINNING CHESS TOURNAMENTS FOR JUNIORS and UNBEATABLE CHESS LESSONS FOR JUNIORS, and excellent but not in this series, IDEAS BEHIND THE CHESS OPENINGS.WINNING CHESS TOURNAMENTS FOR JUNIORS continues with a wide variety of excellent material designed to further enhance what covered in CHESS FOR JUNIORS. It maintains consistency, not repeating the same material. Though not in a lesson building format (like CHESS FOR JUNIORS) it branches off into provide complete chapters on selected subjects. I feel this is good once the basics are introduced. I would recommend this book for ages 7+ to adult who are 700+ ability on the USCF rating scale. Therefore, this book is for an advanced beginner through intermediate.Some of the material in this book, which makes it worthy of 5 stars is,a. Pattern Recognition - The Key to Learning Tactics. The author gives approximately 130 of what are the most important patterns to be learned using tactical problems to solve. This is like a small tactics book in itself. I like the idea of packing this into a limited number of examples. Excellent for the classroom with limited time (I don't need a book with thousands of examples making it hard to select the most important - this book does the selection for you!).b. Studying Endgames. Once again this is like a small book in itself. It covers the very most important basic endgames (the author leaves of out the things already covered in his previous book so not to repeat himself). I also found this useful for classroom use once the students have learned the very basic King and Pawn endgame and how to checkmate with a King and Queen and King and Rook.c. Preparing an Opening System - Setting up opening charts. I don't spend a lot of time teaching openings in the classroom. However, this gives some excellent ideas on developing your own opening system. The actual charts give a nice and somewhat comprehensive outline an entire recommended opening system. It is like a mini opening book with lines.d. How Tournaments Work and How to Use Rules to your favor. This is great for teachers, students and parents who want to know how tournament are run (covers reading wall charts, the Swiss system tournament, tie breaking systems, USCF rating system, Use of the Chess Clock, Tournament Directors, Illegal moves, drawn games, conduct during tournaments and much more). This takes the very thick rule book and condenses the most important parts that a player needs to know while making it easy to understand.e. What it takes to be a successful tournament competitor. This tells you what to do to find the right chess teacher for you, about studying chess, distorting pattern recognition, why you should not play bughouse chess, and conditioning yourself for tournaments. Every student who plays in tournaments should read this chapter (it is the first one!).f. Psychology in chess. Now this is a very unique chapter. It is so jam packed with practical information you must read it! It covers motivation, setting up reasonable goals, self confidence, playing the board instead of the person (and gives a few exceptions to this rule), Analysis and Evaluation (goes into why we make mistakes when analyzing because of negative images - it provides some excellent examples).g. My National Champions. It is interesting to learn about some of the author's championship kids. What made these kids champions? How did they play? What kind of lives did they lead? What are they doing today? What kind of personalities did they have? These and other questions are answered and provide a wonderful insight into the makings of champions.This is a very different type of chess book. It contains the perfect material for teachers to use in the classroom and students to study and learn from. I suggest getting this book if you are just beyond learning or covering basic materials."},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors","review":"You don't need to go out and buy a separate rule book, tactics book, endgame book, and opening book until you read this one first. It takes you just beyond the very basics in a most skillful manner. The author's success with his CHESS FOR JUNIORS and UNBEATABLE CHESS LESSONS FOR JUNIORS shines on this book, which adds a lot more valuable material and information to his previous books. If you are weak at any point of your game or simply want to know what to do to improve along with having the learning material to go along with it then get WINNING CHESS TOURNAMENTS FOR JUNIORS. The author is clear in making the material understandable for anyone age 9 to 90! If you are an adult don't shy away because of the \\"Juniors\\" in the title - the book is only just that much easier to grasp for us older dudes.

Snyder uses the (for Juniors) ie: Winning chess for juniors. Anyways, I came across books by Robert Snyder from the publisher chess for Everyone. And it would appear that all the chess for Juniors have become chess for Everyone. Some examples: Unbeatable chess Lessons, More unbeatable chess Lessons, Chess traps, and Winning chess tournaments. My question is are these books the same just with different covers or are they different in any significant way?"},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors","review":"With this third book, Robert Snyder has produced another excellent volume for the intermediate level chess player. Building on his \\"Chess for Juniors\\", he introduces players to the world of chess tournaments. He gives practical advice about rules, training, and psychological preparation. He shows how to understand what for many beginners is a complete mystery--the tournament Wall Chart. The book has several complete annotated games played by his students (past and present) to show the mental workings of the student mind. As if this weren't enough, the book has:1) practical examples of developing an opening system by giving the complete sample chart of such a system,2) exercises in pattern recognition by giving 125 important tactical problems, and3) endgame exercise using 35 of the most important endgame types to know for practical play.Any student would do well to study all of the books in the series by Mr. Snyder. A fourth book is due to be published next year; it is a sequel to his \\"Unbeatable Chess Lessons for Juniors\\" (More Unbeatable Chess Lessons for Juniors). The final volume will be for advanced students and have 24 games with in-depth annotations and yet have the same quality and clarity of the previous books."},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors","review":"Simply put - there isn't another chess book on this planet that packs so much useful information for the scholastic tournament player. This book should also be read by parents of chess kids and their coaches.Before you or your child reads the \\"Official Rules of Chess\\" read this one first. An outstanding virtue of this book is that it makes understanding advanced tournament rules easy and shows you like no other book how to use rules to your favor. There are some things that even adult tournament players with years of experience would benefit from.Tournament preparation and how and what to study along with additional recommended books are nicely covered. Though I could have probably listed a couple more books, every book recommended in this one are good.Extensive coverage of tactics (includes about 135 practical examples of what every student needs to know), openings (an entire opening system as an example chart is provided - this contains some awesome lines - and this segment shows what should go into your opening system), endgames (a mini endgame book focusing on the most important practical endgames you should know), chess psychology (different images that effect your game - know these are a must - as well as improving your self confidence and appearance at the board!) and the kid champions of the author are highlighted along with some of their games with full analysis.This book is certainly a showcase for the author. But justifiable since the author holds the record (according to the statistics) for having trained more first place winners in championship sections at the national scholastic championships. Basically, the author shows his methods for producing champions and reveals perhaps the most useful information available on the subject. The only possible drawbacks are that the author is obviously set in his ways (i.e. he recommends against playing bughouse or other chess variations, but provides some convincing information why he doesn't recommend it) and even the author stated in so many words that the opening system provided might not be for everyone.An important note: This book is an intermediate level book which is part of a series of books for the scholastic player. If you are a beginner first get the author's \\"Chess For Juniors\\" book. The other intermediate level book (an excellent supplement to this one) is \\"Unbeatable Chess Lessons for Juniors\\". I had the opportunity to attend one of the author's lectures and book signings. He was able to teach, entertain and hold the attention of over 60 children (plus 60+ parents) for an entire hour with the zest of the best stage actor I have seen. This author's books are the next best thing to having him live to teach you."},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors","review":"Chess Master Robert M. Snyder shows you exactly what you need to know and what it takes to make you a tournament winner! I am a chess coach who has attended more than one national scholastic championship. When I have been at the nationals with students I have personally met the author, who is often a game analyst at the nationals (his donated time during his book signings there is very much appreciated!). Mr. Snyder has a fun and dynamic approach to teaching chess and has produced more national chess champions than any other chess teacher in the history of the United States.In \\"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors\\" Mr. Snyder reveals his secrets to success! This is not only a must read for any student who plays or plans to play in tournaments, but also for parents and coaches.Let us take the first chapter called, \\"What it Takes to Be a Successful Tournament Competitor\\". The author shows the importance of finding the right chess teacher for a student and exactly what to look for in your search, giving points of evaluation. Reading other books and the practical aspect of practicing by playing are covered. Then some good pointers on \\"tournament conditioning\\" are covered. These are all going to help you greatly improve your performance at tournaments.The second chapter, \\"How Tournaments Work and How to Use Rules to Your Favor\\" covers the most important tournament rules in a simple and easy way to understand them. How to specifically apply the rules and stand up for your rights makes this segment a great addition to simply having read the rule book. The inner workings of tournaments are covered without the complexities involved in the actual rule book. This segment is not a replacement for the official rulebook, but condenses its most important aspects from a practical player's point of view. It makes the rule book far more understandable and points out some problems with the rules that the official rule book doesn't touch.The third chapter, \\"Psychology in Chess\\" is just awesome! In addition to covering the important topics of Motivation, Self Confidence and Playing the Board instead of the Person, it provides a wonderful insight into faults in your thinking process and how to correct them! It does this by pointing out exactly what the \\"Retained, \\"Inert\\" and \\"Forward\\" images are - the most common reasons why we analysis and have a fault in our ability of come to the right conclusion.

You may not want to use every aspect of the provided system, but almost every player with find it a useful guide with great ideas for your own system. You will not be going in circles constantly in search of what is right for you after reading this chapter.The fifth chapter, \\"Pattern Recognition - the Key to Learning Tactics\\" is the largest of the chapters. It contains over 130 positions to form a great tactics workbook. Mr. Snyder takes from the lessons his gives to his students the \\"very most important\\" patterns that a player should know in practical play and lays them out for you in a condensed form. In other words you may find books containing thousands of problems, but this chapter condenses the most important ones for you. I can recommend getting a book like \\"Polgar's 5334 Problems\\" massive work, but only after you have started out with this chapter first. This chapter also tells you exactly how to use this and other tactics books in the most effective way! Mr. Snyder didn't repeat the tactical material he already covered in his most famous \\"Chess for Juniors\\" (the #1 Bestselling Chess Book in the US). If you are a player rated under 1000 I advise also getting that book.The sixth chapter, \\"Studying Endgames\\" tells you from a practical standpoint what you should do learn endgames and provides you with a condensed endgame text. However, Mr. Snyder avoided repeating the most basic material on endgames covered in the previously mentioned \\"Chess for Juniors\\". So if you are a beginner, you should also have his first book in this series as well.The seventh and eight chapters, \\"My National Scholastic Champions\\" covers a total of six of Mr. Snyder's selected champions. There are nice photographs, biographies and games from these players. The games are nicely analyzed and the last chapter also has commentary from the kids themselves. This gives additional insight into what it takes to be a champion by providing practical examples of what these kids were like and what they did to become a national champion.Robert M. Snyder has done a wonderful service to the chess community by writing the most comprehensive and accurate series of chess books designed for young players, coaches and parents. Together, \\"Chess for Juniors\\", \\"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors\\" and \\"Unbeatable Chess Lessons for Juniors\\" and soon to be published \\"More Unbeatable Chess for Juniors\\" (according to the author, he most advanced book in the series, containing the most detailed and accurate up to date analysis on numerous important openings along with detailed analysis of entire games) this will take a player from absolute beginner to expert level."},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors","review":"If you know already know the very basics (if you don't know the basics skip this book and get CHESS FOR JUNIORS) you will not find a single other book (or series of chess books for that matter) that tells you what this book does. SECREATS OF SUCCESS by the most successful teacher in the United States of all time (35 first place winners at the national championships - intruction of chess to over 160,000 children by the author personally, both national and world records at both levels).This book will teach you the pattern recognition you need to make you great and covers all aspects of chess like no other chess book ever written!

It is very easy to understand for someone in 6th grade."},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors","review":"I like doing book reviews and often like to compare books that are alike. But I cannot do this here because this book is very unique. This is one reason why it deserves 5 stars as it reaches the reader covering things you will not find in other books, or will need to buy many different books to get some of the informations in this book.It gives great advice on things to do and not to do during, before and after chess tournaments. This includes things like looking for a proper chess teacher (this will help you find the right teacher for you) and how to condition yourself (I was doing some stuff that I realized was huring my play during tournaments and this book pointed that out).It has a lot of study material on tactics, endgames and openings to give you solid information and help your pattern regnition. The part of chess psychology is great.This book is like owning a lot of other books put together and all designed to help you improve by giving you things not easy to find in other books."},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors","review":"I have played in rated tournaments and felt I knew what was most important to not only improve my game but to condition myself and prepare for tournaments.However, after reading this book I realized just how little I knew!

I gained so much knowledge from this book it was amazing."},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors","review":"There is one chapter that I really, really like above all the rest.

As mentioned also get HOW TO BEAT YOUR DAD AT CHESS along with this one."},{"Title":"The Cleveland Indians (Putnam Pennant Series, The Big League Library)","review":"This book is one of those special web gems that has fortunately found its way back into print.Penned in 1949 by Franklin \\"Whitey\\" Lewis, the history of Cleveland professional baseball and the Indians came on the heels of the 1948 World Series victory that made for an incredible season in the cavernous Municipal Stadium that rocked to a number of attendance records in Major League Baseball.There are features on the stars over the years - including Cy Young, Nap Lajoie, Addie Joss and Tris Speaker - with particular emphasis on the 1948 season and flamboyant owner Bill Veeck, fireballer \\"Rapid\\" Robert Feller and Larry Doby. Of particular interest is a published box score from 1871, the first that used the system developed by baseball writer Henry Chadwick, which has major elements that are still used today.There is a wealth of photographs and an interesting foreward written by Cleveland baseball historian Russell Schneider. While the book has particular regional interest, it will be an all-star addition to the library of any baseball fan who enjoys taking a step back in time on a field of dreams."},{"Title":"The Battleship Boy's First Step Upward, or Winning Their Grades as Petty Officers","review":"This is an interesting book in that it was written almost 100 years ago and there is a much different writing style than in current writings. Further, it deals with patriotism, honour and doing your duty from the viewpoint of the main characters of the book more so than is now the norm. The main characters also have an aura of innocence about them which makes them rather likeable. It was a good read and also gives you an idea about shipboard life around the time of World War One. It was a good adventure."},{"Title":"The Gift of Hospitality: In Church, in the Home, in All of Life","review":"This book reaches out to the person deep inside me and sharestips on hospitality. Reading this book was easy for me, as I found Icould really relate first hand to her subjects. Using first handexperiences and examples, the author illustrates how to become more hospitable. Hospitality in our churches, in our home life, in our marriage, and yes even at work has become a lost art. When faced with a truly giving experience, we are often uncomfortable.Deila Halverson, in her easy to read guidebook, takes us through the front door of churches she has visited and homes she has been in. Once in the door, she shows us ways to make things more welcoming, more inclusive to all.This is a highly recommended source to anyone who is looking into how to make their church more user friendly, more warm and welcoming or how to improve their time spent with friends and family.The author covers hospitality from a biblical perspective as it relates to:Giving and Receiving Welcoming Speaking and listening Celebrating events and people serving others Healing and comforting others and hospitality overall as a mission."},{"Title":"My First Photo Album (Cartwheel Cloth Books)","review":"This terrific book lets your baby \\"take along\\" photos of grandparents, pets -- the little strap with velcro helps attach it to a car seat, Pack & Play or wherever. The \\"crinkly\\" pages attract baby's attention and the cloth can be chewed and drooled on without ruining the photos. There's also a little baby-safe mirror on the back cover, which is a nice feature. The only negatives: I wish it had space for a few more photos, and you have to be careful not to leave it in a hot car because the heat will warp the plastic, which sort of mutilates the book. Our son still likes his little warped book, and the photos only suffered minor damage. I wouldn't recommend using irreplacable photos -- but I don't suppose anyone would do that with a book that's meant to be enjoyed by a baby anyway. Overall, a nice little book."},{"Title":"My First Photo Album (Cartwheel Cloth Books)","review":"Despite the fact that I could not find a clear statement of how many photoes the book holds, I went ahead and got it. It holds 4 photos (for those of you wondering). It is a good book with nice features others have complimented - it is cute and cuddly. If you have more than 4 people you want your baby to look at, though, you'll need to get them in a photo together!"},{"Title":"My First Photo Album (Cartwheel Cloth Books)","review":"This book is great for long distance grandparents. You can send pictures of the entire family that the baby doesn't see very often. Our grandson loved the bright colors, the crinkly sound of the pages, the squeaker and the mirror on the back. This will help him recognize us the next time he sees us. The book has 4 pages for pictures."},{"Title":"My First Photo Album (Cartwheel Cloth Books)","review":"My 9 month old daughter loves this book! It is adorable.

The teddy bear cover is adorable. It holds 4 pictures and also has little character pics on the opposite pages of the phots. The back is also a mirror so the baby can see him/herself. I HIGHLY recommend this for any chid. Most babies love pics so this way they can look at them and not ruin them.

I was very surprised to get the phone call from Steve Swanbeck and even more surpised to see that my story made the cut. I was very impressed that he got the story about Dallie 100% correct. The other stories were wonderful as well - full of inspiring people. I have read other books similar to this and some of them can be depressing and heartwrenching. I am pleased to report that this book is one that leaves one feeling that there are good people in this world and that happy endings do exist. Also, kudos to Mr. Swanbeck for donating part of his proceeds to help homeless animals. I am a firm believer in less talk more action."},{"Title":"Disposable Dogs: Heartwarming, True Stories of Courage and Compassion","review":"The precious face on the cover of this book sets the tone perfectly. And the description beneath the picture says it all. Heartwarming, True Stories of COURAGE and COMPASSION. Seventy dogs are written about and you'll feel like you've known each one of them. You'll laugh and you'll cry about them and for them. A particular favorite is Keeley who was shot and left for dead, but she always had the will to live, and did. \\"Humans could take a lesson from dogs who have suffered but refused to give up. They never look back. They just pick up and go forward.\\" Amen to that."},{"Title":"Disposable Dogs: Heartwarming, True Stories of Courage and Compassion","review":"I enjoyed this book about \\"throw away\\" dogs and how they persevered through lots of suffering.

In a time when the world as we know it can be cruel to mans best friend, it lets the readers know how kindness and compassion is still prevalent. It makes you realize how much hope and love abandoned dogs and cats can still give us after their hard and sometimes heartbreaking events."},{"Title":"Disposable Dogs: Heartwarming, True Stories of Courage and Compassion","review":"To think that these dogs were disposed! How many more have died suffering or been euthanazed - what wasted lives! But their luck turned around and for it, both people and these dogs lives were enriched; some even saved their saviours.I think the message this book tries to send out is: next time you see a stray, don't think of it as a nuisance but a life that has value and deserves to be on this planet; a life that could have given so much love and care, if only his/her circumstances were different.It's a good read, if only just to enlighten people."},{"Title":"Disposable Dogs: Heartwarming, True Stories of Courage and Compassion","review":"For the dog lover - an insight in to the stories and lives of very special dogs.A must read for dog lovers."},{"Title":"Disposable Dogs: Heartwarming, True Stories of Courage and Compassion","review":"A very pleasant book for dog lovers. It's a rather simple book with a collection of brief stories about various dogs and how they have impacted the lives of humans in a positive way. Most of the dogs featured are rescue dogs and many have been seriously abused. Some were so abused that they faced euthanasia but a wag of a tail showed their determination to live. All of the dogs show love and compassion to their humans and some become true heroes in every sense of the word. Others simply give their humans a reason to live and to smile again. Most of the stories are about the unconditional love dogs give us even when humans have been far from kind to them. I'd guess the author collected a number of stories about dogs and combined them into a book. It's a nice collection of sweet stories where most, but not all, have happy endings, but in every story a human was touched by the love and compassion of a dog"},{"Title":"Disposable Dogs: Heartwarming, True Stories of Courage and Compassion","review":"On the surface, this is a wonderful collection of stories about dogs who were given a second chance. That, by itself, is enough. But I think there is an underlying subtext here about the element of disposability in our culture. If something is inconvenient, we don't want it. It something isn't perfect right away, we don't want to work at making it better...it's easier to just cast it aside. Perhaps I'm just getting older, but it seems like people tend to want things faster and faster nowadays if they don't get what they want exactly when they want it with minimal effort---look out! It's \\"easier\\" to run to a breeder (or, worse, a pet store), plunk down the Visa, and walk out with a purebred puppy than it is to visit a shelter, take time to learn about they type of dog that's the best match for your home, and work through the hiccups that often accompany shelter dog adoption. But, as any rescue dog adoptor will tell you, the rewards that come with shelter dog adoption are absolutely priceless! Kudos to the author for reminding the reader of that fact!Matilda Mae: The Dog Who Needed a Name"},{"Title":"Disposable Dogs: Heartwarming, True Stories of Courage and Compassion","review":"This is several short inspiring stories. It's a book you can read just as many short stories as you have time for. Each one will make you realize how special throw away pets can be.

This book touched me, made me angry, made me cry, and made me cherish and look at my four dogs in a completely different way. I thank the author for showing me that the bond of love between humans and animals is something I had been taking for granted. And for those who haven't experienced it, they are missing something more precious than any gem on Earth."},{"Title":"Disposable Dogs: Heartwarming, True Stories of Courage and Compassion","review":"As an advocate for animal welfare and volunteer at multiple shelters, I was really excited to read this book. However, to my disappointment it is not very well written...the stories are underdeveloped and boring.

However, I do applaud the idea behind the book and wish more people had compassion for animals."},{"Title":"Disposable Dogs: Heartwarming, True Stories of Courage and Compassion","review":"Disposable Dogs: Heartwarming, True Stories of Courage and CompassionThis book is like so many about homeless animals it doesn't tell the reader about the most successfuf program in North America. Everyone spends so much time doing what PETA and HSUS say when in reality these organizations want to end animal ownership altogether. The No kill shelters seem to be working. The best one is Calgary and they have no laws against pets in any form and they have 95% compliance which makes their programs pay for themselves. \\"The Best Animal Control Program in North America\\"None of the 5000 dogs a year that end up in Calgary, Canada shelters are euthanized for population control. The dog licensing rate is over 90%, where 10-30% is the norm in the US. Many stray pets that are picked up by Calgary Animal Services are returned straight home, they aren't impounded. This saves money and it saves lives. It also ensures that the owner will license the pet as its the only way it can get a ride back home.Over the past 18 years, the city of Calgary has cut their number of dog bites and chases by more than 50% (all the while, the human and dog population of Calgary has doubled). The taxpayers of Calgary pay nothing for this excellent service. It's all paid for by pet licensing fees. \\"Your pet's license is his ticket home\\" is the motto.Calgary, when it comes to animal control, is the envy of the continent.The leader of this superb organization is Bill Bruce.no - mandatory spay/neuterno - breed specific legislationno - pet limit lawsno - anti-tethering lawsyes - providing valued services rather than simply punishing citizens into complianceyes - buy in and cooperation among community stakeholdersyes - extensive education and PR campaign to emphasize responsible pet ownershipyes - low license fees and modest fee differential for intact petsCalgary's phenomenal success depends on a sense of trust among pet owners that they will be treated fairly by and obtain good services from Calgary Animal Services. Trust makes for unprecedented high licensing compliance. High licensing compliance means that the taxpayers do not foot the bill for animal services, and it means that nearly all stray pets are quickly reunited with their owners which saves lives and keeps costs low. There is no way to achieve this kind of licensing compliance in an environment where citizens feel they must hide their dogs and cats from pet limit laws, BSL, or mandatory spay/neuter laws. Without the voluntary licensing compliance of 95% of the population, none of the rest of the success could have happened."},{"Title":"Disposable Dogs: Heartwarming, True Stories of Courage and Compassion","review":"Too juvenile for adults, and not likely that children would really enjoy it."},{"Title":"Digital Transformation: The Essentials of e-Business Leadership","review":"I bought the book on the basis of two criterion: the authors are managers or former managers of KPMG and customer reviews were rather good. Well, these 2 criterion do not seem to be entirely reliable! The book is very short, printed with big fonts like a book for children, you read it in 1 hour and you wonder: what have I found there that I have not read many times before in, for instance, Business Week? Well, the answer is: nothing.You get all the clich&eacute;s of e-business or the synthesis of other writers' work without any original ideas. The book is full of &quot;You need to be cutting edge to succeed&quot; (p.87) or &quot;You can't escape change&quot; (p.42)... No, really?! The chapter 7 for intance raises an interesting question: &quot;Do It In-House or Spin It Off?&quot;. The authors say: Clayton Christensen gave the answer in its best-seller &quot;The Innovator's Dilemma&quot;... And the 10 pages of the chapter are indeed a comment of Christensen. Hello! Has KPMG really nothing to say on this important topic?! Even the examples that are given are so broad in their purpose that you cannot do anything with them. I think that I have never read any book on e-business that is, I must say, so thin in terms of content. I hope that KPMG has something better to offer to their customers!"},{"Title":"Digital Transformation: The Essentials of e-Business Leadership","review":"It always amazes when consulting firms produce tomes such as these with the expectation that a relatively shallow skimming of the waters combined with quotes from firm clients is enough to impart &quot;wisdom to the masses&quot;. Even as a KPMG advertisement it fails; there is not enough depth, thought, or original thinking to interest anyone in retaining them to help &quot;transform&quot; their business. In the pantheon of business books it ranks near the bottom - stick with some of the classics, or better yet - read HBR, Wired, Upside, or Red Herring for a better picture of digital trends and their impact on business."},{"Title":"Digital Transformation: The Essentials of e-Business Leadership","review":"Ever notice how the really good teachers (the ones with the deepest subject knowledge) are also those who impart their wisdom the most succinctly and simply?This is what Patel and McCarthy have done with Digital Transformation, a thoughtful, pragmatic discussion of what being an eBusiness really means.The book is short enough that most folks could polish it off on a five hour flight - a welcome departure from the blathery eBiz treatises that occupy most bookstore shelf space (whose main aim seems to be the self-aggrandisement of the author).In Digital Transformation, Patel and McCarthy underscore that eBusiness is less about the ubiquitous dot com appendage and its accessories than it is about using technology to redefine a company's business strategy and means of delivering on it.The discourse is peppered with interesting commentary from such eBusiness mavericks as John Chambers (Cisco), Vint Cerf, Priceline CEO Dan Schulman and Dave Wetherell of CMGI fame.Now, if only other business books could be as simple and relevant, there'd be more shady trees under which to read them."},{"Title":"Digital Transformation: The Essentials of e-Business Leadership","review":"This book is well written, and I think it succeeds in providing an entertaining strategic view of e-Business success factors. The following chapter descriptions may help the reader decide to pick it off the shelf.Chapter 1 Who's Winning at e-Business? -- an overview of successes (CISCO and Intel) and non-successes (IBM and Levi Strauss) at making the jump to successful e-business selling over the Internet.Chapter 2 The Vision Thing -- the core of the book's approach, which emphasizes that successful e-business transformation begins with generating a vision of what the expected e-business will become as an Internet presence. This e-Vision generation process must be the heart of any approach to starting an e-business effort.Chapter 3 Transformation -- detail about how companies must commit to transformation of their business model in order to succeed at e-business. This applies mainly to bricks-and-mortar companies that have not made the e-business leap.Chapter 4 First-Over Advantages and New Business Models -- describes how good business models enable first-to-market companies to establish huge Internet presence in spite of lack of profitability or bricks-and-mortar tangibility.Chapter 5 The B2B Challenges -- details the success of CISCO and Intel into completely transforming their business-to-business relationships into Internet e-businesses.Chapter 6 The B2C Challenges -- details the experiences and difficulties of dot-com companies in selling to customers directly over the Web, and in establishing themselves as Web presences.Chapter 7 Do It In-house or Spin It Off -- looks at the experience of established companies that created in-house Internet departments and then had to decide whether to keep or spin off the successful efforts. Explores the idea of &quot;disruptive technology&quot; that clashes with the current culture/business model versus &quot;sustaining technology&quot; that enables further success of the current culture/model. Looks at several industries, from automotive to brokerage.Chapter 8 Preparing for the Unpredictable -- looks at surprising occurrences in recent past of Internet e-business, and discusses similar expectations for the future. Again there is an emphasis on vision and business model in trying to predict how the future will develop. This chapter is a fun one to read. Contains predictions from many of e-industry's founders and leaders about how the future will develop. Wireless transformation is high among them."},{"Title":"Digital Transformation: The Essentials of e-Business Leadership","review":"A lot of people have have made negative comments about this book because it does not give new ideas. This book is not going to provide you with any technical solutions to develope your e-business but it was also not meant to do that. It gives the non-experiened e-businessperson the rules and how to formulate your own vision to how your company should function. It also explains what has changed in business cycle due to the e-commerce factor. I found it was explained very clearly for anybody to understand. The target audience for this book is somebody who is new to e-commerce."},{"Title":"Digital Transformation: The Essentials of e-Business Leadership","review":"With so much Internet hype over the past few years, it is refreshing to see a common sense analysis of how to integrate the new ecommerce concepts into your business. McCarthy brings a refreshingly clear and understandable perspective to the ecommerce challenge. This book is a must read for senior executives struggling to develop an Internet strategy. I read it in one sitting, and found myself writing action items in the margins of almost every chapter. By the end, you are looking for McCarthy's phone number, for KPMG obviously has thought long and hard about how to adapt your business to the ecommerce age. This is an exceptional book. It is succinct, imaginative, and practical. Buy it. Read it. Use it. If you don't, your competitors will."},{"Title":"Digital Transformation: The Essentials of e-Business Leadership","review":"This is a good book to get a quick study on some basic e-business, however, it is dated and does certainly not intent to spark any ideas.If you desire to read stuff more profound and more connected to real business, pick something else, for example, 'Seven Steps to Nirvana' from Mohan Sahwney from Kellogg School of Management."},{"Title":"Digital Transformation: The Essentials of e-Business Leadership","review":"short with no content.. every book on e business is better. author must have read a few articles and thought he could write"},{"Title":"Digital Transformation: The Essentials of e-Business Leadership","review":"Very disappointed.

Waste of money."},{"Title":"Digital Transformation: The Essentials of e-Business Leadership","review":"This book is a brief description of the impact of the Internet on Businesses of all kind. It starts with b2b e-business success stories like Cisco, FedEx and Ingram Micro whose business volumes on the web is several hundred fold greater than more popular b2c companies like Amazon.Com and Yahoo !. The most important factor to succeed in e-business starts with the right vision of the top management and the book provides a simple and effective framework that integrates business and technology drivers with the e-business strategy.&quot;Digital Transformation&quot; as defined by KPMG is not just the conversion of text, images, voice and video into digital form but also involves the changes in the business processes associated with them. Once the vision and strategy are in place it is important to move fast and get the &quot;first mover advantage&quot; since in the new economy it is the first movers who walk away with all the marbles.One chapter each is devoted to b2b and b2c challenges and in each case the business model is brought out well.The authors then borrow the concept of &quot; disruptive technology&quot; - the term coined by Prof Clayton Christensen in his book &quot; The innovators dilemma&quot;. The web as a disruptive technology and what this means to diverse industries - Travel, Broking, Automobiles is quite interesting. In fact I have started reading &quot; Innovator's Dilemma&quot; once again.The final chapter is devoted to future trends ( and threats !).An excellent summary of what it means to be transformed- Digitally, in just about 120 pages."},{"Title":"Digital Transformation: The Essentials of e-Business Leadership","review":"Patel &amp; McCarthy have written a compelling book that is short yet filled with valuable information. As the race to ecommerce gets white hot, the subjects of this book are being discussed and debated in board rooms, via e-mail, during kids sporting events and even during dinner. My favorite chapter was &quot;Do It In-House or Spin It Off?&quot; valuable for those trying to catch up. A one sitting read that you will go back to again and again."},{"Title":"Digital Transformation: The Essentials of e-Business Leadership","review":"Patel, one of the most notorious used-car salesmen in the Big Five consulting world, has most assuredly reserved his place in the clueless hall of fame with this book. Rather than focusing on those who make or break eBusiness initiatives, the dreaded &quot;Customers&quot;, Patel chooses to buy into the nonsense that large organizations should rebuild themselves around their technology.Of course, this is the same line the Big 5 have been handing their clients for years, first with ERP, then CRM, and now &quot;eBusiness&quot;. Can you think of the last time a Big 5 firm actually &quot;transformed&quot; a Fortune 500 company?

All the more amazing is that this barren place was the center of the Anasazi civilization. The Great House of Pueblo Bonito is the largest pre-historic building north of Mexico, counting 800 rooms and constructed about 1,000 years ago.Chaco is mysterious and this book of seventeen essays by authorities in several fields explores those mysteries. One is given the point of view of the scholars as well as representatives of the Pueblo, Hopi, and the Navajo Indians. Good charts, maps, and photos, some in color, support the text. Perhaps the most interesting of all the mysteries is how the Anasazi fed themselves in this unpromising environment and a brief sidebar talks about Chaco agriculture -- although not enough.The most interesting essay in the book is titled \\"The Chaco Navajos\\" and is about the coming of the Navajos, the Spaniards, and the Anglos to Chaco Canyon long after the Anasazi had disappeared. Included is a brief account of pioneer archaeologist, Richard Wetherill, killed in a gunfight with a Navajo in 1910. \\"Richard Wetherill Anasazi\\" by Frank McNitt is a fine biography of Wetherill, a character worthy of legend.\\"In Search of Chaco\\" is an attractive, up-to-date look at current theories and thinking about Chaco. One suspects there's a lot more to learn. One quibble: I despise the politically correct term \\"Ancestral Pueblo\\" used by the scholars for the people who built Chaco. The old and romantic name, \\"Anasazi,\\" is far preferable.Smallchief"},{"Title":"Final Fantasy XII Strategy Guide","review":"The item was received in the condition advertised and timely. the experience was excellent"},{"Title":"Final Fantasy XII Strategy Guide","review":"Final Fantasy XII is an incredible experience. There are tons of secrets and easter eggs to find. I'd love to tell you that this guide will you help you completely master Final Fantasy XII, but that's only half true. While it'll get you through the main game, there is a lot of information that just isn't here. For a guide as thick as this, it shouldn't miss anything... but it does.The Limited Edition guide comes in a nice portfolio with a nice cover. Inside the portfolio is an art book with some great artwork. And it comes with the guide itself. It's not really enough to justify forking over an additional ten bucks for, but if you like artwork it's a really nice book. The main guide itself comes with a special cover as well. It'll be one of the six main characters from the game on the cover. The inner workings of the guide, however, are no different from the original.The guide begins in standard fare, by giving you a little intro and telling you about the characters. Within this section they'll also tell you about character relationships toward one another. Unless you play through the game you wouldn't understand most of it.After all the intro stuff the guide then talks about all the unique systems that Final Fantasy XII has to offer. It begins with the license board, showing you where all the license on the board are located. This is extremely helpful since within the game they don't show you. It makes it so you don't have to guess. It's also nice that they talk about each section and show it to you separately as well, since the full board is a little hard on the eyes.They don't tell you much about Gambits. They give you a basic rundown and show you an example of how they work, but aside from that they give you no tips whatsoever. Such as examples of how a party might set them up. In the long run this isn't troublesome in the slightest. For the novice who doesn't understand the complex Gambit system... it's a pain.There's a huge rundown of the battle system. Complete with tips and everything. From the basic of basic, to the complexities and giving you tips on how to restore you HP and MP. If the battle system is confusing you, this guide will surely help you. In addition, you'll also learn about espers and quickenings. Again, pretty basic fun down.The walkthrough can best be described as decent. It's helpful, but only moderately so. They give you a basic step by step overview of each section while giving some call outs. The maps aren't bad, but they aren't exactly detailed. They give the location of items and point out shops and whatnot, and that's good, but for the most part you won't need them. A lot of the info isn't bad, but they never really get to the point of where to go and how to go about it. There are also spoilers found within the walkthrough. The boss strategies are also pretty standard. They keep constantly telling you to use quickenings and that's about it. Nothing about what attacks to look out for, or what spells you might want to consider using. At best the walkthrough can best be summed as a walkthrough that gets you through the game and that's it. Every now and then they call out sidequests, but for the most part, they don't let you know when there's a chance to do a sidequest too often. Here and there, but not always. With the number of secrets in Final Fantasy XII, it would've been nice if they could've called out all of them, rather than picking and choosing.Speaking of sidequests, that's where we get to next after the walkthrough and this is where the guide just isn't useful anymore. They begin with the hunts, which is a nice section that tells you where to find them, but sometimes the info given to you is either downright wrong or misleading. They show you where the monster is supposed to be in each dungeon via a tiny map. Except sometimes the location of the monster is wrong, or sometimes there's no map and the text doesn't help. It makes going on the hunts a taxing task.That's not even the worst part. When you really get deep into the sidequests section, you'll find that there are plenty of quests that either get a little mention or they don't tell you about at all. And when they do tell you about them, there's just not enough info. What enemies will you find in an optional dungeon? There are also no maps for many of the optional areas. Any area that has more to explore for when you return to later (such as the Subterra in the Pharos or the Great Crystal) have no map at all, and as such, will tell you nothing about the enemies you'll encounter or the items that can be gathered. In terms of secrets, there are a ton missing or that the guide doesn't do much to help you out with. If you're looking to master Final Fantasy XII in its entirety, this guide isn't going to help.There's plenty of info in the appendices though. All the weapons, armor, accessories etc. are here. This is also pretty standard fare for an RPG guide. The bestiary, however, isn't very appealing. It tells you all the basic stuff without a fuss, it's just not very well presented. It's organized by the enemies number rather than in alphabetical order.Lastly, there's a double sided poster. On one side is the license board. Something you'll already find readily available in the guide.BradyGAMES hasn't made a horrible guide (it's certainly a long way from being as bad their Final Fantasy IX guide), but they've made one that has much to be desired. It's good for getting you through the main quests, but there's a lot of stuff that just isn't included. If you just want to do all the basic stuff, this guide is useful. If you want to completely master Final Fantasy XII, the BradyGAMES guide isn't going to help you do that."},{"Title":"Final Fantasy XII Strategy Guide","review":"At first the guide is wonderful, and stays that way as long as you only follow the main quests.

I have had to restart this game THREE times (50+ hours of play in each attempt) because I had made a mistake or missed something, following the guide VERY closely.

If you trust this guide to tell you when save/obtain an important item, take advantage of an important side quests (or any of the other things Walkthroughs are expected to do), you will find yourself starting over from the beginning over and over, because it just doesn't!I don't know if this guide was rushed to print or what, but it has just been one disappointment after another."},{"Title":"Final Fantasy XII Strategy Guide","review":"\\"Final Fantasy XII\\" was the last Squaresoft-developed Final Fantasy before the Square-Enix merger, and it's known to be a very large game with a very detailed world.

The quality of the information is average and it's really good for the main quest but all of the side quest info is scattered around. The book doesn't really show you good break points to do the side quests in order to save you time and with a game like this that requires you to trek on foot, the worst thing is going several hours out of your way to take on an optional boss and realize that you're not strong enough to take it out. There's way to much page flipping to find out what you need and some of the pages have information sections where it says please turn to page ???. Really, what the hell is the purpose of that?The next problem and this is a killer, is the actual quality of the book. I had pages falling out left and right because of the really cheap binding. For a special edition, this whole book is really lacking and cumbersome when you're afraid the book is about to fall apart whenever you go to check the early pages or the bestiary. Terrible quality and the art book that comes with it is short and thrown together.

Vaughn, another person on the WRONG SIDE of right, and so one more time I had to side with Zoe, and don't even get me started on Antonio...I just knew he had a little bit more together in his togetherness...I enjoyed the way Ms. Jackson-Sloan took us into the mind of a woman the like of which all have encountered at one time or another-one we've watched with total amazement wondering how she will land on her feet this time.

What's a women to do? Pick up and run away from home? Hey, that is a thought. But Zoe toughs it out and what she does should surprise everyone. Being born on Wednesday does have its advantages. Hats off to Gayle Jackson Sloan. You'll also enjoy Saturday's child.

The book started out a bit slow but then it gripped me towards the middle to no end. It's been years since I read Saturday's Child. I actually want to go back and read it again to refresh my memory on the drama that went down with Sara. With her life finally together, she was a great shoulder to lean on in Wednesday's Woes, but Sister Zoe was the main attraction. Gayle's descriptive style of writing and word usage puts the reader right at the scene of chaos!There was however a couple of loose ends in this book. I was intrigued by Stephanie's attitude and questionable sexuality. Why was she completely cut out of the book after the funeral was all said and done and her checked bounced? What happened to Gina?? Also, Zoe's dislike of Chris's girlfriend Tribby was mentioned far too many times.

She has written another story that is so real, so emotional that you feel as if you know the characters personally. There aren't many books that make me emotional, but Saturday's Child and Wednesday's Woes did.Sloan has become one of my favorite authors and one who's works I will snatch up as soon as they hit the shelves."},{"Title":"Wednesday's Woes","review":"When we met Zoe in Jackson Sloan's debut novel, Saturday's Child, we knew she was a force to be reckoned with. What we did not see was the full force of that reckoning. Wednesday's Woes by Gayle Jackson Sloan, is the story of Zoe, one of four sisters within a blended family.Zoe feels she has more woes than the average person. What she does not realize is how her own behavior plays into the negativity. After her divorce, she takes up with a much younger man by the name of Antonio, and moves him into her household along with her three teenage children. Her oldest child is dating a girl you would not take home to your momma; her daughter is too smart for her own good and her youngest son is in the middle, not really causing any problems but living amongst the chaos within the household and beyond. Added to this mix are Zoe's sisters and their secret ways and drama and her ex-husband Vaughn and his meddlesome ways. Everything is brought to a climax when a death occurs in the family, which has Zoe reflecting on her life and her past. Just when things appear to settle down and she makes a decision that will affect all, she discovers a secret of Antonio's and later, the secret of her best friend Tamika. All bets are off as to whether or not both relationships will survive. Understand, Zoe has issues with trust; once it is broken there is no turning back as all can attest to.I looked forward to Jackson-Sloan's sophomore novel because Zoe piqued my interest in her debut. This one provided another racy storyline with strong and believable dialogue, realistic characters, storytelling with uniqueness and strong visualization of people, places and things. Entertaining and captivating without an ending you would come to expect.Reviewed by Dawn R. ReevesAPOOO BookClub"},{"Title":"Wednesday's Woes","review":"What is it about being born on a Wednesday?

Zoe wasn't no joke in Saturday's Child and she definitely holds her own in Wednesday's Woes.Very nice job Gayle..can't wait for the next one...."},{"Title":"Wednesday's Woes","review":"In the much anticipated follow-up to Saturday's Child, Gayle Jackson Sloan gives new meaning to the phrase, \\"Oh, woe is me\\" in WEDNESDAY'S WOES. Zoe Knight's mother died when she was a baby and growing up she didn't quite have a perfect mother/daughter relationship with her stepmother. With her stepmother now gone and having to assist with the funeral arrangements, Zoe has put into perspective how distant their relationship really was and who was really at fault. Zoe's marriage ended in divorce several years ago due to infidelity, and has caused her to struggle with trust issues and maintaining a relationship with her ex-husband, Vaughn, for the sake of her children. Still carrying some residual feelings for Zoe, Vaughn is quite dismayed that a younger man has replaced him in her life.Zoe puts a high premium on trust. As Vaughn and her girlfriends know all too well, once you've destroyed her trust, there is no turning back. This is a lesson that Antonio, her new man, will have to learn the hard way. He is harboring a secret that he plans to share at the right time. As Zoe's bestfriend for years, Tamika knows Zoe better than most. However, Tamika, with all her antics, just can't help herself this time. She has a secret eating away at her that has the potenial to destroy their relationship, and if she doesn't tell Zoe soon, it just may come out anyway. Will Zoe be able to withstand the calamity she's about to face?In her sophomore effort, Gayle Jackson Sloan skillfully weaves a thoroughly entertaining tale, firmly solidifying herself as a major player in the literary industry. WEDNESDAY'S WOES was one of those books that once you start, you just can't stop. I was awestruck by Ms. Sloan's style of writing and the assortment of characters she introduces in some very thought-provoking subplots. She writes in conversational tones similar to what happens between girlfriends chatting during a girl's night out. She added enough suspense and humor to keep me flipping pages well into the night. Her characters were authentic, everyday people and none were put on pedestals. She dealt individually with their various issues and quirks. In the process, she covered a plethora of real life concerns in this book. Chief among them were when girlfriends cross that magical line, the younger man/older woman syndrome, sibling rivalry and forgiveness. WEDNESDAY'S WOES will make for some great discussions. I will be talking about this book for a long time to come.Reviewed by Brenda M.

Sadly nothing of this comes to pass. It seems as though the author hasn't read the books of Kerry Thornley since they are not listed in his bibliography. How can you write about somebody whose books you haven't read? All the author does is restate the absurd and officially disproven charges of Jim Garrison of the late 1960s. He even misinterprets the information Thornley gave to the FBI & the Secret Service right after the assassination of JFK, because he didn't care to check Thornleys own accounts on the matter. Anybody really interested in these issues may find Kerry Thornleys book 'Confession to Conspiracy to Assassinate JFK' for free on the internet by typing the title of the book in any of the internet search engines. More true research, please, because Thornleys real story still leaves many interesting questions open."},{"Title":"In History's Shadow: Lee Harvey Oswald, Kerry Thornley","review":"Any person who continues to place any stock or faith whatsoever in the screwball and proven-wrong JFK conspiracy theories that were spouted by the late Jim Garrison is an individual who is probably pretty close to needing a padded cell.Here are some of my miscellaneous thoughts concerning assassin Lee Harvey Oswald's \\"Lone Killer\\" status in association with the murders of both President John F. Kennedy and Dallas policeman J.D. Tippit in Dallas, Texas, on November 22nd, 1963.......Regarding Oswald's quick descent from the 6th Floor to the 2nd Floor of the Texas School Book Depository Building just after the gunshots were fired; and Oswald's \\"breathing\\" status at 12:32 PM; and the reasons why two Depository employees didn't bump into or hear LHO on the stairs:No one was on the stairs at the exact same time as Oswald. Via the overall weight of the witness testimony given to the Warren Commission in 1964, it's very probable that the two employees in question (Victoria Adams and Sandra Styles) didn't even start down the stairs until a few minutes AFTER the shooting. Those two ladies did not encounter anyone (or hear anyone) on the stairs, including Marrion Baker and Roy Truly, who were positively running up those same stairs within approx. 60 to 70 seconds of the last shot being fired.Given these facts -- Oswald, Baker, and Truly must certainly have been on those stairs PRIOR to the time that Adams and Styles descended that same staircase. But the conspiracy advocates, incorrectly, insist that Oswald and the two women HAD to be on the stairs at the exact same time (and such an unsupportable scenario was also re-created by Oliver Stone in his 1991 motion picture, \\"JFK\\"). But that \\"Everybody's Using The Stairs At Once\\" version of the event simply cannot be accurate, and is not at all necessary to accommodate the available evidence re. this issue.As for being out of breath -- Short of being 5-foot-1 and 299 pounds, I'm guessing that just about anybody could quickly travel down four flights of stairs and NOT be \\"out of breath\\". It must be remembered that Oswald was going DOWN the stairs, not UP. Gliding down stairs certainly wouldn't necessarily make somebody winded at all. I've never felt the need to go on oxygen after going DOWN just a few steps. Plus: Oswald was NOT physically unfit either (5-foot-9; slender build; 150-160 pounds).Also: The Warren Commission re-enacted Oswald's trip to the second floor -- and it was easily accomplished multiple times in less than 80 seconds (Oswald was seen by policeman Baker approx. 90 seconds after the shooting). The re-enactments also included taking the time to hide the rifle near the stairwell.A Secret Service agent, John J. Howlett, performed two separate \\"re-creations\\" of Oswald's probable post-shooting movements, taking 78 seconds on his first try and 74 seconds on the second. And he was not out of breath upon reaching the second-floor lunch room on either occasion. ....\\"Howlett was not short-winded at the end of either test run.\\" -- Quote from Warren Report (Page 152)Conspiracists who continue to believe that Oswald's 90-second, 4-flight trip to the 2nd Floor was a virtual impossibility are simply 100% wrong. It was easily a doable trek for Oswald, or anybody else with two legs who wasn't in a wheelchair.----------------------Regarding the subject of why Oswald was left \\"hung out to dry\\" (via the less-popular conspiracy-flavored scenario which has Oswald actively involved in the assassination plot in some fashion, but NOT being set up as a \\"Patsy\\" by a group of unknown conspirators):In such a case, why in the world would Oswald's other \\"teammates\\" who are \\"in\\" on the plan just leave Oswald hanging out to dry after the shots were fired?In such a large plot involving Oswald (or in just a smaller two- or three-man plot), it would seem logical that one of the other plotters would have provided their co-conspirator (Oswald) with some transportation away from the murder scene.But, instead, Oswald is left to hoof it on his own -- then take a city bus, then a taxi to his roominghouse -- running the risk of being spotted by other bus passengers (which, in fact, he was; a former landlady of Oswald's, Mary Bledsoe, incredibly, was on the very same Marsalis Street bus that Oswald boarded minutes after the assassination; she later positively identified Oswald as having been on the bus).Then Oswald is left completely alone to fend for himself yet again -- travelling on foot from his Beckley Avenue residence to the scene of the J.D. Tippit killing (and if the Tippit murder isn't an indication that Oswald was involved in the JFK shooting, then nothing is, IMO). Then he walks to a movie theater, a perfect place to \\"lay low\\" without running a huge risk of being spotted in the nearly-empty and dark theater.ALL of the above signifies one thing for sure --- Oswald had NO ACCOMPLICES on November 22, 1963. For if he had, all of these walking and public-transportation methods of locomotion would certainly have been avoided.----------------------But, in a total \\"Lone Nut\\" scenario, every single thing Lee H. Oswald did after the President was shot makes perfect sense. Such as the following laundry list of things telling us the President's murder was the act of one lone killer, firing from his 6th-Floor perch:1.) Lee Oswald couldn't drive (not very well at any rate; he had a few lessons from Ruth Paine, and was not impressive behind the wheel according to Mrs. Paine). Therefore, he's left to his own resources after shooting the President, and forced to rely on other modes of transportation for his getaway.2.) Even if he COULD drive, Oswald had no vehicle to take him from Point A (Dealey Plaza) to Point B (anyplace else) after the shooting. And in an \\"LN\\" scenario, it's highly doubtful that he's going to go up to Wesley Frazier (who gave him a lift that morning) and ask: \\"Hey Wes, can you give me a ride home Friday? I'm gonna plug the Chief Executive around lunchtime and need a getaway driver. OK with you?\\"3.) LHO is not the least bit surprised when having Marrion Baker's gun pointed at him just minutes after the assassination. Lee is quite calm and cool. This calm reaction is an odd one if he were completely innocent of the shooting and had no idea of what just happened out on Elm Street.IMO, Lee Oswald wasn't surprised by Baker's confronting him for one simple reason -- he expected the police to be entering the building quickly; and he had no reason to say to the officer, \\"What the heck is going on here?! Why am I being stopped?!\\" -- because he KNEW what was going on, because HE, himself caused it. Any innocent bystander in that same situation is going to get scared, and at the very least ask \\"What's going on? What did I do?\\"; but not Oswald; he never uttered a word.4.) He departs work quickly (within 3 minutes of the shooting), not caring in the least about all the turmoil and police activity going on outside the building.5.) Oswald takes the only transportation available to him, in his flight from the scene -- a public bus. When the bus gets clogged in traffic, he changes to a taxi cab (highly unusual for the penny-pinching Mr. Oswald; in fact, a researcher might be searching forever if he were to try and verify a single other occasion when Lee Oswald spent money on a cab ride).6.) Lee has the taxi driver take him NOT to the front door of 1026 N. Beckley (his residence) -- but instead to a point three blocks BEYOND his home. He actually passes his house first in the cab, which, IMO, is an obvious attempt to see if any cops are waiting for him there yet, and so that the cab driver (William Whaley) won't know exactly where his passenger lives.7.) Oswald then grabs a handgun at his home, puts on a jacket (to conceal the weapon more easily), and hustles out of the roominghouse, not saying a word to housekeeper Earlene Roberts (who noted his hurried behavior).8.) Upon encountering Officer J.D. Tippit on 10th Street within 15 minutes of leaving his roominghouse, Oswald shoots and kills the officer almost immediately (after very little conversation), plugging him one extra time (in the head at point-blank range).9.) Oswald knows he's got really big troubles now (as if killing JFK weren't enough already). He knows multiple witnesses saw him kill Tippit, but he's only got so much ammunition with him (he cannot eliminate ALL these witnesses). So he'll save his last bullets for when it really counts -- on more cops. Which is EXACTLY what he attempted to do once he was cornered in the Texas Theater at approx. 1:50 PM on 11/22.10.) In the theater, Oswald tries to kill police officer Nick McDonald with the same gun he used on Tippit a half-hour earlier. But, luckily, McDonald and other officers are able to wrest the gun away from their suspect before it can be successfully fired, saving Oswald from yet another possible murder charge that day.11.) Oswald's first words when cornered are also indicative of guilt -- \\"It's all over now!\\" and/or \\"This is it!\\" are the quotes that have been attributed to LHO within the movie theater.12.) When questioned by the police, Lee Harvey tells one lie after another regarding crucial information -- such as lying after being asked each of the following questions: \\"Do you own a rifle?\\", \\"Who is A.J. Hidell?\\", and \\"Did you bring a package to work this morning?\\".If Oswald had really been the \\"Patsy\\" (as he shouted out to the press in the DPD hallways), then WHY didn't he reveal some names for the police to check out? Don't tell me Oswald was involved in this massive plan to assassinate the President and yet he had not one shred of an idea as to what any of his co-conspirators looked like or what any of their names (even fake names) might have been?!In a word -- Hogwash!----------------------What do all of the above points add up to (in their totality)? -- In a certain sector of the \\"It Was A Conspiracy\\" world, these points (somehow) add up to a \\"Patsy\\" who not only didn't murder the President, but is also innocent of the even-more-provably-committed-by-Oswald murder of Officer Tippit.In that same portion of the \\"CT\\" world, the above items also add up to a man (Oswald) who is apparently totally oblivious to the fact that he is being \\"used\\" by hired, professional assassins, and who hadn't the slightest idea that he would be used in this manner right up to the time of the actual shooting itself. Otherwise, Mr. Oswald would never have even shown up for work at the Depository on Friday morning (if he had possessed even the slightest notion, that is, of the covert \\"plot\\" that would be implicating HIM, and him alone, after 12:30 PM on November 22nd, 1963).And only AFTER the assassination itself does Oswald \\"get smart\\" (evidently) and put the pieces together, and realize he's just been \\"used\\" as the \\"Patsy\\" in this thing.His \\"Patsy\\" remark has launched a mile-high pile of additional conspiracy theories -- and I do think it was smart of Oswald to announce to the TV cameras \\"I'm just a patsy!\\" for the world to hear. A very smart move indeed. Because it accomplished exactly what he had probably intended for it to accomplish -- i.e., it diverted some attention away from Oswald himself.That ONE single word out of Oswald's mouth (\\"Patsy!\\") has sent CTers scrambling in all directions looking for \\"connections\\" to a plot -- any plot. None of which has been verified to this day to have the slightest bit of truth in them (among the theories placed on the table to date). Zero pieces of credible, verifiable, provable information have been unearthed to date that tie Lee Harvey Oswald to any of the various proposed conspiracy theories.The above \\"points\\", every single one, IMO, add up to the actions of one lone killer of President Kennedy and Officer Tippit. A man, on foot, who tries desperately to flee the scenes of his two crimes and avoid capture, even attempting to kill yet another person along the way (but failing in that attempt before being handcuffed).In a nutshell.........No conspiracy theorist can possibly deny the fact that each of the points I've stressed above could certainly (at the very least) be easily reconciled within an \\"Oswald Did It And Did It By Himself\\" point-of-view.If conspiracy promoters do choose to deny the fact that Lee Harvey Oswald's post-12:30 actions on November the 22nd could possibly be looked upon as the actions of ONE LONE KILLER, then I feel they are not being honest about what Oswald's actions truly reveal.----------------------\\"While opinion polls can reveal cultural trends, they don't change facts. In the final analysis, the truth doesn't require anyone's belief.\\" -- Dale K. Myers----------------------\\"There was no plot, no conspiracy. JFK wasn't murdered by anti-Castro Cubans, the mob, or rogue CIA agents. There has not been one scintilla of proof tying the assassination to anyone but Oswald. There have been theories, but no evidence. Oswald had the motive, the opportunity, and the skill to kill President Kennedy.\\" -- Vincent T.

While turnout was the highest since 1968, more than 78 million Americans who were eligible to vote stayed home on Election Day, which resulted in a Bush victory with just 30.8 percent of the total eligible voters electing him.Flipped around, almost 70 percent of the population eligible to vote did not vote for the man--a self-described decider--who holds their fate, and quite possible that of the world's, in the palm of his hand.This almost begs the question of what would happen if we held an election and no one came out to vote. Or what if there was another line on the ballot that read \\"none of the above?\\" Someone, of course, would be declared the president, but would he--or she--truly be the winner? Would the affairs of state end up in chaos? Could the populace survive?Jose Saramago, winner of the Noble Prize for Literature in 1998, satirizes politics and authority in an eerily similar scenario in his latest novel, \\"Seeing.\\"Set in the same city whose citizens mysteriously lost their sight in his best known work, \\"Blindness,\\" Seeing returns his unforgettable characters back into our consciousness in a tale which begins as a satire on government, the media and a country's political system, but turns more sinister with each turn of the page.Four years have passed since the nameless people, living in a nameless city, located in a nameless country (but long rumored to be that of Saramago's native country of Portugal), were plagued with blindness. It's now Election Day, and government officials and members of the three political parties are concerned as to who the people will select to lead them.A hard falling rain appears to keep every voter at home when the polls open and throughout the afternoon, leaving election officials concerned that no one will come out to vote. Suddenly, at 3 p.m., the rain stops, and precisely one hour later, voters rush to the polls--all at once--as if under some universal order to do so.Surprisingly, when the votes are counted, more than 70 percent of the ballots are blank. Government officials call for a second election to be held a week later. Luck appears to be with them on Election Day redux as a \\"golden sun blazing forth against a backdrop of crystalline blue\\" shines upon the city throughout the daylight hours.Voters head back to the polls--not in a mad and unanimous rush like the week before--but with each person heading out alone, diligently and with a true sense of purpose. That night, after the polls are closed and the votes are counted, government officials are perplexed to find that 83 percent of the ballots are blank.The election result traumatizes the government, and a state of emergency is declared. Could this be a return to the plague of blindness that gripped the city four years ago? Could the one woman who kept her sight during that period be behind the blank ballots? A police superintendent is assigned to investigate and what follows is a griping tale of government impudence that produces thought-provoking scenarios that make the book difficult to put down. That is, if you haven't given up reading the novel after turning just a few pages or browsing through it in the bookstore.Readers unfamiliar with Saramago's writing style may quickly lose patience with his paragraphs that run on for pages and pages with stingy use of punctuation marks. \\"Seeing\\" is a literary challenge, as are all of his works. But patience and persistence (and a blind eye toward sentence structure) are rewarded with a searing work that only cements Saramago's reputation as a magnificent writer who continues to earn his Nobel Prize in Literature with each word he puts on paper."},{"Title":"Seeing","review":"I happened to stumble upon Sarmago's first book in an airport, and the next thing I knew was I didn't want the plane to land because the book, \\"Blindness\\" was so good. It was one of the few books that I've read and actually thought about years later. Maybe that book was so good I was expecting \\"Seeing\\" to be a continuation of it, but it wasn't. My advice to readers is if you enjoyed \\"Blindness\\", let the story end there."},{"Title":"Seeing","review":"This novel's plot seems surreal at first, but becomes more an more realistic the more one turns the pages. The characters' absurd crime, which is that of casting blank ballots on election day, is intensified and seen as horrific deeds by the persons in power. The political satire is at first funny but the tone darkens and the tension rises gradually.I myself preferred the book \\"Blindness\\" for the descriptions and the characters' interrelations and mostly for the journey from darkness into light.This book however is an important study, but has a more pessimistic approach."},{"Title":"Seeing","review":"For those who have read Blindness, this book is less a sequel than a haunting extension of the concept of human blindness, all the more provocative since the literal blindness is over. This time, it is not the populace, but the government which tries to keep its citizens blind, but the government itself is blind.The first half of this novel is grueling, nerve-wracking as it focuses on machiavellian politics, the second half more personal and fluid as we follow one police superintendent who encounters some characters who should be quite familiar to those who have read Blindness, which I would suggest doing before reading this book.Discomforting, maddening, and tragic, this book may ramble at times, but it begins to become strangely coherent and thoughtful in its latter half."},{"Title":"Seeing","review":"It was fun, well written and first rate. Provided some exploration as to how folks in power react when the folks that elect them basically turn thier backs on them and leave them to flounder madly and blindly. What we have here is a failure to communicate. This novel was a very well crafted adventure in the mode of how truly hung up leaders can be with appearing to have interest in the voting populace and how much they actually seem to care about what trials the populace truly has to endure in thier daily travels in life. Mr Saramago's use of language, I realize that this book was written in portugese first, helps in making the book a pleasure to read and in turn paints a colorful description of what happens, how so and additionally adds to the depiction of the plot."},{"Title":"Seeing","review":"Saramago's writing is one-of-a-kind. I enjoyed all his other books including Blindness. Seeing is a sort of sequel to Blindness and it is \\"helpful\\" to read Blindness before Seeing. I felt like watching a surreal world while reading the book. Although each sentence may be a page long, no full stop, no commas, no paragraphs, no chapter number...maybe that what's make the book so readable...you can't stop reading, because the next sentence is on the next page only."},{"Title":"Seeing","review":"In a country where the Party of the Right and the Party of the Center have total control, the electorate only decides when these parties shall renogotiate the sharing of the spoils of power. When 83% of the voters in the capitol decide that this democratic charade is empty of meaning, they cast blank ballots and the government fears for the loss of its legitimacy. Anxious power brokers search unsuccessfully for a conspiracy to be suppressed but finally must settle for a single scapegoat. Spies, coercion, a rigged justice system and even assassination are used to stamp out this threat to \\"legitmate\\" power. Newspapers are fed a drama of small-scale wickedness and the complacent public is assured that the threat has been defeated and they can return to a patriotic sleep.Saramago feels that we have robbed democracy of its true meaning as the centers of national power have grown and the weapons of propaganda have become highly sophisticated. For this dilemna,he offers no solace. I am reminded of the resistance of small numbers of the National Guard and Reservists to repeated tours in Iraq and the heavy handed defamation, incarceration and denial of due-process that our government has flung at them. What would our government do if all these citizen-soldiers refused to return to the battlefront? A most frightening thought that Saramago's novel makes quite real."},{"Title":"Seeing","review":"\\"Seeing\\", by Jose Saramago is in the genre of great books like Orwell's \\"1984\\" that deal with the efforts of States of all political persuasions to control and manipulate the lives of their citizens.Such States don't have to be totalitarian regimes. Liberal democracies also go to great lengths to \\"condition\\" their citizens in the face of perceived threats. They also engage in questionable human rights and legal practices in dealing with those threats. The current war on terrorism fits this mould exactly, but it is nothing new to those of us who lived through the Cold War of the 1950s and 1960s.Books like \\"Seeing\\" serve as a salutary reminder that governments are not always on our side, and it behoves us to be very vigilant to avoid erosion of our rights in the struggle against terrorism, communism or whatever \\"-ism\\" is the current fixation.There is also an uplifting theme in this book, and that is the bravery of insiders who dare to tell the truth to the public, regardless of the cost to themselves. That gives us hope that, in the end, justice will emerge from the murky morass of expediency.In \\"Seeing\\" 80% of the voters in the capital city of some imaginary country turn in blank votes at the national elections. This shocks the government, so they re-run the election. But the proportion of blank votes goes up to 83%. The politicians in charge now fear that some kind of vast anti-government conspiracy is afoot.In order to punish the citizens of the capital and unmask the conspirators, all government services move out of the city and it is placed under a state of siege. The interior minister also arranges for a bomb to go off in a train station and to be blamed on the still unknown conspirators.None of this works, so the political leadership looks for a scapegoat to take the blame.Police spies are sent into the besieged city to find evidence that the blank voting was a big conspiracy against the government, but they don't hear anyone talking about blank votes. When they report this to their boss he says \\"That's a good sign. The proof that there is a conspiracy lies precisely in the fact that no one talks about it.\\"Ideologues and fundamentalists of the left and right should read this book and re-think the basis of their own zealotry. Of course they never will, because such folk never seek to question their unshakeable beliefs. If they read books at all, they prefer books that confirm their fears and hatreds.Readers who are concerned about truth and morality in politics and the cynical erosion of our liberties by those in power should read this book. Perhaps it will give us courage to speak out about practices that in our hearts we know to be wrong and destructive of our liberties.The book is written with little conventional punctuation. Dialogue does not have quotation marks and frequently one speaker's words run into another's with only a comma to separate them. This style serves to depersonalise the narrative and is quite effective, but it does make reading a little difficult."},{"Title":"Seeing","review":"Four years ago the nation's capital suffered a bizarre and debilitating plague of unexplained white blindness. Everyone, save one woman, was blind and she helped a small group to survive during the catastrophe. Such was the premise of Nobel Prize-winning Portuguese author Jose Saramago's amazing novel BLINDNESS. His latest, SEEING, has the capital again in crisis; this time political calamity ensues when about 70 percent of the paper ballots of the recent election are blank.The government goes into a tailspin, assuming the blank votes reflect a subversive, anarchist movement. The egotistical national leaders devise a plan to regain control of the capital; they put the city under siege. Although casting blank ballots is not illegal, the capital is physically isolated from the rest of the country by a military barrier. The police and army are withdrawn from the city as well as many national and local leaders. The government hopes that the isolation and desperation the siege causes result in the capital cooperating once again in their version of democracy.However, the citizens of the besieged capital rally together, take care of each other, and their opinion of the government and the current leadership pales. The government struggles to understand what the blank votes mean and come to interpret them as a new plague of \\"blankness\\" attacking the capital.As the corruption of the government grows more and more apparent, a letter arrives indicating that one woman, who did not go blind during the plague of blindness and who murdered a man during that time, is responsible for the conspiracy of blank votes. The second part of the novel follows a police inspector who is snuck into the city to investigate the claim, as he comes to know the woman and begins to see the absurdity of the government's position.Saramago's style is Kafkaesque (although he is influential and talented enough to have other works referred to as Saramagoesque). The government, in this case right-wing, is shadowy and absurd; a frustrating and uncaring institution. The citizens of the capital are punished although no crime has been committed and the punishment itself is dramatic and Draconian. The inspector struggles to break free of the system he knows can and probably will destroy him; there is little hope for justice. Saramago's style is also about run-on sentences and the lack of traditional quotation marks. This can be an obstacle for some readers but commitment to the book is rewarded. After a bit of a slow start, the pace and rhythm of the story picks up and overall this is a very compelling and timely tale.SEEING is less successful than Saramago's masterpiece BLINDNESS, but it is still a wonderfully executed and highly recommendable read. Saramago further solidifies himself as the post-modern heir of authors such as Albert Camus, Thomas Mann and Franz Kafka.And having read BLINDNESS is in no way requisite for reading SEEING, which works well as a stand-alone story of corruption, fear, politics and the meaning of both terrorism and democracy.--- Reviewed by Sarah Rachel Egelman"},{"Title":"Seeing","review":"Jose Saramago must be read, but Seeing is not must reading except for Jose fanatics / addicts. Get hooked on the Jose experience with Blindness for its language, gripping story line, and the raw beauty of Saramago's eccentric narrative style.

How they clean up their city, restart their lives, etc.?"},{"Title":"Seeing","review":"I really appreciated the first two-thirds of the book--it's a sharp, funny, on-target satire, written in a most appealing style. But I had a problem with the transition to the investigation--I felt it to be almost anticlimactic. Up to this point, the satire gets larger and more far-reaching, and all of a sudden we are in a micro-mode, focusing on the three detectives. I started turning the pages faster and faster, asking myself why he decided to divert the story in this way. Yes, I understand his overall theme and the point of the novel, and after some thought, I sort of understand what he was trying to do with the shift in focus. But I just don't think it works all that well."},{"Title":"Seeing","review":"The city holds its democratic elections with the party's of the right centre and left vying for power. Mysteriously over 70% of the ballot papers are blank, rising to 83% in a hastily called re-run.Seen as an act of sedition, the Government sets about restoring political authority with subterfuge, placing the city in a state of siege and doing all it can to find the perpetrators....An inticate plot in which Saramago looks at how the political elite react when the system fails to serve its purpose in maintaining the status quo, a theme made more subtle as the system under scrutiny is democracy, supposedly mans highest form of rule, which is as blind as any other when under threat and refuses to accept that the blank votes are the electorate speaking.Iran is a recent example of the people not voting in accordance to the political elite as was the Ukraine.'Seeing' is often amusing and at times brutally frank in its realism, all told in Saramago's individual style where no one has a name, just a job title or a characteristic item of clothing to identify them, lending to the fable quality of the tale.'Seeing' is actually a sequel to 'Blindness'; the lead characters in 'Blindness' all appear, this time as prime suspects of the blank vote rebellion. Luckily I had read 'Blindness' some years before (though I have to admit I wasn't 100% blown away by it)which saved me from being bemused by mention of the blindness plague. I found 'Seeing' much more impressive and has made me want to re-read 'Blindness' now I am more familiar with Saramago's style and take on things.A thought provoking and impressive book."},{"Title":"Seeing","review":"After reading the book \\"Blindness\\" by the same author, then you will be able to understand this one. It's like the continuation. It\\"s well crafted in the way he says his stories. Makes you turn the pages and not to want to keep it down."},{"Title":"Seeing","review":"\\"Blindness,\\" Saramago's most successful novel in America, is a horror story disguised as sociopolitical allegory, while its follow-up, \\"Seeing,\\" is a political thriller with a similar allegorical disguise. Both books are set in the same city and they share several characters, but to say that \\"Seeing\\" is a sequel is only half-true, since the tone and the themes are quite different. While the original novel is horrifically violent, the follow-up adopts a breezier manner; it's one of the funniest thrillers I've read--at least until Saramago's trademark cynicism returns full force in the final pages.In two back-to-back elections in an ostensibly democratic nation, the citizens turn in blank ballots in overwhelming majorities. That is, given choices that seem to be no choice at all, the electorate creates a choice all their own. \\"The blank vote could be seen as a sign of clear-sightedness on the part of those who used it,\\" a sentiment that invites the disgust of the ruling patrons. \\"Rights are not abstractions, retorted the minister of defense, people either deserve rights or they don't.\\" And, in the minds of the elected officials (and their media lapdogs), the citizenry not only doesn't deserve the right to vote, it doesn't even deserve the right to a government. So the bureaucrats, the police, the army all pack up and leave, surrounding the city and placing it under siege, waiting for the metropolis to implode.But, initially, nothing really happens (and I'll be deliberately vague about what does happen). There is a suspicious, transparently planned \\"terrorist\\" attack, but otherwise the city gets along just fine and its inhabitants quickly learn to govern themselves. Meanwhile, its self-exiled leaders try to sow divisions and mayhem in the city they left behind, but they only entangle themselves in a swamp of bureaucratic bungling, intra-party clashes, and petty personal squabbles. Indeed, it seems the government doesn't deserve its people.Faced with the devious subtlety of peaceful resistance, the administration resorts to a plan that avoids painful introspection: pinning the debacle on a scapegoat. Gradually, the Keystone Cops imbroglio of the book's first half gives way to a menacing, conspiratorial mission led by an undercover police \\"superintendent\\" who is sent back into the city but who gradually questions the virtuousness of his task. Into an urban nightmare that could have been imagined by Kafka slips this conflicted agent straight out of a Graham Greene novel.In the end, I found this novel to be every bit as dark as \\"Blindness\\"--and every bit as readable. Beneath the author's famously intimidating page-long sentences, unpunctuated dialogue, and unnamed characters are two energetic novels of suspense; the intricacy of the prose slows readers down just enough to appreciate the satire and the wordplay. Still, I couldn't help myself: I rushed through the last 50 pages of its shocking, unexpected finale as if I were reading a Bourne novel."},{"Title":"Seeing","review":"In Saramago's normal humorous manner, he again takes on the political structure of Portugal. His style cuts with the ease of a razor blade, while easing the pain with his wit. The characters are stereotypes that bring to mind people you have met (think Dilbert). You are only given enough about the characters for you to mentally \\"slot\\" them. The meat of the book is the underlying attitudes of the \\"government\\" vs. the \\"people\\".With Saramago as with all politics the \\"story\\" is never resolved. He always leaves you wanting more. Your imagination will be in overdrive as you consider the implications of the opening chapters.Though this books stands very well on its own, you should read \\"Blindness\\" first (I didn't).If you have never read Saramago, start with \\"Baltasar & Blimunda\\". It will ease you into his style of writing which can be difficult - identifying the speaker; run-on (and on and on) sentences; unusual punctuation."},{"Title":"Seeing","review":"\\"Blindness\\" by Saramago is one of the best books I've ever read and certainly won't forget anytime soon. When I heard that a follow-up, \\"Seeing\\", had been published I bought it immediately. Alas, for me, it doesn't live up to its predecessor or other works by the author. The concept is very interesting - virtually a whole city decides to submit blank voting ballots....Why? The web of governmental deceit and lies that Saramago presents is excellent, thought-provoking and definitely on the money. But somehow he fails to deliver. And there are a couple of parts where you question how information was obtained/presented."},{"Title":"Seeing","review":"There are many reasons I love reading a Jose Saramago novel. The ideas he has, playful \\"what-if\\" concepts that explore all sorts of new ground, never fail to intrigue. He has the rare gift is taking his concepts all the way, of not pulling punches the way many authors do. There are lots of good ideas out there, but most authors are too timid to do anything interesting with them -- not so for Saramago. The way he writes is dense and sometimes difficult to read, but it is also beautifully crafted and usually well worth the effort. He never fails to be thought-provoking and original.All of these things are there in 'Seeing.' It begins with a unique idea: what if the vast majority of the population of a (supposedly) democratic nation voted, but turned in blank ballots? What implication would this have for the election? How would a government react to this? As usual, Saramago finds a way to explore this idea that is not trite or simplistic, he makes it more personal (and thus, more universal) than a political thriller. It begins with the government reaction to the blank ballots, and take a while to get moving, but eventually becomes a very individual story, which is what Saramago does best. And certainly, it is beautifully written. There are passages of great beauty in language and originality of concept that are simply remarkable. Nobody writes like Saramago does.So why was I a little disappointed at the end? I think it was the overt poltics of the book. I didn't mind the point that he was trying to make -- I agreed with much of it, actually. But most of his books, while they have political implications, they aren't so obvious about it. This book's predecessor, 'Blindness,' certainly left itself open to poltical interpretations, and I'm sure that was intentional. My favorite Saramago novel, 'The Stone Raft,' also had clear political implications. But neither book was quite so obvious about it as this one was. Neither felt the need to state its politics so plainly, but in those, Saramago found ways to make his points a little more subtly, to trust the reader to draw the conclusions in the end. In 'Seeing' the political point of the book is so clearly stated that there wasn't much left to think about by the end. In a way, that might be considered more satisfying, but to me having the politics handed to me on a platter was something of a disappointment. I didn't have to work for it a little the way I did in other Saramago books.Make no mistake, 'Seeing' is still a good book, and a good example of what makes Saramago such a unique writer. It's just not the best example. It was nice to see some of the characters from 'Blindness' again here, and it was good to get a little more closure on their story. Reading 'Seeing' was very thought-provoking. It made me wonder what would happen if the events of the book came to pass in the real world. It made me wonder about the next big U.S. election in 2008. What would happen if I cast a blank vote? What would happen if everyone cast a blank vote?Perhaps, someday, we will see."},{"Title":"Seeing","review":"The premise is interesting and there is meat to the story: the voters in the capital city decide to cast blank ballots and the democratic government panics. I won't divulge any more because it builds up fairly logically from there but I have an important quibble about the style: the absence of dialogue breaks and proper sentences (everything is a long paragraph, comma after comma, dialogue mixed with description, he said, she said, yes that's true - that kind of stuff) really bothers me. I couldn't see a point to it other than a sort of teenage 'showing-off' of the post-modern type.Ask yourself, what if the book had proper sentences? It would, of course be easier on the eye (God forbid the author should try being readable). Would it detract from the story? I don't think so. It might, if anything, force the author to be more economical, and leave out some of the mundane descriptions he throws in - I imagine that's a sort of affectation. But hey, he won the Nobel Prize, so I guess he doesn't feel he needs to take advice from anonymous reviewers :)"},{"Title":"Seeing","review":"I just finished reading Saramago's new novel, Seeing, last night.Seeing.I've been thinking about that word, off and on, all day.Many of you have also read the book, and know that there are many tie-ins [especially in the latter half] to the events of his previous (1997) novel entitled Blindness. I hesitate to call this new one a direct sequel, and yet maybe it is, because really, I think a lot of its nuance is lost if you have not read Blindness.But the words. Blindness is a noun. And in that book, a rampant contagion of blindness descends upon an unsuspecting populace. It descends like a noun... like a thick white blanket upon the eyes of an entire city. Boom! The people see white. All activity is stifled by the inability to see. What I am getting at is that there is no more obvious and fitting title to Saramago's 1997 book, then the actual word blindness!He's chosen to call this new book Seeing. A verb. Or, if not an actual verb, at least more verbish [verbful?] than say for instance, the other word that may have been used. Sight!And so it is that all day I have been asking myself.... seeing what?What is it that these people in Seeing, are seeing?In other words, this new title is more obscure... and the book is not about a populace whose eyesight gets better, nor does it address any sort of optimetric difficulties or enhancements, nor is it about blind people who now see.Ah, but then again... it is, in a way, because all of these characters recall their former blindness, experienced four years prior to the time frame of Seeing.They are people who can see, but once were blind.All except for one of them, a woman, the doctor's wife, who mysteriously did not go blind in the former plague.And she becomes the pivot, upon which this book... pivots.A key idea in Saramago's Seeing, is that the municipal government [the city officials] try to repeatedly sway popular opinion by way of media manipulation. When faced with an inexplicable crisis, they try to entreat and endear the people through the indirect method of creating terror and then reporting on it, always according to their own skewed objectives.The truth is not what is true, the truth is what we tell you is true!The trump card involves the mass distribution of a photograph, and the trick is attaching it to a web of lies!The game becomes finding a scapegoat. And they do.Does the government succeed in their pernicious plot?I'll never tell. [Truth is, I don't even know!]Superb book, as is everything the man has written."},{"Title":"Seeing","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed \\"Seeing,\\" Saramago's latest novel to be translated into English. This is a first-rate addition to the upper tier of his works.*** Spoiler alert: the following paragraphs reveal a few elements of the plot. ***In the Nov. 8, 2004, issue of \\"The American Conservative\\" magazine, the managing editor, Kara Hopkins, advocated not voting in the pending presidential election. \\"Silence is a profound expression,\\" she argued, \\"and enough unraised voices eventually turn even the most partisan heads.\\" \\"Elections,\\" she contended, \\"maintain the illusion of opposing parties exchanging ideas rather than political animals competing for power. Selling voting as the ultimate expression of citizenship . . . legitimizes the process that keeps them in control and makes the public docile by enforcing the notion that we rule ourselves.\\"Whether or not one agrees with Hopkins, she offers a perspective that Saramago might endorse, to judge by \\"Seeing.\\" In \\"Seeing,\\" some 70 percent of the residents of the capital of an unnamed country turn in blank ballots in an election, refusing to vote for the Party of the Right, the Party of the Center, or the Party of the Left. The government, dominated by unsavory and unprincipled authoritarians, is horrified that the rituals of democracy have generated a challenge to the government's legitimacy and orders the election to be reheld. But the percentage of blank votes is higher than before.The government's reaction, though often fumbling, is vicious and lethal. It uses various Orwellian techniques and, as it deems necessary, violence to punish the capital's residents and try to get them to appear to respect the available choices, regardless of their true feelings about the three parties.This is a fable. It is not intended to be entirely realistic, and the reader must suspend disbelief at times. After all, a modern Western democracy (\\"Seeing\\" appears to take place in western Europe) that took Draconian measures against its citizens for refusing to vote would be subject to external pressure and would have to relent. And it would be unlikely to take such measures in the first place. Western democracies are famously tolerant of political dissent--for example, from 1993-1997 Canada tolerated having as the federal government's official opposition party the Bloc Quebecois, whose goal is to separate Quebec from the Canadian federation. But Saramago is so masterly a writer that he makes the implausible possible. The reader does soon ask, \\"Why would any government that observes the forms of democracy behave this way?\\" A plot twist that appears in the middle of the novel provides an answer.In \\"Seeing,\\" Saramago continues his charming dance with the Portuguese language (I read the book in Portuguese). He narrates events at a languid pace (and occasionally with deceptive calmness by bringing forth a horrible revelation only at the end of an otherwise disarmingly anodyne paragraph). And his characters speak a Portuguese more formal than would be found in much formal writing. People who spoke this way in real life would be seen as affected. But Saramago's use of the King's Portuguese doesn't come across as pretentious; rather, it's a celebration of the outer reaches of classic Portuguese. I often think that Saramago's goal is to restore a full-fledged type of Portuguese that is fading, perhaps thanks to an onslaught of televised Brazilian soap operas and the like. Like Shakespeare, whose facility with language and extraordinary vocabulary altered English forever, Saramago may succeed in elevating Portuguese to a language different from the form that preceded his literary career. That would have to be the supreme achievement of any writer of literature."},{"Title":"Seeing","review":"In this sequel to Saramago's Nobel winning book \\"Blindness\\" the reader is presented with an almost opposite situation. Saramago's books, are political metaphors and commentaries which look deeply into the human spirit and soul.In his first book, the author helps the reader understand how a world would look if all social stability and government broke down and the populace was left blind and helpless. The picture is very ugly and very painful. Yet, it has a realism that can not be ignored.\\"Seeing\\" asks an instrumental operative question: \\"Are those who see, less blind than those who don't?\\" Here Saramago again creates a sociological and political microcosm to illustrate his points. There are many points he makes, but one of his central ones is that citizens can be recognized by \\"standing up and refusing to be counted.\\" This act seems to those in control as a giant insurrection. Additionally, when people spontaneously choose to make such a statement; what should the government do about it? And they can make it unilaterally, without a movement or a leader, per se.Saramago also gives the reader an interesting and experimental writing style. He dispenses with much normal grammar, yet rarely does this impede the reader's ability to glean complete understanding, or close to it, of what is happening in the story. Novelistically, the book is extremely well written and engaging.In many senses, Saramago conveys his feeling that people, events and beliefs can be manipulated. But they can only be manipulated so far. If Saramago is speaking of any specific country, he takes care not to reveal it. He almost jests that he is talking about Portugal, but indicates that this is clearly just to give substance to the contentions of his story, to ground the reader in some basis of mundane reality. Perhaps one imposes the concept on whatever country they live it, because the points Saramago is making are universal. The government can influence the way things happen, how they appear, what is believed and what becomes history. They do have the power to do that, but they do not have the power to control the electorate. And if and when they take things too far, the electorate can stand up and be counted. Change is just around the corner in all Democratic Countries.This book is recommended to all who want to see the kinds of things that Governments can do when motivated to do so. It is a very educational and impressive book. It is recommended to all people of voting age."},{"Title":"Seeing","review":"In the unnamed capital city of an unidentified democratic country, election day morning is marred by torrential rains. Voter turnout is disturbingly low, but the weather breaks by midafternoon and the population heads en masse to their voting stations. The government's relief is short-lived, however, when vote counting reveals that over 70% of the ballots cast in the capital have been left blank. Baffled by this apparent civic lapse, the government gives the citizenry a chance to make amends just one week later with another election day. The results are worse: now 83% of the ballots are blank. The two major political parties - the ruling party of the right (p.o.t.r.) and their chief adversary, the party of the middle (p.o.t.m.) - are in a panic, while the haplessly marginalized party of the left (p.o.t.l.) produces an analysis claiming that the blank ballots are essentially a vote for their progressive agenda. Is this an organized conspiracy to overthrow not just the ruling government but the entire democratic system? If so, who is behind it, and how did they manage to organize hundreds of thousands of people into such subversion without being noticed? When asked how they voted, ordinary citizens simply respond that such information is private, and besides, is not leaving the ballot blank their right?Thus begins Jose Saramago's brilliant new book, SEEING. The setting is the same unnamed country where, four years earlier, a plague of contagious but temporary \\"white blindness\\" afflicted first the capital city, then spread throughout the country. The resulting breakdown of civic institutions and reversion of life to the basest instincts for control and survival were magnificently chronicled in Saramago's earlier novel, BLINDNESS, undoubtedly the author's most powerful and approachable work to that date. The events surrounding that epidemic proved so shameful that the entire country tacitly agreed in the aftermath not to speak of or analyze what happened. Now, however, the blank white ballots bring back haunting memories of the white blindness. Perhaps the citizenry's refusal to cast marked ballots augurs some sort of political epidemic that could spread to the rest of the country.What makes SEEING such a remarkable work is the picture Saramago draws of a right-wing government under duress, with eerie echoes (intentional or otherwise) of the current Bush Administration's \\"war on terror\\" and its imposition of democracy on Iraq. Unsure how to respond to a benign protest but certain that an anti-democratic conspiracy exists, Saramago's ruling government quickly labels the movement \\"terrorism, pure and unadulterated\\" and declares a state of emergency, allowing the government \\"to suspend at a stroke of a pen all constitutional guarantees.\\" Five hundred citizens are seized at random and disappear into secret interrogation sites, and their status is coded red/red for secrecy. Their families are informed in Orwellian style not to worry about the lack of information concerning their loved ones, since \\"in that very silence lay the key that could guarantee their personal safety.\\" When these moves bear no fruit regarding this \\"depth charge launched against the stability of the democratic system...of the entire planet,\\" the right wing government adopts a series of increasingly drastic steps, from declaring a state of siege and concocting plots to create disorder to withdrawing the police and seat of government from the capital, sealing the city against all entrances and exits, and finally manufacturing their own terrorist ringleader. The city continues to function near-normally throughout, the people parrying each of the government's thrusts in inexplicable unison and with such a level of nonviolent resistance that they must all be channeling Mahatma Gandhi.As always, Saramago presents his story in dense, run-on sentences that twist and turn and sparkle like diamonds, to be read and admired for their brilliant cut and the play of light through their many facets. To wit,-- the media promote \\"the old game of public virtues masking private vices, the jolly carousel of private vices elevated to the status of public virtues...\\"-- \\"...we will all continue to lie when we tell the truth, and to tell the truth when we lie...\\"-- \\"...since the citizens of this country were not in the healthy habit of demanding proper enforcement of the rights bestowed on them by the constitution, it was only logical, even natural, that they failed even to notice that those rights had been suspended.\\"-- \\"...demonstrations never achieve anything, if they did, we wouldn't allow them...\\"If Gabriel Garcia Marquez is arguably the world's greatest living writer, Jose Saramago proves once again in SEEING that he is the world's greatest active practitioner of the novel form, and certainly the most deserving Nobelist for Literature in the last decade. SEEING is, in a word, extraordinary. In it, Saramago demonstrates unparalleled mastery of the written word, flashes his low-key but biting satire like a rapier, and reinforces his position as the moral voice of his generation."},{"Title":"Seeing","review":"I enjoyed Blindness, and expected Seeing to be made of the same material: lyrical, nerve-wrecking, bewildering. Like its precursor, Seeing juxtaposes witty dialogue with somber lines that evoke reflection, but in other respects the two books are dissimilar. Seeing is nearly as compelling as Blindness, but it's funnier, and with less real substance-- less happens.I'd suggest readers to think of Seeing not as a sequel to Blindness, though obviously the two books are related, but as a stand-alone book in the same universe. This way, they won't have any unfair expectations; this way, they can appreciate Seeing as a humorous companion to Blindness, and not get caught up in the second book's relative lack of depth and hasty resolution. After all, one can hardly criticize the author for keeping his style fresh."},{"Title":"Seeing","review":"Things start to go dreadfully wrong when more than two thirds of the country's voters turn in blank ballots; in a hastily arranged repeat election, the percentage is even higher. The government is not amused, and responds as to a treasonous threat to democracy. One after the other, bad decisions are taken, leading to measures that are progressively worse.Somehow the phenomenon of the blank votes is connected to the epidemic of blindness that swept the country four years earlier (in Saramago's previous novel, Blindness), and the government begins to focus its suspicions on the one person who didn't go blind--a courageous woman who kept a small group of people alive through unspeakable horrors. A police superintendent is sent out with a small team to investigate this woman--and to find her guilty.Author Jose Saramago writes brilliantly, with wit, wisdom and humor, building inexorably to a horrific ending. His manner of writing, as always, takes some getting used to. Long, rambling paragraphs with minimal punctuation, as though you were simply overhearing the whole thing. Author Saramago has a dark view of human institutions, and of leaders who have to be right at any cost. In Seeing, he has written a brilliant, dark, and persuasive parable of modern life. I recommend this book highly, but be sure to read Blindness first. Reviewed by Louis N. Gruber."},{"Title":"Seeing","review":"It's amazing to me that Jose Saramago is producing incredibly thought provoking literature at an age when most writers have long since written their best works. Seeing is another example of Saramago's penchant for creating such literature. Among the themes that he explores in Seeing are:- If democracy is a form of government that truly represents \\"the will of the people\\", what happens when \\"none of the above\\" gets the most votes?- Does a government need to create a plausible enemy in order to be effective?- Just how far will a government go to stay in power?These are very powerful questions (particularly in this day and age), and Saramago doesn't disappoint in providing his answers. However, wrapping those answers within a farce seems a little odd when considering the seriousness of the issues being presented. While I'm sure Saramago was trying to express his overall opinion of government, he undercuts his message by making the government officials seem comical and more than a little inept. The frequent asides and imaginary conversations also do little to advance the themes.Still, a slightly below average effort from Saramago is better than 98% of the books in the market today. With its complex themes and thought provoking answers, Seeing deserves to be purchased by anyone who enjoys true literature."},{"Title":"Seeing","review":"Seeing is the follow-up to Saramago's critically acclaimed novel, Blindness. While Blindness was metaphorical and surreal, it was also literal - the characters in the novel literally went blind. Seeing feels much more, almost completely, metaphorical though the events that comprise the story are very real. In Seeing, the government begins plotting against it's own citizens when the results of a national election reveal that a majority of the population has cast blank ballots. Neither the controlling right party, the opposing left party, nor the central party, gain a majority. The government is both enraged at this act of subversion, and scared. An emergency election the following week produces similar results and the government's efforts to root out the traitors and subversive elements produce no leads. Though no evidence of organized subversion is found, and though no unrest can be seen in the streets, the government decides to act quickly and authoritatively to root out what it sees as a dangerous cancer growing in the population. Through ill-advised measure after ill-advised measure, the government escalates its war against the unseen traitors, going so far as to abandon and quarantine the city. Weeks into the crisis, an anonymous letter is received by the government which links a key actor from the Blindness crisis, to the current one. A team of undercover officers is dispatched to find, interrogate, and neutralize the suspect. The government turns increasingly desperate, increasingly willing to break the law, manipulating events and the press in order to, if nothing else, turn those citizens loyal to the government against those who are behind the conspiracy. Ultimately the government's cynicism towards its citizens is overshadowed by it's miscalculations about them.Overall, an interesting read but truthfully not the best example of what Saramago offers. That's the view from a fan."},{"Title":"Seeing","review":"Saramago is an incredible writer. I picked this up having enjoyed reading Blindness many times (you really should read it before this one). I wasn't expecting a heavy-handed political allegory but the story is pretty good. It will not leave you as awe-struck as Blindness but Saramago's writing style is always wonderful and will leave you with much to think about."},{"Title":"Seeing","review":"I picked up BLINDNESS a month ago and I finished the book in about two days. I was that imerssed in it. It has become one of my most favourite books and has quickly become a piece of literature that I try to pass off on any of my friends whenever the subject of a good book comes up.I'm sure most of the reviews for SEEING will start, more or less, like that; however, it's true BLINDNESS is a piece of great literature on every single level. So I had high hopes for SEEING and more or less they were met.Saramago still uses his run-on sentences without the proper punctuation which works extremley well and allows Saramago to dictate some truly poetic lines. He also omites the names for the characters, which worked well in BLINDNESS but Saramago falters a few times and the idea becomes cumbersome later on in the story. Never-the-less, it's pretty much a sequel to BLINDNESS with all the same characters and all the same style.So what did I think of it? Well, the first two acts are great. The premise and the unfolding of the ridiculous government and their reaction to the blank ballots is thoroughly engaging; the sections that revolve around the parliament and inner workings are the best part of the story. The third act falls a little flat, however. It focuses too much on ideas from BLINDESS (which sounds great but really, I wanted to know more about the blank ballots) than the problems that arise at the beginning of SEEING (which shows how great the first two acts of SEEING are).More than anything, Saramago uses some intense allegory to express emotions of apathy, disillusionment and fear in regards to modern democracies and the degression these political machines function. All very relevant in today's world and is worth the price alone of the book just to understand how a very kafkaesque version of tomorrow's political landscape could turn out if the degression of democracy is continued.One specific I want to mention, which is great because it happened the other day and much after Saramago wrote this book is in relation to National Security Advisor Condoleeza Rice's comments the other day to the British press. She more or less said that history would judge them differently than the present does. At the end of SEEING, after a particularly important aspect of the story is revealed, the interior minister (a very seedy character) says, \\"The future, prime minister, will, I am sure, judge that I was right\\"."},{"Title":"Seeing","review":"Seeing is a terrific book, particularly if you're interested in politics- the gritty type of politics, that is; the kind not broadcast on television or reported on by any journalist. The reader sees the inner workings of government trying to contain an outbreak of blank votes submitted by a vast majority of the citizens of the capital. The scapegoat which the politicians order their controlled media outlets to attack happens to be our hero, the lady group leader, from Saramago's \\"Blindness\\". However, this isn't some sort of statement that all politicians are evil- we see a minority of them revolt against the majority leaders, disgusted by the limits to which their colleagues will go to sink a problem which, when carefully considered, isn't that great of an issue. How the public views this ruling class is one of the main factors in the ministry's decisions, yet they seem to care very little for their actual actions and the results therof. This stands as a very interesting inside observation of democracy. Mind you, the book isn't all some episode of \\"West Wing\\"; we also see as police agents penetrate the capital in an attempt to retrieve reports for the forementioned ministers, and get a lot of well-earned closure to the story begun in \\"Blindness\\".On the other hand it's not at all required for readers of \\"Seeing\\" to read \\"Blindness\\" first. In fact, looking back, it might be even MORE interesting to read them in opposite order, since that might fulfill the somewhat unsatisfying conclusion to \\"Blindness\\", and sometimes knowing what to expect can be nice. There's obviously reason to support not entitling \\"Seeing\\" as \\"Blindness 2\\"."},{"Title":"Seeing","review":"Take a couple parts of Machiavellie, one part Camus, add a dose of Orwell and a dash of Kafka and you've got 'Seeing'.I strongly suggest that you read 'Blindness' first."},{"Title":"Seeing","review":"Saramago is simply amazing. It won't be long until I own all of his books."},{"Title":"Seeing","review":"This is the fourth novel by Jose Saramago that I have read and, if I compared it to the other three, I have to put \\"Seeing\\" in fourth place. The novel starts out with a lot of promise. An election is held and the vast majority of the voters submit a blank ballot. The powers that be go into a panic and my mind opened to a number of possibilities. Were we discovering that the real defense against abusive authority was openly expressed apathy? Was the general population communicating a secret message through a public forum? What would the subsequent steps reveal? Well, what followed was so below my anticipation that the rest of the novel was a disappointment. There were times that my interest was rekindled but I was becalmed by the awareness that it was merely a false alarm. I know from \\"All the Names\\" that Saramago can make quite a lot out of a bewildering beginning but it didn't work for me with \\"Seeing\\".In fairness to the author, I became aware about half way through \\"Seeing\\" that this may be a sequel to \\"Blindness\\". (Well, DUH!). What I mean is it seemed that it would have been better to have read \\"Blindness\\" first because there were lots of references to when the town had all gone blind inexplicably in the past. With the two books tied together, I realized that I was somewhat at a loss. I've seen enough of the talent of Saramago to realize that I'll eventually read \\"Blindness\\". Maybe after that, I'll give \\"Seeing\\" another look (sorry)."},{"Title":"Seeing","review":"Not Saramago's best, but still better than most of what's out there.

Absent a disastrous translation, it has been a total disappointment so far. I have read 236 pages (out of 306 pages the book has) and it has failed to capture my interest. I have kept reading just in case something interesting happens. But nothing so far. The book lacks the virtuosity and the imagination you would expect from a Nobel Prize winner. The book is about the plot 95% of the time. The psychology of the main characters is practically absent. There are no personal conflicts worth mentioning. This is a very shallow book.

Thankfully Amazon lets you read the first few pages in the \\"Look inside\\" feature and you can see for yourself. This is truly the worst writing I have ever seen.On to the plot. The plot is stupid. A city holds an election,and for some unknown reason most people cast blank ballots. Rather than say, \\"Ok, then we will determine the winner based on the ballots that are not blank\\", the government freaks out and declares martial law, considers sending in paratroopers, and all sorts of insanity. What the paratroopers are supposed to do once they land is never thought through. Basically the government completely freaks out, while in reality there was no explanation for the blank ballots - people independently all decided to cast blank ballots.

With anything from baby dolls to birdcages, fruit to frogs, coffee tables to coffins; he paints a picture that is at times both unsettling and comforting. It brings to the forefront of our minds the dark thoughts and fears that lay within each person upon this planet. However, it also shows in tasteful elegance that such is the way we are all made and there is always a desire for what is considered \\"forbidden\\".

It was my honor and pleasure to read this book and I hope for and expect many more visits to this magical place, compliments of this duo."},{"Title":"Fruit of the Secret God","review":"On first glance, the images in John Santerineross' Fruit of the Secret God are dark, foreboding, unsettling. So why the compulsion to look? If one were to seek a simplistic dismissive answer he might say its like being drawn to the scene of a train wreck, unsettling yet intriguing. If this were so, these images would hold our eye briefly at best. If one steps back and minds what he is feeling father than thinking, he may find an entirely different experience. Dark shadowy images become warm and embracing...stark representations of the human form are rendered tenderly...if there is violence in the embrace, it is measured by calm in the eye of the subject. If the compositions subjugate women, why do the subjects seem so empowered? The artist seems to urge us to examine our definitions of eroticism, sensuality, beauty. To my eye, to my senses, these images produce a feeling of calm...the feeling of a warm reverent embrace of my femininity. Fruit of the Secret God is a complex, evocative, and aesthetically beautiful series of images, which i strongly encourage you to look at for yourself."},{"Title":"Fruit of the Secret God","review":"When I first saw John's work displayed on a website I was overwhelmed by the visuals. The design of his sets, to the models he used, it looked aged to me, antique and quite beautiful in a rough way I have no words for. I immediatly wanted to write something about the scene I was viewing, and that is the highest compliment I can give to another artist. Soon after I had the pleasure of getting to know him as a friend as well as an artist, and there are so many wonderful things to be said about him and his work. His work never ceases to move me in some way and I will always recommend it to others I think will appreciate his unique vision."},{"Title":"Fruit of the Secret God","review":"Everytime I look at these images I see and feel something new. It is very easy to look at a particular image and feel as if you are a part of it, as if your own emotions have created the visual.

His haunting images that showcase femalians wrapped in gauze or naked and clothed merely with angels names written upon them, are really some of the the most original images Ive seen of late. You cant really put his art in a &quot;slot&quot; which is what makes people shy away from some artists and I think this is one of the things that will hurt Santineross in the long run as they will try and slot him in with Witkin. His stuff is really more erotic and more glamourously beautiful than Witkins imagery. Give this book a chance. Youll be happier for it."},{"Title":"Fruit of the Secret God","review":"Santerineross' photographs are reality-bending composites born from the synthesis of his creative energy and dream interpretations. They are dark, foreboding, and at first glance .. fear inducing. Yet he's not what one would call a fetish photographer, nor is he a pornographic image maker seeking to tantalize. His work is a fiendish alchemy of symbolism, archetype, and erotica that when wrought together gives rise to grander sense of itself. It's like how one can get lost in the medieval nightmare of a Hieronymus Bosch painting, or they can revel in its artistic splendor and genius. The same can be said of John Santerineross as he weaves the malcontent elements of his imagination into a provocative and beautiful union. This is a large-format book (13\\" x 10\\") that is a wholly beautiful a production."},{"Title":"Fruit of the Secret God","review":"before my friend pratically made me buy this book, i had never really understood or appreciated visual art. it didn't do anything for me. but after i discovered this book, that changed. his pieces made me feel something, offering me a glimpse into what must be an infinitely complex and talented individual. they made me think about a lot of things, like what constutites beauty and sensuality and power. some of his pieces still make me catch my breath and i feel a sense of awe."},{"Title":"Fruit of the Secret God","review":"I happen to have had the chance to visit with John int he studio where most of this was shot - and I must tell you that the sense of reality you see in his art is present in John's daily life.The book is an amazing addition to your collection."},{"Title":"Simplify","review":"Short story collections are nearly impossible to review, especially in anything under several hundred words. (How do you comment generally on a book that contains twelve different stories that vary in plot, theme, quality, etc.?) Still, there are a few observations that one can make about Tod Goldberg's Simplify. The stories are sharp and insightful, many of them dealing with issues emerging from childhood. The writing is often funny, even when it's painful, and always to the point, with keen dialogue and a strong voice. Finally, the stories on the whole are powerful, provocative and a pleasure to read. The title entry, in particular, is a minor masterpiece."},{"Title":"Simplify","review":"This collection of short stories will keep you awake thinking, or fearing your dreams, for days. Filled with characters you just might know, Simplify is precisely deep enough to still be fun. A great combination of humor and insight runs through these varied glimpses into the contradictions, chaos, and slapstick of life."},{"Title":"Simplify","review":"This is a collection of twelve short stories.*Each story is dark and the majority of them revolve around death.*Each story delivers either a deep life lesson or a view of another person's life that will leave you pondering things that you have probably never thought of.I am amazed at how well the author, Tod Goldberg, understands and is able to portray other people's thoughts and feelings. He tells the story of a messed up child, a suicidal man, a wealthy man with an empty life, a child growing into an adult, a dead child, and the brother of a killer. These are just some of the people that Mr. Goldberg takes the shape of.Each story is written in a unique fashion. Within the first page, you will be sucked in by the unfolding of a foreign life that each story promises.Some of the other reviews label it as sinister or evil. I didn't see it as either. Sorrowful? Maybe. Dark? Definitely. Sinister or evil? Not so much.I'm not a big short story fan. I like stories that I can sink my teeth into for a period of time. I am the kind of person that never wants a good story to end. That being said, I loved this book. The stories allowed me to step into someone else's existence.The stories make you dig deep and think."},{"Title":"Simplify","review":"I greatly enjoyed this book. Tod Goldberg writes in a witty, smart way. The stories in \\"Simplify\\" are often impressionistic. They deal with the emotional life of the character in a very intimate way, but Goldberg manages to remain always sincere, which is not always easy. His writing is very simple, in a way that is reminiscent of Hemingway, only with less wine and tipping of waiters.I also liked how Goldberg's universe is drenched in American pop culture: a coffee-drinking Jesus vs. a beer-drinking devil, a bleeding picture of Elvis... I would highly recommend it to Europeans who want to understand the US a bit better."},{"Title":"Simplify","review":"The stories creep up on you and take hold of you....I was so glad when each new short story was just as good as the last one. I love this author!"},{"Title":"Simplify","review":"Picked up this volume of short stories in anticipation of hearing Tod Goldberg speak and was not disappointed one bit.My favorite story is probably Simplify, the title story, though I really feel that every piece has that same kind of disturbing yet vital pulse. I don't know if I would describe this collection of stories as humorous or fun, though there might be a vein of very black humor underlying some of them. I think it's more like a very dexterous yet raw exploration of what would seem to be ordinary lives and situations, but that are in fact anything but.Overall, the tone is incredible. Goldberg, I feel at least, really flirts on the edge of normality and sanity. I felt alternately sorry for and disturbed by his characters, even while I identified with them and could understand their emotional/mental responses, even as the stories themselves spiral into some jarring extremes."},{"Title":"Simplify","review":"I was looking for something to add to my summer reading list and boy did I find it. I couldn't put this down. Surreal, disturbing, insightful, brilliant, grounded. Each vignette transports you instantly to the lives of the characters. I was both drawn to and repulsed by each of the main characters. Tod Goldberg is effing brilliant."},{"Title":"Simplify","review":"Reading--and especially enjoying--short stories is unusual for me. I bought the book because I read Tod Goldberg's blog regularly and decided to take a chance. I'm glad I did.Simplify is a collection of good, readable stories, mostly describing the fine line between sanity and not.I loved it, but I'm not sure how to describe it."},{"Title":"You Don't Need Plastic Surgery: The Doctor's Guide to Youthful Looks with No Surgery, No Pain, No Downtime","review":"Finally I readable book with understandable advice on looking better and yonger without the hype."},{"Title":"COPPER CAMP","review":"This is an exceptional word picture of a fascinating part of the United States.

There are lots of color photos. It contains many detailed b/w photo steps for creating bonsai and it illustrates a great variety of plants."},{"Title":"The Book of Common Prayer (Proposed)","review":"The Book of Common Prayer (1979) is the latest, complete BCP used by the American branch of the Anglicans, the Episcopal church. There have been many books that have had the title 'Book of Common Prayer' since the first one appeared in 1549; it has been used continuously in one edition or another in the Anglican tradition since 1559; the 'main' edition remains the 1662 edition. The American church modified the Book of Common Prayer for its own use beginning shortly after the Revolutionary War -- this book is the successor of a long and worthy tradition.A bishop in the Episcopal church once said to me, 'We don't have a theology that we have to believe -- what we have is the prayerbook.' Please forgive the absence of context for this phrase -- while he would say that this statement in isolation is an exaggeration, and I would agree, nonetheless his statement serves to highlight both the importance of and the strength of the Book of Common Prayer.To be an Anglican (in the United States, read Episcopalian for the same in the context of this article), one does not have to subscribe to any particular systematic theological framework. One does not have to practice a particular brand of liturgical style. One does not have to have an approved politico-theological viewpoint. One can be a conservative, liberal or moderate; one can be high church, low church, or broad; one can be charismatic, evangelical, or mainline traditional -- one can be any number of things in a rich diversity of choices, and the Book of Common Prayer can still be the book upon which spirituality and worship is centred.The Book of Common Prayer is not, in fact, a book that changed my life. It is a book that changes my life. Even though it is not the primary book of my own church, it continues to provide for spiritual insight and development; it continues to guide my worship and my theology. It continues to help me grow. The words are part of a liturgy now shared by Catholic, Lutheran, Methodist, Presbyterian and other liturgical churches, in different combination and priority.Gerry Janzen, an Anglican professor at my seminary, said to me recently as we were lunching and having a fascinating and wide-ranging conversation (in a unique way that only Gerry Janzen is capable of doing) that he strives for that kind of memory and understanding that is so complete that one forgets what one has learned. He recounted to me his experience of working with his book on Job -- he had done a lot of research, development of ideas, writing, and organisation, and then set it aside for a time. When he picked up the topic later, he decided to begin by writing, and then go back to the research, other notes and writings he had done earlier. He was surprised to see, in comparing the work, that he had in fact duplicated much of the material -- he had internalised the information, incorporated it so well into his thinking and being, that it came forward without effort. It is this kind of relationship I feel I have developed with the Book of Common Prayer.To be sure, there are pages of information that I don't know. I haven't memorised the historical documents; I still consult the calendars; I haven't learned all of the collects by heart. But it has become a part of me. When was asked to put together a liturgy for a houseblessing for Episcopalian friends, there were rooms that called for collects that had not been written -- I wrote new collects and inserted them into the liturgy.'Can you do that?' the householder asked, worried about the flow and the approval of the priest doing the blessing.'I trust Kurt to write collects -- his probably belong in the BCP,' the priest said in response, and I appreciated her vote of confidence. That was perhaps the first confirmation to me of this sense of incorporation of the book into my life.From his first edition, Cranmer distinguished in his terminology the words minister and priest, and the two should not be viewed as interchangeable. A priest is a minister, but a minister need not be a priest. This become part of the early development of the idea of all people being ministers to each other, which is also a concept that has varying acceptance and fulfillment in actual practice over the history of Anglicanism.One of my favourite prayers derives from this book, part of the English prayer book from the very first one in 1549:Almighty God, who hast given us grace at this time with one accord to make our common supplication unto thee, and hast promised through thy well-beloved Son that when two or three are gathered together in his name, thou wilt be in the midst of them: Fulfill now, O Lord, the desires and petitions of thy servants, as may be best for us, granting us in this world knowledge of thy truth, and in the world to come, life everlasting. Amen.This prayer, like many things in the BCP, has moved to a new location from the first edition, but nonetheless the spirit of the BCP shows a circuitous but continuous development from this first English Prayer Book to the current varieties. Likewise, other denominations have gleaned insights, prayers and structures from this and other versions of the BCP.The current Book of Common Prayer is not copyrighted material. The purpose for leaving the BCP out of copyright is to permit free and easy duplication and incorporation into worship materials; however, it also serves the purpose (deliberately intended) of permitting people, Anglicans or not, to use portions of the BCP as inspiration and material for their own worship. The Book of Common Prayer is an Anglican gift to the world."},{"Title":"The Book of Common Prayer (Proposed)","review":"This is the prayer book used by the American Episcopal Church and the language is rich, powerful, inspiring, forgiving and just plain beautiful. It is gorgeous in its simplicity. As Red Barber said in praising the BCP(and I am quoting from Bob Edwards' great book Fridays with Red) &quot;the beauty and conciseness of the English language, the fact that everything the Episcopal Church stood for was right there between the two covers, and the inclusion of the entire book of Psalms&quot;Other Episcopalians will criticize me for &quot;commonizing&quot; their book but his review was right on the money.Both Barber and former president Bush include the BCP in their list of &quot;must read&quot; books.Its beauty is in its simplicity and grace."},{"Title":"The Book of Common Prayer (Proposed)","review":"Note that this prayer book is authorized by the Episcopal Church of Scotland.

I too wanted the American book and, further, one whose print is readable not microscopic!. This book will be donated to a paperback exchange since I missed the deadline to return it."},{"Title":"The Book of Common Prayer (Proposed)","review":"I don't presume to review the \\"icon\\" part of this book -- the rituals, litanies and prayers that are a staple of American Episcopal worship and that have (with varying degrees of acceptance) been in use since 1979 if not all the way back to the English Reformation.The item itself, moreover, is hardly a bad bargain IMHO -- it has over 1,000 pages, yet sells for a little less than the average trade paperback of 250 pages. The onionskin pages are not hard to turn. For about five dollars more, permanence is available in the form of a leather-bound edition.If you are new to Episcopalianism, a wonderful thing to own is this book. Odds are overwhelming your local Episcopal church also stocks this prayer book in its pews for worship services, but I for one like having one at home for private devotion and contemplation.You will also find at Amazon lots more books ABOUT this seminal book and its uses."},{"Title":"The Book of Common Prayer (Proposed)","review":"I bought six copies as gifts for friends.

It has the same content and pagination as the book used at church, but is physically smaller and a more convenient size to carry with you in a purse or briefcase.

Why they were in that cell was anybody's guess, and why they were in Lebanon was their own guess.&quot; (p. 17)This is how one of the characters describes their own situation. It sounds like the beginning of a joke and indeed, humour-light hearted as well as black-gets its fair share in McGuinness play. But it never truly manages to conceal the desperateness of their situation.Having been kidnapped for political reasons unknown to them, by people who are only referred to as 'Arabs' or 'the Enemy', the three hostages have to cope with the daily challenge of fear and monotony. While their captor's strength 'depends on silence' as one of the characters observes, their own depends on communication. There are savage fights between the three as well as gentle understanding, uproarious laughter and deep grief. The play takes the audience on a rollercoaster journey through the horrors of captivity, the balm of memory and the unbreakable strength of friendships forged in dire circumstance.The play is inspired by the true story of Brian Keenan from Northern Ireland, who was kidnapped in 1986 shortly after taking up his position as a lecturer of English at the American University in Beirut. He was released in 1990 after talks between the Irish and the Iranian government. Most of the four years and five months in Lebanese captivity he spent together with John McCarthy, a British journalist. McCarthy had in fact come to Beirut to make a documentary about the hostage situation and was kidnapped shortly after Brian Keenan. The two men became close friends. When Brian Keenan was released he said that to leave behind his co-hostage was 'like losing an arm'. John McCarthy was not released until August 1991 after more than five years in captivity."},{"Title":"Someone Who'll Watch Over Me: A Play","review":"this book was recommended by a friend of mine. i ordered years ago and i was just reminded that i never received it. i did order it from an outsourced seller through amazon. so yeah, i'm done writing about this..."},{"Title":"Wallace Stevens (Writers and critics)","review":"Stevens is a meditative, mantic, hieratic poet, hence his auditory manner is majestically reflective, slow, & oracular. If you know & care for his poetry his readings are revelatory of its sounds, gestures, gait. It may not be what you expect. It may well be an acquired taste. But once you have his voice in your inner ear you respond to his work as you read it in a more knowing - slower & measured - way. A pity we don't have more of him, more poems from \\"Harmonium,\\" & especially readings of the longer works, in particular his supreme masterwork, \\"Notes Toward a Supreme Fiction.\\" But if only for \\"Large Red Man Reading,\\" \\"To an old Philosopher in Rome,\\" and \\"Final Soliloquy of the Interior Paramour\\" this album is indispensable. I can't complain about audience noises - what little we have of Stevens is valuable beyond measure."},{"Title":"Wallace Stevens (Writers and critics)","review":"Stevens' voice is slow and deep.

For so large a man, his voice is as little as a mouse. The rewards for those dedicated to Stevens' poetry is, however, great. The intesity and simplicity of the meaning of the poems he reads is transmitted by the emphasis placed by his own voice. You have no doubt what the poem is about when you hear Stevens read them. That's revelatory.

Jodee explains the inner workings of every aspect of the media, and how to approach a television producer versus a radio producer or news paper editor, and why. Moreover she gives example after example of how to write a grreat press release, cover letter, question and topic sheets, but her greatest accomplishment is her intensive work on fiction.NO OTHER BOOK I have read comes close to covering \\"How To\\" promote fiction like this one does.

Since then, the issue has popped up every so often, usually generating much more heat than light in examinating the role of clerks. Fortunately, we now have probably as solid an analysis of the role of clerks as we will ever get in this fine book by two political scientists.The authors have reviewed all printed material on clerks, checked judicial biographies, surveyed oral history collections, conducted extensive interviews, and submitted an extensive written questionnaire to 600 former clerks selected on a random basis. The picture that emerges is skillfully developed, with helpful charts and figures, as well as an exceptionally detailed set of notes and bibliography for those interested in further research. At around 250 pages, the authors have managed to strike a beneficial balance between detail and survey, so the narrative moves along smoothly.The authors discuss all key issues relating to clerks: selection, their critical role in reviewing cert. petitions and making recommendations, the drafting of bench memos, serving as communication conduits and coalition builders between chambers, and the all-important and most controversial element, their role in drafting opinions for their Justices. I think it fair to say that the authors conclude that clerks do have influence in the Court's decision-making process, but not to the extent of manipulating results. The more substantial problem that emerges from the book is whether the Supreme Court has become too bureaucratized and \\"depersonalized\\" as each term the Court works its way through thousands of cert. petitions and cranks out it published decisions on argued cases. This situation raises serious issues, as does the role of the clerks and the issue of whether the Justices have abdicated any of their constitutional responsibilities. Fortunately, we are in a much better position to grapple with both these issues because of this fine and highly interesting book."},{"Title":"Sorcerers' Apprentices: 100 Years of Law Clerks at the United States Supreme Court","review":"This book is an excellent look at the changing roles that Supreme Court clerks have played over the last 100 years. I highly recommend this to anyone who is curious about the workings of the Supreme Court. The writing is clear and enjoyable - definitely not just for law geeks!"},{"Title":"Sorcerers' Apprentices: 100 Years of Law Clerks at the United States Supreme Court","review":"A book ten years in the making, Sorcerers' Apprentices is an intriguing and sometimes unsettling look at the world of law clerks. Most people know precious little about this field. Ward and Weiden provide an eye-opener.Being a law clerk is to basically be a research assistant for a judge. Being that the United States Supreme Court is the highest court in the land, being a clerk for an U.S. Supreme Court judge (a \`Justice') is the pinnacle in this field. As former clerks to a Supreme Court Justice, these young men and women will be the most sought after candidates at law firms across the country. Many will later be offered judgeships themselves.After a decade of research, pouring through the personal papers of justices and court employees, and interviews with former clerks, the authors discovered that the law clerk went from being little more than a secretary in the 1930's to a position of enormous power today. Perhaps the greatest power is in the \\"certiorari process\\" of choosing what cases the Supreme Court will hear. Of the over 8,000 cases submitted annually to the Supreme Court, only a few hundred perhaps will be heard. It would appear that the law clerks suggestions to their respective Justices on which cases to hear has had a great impact on the types of cases heard. And changes on the constitutionality of specific laws in specific areas literally changes people's lives.Another issue of concern is that for some Justices, the bulk of their decisions may come not from legal research, but from the opinions written by their law clerks. Some have gone so far as to say that in some cases it is the law clerk who actually writes the final opinion; the Justice simply signing it. Others point out that the opinions expressed verbally by law clerks to their Justice may actually hold more sway over a decision than the attorneys presenting the case.Filled with quotes, text, research, analyses, and charts galore, Sorcerers' Apprentices: 100 Years of Law Clerks at the United States Supreme Court is a revealing look at the workings of the U.S. Supreme Court. It sheds light on an institution that few in America have any knowledge about, but that affects us all. Ward and Weiden present nearly as many questions in this book as they do insights. Do law clerks have more power than they used to? Do they have more power than they should? Should this be rectified, and if so, how? In the end, Sorcerers' Apprentices is a fascinating look at a world few ever see."},{"Title":"Sorcerers' Apprentices: 100 Years of Law Clerks at the United States Supreme Court","review":"This book is hands down the best book published about Supreme Court clerks. Dr. Art Ward has written an exhaustive and accurate book that details the true role of clerks in the Supreme Court. It raises eyebrows and highlights that any discussion on the Supreme Court is incomplete without aknowledging the role of clerks. It is a must read by anybody interested in the Court or in judicial politics."},{"Title":"Sorcerers' Apprentices: 100 Years of Law Clerks at the United States Supreme Court","review":"This book is a must read for court watchers. You cannot understand the modern court without understanding the role of the modern court clerk. Simply the best researched book on the topic."},{"Title":"The Nightwalker","review":"This is one of the few books I couldn't finish. What was Stephen King thinking, endorsing it? OK, so the writing was fresh and the style was interesting, but it sort of just plodded along. I found myself at first excited by the anticipation of something happening, then just impatient for it to happen. I read a good two-thirds, so I feel qualified to write a review. Points for obviously knowing the craft of WRITING. Points taken away for not being a great storyteller-at least, not on this one."},{"Title":"The Nightwalker","review":"A riveting exploration of lycanthropy and insanity, The Nightwalker has several things going for it, among them Tessier's lucid prose, expert plotting, and a remarkable evocation of the city of London.The novel tells the story of US expatriate Bobby Ives, an aimless Vietnam veteran living in London with his girlfriend. The extremely volatile Ives is obsessed with two strange events in his past: the fact that he was declared dead in Vietnam via administrative error, and the time he experienced a vivid waking dream, in which he became a zombie.Ives finds himself becoming more susceptible to uncontrolled rage; he also experiences quasi-fugue states where he lets that rage overwhelm him. In the midst of such a fugue state, he's capable of great violence. His girlfriend dies as the result of one of his rages; other victims soon follow.At first, he perversely revels in the changes that have occurred. Then, realizing that he is swiftly losing control, he seeks help from a clairvoyant who seems to have insight into his condition. She initially refuses, and his rampages continue. Eventually, she relents, and tries to help him by imprisoning him. Her efforts prove unsuccessful, as he escapes confinement, forcing her to take more drastic action.Effective and disturbing , The Nightwalker is a compelling fictional study of one man's descent into madness, exploring the chaos that results when a troubled individual gives in to his inner rage. Whether viewed as a terrifying novel of the supernatural or as a gripping psychological study, The Nightwalker, to paraphrase Stephen King's words in praise of the book (see Danse Macabre for his full evaluation), is perhaps the finest werewolf novel of the past forty years."},{"Title":"The Nightwalker","review":"I collect horror novels and keep the good ones. This one is a keeper. Very good writing short and to the point moves quickly and is very scary. I own two copies. &quot;The Nightwalker&quot; and &quot;The Wolf's Hour&quot; are my favorite werewolf stories ever written."},{"Title":"The Nightwalker","review":"I bought this book with the intention it was going to be a really good werewolf story that would hopefully thrill and captivate me, but was let down COMPLETELY. The story is SHORT. The book is only 183 pages and reads like a short story you would find in a compilation. The writing is halfway decent and I think the story had the capability of being good but it fell flat and there never really seemed to be any climactic moments. The main character is someone you dont really like or have any feelings for and his journey into \\"madness\\" is disturbing and unneccessary for the storyline. There is even a gory sex scene that I will never be able to shake that involved a menstruating teen girl...YUCK! The ending was DUMB....Nothing seemed to happen and It didn't even feel like he really was a werewolf...I kept wondering if he was just crazy or if maybe I was going crazy from the crappy storyline. All in all, it was a really really dumb book with a terrible plot and one disgusting sex scene that will remain with you for days. Dont buy this garbage."},{"Title":"The Nightwalker","review":"As Jack Ketchum notes in the introduction to Thomas Tessier's The Nightwalker, the werewolf is generally underrepresented in fiction, especially compared to ghosts, vampires and zombies. This reprint of Tessier's 1979 novel helps to fill the void.Actually, Bobby Ives may or may not be a werewolf. He is, however, an American in London who is haunted by memories of the Vietnam War as well as a possible past life. He is also occasionally finding himself disconnected from reality and overwhelmed with violent feelings. He is possibly becoming a werewolf, but he is certainly because some sort of beast, and he is relishing the feeling more and more.This is a decent enough novel, which plays with the werewolf legend while not necessarily adhering to it. For one thing, Ives is not the victim of a werewolf bite, nor are his transformations constrained by the moon. Since the whole story follows Ives's point-of-view, for the most part we only given glimpses into what he becomes. Indeed, that is the heart of this small novel: it has less to do with the physical monster than the transformation of Ives's soul.As I just mentioned, this is a small novel, just a shade over 200 pages. As a bonus, this book includes a 100 page novella called The Dreams of Dr. Ladybank. This is a tale of the title psychiatrist who has discovered he can project his thoughts into other people. Unfortunately, it only works on two people, a male prostitute and a pimp; Ladybank manipulates both of their lives, quickly discarding the motive of \\"scientific interest\\" in favor of sadistic pleasure.Both stories are good tales of both psychological and supernatural horror. While entertaining, they lack that extra oomph that could make them truly great; in part, this is because there are times when things are a little predictable. They do have enough originality, however, to merit reading if you're a horror fan."},{"Title":"The Nightwalker","review":"I love this book. Short and sharp, Tessier's prose is incisive and deadly as it sketches out the psychological transformation of a man from damaged goods into a violent and perhaps supernatural murderer, as he is plagued by mysterious dreams and terrifying rages.The true genius of the book is to paint the whole disturbing metamorphosis through the eyes of the man himself as he succumbs to a bizarre lycanthropic curse. This allows Tessier to leave the door wide open to madness on the one hand and magic on the other. I found this added a very stark edge of gritty reality to what might otherwise have been a work of pure fantasy.There's no logical connection between the dreams of zombies and his subtle transformation, and this adds equally to either possibility of insanity or sorcery, as Bobby's brain struggles to make sense of the bestial episodes that come to dominate his life, and the deep, animal pleasure that he derives from them.The book oozes brutal sensuality and the ferocious sadomasochistic lust of his relationship with Angel I found both chilling and compelling. The almost accidental circumstances of her murder at his hands brings his detachment from human sensibilities into ghastly relief.The ending was inevitable. I wanted it, feared it, expected it and enjoyed it. A shot of espresso straight to my gothic horror gland."},{"Title":"The Nightwalker","review":"A quick read--perhaps a little too quick at the end, which felt rushed and left me wanting more (in the way where I felt a little cheated, not in the way where I was sad that it had to end).It is a slightly different take on the wolf-man mythos. (As a note, for me there's a difference between a wolf-man, who retains a distinctly human shape when transformed (think Lon Chaney in the Wolf-Man), and a werewolf, who becomes either a four legged animal or bipedal wolf (ala, The Howling).) There doesn't appear to be an instigating factor to his transformations nor does it ever really get explained. For a good deal of the book, you're not really sure if it's in Bobby Ives' head, or if it's really happening to him. This uncertainty would be more endearing if it paid off better at the end, and for me it didn't.As another note, the way the author chose to clarify what was actually happening to Ives was via \\"head pops\\" from the main character to others. This was done only a couple of times and was always jarring when it happened.Finally, I never made any emotional connection with the main character, never cared about what he was going through, or what he was putting those around him through. I think this was because so much of the book was internal monologue, which had little impact on Ives' life.What worked for me:=========================================* suitably atmospheric* if you ignore head hopping, it's strongly written* new take on what it's like to be a Wolf-ManWhat didn't work for me:=========================================* never cared about any of the characters* what was happening to the protagonist and why it was happening were never explained* too much internal monologue"},{"Title":"The Nightwalker","review":"Like most, I came to this book because Stephen King praises it so highly in Danse Macabre. Unfortunately, when the Master praises a book so muc, it is quite easy to disappoint. The scares in Nightwalker are mostly psychological.This is described as a werewolf story, but is more of a \\"variation on theme.\\" Anyone coming to this book looking for the usual - the full moon, the dramatic transformation scene, the unwilling monster - will be disappointed. In fact the nature of his transformation is always left in doubt: Does he change at all?The story concerns an American Vietnam Vet living near Hyde Park in London. (Side note: Just what is it about werewolves in London? You'd think they'd be used to them by now.) Unlike most werewolves, Bobby is gripped with a compulsive desire to kill, which he can't quite control. After his murders, he doesn't feel particularly guilty - and therefore, not too likeable.This is a good book, but it has its flaws. For instance, there is a sub-plot involving Bobby's previous life - as a zombie! But, if you are a horror fan, and you are not looking for the greatest book ever written, it is worthwhile."},{"Title":"The Nightwalker","review":"Werewolves and shapeshifters have been extensively chronicled and romanticized in the most mediocre ways possible (with the Twilight series as the most famous catastrophe to date). Thomas Tessier's The Nightwalker is an intelligent, original treatment of lycanthropy, which is definitely not for people who read the work of Stephenie Meyer.The changes in Bobby Ives, the main character, may or may not be psychological in nature. The backdrop of the story is London, and there are exciting references to the underground punk rock scene. The prose styling is excellent as Thomas Tessier is also a poet."},{"Title":"The Nightwalker","review":"I really appreciated Tessier's new and refreshing approach to the werewolf mythology. While I don't think all the historical elements came together as cohesively as they should have, I had a good time reading this. I would have preferred to not even know what the book was about since the werewolf idea doesn't come into play for quite a while into the story.Tessier's technical and creative writing is excellent, but like many of his other books, his tempo is completely off. Certain scenes are nicely slow and atmospheric and then, without warning, events happen very quickly, leaving out what I feel are crucial details, mood, and tone. Then things abruptly slow back down before spastically speeding up again. It almost felt like Tessier writes every day and then takes a few weeks off and can't quite get back into the groove of the story.My only other issue is the slightly unsatisfying ending. Tessier managed to pull everything together but I think it felt too short and rushed. Regardless, I enjoy his writing and ever since reading his amazing book, Finishing Touches, I'll always pick up his work."},{"Title":"The Nightwalker","review":"i tried to not like this book. it was plodding at times and i wouldn't give the main guy the time of day, but there was something about the story as a whole that makes this a really good horror read. it's filled with unease and sudden shots of violence. the prose is engaging in that disturbing kind of way. i have to say that when i finished i was glad i stayed with it."},{"Title":"The Nightwalker","review":"This is not your straight forward typical werewolf tale. It is an indepth take on the werewolf and a man's change, both physiological and mental. It's about a man's struggle with what he's been and become. The beginning is a little slow, but picks up full throttle. Dont go in with expectations, just read it."},{"Title":"The Nightwalker","review":"I was expecting more than I got, manly in the terms of the werewolf transformation/s, the author just made it seem like the main character was some rabided carriering psycho-path instead of a werewolf...Thats what disapointed me about this book, I have been looking for a good werewolf book and I guess this was not it.:("},{"Title":"The Nightwalker","review":"I'll read it for the third time one day. I don't actually keep many horror novels after reading them, but this, along w/ Tessier's FINISHING TOUCHES, I certainly have! You just won't come across a better modern psychological werewolf-in-London story than this. And guess who agrees with that? Stephen King."},{"Title":"Israeli F-4 Phantom II Aces (Aircraft of the Aces)","review":"Really rare and hard to find data on Israeli Phantom kills, covering every kill (many in details). Many non-seen before photos and exceptional color profiles.The information that presented in the book is the Israeli look on the Phantom air-to-air combat results. It is not a traditional ace by ace coverage, but more chronological victory by victory account, grouped by squadrons.There is also a very, very brief biography of ace pilots (not the navigators).The problem is - the Osprey book format (96pp), there is so much information, photos and details to be covered, that 96 pages are simply not enough. To compensate this, the photos are shrunk and the text is very compact. I could wish more exceptional photos to be included, as I've seen some in different sources.Bottom line, I will suggest this book to every aviation enthusiast, who deals with Middle East aviation warfare."},{"Title":"Israeli F-4 Phantom II Aces (Aircraft of the Aces)","review":"Israeli F-4 Phantom II Aces, by Shlomo Aloni, offers superb combat narratives, photography, and other illustrations of one of the most important warplanes in history. For anyone interested in modern Israeli military history and/or the F-4 in particular, this is a \\"must have\\" volume.However, I would offer two criticisms. One, I would have liked to have seen more technical data/history on the F-4s used by Israel, so as to be able to put their combat use in greater perspective. Along with this, I would have liked to have seen a description of the \\"Kurnass 2000\\" upgrade program; this type is mentioned repeatedly, but just what the upgrade consisted of is not described in any detail.I understand that this volume primarily concerns \\"combat aces\\" - i.e., the men who flew the planes and their exploits - rather than the airplane itself. However, while \\"war stories\\" are fascinating, it is rare that I have seen comparable histories involving other aircraft that are as devoid of technical treatment of the aircraft in question as this work is."},{"Title":"Israeli F-4 Phantom II Aces (Aircraft of the Aces)","review":"i got this being interested in the combat history of the phantom and its abilities against soviet fighters,also in wishing to read about how it faired against them when they did not have crippling ROE working against them like in vietnam.I was very very board reading it as its hole text just one sleep inducing jumble of numbers.The decsriptions of the air fights is very brief and usually is SUCH AND SUCH GOT THEIR 3RD MIG KILL ETC ETC.The pictures are good and the plates are acceptable but thats not good enough if the bulk of the text is boring,hence the one star."},{"Title":"John C. Calhoun, American portrait","review":"Coit offers a very readable treatment of Calhoun's life. In concocting this work, the author does go into a more literary mode to make things more interesting. She does offer some imagined thoughts fresh from Calhoun's mind. This does not make the book worthy of your disregard, rather it just requires you to appreciate the book for what it happens to be. It is a very good introduction to Calhoun. You will get some anecdotes regarding his life and the decisions he made, but without the solid intellectual footing that would allow one to discern what unfolded in his life. In essence, you get the highlights without being exposed to the process of making this man's paradigm. Calhoun should go down in American history as one of the senators who had a very significant impact upon the nation's history. The former Vice-President was able to become the spokesman of the minority within that era. In doing so, he offered a vigorous justification of why the majority should be limited in what they can do to the minority. His explanation is as sound as today for any minority as it was for defending the South in his time. You will not get how he came to this in this book, but you will get the fact that he did. And you will not be bored in the process."},{"Title":"John C. Calhoun, American portrait","review":"Readers will either love or hate Margaret Coit's Pulitzer Prize winning biography on John C. Calhoun. Coit has a very vivid style and sometimes she comes dangerously close to crossing the line into writing fiction (such as when she enters the mind of a dying Calhoun and offers a series of flashback sketches). She offers a generally interesting biography even if she gets bogged down in anecdotal stories and speculations (including the annoying Lincoln was Calhoun's illegitimate son story). This is the most accessible biography of Calhoun which does redeem some of its flaws. Still while Coit does offer a solid narrative of Calhoun's long and often tempestuous political career and is better than some of Calhoun's other biographers on sections of his life (including his home life at Fort Hill), the book fails in offering a good analysis of Calhoun as a political theorist. However if someone wants a good account of Calhoun's political and home life without dozing off, Coit's book is a good place to start."},{"Title":"John C. Calhoun, American portrait","review":"Of the three members of the Great Triumvirate--Henry Clay, Daniel Webster and John Calhoun--Calhoun was arguably the least interesting. He was not a poker playing rogue like Clay, nor a thunderously captivating speaker and industry shill like Webster. But his influence during four decades of national life cannot be denied, which is one of the reasons why scholars to this day argue over whether there are two distinct periods to Calhoun's career: his earlier years when he seemed more inclined to support national-oriented legislation and his later years when he appears as an early \\"states rights\\" man.Coit, who clearly admires Calhoun and is determined to unearth the person behind the stony legend, argues that Calhoun's devotion to nation and state were as one and that in his view only through a determined affirmation of the rights of the states could the larger national confederation succeed.A previous reviewer notes a problem with Coit trying to get inside of Calhoun's head, imagining what he was thinking. Undoubtedly today this aspect of her book would fall well short of academic standards. But in every other way, this is a strong book, and most of all, it is a beautiful literary achievement--it does read like fiction."},{"Title":"John C. Calhoun, American portrait","review":"If you think you understand American history, or even current day US political issues, but don't know about John C. Calhoun and the struggle over \\"nullification\\" then you are mistaken. This book is like going to the headwaters of a large river from whence flows the civil war, new deal, great society and even Obama care. Here is where the struggle over the power and scope of the Federal government's power was first waged in earnest in the practical reality of American politics. In the historical economic context, what followed, if not inevitable, is certainly put into proper perspective."},{"Title":"The Covenant/The Inheritance/The Dream (The White Pines Chronicles 1-3)","review":"This trilogy is the one of the best peices of literature I have ever read in my life. it touched my heart as well as my soul and I find it extremely sad that it is no longer available.

Jennet fears she will never be able to survive under Taits strict and cruel hand until one fateful day when Freeman Havlick saves her.

It was fascinating. Christopher Boyce, convicted spy, escaped from prison and managed to elude the police for something like 18 months! Whoa! Robert Lindsey, who also wrote The Falcon and the Snowman about Boyce and Daulton Lee's actual crimes and trials, came to know Boyce after his incarceration and recounts the events as told to him by Boyce without bias but with a keen, critical eye. A truely fascinating book."},{"Title":"The Flight of the Falcon: The True Story of the Escape and Manhunt for America's Most Wanted Spy","review":"You know how this book is going to end, but despite that, it is impossible to put it down - as long as you make it to the last third. The beginning 20 pages tells the tale of Chris Boyce's escape from prison (He is the former USSR spy brought to fame by the movie \\"Falcon and the Snowman.\\") The next 180 pages or so starts off well but then bogs down as it presents all the false-leads that law enforcement got stuck with in their going-nowhere-fast manhunt for him over the next 12-18 months. The final third presents Boyce's perspective of where he was hiding until they caught him at the end, and although you know it will end in his capture, it is an amazing and addictive read.As a humorous aside, I love the idea of FBI agents and US marshalls driving around Port Angeles WA in the summer of 1981 looking for him, openly drinking cans of beer as they drive around town. Federal law enforcement officials drinking AND driving simultaneously on a national manhunt. How times have changed.

The Flight of the Falcon is one of the best. It's a story about a smart, young, convicted spy and his escape from prison. I give it only four stars because the author kind of went over board on the whole \\"follow the false leads\\" thing. For 18 months they got thousands of leads that went absolutely nowhere and Boyce was well on his way to freedom. But the play by play accounts of each false lead was redundant and tedious. Lindsey took a gamble with that and won.....in my opinion. All the redundancy paid off in a big way with a truly exciting escape story."},{"Title":"The Flight of the Falcon: The True Story of the Escape and Manhunt for America's Most Wanted Spy","review":"Interesting story and have two close friends who knew some of the characters.

Freshmen following a first course in cosmology may also find this book useful as a first intuitive approach to the field. The author is extremely clear in his explanations and he reminds me the writing style of French Canadian Hubert Reeves, one of the most famous cosmology writers for the general public.Structuring the book with &quot;questions&quot; is an extremely useful approach for those trying to demystify space and time."},{"Title":"Cosmic Questions: Galactic Halos, Cold Dark Matter and the End of Time","review":"This is another \\"feel good\\" book that merely recounts the current state of political correctness in cosmology. For the novice, it gives answers to what the current establishment sanctions as the leading theory of how the universe came into existence. If you are looking to acquaint yourself with a superficial account of the Big Bang, this is one book among many that does the job. If however, you are looking for a book with real substance, go elsewhere. There is one thing that I find particularly distasteful, both in this book and in many others that I have read. It is the assertion that all the \\"good\\" scientists believe as the author thinks they should. Here's an example from page 7. \\"In the view of most, there were no good reasons to question the basic theory\\" (of the Big Bang). I doubt that the author has interviewed \\"most scientists\\", and so I believe it to be highly suspicious that he can make so sweeping a statement. Of course if a scientist does oppose the Big Bang theory, he will most likely find his career jeopardized. Such is the fate of those who don't play follow the leader. Halton Arp adn Fred Hoyle point out these things very well.

They inherited their late great uncle Horatio's home with some stipulations, no cash for so many years. Although named the Grace and Favor Cottage, it is really a mansion, and Lily tired of trying to make ends meet, has an idea how to use the cottage to earn a living. She wants to turn it in to a Bed and Breakfast of sorts, invite a famous person, and surround him or her with fans. The first blessed or cursed soul, depending on which side you are looking at, is the famous fiction war writer, Julian West. With him comes his helper, a young man that has been with him and his cousin for years. Also on the list of paying guests are Addie Jonson, a teacher; professor, and critic Cecil Hoornart; siblings and old Brewster acquaintances, Raymond and Rachel Cameron; Mad Henry, invited by Robert, and one self-invited guest who gets permanently uninvited. Support characters back again are, the estate lawyer, Mr. Prinny, the cook Mrs. Prinny, the maid Mimi, the police chief Howard Walker, and news editor Jack Summer. Life goes on for these recurring characters and the reader has the pleasure of joining in.It's a fun mystery, full of wonderful characters. The storyline repeats some of the Brewster duos past, and there are some small spoilers, so if you haven't read the first Grace and Favor Mystery, Anything Goes, you may want to. It took me a little longer to solve this mystery than the last. The plot was pretty basic, but what makes the read so fascinating is the atmosphere, with the jargon and historical facts sprinkled through out, it really brought the thirties era to life.

Robert and Lily decide to use the mansion they inherited from their Great Uncle Horatio to host a paying weekend where their society friends (who still have plenty of money) can mingle with celebrity writer Julian West.

The party weekend is completely spoiled when Lorna Ethridge, one of the geusts, is found strangled in her bedroom after the first evening at Grace and Favor. In an effort to clear the mansion of scandal, Lily and Robert set out to find out the killer's identity.\\"In the Still of the Night\\" is the second novel in the Grace and Favor series, set in upper New York State during the Great Depression. The story is filled with everyday details about life in the Depression and is full of 1930's ambience. Author Churchill continues to do a great job of developing the main characters in the story, as well as fleshing out other characters who were only briefly introduced in the series premiere \\"Anything Goes.\\" I look forward to enjoying the next installment in this fun period mystery series."},{"Title":"In the Still of the Night (Grace & Favor Mystery Series #2)","review":"As a lover of a good mystery, I picked up this book because it listed Ms. Churchill as being the \\"Winner of the Agatha and Macavity Mystery Readers Awards.\\" She obviously did not win with this piece of work.It almost reads more as a romance novel for women too ashamed to buy the books with Fabio on the cover.The outcome is predictable and the subplot is mundane at best. Not for sincere fans of mysteries."},{"Title":"In the Still of the Night (Grace & Favor Mystery Series #2)","review":"As a big fan of Jane Jeffrey, I was very disappointed with this Grace and Favor book. The two uppity main characters in this book are not nearly as interesting as the contemporary housewife Jane Jeffrey. I could not identify with a couple of 20-ish young people of the 30's who inherit a large home from their uncle, but who have to have paying guests in order to support their expensive habits. Please give us more of Jane and less of Grace &amp; Favor."},{"Title":"In the Still of the Night (Grace & Favor Mystery Series #2)","review":"I had never read any of Jill Churchill's books, as I am usually a fan of British mysteries. However, I was intrigued by the premise of an American series set in what has always been known as the Golden Age of British Mysteries, the late 20's and 30's. I enjoyed ANYTHING GOES and was delighted by IN THE STILL OF THE NIGHT. Lily and Robert Brewster, a high society brother and sister who have been wiped out in the Crash have inherited a slightly down at the heels mansion in the Hudson Valley and a huge fortune-if they can live in the house with very few financial resources for ten years. Their solution is to take in paying guests to help keep afloat. This sets up a perfect scenario for the &quot;Country House Murder&quot; so beloved by the golden age writers. It's a great read for fans of Agatha Christie who aren't fond of the modern tendency for graphic detail."},{"Title":"In the Still of the Night (Grace & Favor Mystery Series #2)","review":"As she did in her first Grace and Favor novel, Anything Goes, Jill Churchill has written another wonderful addition to this mystery series with the publication of In the Still of the Night.Brother and sister, Lily and Robert Brewster, are now living in the mansion they inherited from their Uncle Horatio. Getting used to small town life on the Hudson has proved to be pleasant but these two young people must now begin earning an income. Athough they live as wealthy people in the year 1932, according to the terms of Horatio's will they won't inherit anything for almost ten years. Lily and Robert come up with an idea to provide some income by hosting a weekend of paying guests and a celebrity who will entertain all. The assortment of people who gather for their weekend, though, have links to one another from previous days and suddenly there's been a murder and it seems as though almost everyone has a motive.This book was very charming and evoked an era and style which is now forever gone. And Ms. Churchill also includes just enough historical information about the times to further set the mood. Unfortunately, I gulped down this book much too quickly and now I'm wondering how long I will have to wait for the next book from this author."},{"Title":"In the Still of the Night (Grace & Favor Mystery Series #2)","review":"Another great story about Lily &amp; Robert Brewster, who are inhabiting the Grace &amp; Favor Cottage in order to inherit their uncles fortune. When they invite paying guests to stay for a weekend to mingle with a famous writer, one is murdered, and they learn plenty about their guests and their pasts. I truly enjoy Jill Churchills Jane Jeffrey series, and this new series is turning out just as good!"},{"Title":"In the Still of the Night (Grace & Favor Mystery Series #2)","review":"For Robert and Lily Brewster, the planned gathering at Grace and Favor Cottage held the possibility of a living. For the guests, both honored and paying, it turned into something gelse entirely. Lily's hopes for the literary gathering featuring author, Julian West, are thwarted when one of their guests turns up dead and the much-valued manuscript of another disappears. When it appeals the two incidents might be linked, the brother and sister duo find themselves on the hunt for another killer in order to preserve their aspirations for their inherited cottage.Jill Churchill displays a stunning ability to integrate the history of the 1930's with the fiction she writes. This is perhaps the story's greatest recommendation. The mystery itself is thin and while suspenseful, it also becomes somewhat predictable. What the mystery has to recommend itself are the strongly drawn characters with interesting quirks of credible motives. I did enjoy Lily's guests, but perhaps the most entertaining of them all was Robert's \\"idiot\\", Mad Henry, whose skill, or lack thereof, as an inventor, proves to be a constant source of irritation and bafflement for Lily though it ends up paying off in the end."},{"Title":"In the Still of the Night (Grace & Favor Mystery Series #2)","review":"Jill Churchill is as always a great read. I've been a fan of Ms. Churchill for years and was so thrilled that she started another series. One book a year is not enough for me. This one set in the 1930's gives it a difference that makes it very fun. You go Jill, keep those books a coming!"},{"Title":"In the Still of the Night (Grace & Favor Mystery Series #2)","review":"As a fan of Jill Churchill, I have read all of her Jane Jeffry titles. When I saw a new series, I doubted it could live up to my expectations based in the other series. I found the Grace and Favor series, if which this is the first, to be a totally fresh kind of mystery for me. The era of the Depression in a fascinating time of contrasts between the haves and have-nots. Lily and Robert are both. They seem to have inherited a line back to the good life, but making ends meet continues to be a challenge for them.The idea of a house party with paying guests was certainly a new one to me. It was written with a lot of character development necessary to the future of the series, but with here-and-now action. A great read, as well as a great send-off for a new series."},{"Title":"In the Still of the Night (Grace & Favor Mystery Series #2)","review":"Learning how to make lemonade when life hands you lemons is one of the more important lessons one can learn. A sterling example of this is in this second book of the new Grace and Favor series. The first book ANYTHING GOES introduced Lily and Robert Brewster, whose once-wealthy broker father committed suicide after the big crash of 1929, rather than face up to his greed-prompted mistakes, leaving them impoverished orphans.Their struggles to survive with something of dignity intact is greatly enhanced by the will of their great-uncle, who leaves them a huge mansion along the Hudson, and the fortune to go with it--but only after they've proved they didn't need the money on which to live for the required ten years in the run-down mansion.This charming pair of siblings blend well with the town folks of Voorburg-on-Hudson, having no more ready cash than any of the natives. However, they still have to live, so in the spring of 1932, Lily hatches the plan to convert Grace and Favor Cottage into an exclusive guest house, at which the drawing card will be a celebrity of some sort, who is offered a week-long stay in exchange for mingling with the other guests. Who pay to stay.Julian West, a best-selling author is the first of these guests, accompanied by his 'man' Bud, who idolized his hero-employer so much that he accompanied him to France, and fought beside him in WWI.Period detail is wonderfully mixed in with this assorted cast of characters, the whole reminding one immensely of the traditional English County House mystery. The puzzle is a good one (I figured out the why, but not the who) and the writing smooth. You'll enjoy your visit, and most likely, look forward to the next occasion, as well. I suspect you'll find a few old friends when you return. Hope it's soon!"},{"Title":"In the Still of the Night (Grace & Favor Mystery Series #2)","review":"I really enjoyed this second edition to the Grace and Favor Mysteries series. Lily and Robert are fun and smart characters. There was also good character develpement with the supporting characters. Chuchill gives a vivid picture of Depression era New York. Most importantly the mystery is very captivating."},{"Title":"In the Still of the Night (Grace & Favor Mystery Series #2)","review":"After inhaling the contemporary Jane Jeffrey series, it is refreshing to enter the historical period of the Great Depression in the vicinity of the Roosevelt's of Hyde Park. The luxuries on a budget managed by the brother and sister Brewster duo smack of favorite Christie mysteries set in a similar time in Great Britain. Lily and Robert accept their challenge to fulfill their Uncle Horatio's will and seek paying guests to their inherited domain. Their cleverness in luring a popular author of the times, fictional Julian West and his man Bud Carpenter, draws a nice mix of eccentric paying customers.Of course, their best laid plans result in an unplanned murder and the who-done-it is on in the most suspenseful of fashions. An inveterate mystery reader may well figure things out ahead of the end, but it seems that Churchill excells in making the reader wait to unravel the answers.There are poignant moments in the interaction of characters, and Churchill lets the reader into the background connections of the characters just enough to develop them as well-rounded and believable. The desires, jealousies, deceits, and manipulations the characters employ draw the reader in until the end.Historical data, i. e. the kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby, Hoover's misbegotten administration, Governor Franklin Roosevelt's presumed candidacy for President, the poverty of out-of-work, homeless, depression era people, puts everything into perspective. Churchill has done her homework. Even the menus prepared by Mrs. Prinney entice the reader with the details of Dutch cooking appropriate to the historical settlement of the Hudson River Valley. Churchill's descriptions are so good that one wishes to get a real taste of the Prinney cuisine.One can only guess what the next books in the series will bring for Lily and Robert Brewster as they fulfill the ten year trial demanded by their deceased uncle's attorney, Mr. Prinney. There already appears to be possible romance for Lily with either the new town sheriff or the new town newspaper editor. And Phoebe Twinkle, Grace and Favor's new lodger has her own prospects to consider, in addition to maintaining her millinary business in Voorburg-on-the-Hudson. Robert may be in for a settling down as well as he acclimates to this quieter lifestyle in coming books. Anticipating where Churchill will lead the reader in further Brewster sleuthing makes one anxious to read her next volume."},{"Title":"In the Still of the Night (Grace & Favor Mystery Series #2)","review":"Jill Churchill only gets better with the second book of her \\"Grace and Favor\\" mystery series. \\"In the Still of the Night\\" adds a little more mystery to the plot and a few additional characters as well.\\"In the Still of the Night\\" continues the saga where Lily and her brother, Robert Brewster are contemplating various ways to add to their income. Their relative's will stipulates that they must earn their living expenses (minus the upkeep of the house, etc.) for 10 years - before inheriting the estate.Hesitantly, they embark on the venture to invite a famous novelist for the weekend and invite various wealthy friends as paying guests. They know many who will pay for the priviledge of spending the weekend at the manor in his company. A murder takes place and in order to earn any type of profit at all - they must solve the mystery. (As well as knowing that one amongst them is a murderer.)I especially enjoyed how the plot and characters were so believable. Also, Churchill does a wonderful job of incorporating various historical facts of the time into the story. It is interesting to read that Phoebe makes hats for Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt whose husband is the governor in a nearby city! When Lily invites Phoebe as a boarder to their mansion, Churchill gives a very sound reasoning for Phoebe's decision. This type of detail makes the characters very multi-faceted with a great deal of depth.Excellent book; wonderful series!"},{"Title":"So Near So Far (The Richard Delancey Novels)","review":"_So Near, So Far_ is the weakest of the Delancey novels. None of the series are particularly strong on supporting characters and general characterization, and this one does even less. But where it really breaks down is in the plotting.The story is made up of several distinct and disjoint episodes, which sometimes works in adventure stories, but usually there is a connecting thread or series of lessons that builds to the finish. Not here -- a chapter ends and that's it, except fot an occasional reference to prior events thrown in for forms sake.An example: A steam driven ship and its inventor are introduced, built up, and brought back a chapter or so later. At this point -- in the course of a single page -- it is sent on a mission, damaged and sunk. (It had me thinking of the Mark Twain story where, repeatedly, inconvenient characters wander out into the yard, fall down the well, and drown.)There are also several odd shifts in tense or point of view. It's a bit odd to suddenly find two sentences written as if from looking back over Delancey's entire career slotted into the middle of a page of present tense narration.One of my favorite parts of books of this type are the supporting characters -- Forester's Brown and Bush, Kent's Herrick and Allday, etc. The only distinctly drawn character here is a spy -- and he is distinguished by being mysterious.I'm a fool for this kind of story -- have read the Forester/Hornblower (multiple times), Kent/Bolitho, Parkinson/Delancey series in their entirety, all but one of the Maynard/Lamb tales, and have five of the Pope/Ramages.The Parkinson stories are noticeably weaker than any of the other series, and _So Near, So Far_ (which was very hard to find -- many thanks McBooks for the new edition!) was a major disappointment."},{"Title":"So Near So Far (The Richard Delancey Novels)","review":"The Delancey novels appear to have been written out of order. Dead Reckoning, the last novel in the series, has a copyright date that indicates it was written two years before the present novel. The present novel fills in details of Delancey's career during and immediately after the Peace of Amiens. It explains his marriage to Fiona, and his promotion to Captain. It is not great literature, but I don't think it merits the one star given by a previous reviewer (there are ratings between one and five - I reserve one star for really awful books).While I would not recommend the novel as a stand alone novel, it is an essential part of Delancey's career if you are a Delancey fan. The main problem seems to be that the author got carried away showing off his historical knowledge, and included a bit too much detail when you wanted to get on with the action. It does have a plot, largely related to Napoleon's plan to invade England, once Delancey goes back on active duty. It involves action on shore, secret agents, etc.It does get into the English political system, covers patronage and influence, and raises the interisting question as to whether it would be good or bad if the Prime Minister was killed, i.e., would the war progress better with someone else in charge.Patrick O'Brien wrote a similar novel, \\"Post Captain,\\" in the Aubrey series, covering the same time period, but with better writing. Dudley Pope wrote a similar novel, \\"Ramage & the Guillotine,\\" putting Ramage ashore gaining information about a French invasion fleet. You have to check copyright dates to determine who was borrowing ideas from whom."},{"Title":"So Near So Far (The Richard Delancey Novels)","review":"C.S Forester is the standard for all others. Alexander Kent, Julian Stockwin, C. Northcote Parkinson, Dewey Lamdin, and Dudley Pope are all excellent authors, but Forester set the stage for them to follow.But, to that point, the Delancey series is a most excellent read!"},{"Title":"At Home in Thrush Green","review":"Miss Read's books are as comforting as cup of hot tea on a cold day. The world of Thrush Green is endearing but not so perfect that it is uninteresting. It is inhabited by characters that are by turn charming,wise,eccentric and down-right irritating! The stories, set in a fictional town in modern England, portray a pace of life that is appealing to those of us who live in the busy, disconnected world of 21st century America and while they are somewhat idealized, the real world is allowed to intrude and the characters must deal with some of the same situations we face in our own lives....aging relatives, loss and disappointment. Yet the book always leaves you with the feeling that life is good. If you like Jan Karon or Jane Austen, you will love Miss Read."},{"Title":"At Home in Thrush Green","review":"Complete your set of Miss Read's books.

A story that gives that warm, curl up in an easy chair and treat yourself to a real treat experience."},{"Title":"At Home in Thrush Green","review":"Though he fondly remembers the poorly designed Victorian vicarage that was reduced to cinders recently, leaving him and his wife homeless, Charles Henstock, the rector of Thrush Green is pleased to observe the completion of the new senior residences that have taken its place. The charming little cottages are perfect for the older residents of the area who can no longer care for themselves. Applicants for the limited space are numerous, however, and it is with some anxiety that Charles and the other members of the board sit down to choose the first inhabitants of the homes. After much deliberation, their choice is made and the community eagerly watches to see if the new inhabitants will be pleased with their homes and will live peaceably together. Meanwhile, other concerns arise in each of the village homes. Friendships are tested by arguments and misunderstanding, sickness plagues many households and new relationships and business partnerships are formed, to the delight of many. Though the mood of the village seems bleak at many times, the sunshine returns and harmony once again reigns at the close of the book.Peopled by charming, very human characters who find themselves in some interesting predicaments, this installment of the Thrush Green series is, like its predecessors, a sweet and cozy read. Simple but filled with wisdom, it's perfect for a day when you need to be reminded of all that is good in this world, despite the trials that we all face, whether we live in the big city or a quaint little English village."},{"Title":"Unemployment benefit exhaustion hits record level in July","review":"To be honest with the public, this was not one of my favorite books.

After reading this book, I feel an incredible empathy for them now. The book was raw enough to feel that you were there, and real enought to KNOW that you were there.

He explores the thoughts and feelings of the people Jesus met and influenced, and the awe that they must have felt in His presence.

That man has already admitted to the murder, but there are loose strands everywere, and this is just the first 30 pages!!! Readers of Harry Stephen Keeler are never surprised to hear this kind of plot layout, and from what I have heard, this one is one of his lesser novels. But this is a wild ride, and a fun mystery supense novel from the 1940's nevertheless. Keeler's books are hard to find, but your local library may be able to get them for you if you are interested. There is also a great site on the Web devoted to him called The Harry Stephen Keeler homepage.http://home.williampoundstone.net/Keeler/"},{"Title":"The sharkskin book,: A mystery novel","review":"This novel, from 1940, and one of Keeler's \\"Way Out\\" series [that is, featuring a collection of Oriental Wisdom called \\"The Way Out\\"] perhaps has the most astonishing plot twist in all of Keeler's roughly 80 novels. And one plot is of course not enough for Keeler, he has something like three running in rough parallel. The main plot involves Ogden Farlow, who's been arrested by Chicago police on suspicion of murdering his friend Peter Van Dervelpen. He's being mercilessly grilled, and is just on the verge of getting the infamous \\"third degree,\\" from which few ever recover. Meanwhile Indian Joe Long Buffalo is entering the world of Chicago gangsters on a desperate and dangerous... and presumably impossible... mission. Meanwhile Dr. Byxbee Adair has been kidnapped by other Chicago gangsters, who want revenge because they think Adair turned a key member of the gang in to police custody when the member came to Adair for treatment of a gunshot wound. These stories are actually completely unconnected, and perhaps have been adapted and expanded from earlier short stories by Keeler. All three of our heroes face absolutely impossible odds, and all three plot lines are wrapped up by incredible twists and convolutions which set all possible reader assumptions, guesses and expectations right on their ear!I enjoyed it all the way through, and if you like HSK, you're almost certain to like this one."},{"Title":"One Church, Four Generations: Understanding and Reaching All Ages in Your Church","review":"I recently completed a reading critique of Gary L. McIntosh's One Church, Four Generations. Here are a few of my observations:1. The author's main purpose in writing this book was to equip church leadership to \\"understand the challenges of synthesizing the generations under one ministry\\" (McIntosh, 14). Cross-cultural communication demands that one first gain a healthier viewpoint concerning the Builders, Boomers, Busters, and Bridgers within the local church and the surrounding community (14). His hope is that the church \\"will cause [God's] name to be remembered in all generations\\" (Psalm 45:17, ESV).2. The author's instruction on the different responses to cross-generational ministry was helpful. Demographics bring success with target audiences but lack variety in practice (McIntosh, 211). Multi-venues bring various elements or locations but might develop inconsistent visions (212). Newly planted churches relate to new groups but cause congregations to grow further apart. Blended services model cooperation but also can appear to be disjointed at best or cause power struggles at their worst (214).Another item of instruction that was appreciated was the teaching on recognizing that each generation can bring and receive value to the whole. The Bible counsels the young to listen to the wisdom of the elders. Likewise, elders \\"should focus on scriptural values, such as honesty, overcoming temptations, wise use of the tongue and putting God first\\" (McIntosh, 232). Every generation is to be committed to loving each other, offering others the first choice out of respect, sharing the same overarching vision, not being arrogant in opinion, and being united (McIntosh, 233).3. The most helpful part of the book was the contrast of generational values. Generally speaking, Builders are seeking stability, Boomers are striving for quality, Busters are looking for simplicity, and Bridgers need community (McIntosh, 95). Leadership has to reconcile the one's need for tradition with others' propensity for change. One is calling for alternatives while another is searching for uncomplicated processes (97).4. The quotation that seemed particularly important was the one which read, \\"Generations change and Scripture records that it normally takes new leadership to communicate to new generations\\" (McIntosh, 21). There are several repercussions to cross-generational miscommunication. Attendance in local churches continues to dwindle. The gospel must be presented in the language that is understandable. Missionary recruitment is also decreasing. Financial support of Christ's mission is suffering (McIntosh, 22). A culture of consumers has to be transformed into givers. The emerging generations are embracing the secular over the sacred - politically, academically, and financially. Finally, people are being left disconnected from Christ. Leadership must honor the past while simultaneously envisioning the future."},{"Title":"One Church, Four Generations: Understanding and Reaching All Ages in Your Church","review":"I led a discussion group where this book was the primary source, but not the only source, for understanding the viewpoints held by the generational groupings within our church.

McIntosh's book is well documented and detailed related to the four generations currently overlapping in the United States. While written for the church environment, if one reads it from a leadership perspective, there is much to gain in terms of developing programming, advertising, and considering what drives the experiences of each generation.

While I knew there were generational gaps, my categories were a simplistic, 'young and old' and the differences on the continuum between that. After reading McIntosh, I am convinced that the 4 generations he outlines in One Church, Four Generations indeed have their own distinctive culture. Each generation has a shared social experience unique to their own experiences while growing up whether that be WWII, the civil rights movement, or the war on terrorism.Coming at this book with a missiological background has proven helpful to me in applying lessons from this book. Ministry to another culture has now been deepened by my realization in reading this book that differences between the various age groups are large enough to make each a distinct sub-culture of its own. With the collapse of the extended family, and the weakening of the nuclear family due to globalization and the Industrial Revolution, generation-specific ministry niches may be our best hope for a church that represents all four generations. I'd argue for that being the initial thrust, followed by attempts to incorporate inter-generational ministry. The family is still the best target, as no other structure has endured so well across the generational boundaries.Some unanswered questions I now have for further research are the following: Do parallel generation groups in different countries have more in common with each other than different generation groups of their own country? Are current generations qualified to be a distinct 'people group' in the missiological sense?"},{"Title":"One Church, Four Generations: Understanding and Reaching All Ages in Your Church","review":"McIntosh provides a practical summary of generational differences and similarities for church ministry. It does have a mono-ethnic feel to the discussion and should address the multi-cultural growth of Hispanics in the US and Asians in Canada. First generation immigrants and third generation immigrants have a story all their own. The distinctions between the generations are typical of most fast moving and changing cultures and McIntosh provides wisdom in discerning their distinctions. Be cautious though of assuming (with appropriate apologies!) \\"one size fits all\\". Four out of five stars"},{"Title":"One Church, Four Generations: Understanding and Reaching All Ages in Your Church","review":"McIntosh provides an excellent comparative summary of the generations of the 20th century and bridging into the 21st. In an American social context, he describes the formative events of each generations, the characteristics that developed as a result, the common attitudes and approaches to life this led to.He then provides a basis for communicating and building intergenerational communication. McIntosh provides a survey of the religious and church concepts of each generations, including the expectations their formative life experiences created in their generation. Then he analyzes how church leadership needs to interact with members of each generations, how to understand their needs and how to enhance their spiritual growth.McIntosh does a good job of lining the practical implications for each generational and for handling the conflicts or differences in response to various educational, social and worship formats. He emphasizes the possibilities and need for inter-generational relations in the church community, as well as the society at large. Readers of this book should gain a positive appreciation for the other generation they relate to in daily life.I appreciated the time-line analysis of the worldview of each general age group. This provides a practical perspective on the manner in which the early formative events lay the foundation for a general perception of the world at large. I have referred to such dynamic events in my writings as Shared Significant Experiences.These shared experiences that are significant in forming our early shared concepts of reality result in what we call worldview. The worldview differences are at the base of what we refer to as Culture, in the cognitive level, beyond the sometimes puzzling outward expressions in lifestyle and decision-making approaches.McIntosh's analysis clarifies how narrow the walls of a world can be right alongside others who remember earlier experiences that strongly shaped their view of reality quite differently."},{"Title":"Redating Matthew, Mark and Luke: A Fresh Assault on the Synoptic Problem","review":"Wenham's work is, as noted above, thoroughly documented, researched and conducted. And I would go further than the earlier review. If you don't have a working knowledge of Greek, this will probably be too painful for you.However, I would say it rewards careful reading of the one willing to examine the issue without buying into the current dogmas of NT scholarship. I did not find him uncritically assuming his own evidence true, rather in several places I recall him saying he would not dogmatically assert either way. The point is to him much of the evidence can be used to support whatever theory one wishes to contrive. &quot;Q&quot; can be made to look reasonable to many, as can Markan priority, if we don't examine the facts behind WHY these works were written.As to counting Patristic evidence, one could say NT scholarship today dogmatically REJECTS Patristic evidence whenever it doesn't fit their hypothesis. Who's to say that scholars sitting in their offices 2000 years removed automatically have a better concept of the events than 2nd &amp; 3rd century scholars? Am I attacking all NT scholarship? No. But I think it is fair to give the author a reasonable hearing. And I think, after a reasonable hearing, it is not unreasonable to see at least Matthew and Mark written before AD55, and see some measure of MUTUAL dependance between the Gospels.Neither of these would be fashionable in many NT circles today. But that doesn't mean they are not real possiblities."},{"Title":"Redating Matthew, Mark and Luke: A Fresh Assault on the Synoptic Problem","review":"Wenham has done a remarkable job of examining the external evidence (the words of the fathers) and the internal evidence (the Gospels themselves) to demonstrate not only the plausability, but the probability of:1. An early date for the Gospels.2. The traditional order of Mt, Mk, Lk.3. The involvement of not only written but oral tradition in Gospel formation.Critics charge Wenham with relying too heavily on patristic sources. But such charge thus if one relies on the patristics at all in this matter. The critics of the Augustinian order have never satisfactorily explained the origin of the traditional order if a different order is true. In any case, Wenham does solid work in establishing the essential trustworthiness of the patristic sources.He is perhaps even stronger is his examination of the interrelations between the synoptics as he works through the various synoptic theories and how they fare in terms of how they used or allegedly used each other in their mutual formation.Wenham believes strongly that oral tradition played a key role in determining the form and the content of each of the Gospels. Despite this, he eschews the idea that they were written in ignorance of each other. He argues dispassionately but forcefully that each successively impacted the ones that followed.Those who hold variant opinions of the origins of the Gospels do not hold them well until they have positively worked through Wenham's arguments.I further recommend the writings of B.C. Butler on this topic."},{"Title":"Redating Matthew, Mark and Luke: A Fresh Assault on the Synoptic Problem","review":"John Wenham's \\"Redating Matthew, Mark and Luke\\" weights in on some of the most enduring and vexing questions in literary history - the composition and dating of the synoptic Gospels.Matthew, Mark and Luke are often referred to as the synoptic Gospels in light of their strong similarity in genre, material and phraseology. Over the centuries many different theories have been formulated to account for these similarities. For instance, in the Nineteenth Century it was widely assumed that access to a common and well developed oral tradition accounted for much of this similarity. The advent of modern literary critical techniques in the Twentieth Century contributed to a shift in opinion, and, currently the majority view of New Testaments scholars support what is known as the Two-Document hypothesis, according to which Mark and Q are posited as primary sources for the authors of Luke and Matthew. Combined with other assumptions, this view results in a rough compositional chronology of Mark (70) Matthew and Luke (75-85).Wenham challenges the Two-Document hypothesis, arguing for what is known as the Augustinian view - Matthew first, followed by Mark then finally Luke. In making this claim Wenham adopts a holistic approach that combines both internal (literary critical techniques) and external (historic tradition and testimony) evidence. Once his compositional argument is complete Wenham works backwards from Acts (early-mid 60s prior to death of Paul) to posit a radically revised synoptic chronology of Luke (55), Mark (45) and Matthew (40).Whether or not his theory is ultimately correct, Wenham does valuable work identifying and challenging many of the assumptions that underlie the current New Testament scholarship and positing a credible counter argument. While the book has much strength the examination of historical testimony pertaining to Gospel authorship is particularly worthwhile and illuminating. It has often struck me that contemporary scholarship has been a bit too quick to dismiss ancient testimony in favour of modern literary techniques (as valuable as they are). A balanced view that weights internal and external evidence does indeed seem warranted.With regard to weaknesses, while overall the text is of a high standard, it is occasionally awkward (font and layout). Additionally, the relatively detailed comparison (for a popular text) of Greek texts, in the early chapters, while necessary may be a bit off-setting for some non-Greek readers. The good news is that these textual comparisons can be skimmed with little loss. And, finally, from a physical standpoint the paperback is a bit stiff - one has the sense it would not hold up well with heavy usage, i.e. as a reference text or library copy.Overall, this is a provocative, interesting and well researched work which warrants serious consideration. I highly recommend it for all students of New Testament history. Readers that enjoy this book may find J.A.T. Robinson's \\"Redating the New Testament\\" which takes a similar argument applied to the New Testament in general worth a read."},{"Title":"Redating Matthew, Mark and Luke: A Fresh Assault on the Synoptic Problem","review":"Some good and helpful reviews above. Having now read the book, I would only add:1. look at the evidence for dating Acts at c. 62; this means Luke and Mark must be earlier. See Hemer, Acts and Hellenistic History.2. read in conjunction with Bauckham on 'Jesus and his Eyewitnesses' - which, like Wenham, also places a lot of weight on ancient and patristic testimonies.Maybe in a few years' time we'll see a whole new-old paradigm in Gospel studies.

Wenham clashes with modern theories about the bible, mostly by exploring early texts and studying verbal independence among the synoptic gospels. His arguments are impressive. In particular, he insists that the synoptics were all written before 70 AD. He points out, for example, that Luke tells us of the fullfilment of Agabus' prophecy of worldwide fame (Acts 11:28). Yet Luke fails to mention the fall of Jerusalem and the destruction of the temple, which so clearly fullfilled Jesus' prophecy about the temple."},{"Title":"Redating Matthew, Mark and Luke: A Fresh Assault on the Synoptic Problem","review":"I have bee. Reading and rereading this book for o er ten years. I just bought a copy for someone else. Itis rich!Rev RichRd Cantrell, SSC"},{"Title":"Redating Matthew, Mark and Luke: A Fresh Assault on the Synoptic Problem","review":"Wenham sets out to prove that the Synoptic Gospels were written in the early to mid 40's A.D., a good 20-25 years before the earliest generally-accepted date for Mark. His analysis is thoroughgoing, well-researched, and heavily documented. Unfortunately, his defense of evidence for the early dating lacks the cogency and forcefulness of his attack on the evidence for later dating. While Wenham is vociferously dismissive of evidence contrary to his viewpoint, he uncritically accepts evidence supporting his viewpoint. He bedrocks his early dating on a two pronged analysis: 1. Dismissal of the documentary solutions to the Synoptic Problem, and 2. Heavy reliance on the Patristic evidence of authorship. Firstly, the documentary explanations of the Synoptic Problem must be dismissed because if the Gospels were based on earlier documents, they must perforce be later documents. Secondly, from acceptance of the Patristic evidence of authorship, Wenham can infer a very early date for each of the Synoptics. The book makes interesting reading, but it fails to carry the day in establishing such an early date for the Synoptic Gospels.One caveat: If you can't read Greek, the first half of the book will be rough sailing, as it analyzes many gospel pericopes in Greek. With a little patience you can, however, muddle your way through it."},{"Title":"Redating Matthew, Mark and Luke: A Fresh Assault on the Synoptic Problem","review":"This book will make you doubt everything you think you know about the dating of the synoptic gospels.

All we have to do is watch the plane ask other machinery, like a tractor and windmill, what it is. Finally, the little plane looks up and knows where it belongs when it sees a group of planes flying overhead. It then happily flies away into the sunset. Children with a love for trucks, planes and other machinery will likely adore this simple story that accommodates a toddler's short attention span.

Feynman was never quite able to tie in the oddities observed in the interaction of nuclei or gravitrons, but reality as we observe it is more or less dictated by the interaction of electrons, and this theory describes that interplay perfectly.Feyman's &quot;sum over histories&quot; explains reality even better than Newton's seemingly incontrovertable laws of Nature, which in actuality, decribe only the end result of the sum over histories. Where Newton described one reality, the one observed by all of us, Feynman described every microscopic reality, each as real as the other, and all culminating in the one macroscopic reality as described by Newton. Feynman described particles moving faster than light, and even backwards in time - all of which is explained in his &quot;strange theory of light and matter&quot;, and all of which is endlessly verifiable in the laboratory.For anyone willing to break out of the Newtonian mindset which humanity has been in for over 300 years, and which is still taught in today's high school science classrooms, this book is a must read. Treat yourself to 150 pages of plain english which will infuse you with wonder for the rest of your days."},{"Title":"Qed: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter","review":"I am studying A-Level Physics, and find this book truly inspirational.

Instead of equations, the quantum theory in this book consists entirely of pictures. But this is not a popularization in the usual sense. This is not gossip about science. This actually is quantum theory in a very simple case.

After all, the mathematical description of a concept is only one form of expression of the idea, albeit in precise terms. Feynmann's discussion of QED explains with great power the way that when one examines the action of particles in the real world, the classical deterministic description of the particle and what happens to it proves inaccurate. For instance, when a particle travels between two points, one cannot know its exact location and how it is moving. One can only describe the particle's movement in terms of probabilities. A classical description of the action of the particle would attribute a fixed path to its course. In quantum physics, one describes the probable path. There is a finite, however small, probability that at any given time in the questioned interval the particle may be found in any location in space. It's true path description allows the particle to travel by all possible paths, and the classical path is merely the one which is most probable. Feynmann explains this and related phenomena with compelling logic and power. He writings are a unique and essential explanation of modern quantum analysis. They are readily understood by non-physicist readers, requiring only a willingness to concentrate and open one's mind. This is a remarkable work."},{"Title":"Qed: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter","review":"As a 3rd year undergrad physics major at Caltech, I sometimes got lost in the forest of mathematical equations that the professors threw at me.

Yet, here Feynman admirably succeeds in distilling the essence of QED-quantum electrodynamics-, one of our most fundamental theories of nature, without using any mathematical equations. Comprehending what is presented in this book still requires a fair amount of attention and mental work on the part of the reader, but the reward is understanding something about the fundamental workings of nature that the overwhelming majority of people unfortunately don't and, even worse, are not even aware that they don't.I recommend using this book in conjunction with a set of lectures Feynman gave on this topic, and which are fortunately freely available from the Vega Science trust (Do a search for \\"Feynman Robb lectures\\" to find them).The content is about the same, but whereas the strength of the lectures is that they make the material seem more accessible (due to the brilliance of Feynman as a lecturer), the book is useful for long-term reinforcement.In my opinion, the book and lecture combination should be seriously considered for inclusion into the high school science curriculum. I think the material is not too advanced for that level, and if more people had their basic worldview shaken at that age, it would provide them with at least one profound experience that what they know (from their sensory experience) just ain't so. That, I believe, would in turn make them less vulnerable to superstitions or fundamentalist dogma like intelligent design etc."},{"Title":"Qed: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter","review":"Feynman's version of QED (which he helped develop) is the most clever and lucid way of explaining QED phenomena.

However never have I heard QED described in such an engaging and simply entertaining style. Feynman was truly one of the greatest communicators of physics this century, and he's extraordinarily funny. The lectures are aimed at people with a very rudimentary knowledge of physics and maths (they were public lectures in New Zealand after all!) and if you're willing to suspend disbelief for some of the more unusual aspects of QED it will all make sense.The biggest flaw with the videos, however, is the poor quality of the video and audio. Sometimes Feynman's mic drops out completely (dealt with humerously by Feyman of course) and the picture is rather poor. This is why I think the videos only receive four stars (while Feynman himself would receive about ten). Nevertheless, I'd put up with a lot more to see Feynman lecture on QED.

Even though Feynman is a great teacher, this is not easy stuff. If you hope to really grasp what Prof. Feynman is saying you are going to have to really think about it. I remember reading one page over and over again for an hour until I grasped one concept. But it is definitely worth it in the end.

Among them, many are of very good quality, describing sectors of science with competence and, sometimes, charm. The books by Gamow, for instance, are notable, as are those by Jeremy Bernstein. Then there are books which not only explain physics to you, but give you tools so that you can, by yourself, understand new things. These are very rare. I can think of two. Cosmology, by Harrison, allows you to derive by yourself consequences of the universe expansion by the trick of moving mirrors, a nice, simple and useful tool. But it is restricted to this rather esoteric corner of science. Then there is Feynman's QED. This is unique. By the clever trick of a clock attached to each photon and by the use of it in combination with his breakthrough idea of summing over all paths, he succeeds in extracting not only the specialized phenomena of high energy physics, but magically renews the good old optics of mirrors and refraction. Using his simple rules you can understand light &quot;like a pro&quot;, and even do your own little research projects. I published papers on quantum field theory, yet, learned quite a bit from this small and precious book."},{"Title":"Qed: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter","review":"These are the popular lectures that Dr. Richard P. Feynman gave in New Zealand in 1979. Feynman's legendary teaching ability and wit are in full force here. These lectures are meant to give a general audience a taste of the most successful theory in physics, quantum electrodynamics, or QED for short, that he developed independently of two others (Schwinger and Tomonaga), who all shared the Nobel Prize in 1965. Feynman builds up the theory using very simple ideas such as &quot;all we do is draw little arrows on a piece of paper and we get all these answers.&quot; We see how light can be reflected from the center of a mirror, but that it really reflects from all points on a mirror. How can that be, you say? Answer: watch these videos! Feynman moves from light, to electrons, to their interactions in the first three lectures. We even get to see the legendary &quot;Feynman Diagrams&quot; drawn by the master, himself! In the fourth lecture Feynman discusses the problems or difficulties with the theory (always honest, he never quite believed that the theory was completely perfect, even though it gave the right answers. In fact, he said in his Nobel Prize acceptance speech that &quot;... we might just be sweeping the difficulties under the rug.&quot;) as well as discussing some of the current (in 1979) theories such as quarks and gluons. These tapes are invaluable for the interested amatuer who wants to learn the basics of the theory which describes all of everyday experience except for gravity, or for the physics student to find out what it is that you are really calculating with those messy equations, and how it really goes."},{"Title":"Qed: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter","review":"Richard Feynman, along with Schwinger and Tomonaga, won Nobel prizes in the 1960's for their development of quantum electrodynamics (QED). In this book, Feynman attempts to bring this esoteric field down to the layman's level and succeeds as usual. The chapters in the book are taken from lectures he presented to a largely nonscientific audience, but the material is not dumbed down. Of course, many of the details are left out since only years of study can provide a true understanding of the theory, but Feynman presents his lectures in such a way that only a reasonable amount of thought is needed to appreciate the basics of QED.\\"The Strange Theory of Light and Matter\\" is an entirely appropriate subtitle to a book that attempts to explain the theory behind phenomena that escape our everyday experience and intuition. QED is arguably the most successful scientific theory in existence. Its predictions have correlated extraordinarily well with experiment although \\"prediction\\" in the QED sense is not what we are generally used to. The quantum world is inherently probabilistic. There are certain things we just cannot \\"know.\\" We cannot predict which photons will reflect of a glass surface, but with QED, we can at least accurately calculate the percentage of photons that do reflect. That's just one of the results of QED that Feynman attempts to explain, and he does so in a very straightforward fashion.Feynman never insults the intelligence of his audience by pretending that the basics of QED are beyond its grasp, but instead repeatedly insists that no one really understands QED, but that should not prevent anyone from appreciating some of its results. With this attitude, Feynman explains the basics of partial reflection, particle interactions, and the discoveries of new particles, and he does all this through numerous figures and analogies rather than mathematical equations.Richard Feynman was not your ordinary physicist. He was a physicist's physicist and a great teacher (read James Gleick's bio of Feynman called Genius). His teaching abilities are in full display in this book as he is able to bring an incredibly strange theory down to the average reader's level. I highly recommend this book. It will tax your thinking abilities but will never insult them."},{"Title":"Qed: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter","review":"This is great book. It's rather startling, however, to see (further down the line) someone recommend this and David Deutsch's &quot;The Fabric of Reality&quot; in the same breath.

(See especially the last chapters of &quot;The Character of Physical Law&quot;, &quot;Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman&quot;, and \\"What Do You Care What Other People Think?\\".)

Well, some people are capable of appreciating Richard Feynman, at least."},{"Title":"Qed: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter","review":"In introductory physics courses, whether in high school or college, one tends to be exposed to some of the rudiments of electromagnetism. Often it seems overly complex or badly organized: while all of classical electromagnetism can be put under the header of Maxwell's equations, the student learns that there are separate equations for resistance, capacitance, magnetic and electric fields in matter as opposed to vacuum, moving electric fields and static, and what is all this business about fields, anyway? The student is told of a world where electrons do indeed collide, the speed of light can slow in some media, and electric and magnetic fields are two different things.In QED (quantum electrodynamics, a theory that was proposed independently by Feynman, Schwinger, and Tomanga, and which earned the Nobel Prize for all three in 1965) none of these mysteries exist. &quot;Fields&quot; don't act differently in matter, and electrons *don't* collide. The speed of light does not slow, and magnetic and electric fields are two aspects of the same relativistic effect (this is known generally to students above the freshman level, but unfortunately is either skimmed over or is untouched by an introductory course). How is all this made possible? Why, by simply understanding what electromagnetism really is, on the most fundamental level: the interactions between electrons, mediated by photons they pass between one another, emit or absorb, or pass back and forth between themselves and the nucleus. Indeed, all of electromagnetism can be generalized to tiny particles emitting and absorbing packets of light --- and this simplicity of thought, this generalization, is what led many people back then and now (including myself) to consider Richard Feynman one of the greatest minds physics has ever known.This book is better if one has taken an introductory physics course in high school or elsewhere, but it is not necessary to have any prior physics or higher level math background. One just needs to have a good imagination to picture interactions on such a tiny and observationally unknowable scale."},{"Title":"Qed: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter","review":"This is the best book for the layman on the difficult subject of quantum mechanics. I've read much more technical works on the subject, but none of them can match Feynman's clear and concise explanations of the fascinating and paradoxical world of quantum mechanics. Feynman had a gift for explaining difficult physics concepts to the non-physicist, and this book is perhaps the best example of his ability to do this. Using primarily spatial concepts, visualizations, and diagrams rather than advanced math, Feynman clearly illustrates and explains many of the fundamental aspects of QED in a way that the non-specialist can grasp. A true classic in the field, and one that hasn't been equalled since in its clear and concise treatment of the subject. All in all, a great book from both a great physicist and great teacher."},{"Title":"Qed: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter","review":"This book is basically a transcript of a series of lectures Professor Feynman gave at UCLA and in New Zealand. The lectures were given at the University of Auckland in New Zealand because Feynman wanted to \\"try out\\" the lectures on people far from home to see if they would work. [...] The book QED attempts successfully to give the reader an idea of how light works at a fundamental level and is actually very weird and untuitive due to our inherited and evolved senses and perception. Feynman preps the reader to anticipate these very strange unintuitive scientific findings and goes on to explain them very well."},{"Title":"Qed: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter","review":"What differentiates Feynman from other eminent physicists of the 20th Century is his uncanny ability to communicate abstract and complicated theories of physics into totally comprehensible lamens terms. For example, in QED, he explains the movement of electrons without actually discussing vector analysis. He simplifies the calculus of quantum electrodynamics by using arrow diagrams and describes the path of electrons almost in a narrative style. The hardest thing in writing is simplicity; for Feynman, who deals with the complexities of life in their most minute detail, such simplicity is poetry to the curious mind."},{"Title":"Qed: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter","review":"QED(Quantum Electro Dynamics) is a very difficult theory even for physicists.

Now, if you're ignorant of physics, you're probably still thinking, \\"That says a whole lot. What is it?\\" By this rather formidable name, you might not be able to tell if you want to read the book or not, so I'll synopsize. Over three quarters (75%, if you prefer--ooh, I can do math!) of this book explains movements and interactions of electrons and photons expressed as probabilities. The last section discusses a variation of QED, quantum chromodynamics (i.e. quarks). Unlike some abstruse conjectures (most notably, string theory), quantum electrodynamics can be and has been experimentally verified. In fact, it is the most accurate theory ever devised! This does not mean that QED is totally compliant with common sense (fortunately; physics addicts often find common sense to be rather dull--and incorrect!). The reader learns to accept that light does not always travel in straight paths, that light reflects from all parts of a mirror, and that electrons can travel backward in time. Richard Feynman, who (along with Sin-Itiro Tomonaga and Julian Schwinger) was awarded the 1965 Nobel Prize for his work on this theory, elucidates QED so that even those who have never before studied physics can understand it. (To be more accurate, they can understand *how* QED works; Feynman admits that no one, himself included, truly understands *why* QED works.) If you already are familiar with the theory, you are likely to become bored with this book. On the other hand, I'm not sure that this book is the best for physics neophytes, since it is specific in explaining this one given area (even skipping the historical background present in most popular accounts of physics). You might want to first obtain more general knowledge of modern physics. If you find optics interesting, definitely read this book.

However, I found it frustrating that he assumes there is no way to provide a sensible theory of physical reality when there is actually a simple solution to the problems of particle wave duality that are far better explained with the Wave Structure of Matter (WSM). i.e. Standing wave interactions only occur at discrete frequencies which explain the discrete 'particle' properties of both light and matter. For more information search Milo Wolff or Geoff Haselhurst."},{"Title":"Qed: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter","review":"In the Introduction to the 'Strange Theory of Light and Matter' Feynman tells us that what he likes to talk about is the \\"part of physics that is known, rather than a part that is unknown.\\" And he goes on to give us a thumbnail sketch, a \\"physicist's history of physics,\\" which shows how physicist's, in their quest to describe the world, continually reduce a group of seemingly unrelated phenomenon to a single phenomenon. So heat and sound were found, thanks to Newton, to be reducible to laws of motion, while electricity, magnetism and light were reducible to Maxwell's electromagnetic wave. In this way physicist's explain the world.Here one is almost tempted to say that they proceed much as religion and ideology do. Religion has from the beginning of recorded history been taking phenomenon and feelings, like storms and suffering or aging and despair, and molding them into an internally coherent explanation of all that is and was and will be. They do this by separating the relevant from the incidental, then uncovering the essential by excluding the accidental. They simplify. In similar ways ideologues like the communists take what at one time were discreet incidents and disparate facts (for instance, the poverty of the third world and imperialism) and weave them into a grand general explanation. Is science merely the latest avatar of religion? - Or perhaps it is an ideology without tears?Not so fast! Feynman goes on to show us that attempts to explain the atomic world foundered on the laws of motion. He shows us that the rescue of those shipwrecked on the shoals of classical theory involved the invention of a new, counter-intuitive theory, Quantum Mechanics. He then goes on, while discussing a small portion of that theory, to give us the (deliberately) hilarious and 'absurd' example of how physicists predict how many photons, out of a given number, will be reflected back from a surface. 'Draw little arrows on a piece of paper' and watch the clock, he tells us. And with no explanation as to why this procedure works! Of course, for physics, what matters is that it does work. Physicists have been forced \\"away from making absolute predictions to merely calculating the probability of an event.\\" But where is the essential, the eternal, the necessary?Perhaps this is what Feynman is driving at. Science describes, it doesn't explain why. We should all wonder at that. The great 'philosophical' questions that drive theology and political ideology are beyond the purview of physics. Science doesn't create worlds; nor does it 'interpret' or change them, it simply describes what it finds. (It is technology that changes the world.) Freud saw fit to end one of his books by saying that 'our science is no illusion, but it would be an illusion to believe you can find elsewhere what it does not offer.' But how much truer this is of physics! One is then perhaps not surprised to come away from this little book wondering exactly what the status of philosophy, psychoanalysis, politics and religion would be in a genuinely scientific world.But of course there will never be, given human irrationality, an entirely scientific human culture. This book is a superb introduction to quantum electrodynamics. It's 'experimentalism' and agnosticism towards grand philosophical explanations I found very congenial and convincing. Feynman is an engaging personality and this is an entertaining book. While one doesn't need a degree in physics and math to understand him a lay competence and interest in math and physics is certainly necessary. For those of us still living in a Newtonian world, a dwindling number to be sure, this book will have several surprising moments. But that really is part of the show!"},{"Title":"Qed: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter","review":"This book will absolutely blow you away! If you're an armchair physicist and you thought you understood the universe, prepare to be blown away! The physical universe is NOTHING like you've ever imagined.

And the strangest part of all, is this branch of physics has stood up to scrutiny more than any other idea in the history of science! It's just plain freaky, but real!The only reason I don't give this book 5 stars is because the author committed a massive science flaw: He said, \\"There are no gears or pullies inside these things. Don't even look for them.\\" Imagine that! A scientist telling you to do no more research for further answers! That cost him a full star in my review.Put this book on the top 10 reading list of all time!When you're done, search for information about faster than light transmission, quantum entanglement, and the real science of teleportation.Also, required reading: Alber Einstein's \\"Relativity, the Special and the General Theory\\" (or is it the General and the Special Theory?). You can't read one without the other. In my opinion, they make a complete set."},{"Title":"Qed: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter","review":"First of all there are two books authered by Feynman on this subject ...QED and Quantum Electrodynamics. I have studied only QED.My recomendation is that every new and curious mind should read it once.This is an excellent book to know and understand what QED is, what it deals with and how it deals with. But it is very disappointing in the sense that its very lean and thin. This entire book desrves to be an indispenseable first chapter of a bigger book. This books ditches you at the very momment when you have understand the basics and you want to know more ..... you want to know actually how calculations are done ...your mind starts questioning and Feynman becomes quite ...... too teasing !!!!I would like to humbly comment, in general, about the Feynman's books. I feel there are two faces of science which attracts and fascinates bergeoning minds. First is that its ability to pridict ...... even after senselessly lenghthy looking mathematics one finds that still nature behaves the way science predicts. Second is the ELEGANCE that science, as distinct from other subjects, has. How beautifully science maintains the consistency ...... how beautifully it has been formulated ..... how severe are small assumptions ...... and how carefully each small assumption is mentioned in the formulations ...!!! This second phase is where Feynman lacks. Feynman's books failed to impress the new minds with the BRILIANT mathematical ELEGANCE of science !!! He fails to bring out the GRACE of CONSISTENCY !! The lengthy circular line integrals and surface integrals of electrodynamics, the elegant linear algebra quantum theory, the variations in Hamiltonian formultaions .......all these have an intrinsic beauty which Feynman fails to bring forth to new entrants into the field of science.There is a satge in one's educational growth till which one likes to understand how the nature behaves ....how science enables one to predict nature .....I mean things of general curiosity. But finally a stage comes when you want to study science with all its ELEGANCE. There is a stage when you want to admire the beautifull science ..... elegantly decorated and precisely dressed with mind boggling mathematics.Hence, all new comers should definately read QED of Feynman's Lecture .....but togather with that they should also read some formal treatment of science like those by Landau or Sakurai to admire the science with its true colors."},{"Title":"Qed: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter","review":"I have just looked at this, but It sure is a feynman original.Buy it if you have that kinda cash for this.

It conveys Feynman's unique combination of earnest enthusiasm and elfish delight at the fact that &quot;the way we have to describe Nature is generally incomprehensible to us.&quot; (p. 77) It is probably true that the book can be profitably read by every class of reader, from Feynman's physicist peers to street people (if this is not the contemporary equivalent of &quot;the man in the street,&quot; why isn't it??) who have never studied physics. Feynman was a great communicator, and knew how to throw out a lifeline of wit, reason, or good sense in the midst of the most bewildering complexities. Twenty-first century humanity urgently needs to integrate something of the quantum view of reality into its common understanding of things, and Feynman's work is a precious contribution toward that end.

This is due in part because our universe is so amazing and in part because I feel that what we learn from the natural world tells us many fundamental things about ourselves. My husband is a physicist. When I first met him a whole new world of thought was opened up to me. QED was the first place he sent me to begin my journey into the conceptual study of Quantum Electrodynamics.The author of this little book, the late Richard Feynman, was a Nobel Prize laureate in physics in 1965. He was a member of the team that developed the atom bomb and served on the panel that investigated the space shuttle Challenger disaster. Although one of the world's most brilliant physicists, he was also awell loved professor at Caltech. Neil Bohr would seek him out often because of his unassuming nature and ability to play devil's advocate with any scientific mind of the time. His immersion in the topics of mathematics and physics gave him the clarity in his teaching that could speak to the un-initiated. This book is an edited version of his presentation for the Alix G. Mautner Memorial Lecture series given at UCLA.So, what is so terribly amazing about this particular book? Well, with little or no mathematics and diagrams that walk you through each and every step, Feynman takes you into the world of quantum mechanics where nothing happens as we expect. Time travels whatever way it chooses, particles can be here and there at the same time, or nowhere at all. As a teacher, Feynman does not talk down to his audience, nor develop not-quite-right metaphors to lead the blind. The presentation is straight forward and just as applicable to the adventuresome layperson as it is to a physics major. A delightful way to get introduced to some of the aspects of the strange and wonderful universe we call home."},{"Title":"Qed: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter","review":"RE: \\"QED the strange theory of light and matter\\" by Richard P. Feynman, with an introduction by A. Zee : 2006 editionI found the approach unique and captivating. It was different compared to what you would find in a physics book. Like most books of this kind, I think you need a physics background or you have to be very smart to get much from this book. But, it is worth a try. I reread parts of the book for nearly a month because it was so interesting to me.On page 101, he says that \\"light is really not affected by surfaces\\", when he is explaining how reflection is really absorption and re-emission of photons by electrons within the glass. When reading this, I thought that a highly polished glass surface would probably reflect more light than a rough surface, yet it would seem that in the polished glass, molecules are not different than in the rough glass. So, how do you explain the increased reflectivity when the interior of the glass is the same and only the surface is smoother? I wish he had said more about that.In the last chapter, when he described fundamental forces as being associated with the exchange of particles, such as photons and gluons, he did not give the reader any intuitive understanding of that idea, which was a dissapointment to me.I highly recommend this book to anyone with a physics background and to anyone who wonders about this stuff."},{"Title":"Qed: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter","review":"Feynman is the best author in the field of physics.

This theory explains a few things about how light and electrons interact. These interactions can be used to understand better how things in nature occur. The only problem is that this theory is very hard to understand if, indeed, anyone can understand it. The problems starts with asking why, when you shine a monochromatic light at a surface of glass, does some of the light reflect and some go through the glass? The strangeness of it starts to come into the picture when you get different results depending on how thick the piece of glass is. How does the photon decide when it comes to the surface of the glass if it wants to reflect or go through? This professor attempts to answer these sorts of questions and does it in a very entertaining way. You feel as if you are attending a class at college. You also feel like this is one of those professors that one finds entertaining and informative. By the end of the book if you don't understanding everything, at least you have come a little closer to knowing what questions to ask. Another light book I really enjoyed wasThe Speed of Light: Constancy and Cosmos."},{"Title":"Qed: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter","review":"This book thoroughly explains the fundamental principles of light wave propagation through various mediums. Though the ideas presented utilizes particle nature of light, the explanation can be applied for wave model of light as well.

But 'enigma&quot; equally applies to this book, QED. Why is it so popular? Four lectures on quantum electrodynamics? Why would anyone, other than a physicist, rave about such a book?Feynman cautions the audience that they may not understand what he will be saying. Not because of technical difficulty, but because they may be unable to believe it, unable to accept what he is saying. &quot;The theory of quantum electrodynamics describes Nature as absurd from the point of view of common sense. And it fully agrees with experiment. So I hope you can accept Nature as She is - absurd.&quot;I long had this problem. I wanted to understand why, in addition to how nature works. I wanted some philosophical understanding, some underlying meaning. I have come to accept that the fundamental laws (rules, behavior, whatever) of physics are not intuitive, but are incomprehensible in terms of common sense.To appreciate Feynman's QED lectures, you must have patience, some commitment (its not really difficult), but more than anything else you need a willingness to set aside disbelief and simply listen to a physicist talk about quantum electrodynamics. A willingness to accept that nature refuses to be understood. Analyzed, dissected, mathematically described (in a probabilistic sense), but not fundamentally understood. QED.I am largely unsatisfied by books for laymen on quantum physics, string theory, cosmology, and the like. My background includes some physics and I find that a bit of mathematics is more helpful than a great many analogies, no matter how cleverly constructed. QED should have been disappointing. But I gave it five stars.Feynman did not rely on analogies. He talks physics and experiments. Feynman had a wonderful clarity of thought, an ability to explain advanced physics, and all with a sense of humor. No math symbols, no complex numbers, no matrices, no wave mechanics, no advanced probability analysis - just simple addition of little arrows that shrink and turn.Feynman was unpredictable. He saw the world in unexpected ways. In a footnote he mentions that Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is really no longer a necessary construct. &quot;If you can get rid of all the old-fashioned ideas and instead use the ideas that I am explaining in these lectures - adding arrows for all the ways an event can happen - there is no need for an uncertainty principle.&quot; Heisenberg relegated to a footnote!The casual reader may find some short sections a bit strenuous, particularly some of the more involved manipulations of arrows, but stay with it. As Feynman points out in the preface, these lectures represent physics accurately without distortions for simplicity. Nothing would need to be unlearned if you later majored in physics. Think about it. QED may lead you down a path heretofore not taken."},{"Title":"Qed: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter","review":"A book on physics that is entertaining? Hard to believe, but during the reading of this book I not only got a grasp on some of the fundamental concepts of Quantum Electro Dynamics, but thoroughly enjoyed the way it was explained. Feynman is a master teacher. He has the ability to take complex concepts and boil them down so that even a physics dummy can understand them. It is obvious when reading the text how complete Feynman's understanding of the material is. You know how you can read a science book and not really get what the author is trying to explain? Sometimes that comes from your own lack of intelligence, but a lot of times it's because the author wasn't totally clear about what he was writing. In this book, you really get the underlying concepts becasue Feynman's understanding of the subject is so complete. I found myself absorbing some of the QED concepts almost by osmosis.The book is composed of 4 lectures Feynman gave at UCLA in the mid 80's.QED is about the interaction of light and matter. Feynman starts the explanation of QED by dealing with the partial reflection of light onto 2 surfaces of glass, and uses arrow diagrams to make the explanation easy to understand.He uses the arrow diagrams in the other lectures which continue the discussion of QED's attempt to explain the interaction of photons with matter. The last lecture deals with subatomic particles and QED's relationship to the rest of physics.The part of the book I enjoyed most was the 3rd lecture called &quot;Electrons and Their Interactions&quot; which explains how electrons go from point to point in space/time. He gets into the famous &quot;Feynman Diagrams&quot; showing how electrons and photons seem to travel backwards in time, and how photons can go faster or slower than the conventional speed of light. It's fascinating!What's great about these lectures is their clarity and humor. The author doesn't take himself too seriously and as a result the book is a delight to read, as well as being enlightening.Kudo's as well to the editor who distilled the material down to a manageable length of 152 pages.Can a book on Quantum Electro Dynamics be really fun to read?

It amazes me how much ground Feynman managed to cover in just four lectures, without assuming ANY foreknowledge of higher mathematics or physics (not even complex numbers, which are central to QED).Every scientist who deems his work too esoteric to be digested by laymen should be made to read this.

Feynman was both a great physicist anda great communicator, but the subject is both important andperplexingly obscure. This book is based on the Alex G. MautnerMemorial Lectures given at UCLA.Quantum behavior will matter to the21st century the way the steam engine mattered to the 18th and 19thcenturies, the way the internal combustion engine mattered to thefirst two-thirds of the twentieth century, and the way computers andtransistors have mattered to the last third of the twentieth. Tounderstand Quantum behavior you first have to understand themeasurements and scales involved. One billionth of a meter is a&quot;nanometer.&quot; It is how we measure things at the level ofmolecules and atoms. Quantum behavior is what starts happening innano-scale behavior below about 50 nanometers. The rules of physicssuddenly change at this level, and the way you and I were taught thatthe world works is suddenly replaced by very different rules.AsFeynman said &quot;my main purpose in these lectures is to describe asaccurately as I can the strange theory of light and matter--morespecifically the interaction of light and electrons.&quot; Feynman isclear that the theory works in that it accurately predicts outcomes,but that we do not really understand what is happening or how thoseoutcomes are arrived at. In his words: &quot;What I am going to tellyou about is what we teach our physics students in the third or fourthyear of graduate school ... No, you're not going to be able tounderstand it. Why, then, am I going to bother you with all this? Whyare you going to sit here all this time, when you won't be able tounderstand what I am going to say? It is my task to convince you notto turn away because you don't understand it. You see, my physicsstudents don't understand it either. That is because I don'tunderstand it. Nobody does.&quot;Feynman goes on to explain whyquantum behavior is so hard to accept: &quot;I'm going to describe toyou how Nature is--and if you don't like it, that's going to get inthe way of your understanding it. It's a problem that physicists havelearned to deal with. They've learned to realize that whether theylike a theory or they don't like a theory is not the essentialquestion. Rather, it is whether or not the theory gives predictionsthat agree with experiment. It is not a question of whether a theoryis philosophically delightful or easy to understand, or perfectlyreasonable from the point of view of common sense. The theory ofquantum electrodynamics describes Nature as absurd from the point ofview of common sense. And it agrees fully with the experiment. So Ihope you can accept Nature as She is--absurd.&quot; Despite itsdifficulty and remarkable characteristics Feynman asserts that Quantumelectrodynamics is important to all of life. Consider: &quot;Most ofthe phenomena you are familiar with involve the interaction of lightand electrons--all of chemistry and biology for example. The onlyphenomena that are not covered by this theory are phenomena ofgravitation and nuclear phenomena; everything else is contained inthis theory.&quot;&quot;The more you see how strangely Naturebehaves, the harder it is to make a model that explains how even thesimplest phenomena actually work&quot; is a Feynman observation thatgoes to the heart of our current situation. In traditional areas ofscience we are making rapid progress and some people think we are evenclose to the end of the scientific era or in a mature state. Yet inmany areas of science we are just beginning to understand thequestions and do not have a clue as to the answers. For example, 80%of the universe is dark matter and we currently know nothing aboutdark matter. Feynman's book is a good introduction to the frontiersthat beckon us to a great age of discovery in the 21stcentury.Consider the possibility that at least at very tiny levelsa kind of time travel can occur. Here is the description of figure 63(p.96) &quot;the scattering of light involves a photon going into anelectron and a photon coming out--not necessarily in that order, asseen in example b. The example in c shows a strange but realpossibility; the electron emits a photon, rushes backwards in time toabsorb a photon, and then continues forward in time.&quot; Rememberthis is a great physicist lecturing a sophisticated general audienceabout the cutting edge of knowledge. There is much in this onedescription to think about. Feynman goes further on this topic:&quot;This phenomenon is general. Every particle in Nature has anamplitude to move backwards in time, and therefore has ananti-particle.&quot;Feynman's argument is that quantum behavior istruly outside the Newtonian principles of classical physics andcontradicts our understanding of the world as we experience it at ourlarge, bulky level. &quot;Throughout these lectures I have delightedin showing you that the price of gaining such an accurate theory hasbeen the erosion of our common sense. We must accept some very bizarrebehavior...light traveling in paths other than a straight line,photons going faster or slower than the conventional speed of light,electrons going backwards in time...That we must do, in order toappreciate what Nature is really doing underneath nearly all thephenomena we see in the world.&quot;This is a challenging but veryimportant book about a topic which will have enormous implications forour century but which remarkably few public minded citizens have paidany attention to.

The narrative counts up to ten and then back down, with each page corresponding to a certain nuber of Halloween images-- scarecrows, jack-o-lanters, bats, witches, etc. The artwork, woodcut-looking vignettes that seem to have been scratched out of blackened paper, is crisp and very expressive, eerie without extravagance and yet truly edgy here and there--that vacant but sentient scarecrow, for example, or the chicken legs on the witches' house, or the startled faces on the book's center page. But really, the book is just a fun, aesthetic exploration of one holiday, without anything lasting or engaging about it except for that visual experience. It's excellent among Halloween books, more so for not actually forcing some dopey plot on us, but that's the end. I know I'll look forward to circulating the book into our reading cycle each October, but aside from then.... So it's just shy of 4 stars for me. 3 stars is too low, so we'll say 3 and a half, like my daughter."},{"Title":"A Creepy Countdown","review":"A Creepy Countdown involves a scarecrow, two toads, three jack-o-lanterns, four owls, five bats, six witches, seven ghosts, eight cats, nine skeletons and ten mice. I assure you that you're little children will be amazed by the little details of the pencil drawings. What I liked was all of the little grave stones. I was amazed by the excellent rhyming. And if you look very closely at the sides of each page, you can see masks dangling over the trees. Be on the 'look-out' for Jos. A. Smith's drawing book named The Pen and Ink Book. I hope that you have a extraordinary Halloweenific time this Halloween. Boo!"},{"Title":"A Creepy Countdown","review":"Christmas is on the list and getting special items are the fun of the seasons of the year. Thankyou much."},{"Title":"A Creepy Countdown","review":"This is our kids favorite Halloween book. We absolutely love it. Scary enough, but not so much that they wet the bed. The illustrations are OUTSTANDING. I want to rip the pages out, frame them, and hang them on the wall."},{"Title":"A Creepy Countdown","review":"\\"A Creepy Countdown\\" is certainly all that--and more. Writer Charlotte Huck and illustrator Jos. A. Smith combined to produce a truly creepy countdown from 1 to 10 then back to 1 again.This is a lap book so that the child can study the pictures carefully if he or she dares. The images are done in pen and ink on scratch board with an overlay of minimal color (actually a thin frame around each picture). These are truly frightening illustrations.\\"One tall scarecrow standing on a hill.\\" You know how a clown can be really scary? Try the properly dressed scarecrow propped ominously on a pole, arms extended, legs dangling, hat tipped, coat collar upright in black and white. Ummm, snuggle closer, little one.\\"Seven ghastly ghosts rising from their bed.\\" Each has red eyes peering from those twisty drape things. Scary!Something scares them on the middle double-spread and they all return page by page from whence they came. A creepy book good for a delicious scare!"},{"Title":"The Joyful Journey (Walker Large Print Books)","review":"The book is just easy reading, and has a good deal of humor. The book is just great to give to someone who has been in the hospital and is now convalescing either in rehab or at home. The book seems to be well received by those who are 50 or older. My wife read a copy which had been loaned to us, and was the mover in purchasing a few copies."},{"Title":"Men and rubber;: The story of business,","review":"If you want to learn something about entrepreneurship or even if you're management in a large corporation, one can learn a thing or two from Mr. Firestone's experience. Whether from how to keep a customer, techniques on what to look for in promoting someone, to making time for yourself to think about the business vs. the business using your time, these and other hard earned experiences have been reprinted for your benefit.Though Mr. Firestone's account was written fourscore ago, the business examples read as if they were of today's account as many problems he encountered sound contemporary and remind me of some of my own business problems. I am always surprised by historical accounts whether of history or business how the language somehow comes across as contemporary. One somehow goes into the historical reading process thinking otherwise, but leaves knowing different that our great or grand parents really went thru what we are going thru now.Though some chapters are somewhat autobiographical in nature, the anecdotal business insights from both Thomas Edison and Henry Ford come out and are worth the review. All in, a nice quick read with business lessons to learn and remember.(Comments reflect the original hardback release)"},{"Title":"Fell Beasts and Wondrous Magic Sourcebook (The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game)","review":"&quot;Fell Beasts and Wonderous Magic&quot; is a fantastic addition to the Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game. It includes an expansion on the core rules set down in the core handbook and includes the addition of special classes for player characters and new monsters. The main problem with the core rulebook was that it had a very limited focus on possible villians and scenarios for the players to be involved with. Fell Beasts and Wonderous Magic resolves this problem by giving the gamemaster a plethora of new ideas and adversaries with which to craft an adventure. If you have the core rulebook and like the game definately pick up this book to add to it."},{"Title":"Fell Beasts and Wondrous Magic Sourcebook (The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game)","review":"Like the Core Book, the creatures detailed are based mainly on the novel as opposed to the film. It provides much-needed expansion on the potential adversaries to throw at your players, and is primarily a GM's tool. There is also some very nice original artowrk, and hopefully Decipher will continue this trend.There is also some very helpful information on how to use magical and special items in your game, with some great examples to help you get the feel of the types of special items that are appropriate to the setting. I wasn't too impressed with the way in which the book suggests that introducing alternative monsters (such as good dragons) can &quot;destroy&quot; the integrity of the setting, and it is a little small for the price, but other than that it's a vital buy if you're serious about running a Lord of the Rings campaign."},{"Title":"Fine Silver Sampler: Introductory Precious Metal Clay Projects--Step by Step Guide for the Classroom or the Home","review":"For starters, though the information in this book IS good there is nothing in here that you can't find either on the Internet or in one of the many other books about Precious Metal Clay.Why is this important? Because for about $4-5 more you can get a more robust, WELL MADE, well produced book on the same subject here on amazon.com. Pick just about any other book about PMC and you will get professional binding, high resolution pictures, high quality cover and pages, and about 50-100 more pages of information.This book looks like it was made on a home computer by someone who just got a desktop publishing program and knows nothing about proper image resolution for print media. The images look like someone used the pictures on a website and then copied them for print. If you've never done this, trust me when I say the results look very unprofessional.The binding of the book is even worse. It is as if someone printed off legal size sheets from a desk-jet printer and got their kid to staple it in the middle and fold it over. You can't even just flip through the book because the pages are uneven.If I had seen this in a store I'd never have bought it, but because it was new and on amazon I figure I'd give it a shot. I'd send it back but I'd have to eat the shipping cost twice. I'm keeping it as a reminder to never buy books without reviews unless I've seen them up close and in person.Seriously, save your money and get The Art of Metal Clay by Sheri Haab or ANY other book on PMC out there. Heck, save your money entirely and do a google search about PMC Techniques. You'll get just as much information, if not more, as what is in this book, and can probably print it all off to put in a project binder and make something at half the cost that looks 100% better than this."},{"Title":"Fine Silver Sampler: Introductory Precious Metal Clay Projects--Step by Step Guide for the Classroom or the Home","review":"There are plenty of precious metal clay books worth buying but this is not one of them--unfortunately. This was the first precious metal clay book I bought and now that I completed the 3-day certification class in PMC, I realize how poorly done this book is, and I wasted my money on this publication. The instructions are marginal. The layout is very confusing and poorly done. It appears the book was put together by someone who has no knowledge or experience in desktop publishing or technical writing. The photos are not clear and are poor quality, and the \\"busy\\" backgrounds make it hard to see the object in photo-- some of the photos should have just been left out since they don't enhance or help to clarify the directions.

This gives extra knowledge into Buddhism aside from just having general Buddhism outlines.I would highly recommend this book for anyone interested in Buddhism.

My expectation, based on the fact he paid $18 for it, was that I would be treated to an informative and professional introduction to Buddhism. Unfortunately, I couldn't make it past the first 10 pages because (IMO) this book read like a working draft of a theology thesis. I found the awkward writing style, the frequent grammar and punctuation errors, and the confusing formatting frustrated any appreciation for the information it contained.If you are not as easily distracted as I am by an unpolished presentation (and I suspect I am in the minority), then it appears by the other reviews that this book is well worth your consideration.

An orphan, the result of a particularly bad cholera epidemic which wipes out his whole family, Daniel apprentices himself to the boatman, John the Brawn, as a helper in lieu of living in an orphanage. But when the boat containing the actress Magdelena Colon, her maid, and niece, Maud Fallon, is upset by a large block of ice, fate intervenes, causing Quinn's fortunes and fate to be interwoven with Magdelena, Maud, and John the Brawn.This was a wondeful novel, full of rich language, and subtle humor, which portrays the life of the Irish in the mid-nineteenth century with startling realism. Daniel's family seems to have arrived in America well before the parade of famine Irish, so starkly portrayed by Kennedy in all their squalor. While not attempting to stereotype the Irish immigrants, we see them as the white, upper-class citizens of New York did, a scourge and pestilence bringing filth and disease with them. At one point in the novel they are herded on railroad cars and transported away from Albany as undesirables, dumped on some less fortunate area of the state.Though the fate of the Irish immigrant is not the main theme in the novel, Quinn's background of being a penniless Irish orphan doesn't increase his chances of gaining the hand of Maud, though she declares her love for him upon their first meeting when she is but thirteen to his fifteen. Fate throws them together over the years, but it is not until he is a grown man that he finally seems worthy of the precocious Maud.Besides the obvious love story the historical perspective works well. We are treated to a look at the anti-Catholic Know Nothing Pary, the forerunners of the modern Republican Pary, Abolitionists, the Underground Railroad, and the New York City Draft Riots. A very enjoyable story."},{"Title":"Quinn's Book","review":"Recently, in reviewing an early William Kennedy Albany-cycle novel, \\"Ironweed\\" I mentioned that he was my kind of writer. I will let what I stated there stand on that score here. Here is what I said:\\"William Kennedy is, at least in his Albany stories, my kind of writer. He writes about the trials and tribulations of the Irish diaspora as it penetrated the rough and tumble of American urban WASP-run society, for good or evil. I know these people, my people, their follies and foibles like the back of my hand. Check. Kennedy writes, as here with the main characters Fran Phelan and Helen Archer two down at the heels sorts, about that pervasive hold that Catholicism has even on its most debased sons and daughters, saint and sinner alike. I know those characteristics all too well. Check. He writes about that place in class society where the working class meets the lumpen-proletariat-the thieves, grifters, drifters and con men- the human dust. I know that place well, much better than I would ever let on. Check. He writes about the sorrows and dangers of the effects alcohol on working class families. I know that place too. Check. And so on. Oh, by the way, did I mention that he also, at some point, was an editor of some sort associated with the late Hunter S. Thompson down in Puerto Rico. I know that mad man's work well. He remains something of a muse for me. Check.\\"That said, this little novel takes place in an earlier time in the Albany novel cycle, the earliest period thus far in my reading of the cycle. This is a story of the hard period in America for those \\"famine ship Irish\\" that were driven to seek a new life in the new world against their collective wills. But, certainly they were driven out of Ireland by economic necessity and desperation. For the most part the snippets of character detailed here, including the earliest generations of names that are familiar from later generations in Kennedy's book , do not suggest that they were driven out due to some criminal activity, political or not, against old \\"Mother \\"England\\".That snippet of character reference above also can be used as a point that makes this novel a little different from the others in this cycle. The narrator, Daniel Quinn, a teenage boy-man orphan (nice touch, as narrator in a fresh, young country) with plenty of spunk and ambition, as is usually the case gets plenty of character build-up throughout. However this novel is driven more by the plot than by character development than prior Kennedy reads. That plot, such as it is, centers on Quinn's \\"golden quest\\" to win the hand of the \\"teen angel\\", Maud, come hell or high water. Along the way, we are taken on a Kennedy version of \\"magical realism\\", 19th century Albany Irish style: of the \\"famine ship\\" Irish; of the old Dutch squirarchy that ruled the Hudson Valley in those days; of the American racial and political scene in the pre-Civil War period, and much else. That \\"much else\\" sometimes gets in the way of the \\"golden quest\\", but as almost always with Kennedy he gives us a good read, if not a great one."},{"Title":"Quinn's Book","review":"I should have been writing my senior thesis during the last 24 hours, but instead I was whipping through this novel. I really like mystical realism, and the idea of the author following the large cast of characters through the twists and turns of their eventful and intersecting lives. It reminded me of novels by Isabelle Allende which I really have enjoyed."},{"Title":"Quinn's Book","review":"I have read all of William Kennedy's books. I admit to being from Albany, the subject of his books. Kennedy unravels the tales of one of the nation's great \\"open\\" towns in the U.S.They are history on a more personal level. It will not ast long on the night table."},{"Title":"Quinn's Book","review":"I admit to being biased (my family moved to Albany around the time this story is set and has stayed since) but still insist this is a great period story that is at times hilarious, at times heart-wrenching, and never dull.Although period literature is definitely in no short supply, Kennedy writes this book with a distinctly mystical flair that adds a stern dose of magic to a time most authors relegate to stuffiness and pomp. In addition, his characters here are immediately endearing, espescially Maud, Magdalena, and Daniel Quinn himself.I'm less coherent than normal having spent the night awake reading this great story in lieu of sleep, but for anyone interested in, well, good storytelling set with a historically accurate backdrop of Albany and canal-town New York as a whole,Quinn's Book recommends itself."},{"Title":"Quinn's Book","review":"I came late to William Kennedy's work and may have to take other reviewers at their word that this is not his best. But it's certainly pretty good, and I'll find out if the rest is better. He captures a kind of crazed picaresque worldview which is something like E.L. Doctorow on drugs. His disasters are gigantic, larger than life, and so are most of the characters. It's hard to tell if it's magical realism or just totally unlikely, but it's funny as hell and a tremendously fun and quick reading experience--in spite of the mass violence and misfortune and desperate poverty it describes."},{"Title":"Quinn's Book","review":"An excellent book, just excellent. My cousin read me the first sentence and I was hooked. This novel made me think of Doctorow's Billy Bathgate and Helprin's Winter's Tale, and it's just as good as those masterpieces. Now, has anyone else wondered about the mysterious but obvious relationship between this book, Winter's Tale, and Paul Auster's New York Trilogy (e.g., there is a character named Daniel Quinn in New York Trilogy)? And what other references am I missing? What is going on here?"},{"Title":"Quinn's Book","review":"If someone set out to write a parody of Kennedy's works, it would read a lot like Quinn's Book. Hard to put down, yes; telling details, of course; but undermined by preposterous characters and an offensive kind of magical realism.

Its called \\"intervertebral disc disease\\". It is a problem of the spine in which injuries to the vertebrae over time could wind up making your dog lame and needing a very expensive operation. If only the books on bassets would warn people of this issue and give them advice on how to prevent it. Namely, never allow your basset to become overweight, jump on furniture, go up/down stairs, or jump into your car without benefit of a ramp. Their spines just can't handle the stress. Our basset, who was healthy in ever other way, suddenly yelped in pain one day when entering the house. Shortly afterwards she was shaking in pain, and unable to walk. The vet hospital wanted $10,000 to operate on her spine, which would have given her an 80% chance of recovery, but made no promise of it not happening again. We could not afford it, and they refused to negotiate a lower fee. We had to do the unthinkable and put her down. She was only 6 years old, and the most wonderful dog we had ever owned.

Through a complex dialogue, a rabbi-teacher reveals to his student the techniques of ascent, methods for traveling up through the heavens by means of recitation of hymns. The teacher gives vivid descriptions of the heavenly realm, filled with flaming chariots and a chorus of angels engaged in praising the deity.The emphasis in the text is on language, on the correct recitation of the words to achieve the ritual. The particular focus is on the divine Name, which can be employed in unusual ways. The author relates the structures of the text to linguistic ideologies. The complex structures of the text begin to unfold in light of the theories about the ritual function of language.The hymns include praise of the deity and occus magicae, words that have no semantic meaning, but draw attention to sounds of letters in God's name. Since God's name is used to create the world, the sounds of the name are creative, but the Name cannot be spoken. The hymns create a multiplicity of Name-equivalents, words that have the functional status of the divine Name and which can be employed in ritual. Voces magicae are not so much nonsense as they are logical extensions of the linguistic theory. The final chapter surveys recent theories of ritual language and then uses the conclusions from the study to refine the general issue of the relationship between the semantic meaning of words and their ritual efficacy.The dialogic structure of the text permits the reader to become the next student in a chain going back to the deity by means of Moses."},{"Title":"Random House Webster's French-English English-French Dictionary","review":"In college (I was a French major) I used an excellent paperback English-French, French-English dictionary put out by Random House.

Somewhat like in the Warhammer series. He also creates one of the most frightening alien life forms I have read about in science fiction, the Vang. I always thought that it was a shame that Rowley didn't develop this theme to more than the three books he wrote on the subject of the Vang and the Laowan.

With all the trashy SF movies over the last few years; with a few notable exceptions, most of the problems lie with poor basic scripts.

I would love to read more of the wars background/history that would be some tale. As a final note what ever happened to his Golden Sunlands series...C'mon my man finish it off damnit.

For instance the varg are EXACTLY like the flood, and have the EXACT same 3 forms. Also the blue skinned beings whos name escapes me at the moment are like the Elites. Those guys who created the Starhammer are the Forerunner. The Starhammer is like halo and so on and so forth.

It has no cover and is about the most damaged book I own.But, I treat it as best I can, considering I have read it at least twice every year since I found it. It is a detailed trip into a bleak future, where mankind is saved long before it ever reached the stars.The book has some technical flaws, and the pacing changes through the story, but for all that it presents ideas and visions with clarity and imagination. I would love a story about the long past heros of the novel.The plusses of the book significantly outweigh the minuses. The heros are thinking, feeling beings, the villans obviously think a different way, and the true villan turns out to be much scarier than expected. Plus, its smart.In all this is a very exciting and fast paced (mostly) book that is a vision of redemption."},{"Title":"Starhammer","review":"Starhammer presents a new frontier for the sci-fi epic, or beautifully restores one. You be the judge.Having read the book four times, I never tire of what it has to offer.The human race is under the control of an alien race, the laowon. These are the darkest times in human history, and there is not hope in sight. Until Jon Iehard, the main character, comes across a mission he cannot decline. He is on a hunt for a terrorist the laowon badly. Who has with him half the key to a terrible secret which will set free the human race.To say more than this is to rob you of the pleasure of reading this book for yourself.Starhammer is a grand epic of unimaginable proportions.

I love Jon Iehard. I love to hate the Laowon aliens. Rowley creates a fantastic universe, dark, believable and desperate for the humans. The pace is swift and gripping. My favorite moments are when Iehard draws his Taw Taw long-barrel and gets some serious revenge. The cyborgs were fantastic and the hunt for the man with half a face was simply great.Great book. Great ideas and one of the best ends ever."},{"Title":"Starhammer","review":"It's been eighteen years since I last read this book, when I was a teenager in high school. It was very fun to read then, and now in mid-life I've read it again after finding it buried in my stuff, some questions stick out.The very existence of the Starhammer weapon raises questions. It is an ultimate power indeed, so how does it improve conditions for anyone who does not possess it? If you read the sequels, overall conditions improve only slightly in my opinion, and my theory is it's because of the Starhammer. As they say, power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. And I hate to say this but it can eventually ruin the story for me because it is a plot device after all, a big stick that forces the story to play along its rules. And like The Matrix sequels, it destroys any tension in whatever plot may come along later. What is there to fear if you possess God-like power? Even then, The Vang was a satisfying read because it was a Starhammer sequel yet it wisely did not involve this plot device.The author paints a truly cynical picture, which I did not realize in my idealistic youth. As opposed to Star Trek, he knows how to create very human humans and very alien aliens (apologies to a certain reviewer). The Laowon are alien enough as they are completely bereft of human characteristics such as mercy and empathy. The human slave traders drew the line and pointed out the benefits, at least, a the human cannibals killed only to survive.And as in most of his work, the recurring motif is the human pursuit of freedom from the excessively greedy (e.g. the Khalifi in The Founder) or simply the evil (the vang).If for no other reason, this novel is worth the read based on the account of the slave trader who captures the heroic main character. The emotions you may feel will be unforgettable, and it took me back to how I experienced this book the first time all those years ago. And the ending is great in how it turns full circle and recalls the beginning, as it is karma defined."},{"Title":"Starhammer","review":"The human race after coming into contact with a technologically superior, but morally corrupt alien race, have become their slaves.

I know the phrase is overused, but this book truly is must-reading for the serious sci-fi fan. It essentially takes the classic quest motif and recasts it within a futuristic setting. The result is a book that I've had to read several times -- so good and entertaining is its story-telling. If there are any Hollywood types reading this, you should give serious consideration to making Starhammer into a feature film. I think, if professionally done, it would rival Star Wars as the greatest sci-fi epic adventure. Christopher Rowley blows away the pathetic futuristic junk we're all too accustomed too.

Dona Canovas wants a older woman to help her son Felipe translate his novels in to English, but Frances gets such high praise from her former employer Mr Granby who sent a letter to his publisher praising Frances. So under the strength of that she is hired.They head to Spain, on the plane Frances meets Clive Kettner, an Australian. Clive falls in love with Frances, but so does Don Felipe's 1/2 brother Luis, and his young brother Juan takes a special liking to Frances.Once in Spain and Don Felipe doesn't seem too concerned with paying Frances for doing nothing but sight-seeing.Dona Teresa gets sick just as they get to Spain and we don't see her again until almost the end of the story.Don Luis is head over hills in love for the first time and he doesn't know how to take things gently.As he storms Frances defences, Frances takes his attentions with a pinch of salt, because Juan told her Luis has all the women falling for him, including his brother's Nova Carmela Henares, although Luis doesn't return her love she is so beautiful she is sure she will win Luis' heart.But the twist in this book is 12 yr-old Juan who thinks if he can get Felipe jealous, Felipe will drop Carmela and Juan will marry her as soon as he gets old enough.So he plans Carmela's fall, and tells his brother Felipe, but it backfires when Felipe has a nasty accident after hearing the news that the woman he loves is in love with his beloved brother.And much to Juan's chagrin, Frances is involved by Juan's Governess Senora Garcia who is a active menace. She tells Dona Teresa lies about Frances, but in the process get herself fired, after slapping Juan in the face for once in his mother Dona Teresa's presenceThere 2 more children Teresa has 18 yr-old Emilia who we never meet and 9 yr-old Pilar, who is rarely seen.Will Felipe get Carmela, will Clive get Frances, or will all be lost because of a wicked Senora Garcia?From the back of the book: 'Frances was delighted to get a job in Madrid as secretary to a handsome Spanish novelist-who, she later discovered, had a still more handsome brother.A nice Australian came into the picture too; altogether her visit to Spain proved even more trilling than she had expected.'"},{"Title":"The Fragility of Goodness: Why Bulgaria's Jews Survived the Holocaust","review":"It is no big surprise that Todorov published a book on the Bulgarian Jews' salvation issue. First, it goes within the major topic of his later research: the value of ethics in extreme circumstances. Second, his Bulgarian origin should made him, even for simply methodological reasons, pay more attention to the country where he comes from (and which one would expect him to know well). The book follows a scheme that Todorov already employed ten years ago in compiling the witnesses' tales of three Bulgarian citizens severely (and unreasonably) persecuted by the Communist secret police in the early 60's: no place for comments, the floor is given to the \\"historical figures\\" themselves. Yet, while in the previous \\"Bulgarian\\" book the historical figures spoke with their own words, here Todorov is constricted to the existing documentation (no one of the participants in the '43 events is still alive). And this is why he, everything taken into acount, fails. The texts are insufficient to build a complete picture of WWII Bulgaria because of their \\"official\\" character: they do not present in detail the motivation even of those main figures that were most deeply involved in the salvation (or effective dispatch to the camps of death), yet they are not adjoined by any commentary by the author wich to elucidate them better. The author's position is limited (and this is quite a particular case!) to the title itself which, however, is misleading, too. Shall we interpret it literally in the sense that Bulgarians should not really boast about saving the Jews; or shall we understand it within the broader context of Todorov's work, as just one more argument in favor of Todorov's general concept of the relativity of morality? The truth is even now I cannot choose the correct answer."},{"Title":"The Fragility of Goodness: Why Bulgaria's Jews Survived the Holocaust","review":"The author thoroughly explores the chain of events and actions that led to the rescue of Bulgarian Jews from Holocaust. In addition to his own remarks, the author provides a set of documents relevant to the period of persecution and possible deportation of Bulgarian Jews. The memoirs and diaries of political (and moral) adversaries describing the same events are put together. The clash of individual / group actions and opinions reveals the struggle between good and evil, courage and cowardliness in the Bulgarian society and government of 1940s. The author puts special emphasis on the brave attempt of Dimitar Peshev, the Vice-Chairman of National Assembly, to prevent Jewish deportation. His actions cost him the political post, but his goal was eventually achieved. I believe the author underestimated the role of Bulgarian king Boris in the eventual cancellation of deportation plans. Without his decision, the protests of Peshev, the opposition, and Bulgarian society would be in vain. I think his decision was more than just a calculated move done in Bulgarian national interests. His efforts to defend Jewish lives in the personal meetings with Nazi officials (including Hitler) are evident and should be recognized."},{"Title":"The Fragility of Goodness: Why Bulgaria's Jews Survived the Holocaust","review":"The Fragility of Goodness: Why Bulgaria's Jews Survived the Holocaust by Tzvetan Todorov (Editor) fails in the essential task created by the title - explainig how fragile was the set of circumstances that led to the Jews of Bulgaria being saved. The first 40 or so pages of the book is a concise history of Bulgaria and the Second World War with the remainer of the book restricted to primary historical documents and memories of the major participants.The stated premise of the book is that goodness is fragile and that the saving of Bulgarian's Jews was not a forgone conclusion. The author ignores that fact that few historical events were forgone conclusions. Even the rise of Hitler was not preordianed and but for the acts of Hindengurg and a few Weimar leaders who thought that they could control Hitler there might not have been a Holocaust. Todorov does not explain why the events in Bulgaria are any different from every other historical event.If one want to read a comprehensive history of Bulgaria during World War II, I would suggest Beyond Hitler's Grasp: The Heroic Rescue of Bulgaria's Jews by Michael Bar-Zohar. The Fragility of Goodness is wothwhile for the presence of the primary sources, but not much else."},{"Title":"The Fragility of Goodness: Why Bulgaria's Jews Survived the Holocaust","review":"There are two elements to this fascinating book. One is the basic facts, including lengthy excerpts from primary sources, of a story that deserves to be much better-known than it is in the West. The other is the author's philosophical observations on those basic facts. There is heroism here, but do not expect a simple depiction of good guys and bad guys. As the title suggests, Todorov believes it all could have gone much differently, and quite easily. In this book, history is as much about luck, happenstance, and coincidence as it is about intention. The book is worth reading for the story alone, whether or not you accept Todorov's analysis, but even if you disagree with him, his views are thought-provoking."},{"Title":"STAR WARS: THE LANDO CALRISSIAN ADVENTURES","review":"This volume includes the three novels written about Lando Calrissian in 1983 (the same year as the film \\"Return of the Jedi\\"). It covers how Lando first acquired the starship Millennium Falcon and his three adventures with a droid named Vuffi Raa, involving a serious grudge from a sorcerer named Rokur Gepta.It's an entertaining read, but this has to be the strangest Star Wars book (or books) ever written. There's an Empire, but much of the time it is referred to as the Civility. Instead of the Imperial Starfleet there's the Navy, with ships with names like \\"Courteous\\" and \\"Reluctant\\" instead of \\"Relentless\\" or \\"Devastator\\", the usual kind of name for Imperial starships.Moreover, someone has apparently handed a lot of power over to the sorcerer, but nowhere is there an Emperor, a Darth Vader, stormtroopers, Sith, Jedi, or the Force. But all these things were mainstays of Star Wars in 1983.And Vuffi Raa is referred to as a \\"robot\\" never as a \\"droid\\", the Star Wars terminology for such beings.Basically someone took a completely different science fiction galaxy and inserted Lando and the Falcon into it. The corresponding trilogy covering the adventures of the young Han Solo, published in 1997 and 1998, certainly describe Han's encounters with Lando over many years (including how Han won the Falcon from Lando) against a much more plausible backdrop of Empire and nascent Rebellion.One really wonders what Lucasfilms were thinking when they approved the publication of these books?"},{"Title":"STAR WARS: THE LANDO CALRISSIAN ADVENTURES","review":"A series of three novels, all fairly ordinary. This is the story of some of Lando Calrissian's adventures before the events in Star Wars. Here, he has a lot of success in card games. He wins the Millenium Falcon, and then he wins a droid.

With all of the other excellent Star Wars books out there, this book should be labeled &quot;Die Hard Fans Only.&quot;These three stories detail some of Lando's adventures before he meets Han in the Han Solo Trilogy by A. C. Crispin. Lando and his faithful droid Vuffi Raa travel the galaxy looking for a good game of sabacc, and try to stay out of the clutches of the evil sorceror Rokar Gepta. I think the only direct references to this series in other books were when Han worried that Lando was a better sabacc player because he had made a fortune in the Oseon, and when Han asked Lando about his friend, Vuffi Raa. Other than that, there is nothing crucial that you must know in order to read the other Star Wars books.This series was a little silly at times. At one point, Lando grows very tall, and then eventually s! ! hrinks back to his normal size. No explanation is given (you know, like the Force gave him the power) and the reader is left shaking his head in disgust. In the last book, huge vacuum breathing aliens are able to fashion convincing models of themselves out of their own waste products.

The problem is that the author obvously never saw Star Wars. All he knows is Lando Calrissian and the Millenium Falcon. No Emperor , Empire , zero descriptions of the ships , something called the Centrality (Neil Smith probably meant &quot;the Empire&quot;) , wrong terms (i.e , &quot;faster than light&quot; instead of &quot;Hyperspace&quot;), and just what the HELL is Rokur Gepta doing commanding the Imperial Navy??? . Despite these obvious errors , the book is funny. the conversations between Lando and the awseome Vuff-Raa are hysterical. and the plot is,nt that bad , just goofy and too unbelivable ( a race of starship biengs that can destroy Imperial Warships in just one shot?).

If only someone would edit the Black Fleet Crises down from 900 to 400 pages, but I dream...Mindharp is the first story and the best of the three. This tells how Lando got the falcon learned to fly it. Flamewind is a bit confusing but a worthwhile read. Starcave may be one of the stupidest plots I have ever read.

So I can't really comment much but intend on editing as I progress.So far... Eh. I enjoy Lando and wanted to read the book after getting into gambling myself and I love the details of the resort/casinos and Lando's gambling. In fact, the first story was great until about half way through when it started to become juvenile fantasy. I actually got a migraine just trying to finish the last few chapters in the first story as half-way through it just gets ridiculous- the entire story -and way too repetitive. Star Wars is of course science fiction which means not real but many elements of the universe have the potential of being real in another universe and make sense... What happens in the first story here is just asinine and so totally unrealistic. It's like one of those space movies from the 50s or 60s that are just like WHAT!?!?!Other than that though I am enjoying the book and am hoping the next two stories have less retardedness as otherwise it's rather enjoyable. Some reviews mentioned the stories not being all about Jedis and the force... Well, the Star Wars universe is just that, a universe. There is more to Star Wars than lightsabers and the force. For me the main attraction is just the universe itself with all the intricate politics and deception. Star Wars Galaxies was a great game because of the fact it took the Star Wars universe and put you in the middle of it to do what you like (RIP SWG.. BOYCOTT SOE and Lucas Arts!).So so far the first story was extremely lame but the beginning was good and so far the second story is going good too so.. Here's hoping!The only thing that is annoying is the improper terminology such as \\"faster-than-light\\" but it certainly doesn't kill the book (The outrageous, unbelievable plot does that which hopefully was just the first story). Also, one thing I noticed was the writing is a bit jagged here and there. The book doesn't read as smooth and seamless as one might expect which is far more annoying than the improper terminology but again, doesn't kill the book, just makes it seem as if an amateur wrote it.UPDATE --Finally finished the book. Long story short, it didn't get better. The stories themselves are far fetched, the only upside is the beginning before it just becomes unbearable. The writing is difficult to follow as well, as mentioned, very jagged and no flow whatsoever. The ending of the last story was rather abrupt and hastened it felt.I couldn't recommend this book to be honest but for anyone who is a fan of the Star Wars universe itself I certainly wouldn't discourage the read. I don't regret having had read it but I do wish it would've been better written with less stupid plot lines.The only real joy in the book was Vuffi Raa. I guess just knowing this character alone would be worth the read for any Star Wars fan. Would be nice if there was a better written, better plotted Lando book with Vuffi Raa as really, Jedis and all that crap is the least appealing thing about Star Wars imo. It's all about the universe itself and those who occupy it living their lives. Definatly need more books of this nature but by a different, more in tune writer."},{"Title":"STAR WARS: THE LANDO CALRISSIAN ADVENTURES","review":"Being an avid Star Wars fan, I have read nearly every Star Wars novel available. Without a doubt, these three stories are the worst. The author, Lester Neil Smith III (I was shocked to learn that he has written other novels...) uses jargin that no charactor in the Star Wars films would EVER use, Lando is completely out of charactor. He constantly uses insults, as an aparent running gag, about Lando's strange robot friend. His charactors are boring, and not very creative. One charactor IS \\"Big Bird\\" from Sesame Street. Another looks just like a manta ray... I mean, come on, Smith has no imagination. At the begining of every story, Lando is a is a down on his luck and broke, and at the end his a millionaire. I was so happy when I finished the book, and believe me, that was no easy task.Bottom line is, if you're a collector like me and just have to have all the novels, then it's a must.

Neil Smith is an extremely talented author; his sentence construction was great, his descriptions were vivid and colorful, and he all around wrote with talent. However, this book was Star Wars soley by name and main character. Lando Calrissian, while not a huge character in the original Star Wars series, is a very prominent character in the expanded universe - even having a role in the newer Dark Tide novels. However, Mr. Smith had Lando visiting obscure places that I had never heard of before (with 70+ novels and reference books I know a lot) accompanied by a droid who's design was apparently &quot;one of a kind,&quot; - a concept which the author seemed to like very much. At seemingly every location Lando visited there existed, &quot;the largest buildings in the galaxy,&quot; or the &quot;most precious gems in the galaxy,&quot; etc. Lando journeyed to places where certain authorities spanned the galaxy. There were entire fleets that roamed space enforcing their own laws, doing as they pleased. Hello Neil? Do you remember a little, tiny thing called the GALACTIC EMPIRE, that played, hmmm, a small role in the movies? Obviously you haven't done any reading about Star Wars, because the few references to the Star Wars galaxy in your book refer to the movies. In fact, I recall considering making a list of the items in this book that did not pertain to Star Wars, but did not end up doing so. Unfortunately I cannot name every nuance of the book that upset me. I'm sure this would make an excellent, general science fiction novel if the main character were renamed, because I do not recall any references to Han Solo, and Star Wars planets, or anything else Star Wars. However, if you are a die-hard Star Wars Fan as I am, you will find yourself constantly correcting the book and calmly explaining to it that it was wrong. :-) The one that stuck with me most was how Neil called Vuffi-Ra (Lando's droid companion) a robot. I believe Star Wars stands out in that it is one of the only series to refer to its mechanical counterparts as &quot;droids.&quot; Anyway, I do not know if you would agree with my 2-star rating, but as I said before, if you are a big star wars fan like me you would give it such a score for the sacrilege Neil has committed!"},{"Title":"STAR WARS: THE LANDO CALRISSIAN ADVENTURES","review":"I was expecting a good, thrilling adventure story, after all, Lando Calrissian, a real scoundrel, is the main character.

There are way too many references to cigarettes, sardines, children's TV icons, Rabbits from Breakfast cereals, and many other things from our galaxy and not the Star Wars galaxy. I know that this was one of the first Star Wars books ever written, but these books do not even fit in with the original trilogy, much less the Expanded Universe. If you want to read these books I would recommend forgetting everything you read in them, as soon as you are finished, especially if you are going to read any of the other Star Wars books. I have read several of the Star Wars books and these three are the worst by far."},{"Title":"STAR WARS: THE LANDO CALRISSIAN ADVENTURES","review":"I read these immediately after finishing James H. Schmitz' _The Witches of Karres_ when I was a high school student around 1985 or so. I remember thinking I had just read the names of a list of items in the cargo hold in the last book I had just read--sure enough, L. Neil Smith plagiarized straight from _The Witches of Karres_.While the plagiarism rankled a bit, I continued to work my way through them. The books are the most boring and ill-conceived I've read. Save yourself the time and read Eddings, Lackey, Moon, or McCaffrey--or even Schmitz' _The Witches of Karres_. All write much better than this plagiarizer."},{"Title":"STAR WARS: THE LANDO CALRISSIAN ADVENTURES","review":"It was ssssssssooooooooooooooooooooooo boring. I fell asleep well reading it."},{"Title":"STAR WARS: THE LANDO CALRISSIAN ADVENTURES","review":"First thing first: My review is biased. I love Lando Calrissian. He is probably my favorite character in the whole series and I'll explain why. When we first see him in Empire Strikes Back, he is someone that doesn't have the same freedom that the others have. He is responsible for the well being of an entire populace, on his own. His apparent betrayal of our heroes is one of necessity. Only when he realizes that his betrayal will not save his city and will make things even worse for his friends does he correct the situation as best he can. By the end of the trilogy, he is the hero of Endor, having led the defeat of the Death Star. Lando is a transitional hero; he is not as clear cut as the rest, but develops with the story. His actions are weighed by responsibility and eventually he does the right thing; not only that, but he redeems himself for his apparent betrayal. So, let's look at the book itself. We get to see what Lando did while he owned the Millenium Falcon, back before he became Baron Administrator, previous to his heroics in the rebellion. And his story is very fun to read. It takes place when the Jedi are gone, the Empire strong and growing, and the galaxy falling to despair. Never a better time to make one's fortune. He flies his ship through uncharted backwater worlds to become involved in an &quot;international&quot; adventure that leads to some terrific conclusions and plot twists. Not only that, the scenes that stand out are Lando's James Bond-like lifestyle and the casino scenes are well written. Lando could beat 007 at a hand of cards and with style. Don't look for an all out battle that redefines the fate of the galaxy. Instead, sit back and enjoy the suspense of a good card game, the mystery of the past revealed, and the wonder of discovery in classic sci-fi fashion. Lando is young, the Millenium Falcon, well, still an old piece of junk that can outfly anything, and there are destinies to be made. This book lays the foundation of Lando's adventures and gives us a glimpse into his past. p.s. If you want to find out what happens after the Lando Calrissian Trilogy, read the second Han Solo trilogy by A.C. Crispin; highly recommended."},{"Title":"STAR WARS: THE LANDO CALRISSIAN ADVENTURES","review":"These stories were a refreshing change from the more &quot;heavy&quot; star wars books, and makes for a nice break from the endless arrays of &quot;Greatest Threats Ever&quot; or giant Superweapons that plagued the Jedi Academy Trilogy, Corellian and Darksaber books. The Calrissian trilogy also has more in common with traditional sci fi than most Star Wars stories. The characterizations of Lando and his robot sidekick, Vuffi Raa, are spot on, even if the main villain, Rokur Gepta is totally generic. The story is pretty light throughout, it is always interesting and full of unexpected twists and turns. The droid, Vuffi Raa, is a classic robot, and has the same appeal as C3-PO and R2-D2. And if many of the details in the book seem wrong, or undefined, just remember that it was written in 1982-1983 when only two films and maybe five books of Star Wars were around. This series is far better than the 1978 Han Solo Adventures. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"STAR WARS: THE LANDO CALRISSIAN ADVENTURES","review":"Having read many of the Star Wars novels I would rate this as one of my very favorites--Or I should say 3 of my favorites as this is a three book set.The story was a fresh one not a rehash of former themes (like many of the tedious Rogue Squadron books).And the author added some nice touches; for instance: throughout this series Lando has a sidekick named Vuffi Raa, Vuffi is a Robot that Lando won in a card game; Lando can't stand him at first; but his relationship with Vuffi is one that teaches us what kind of a person Lando is.This is also a nice, money-saving format for purchasing these series books."},{"Title":"STAR WARS: THE LANDO CALRISSIAN ADVENTURES","review":"Seriously, L. Neil Smith's Lando Calrissian Adventures are among the best stories set in the Star Wars universe. I'll not waste your time repeating all of its virtues (you can read the other positive reviews for that); instead, I'll clear up a couple of misconceptions some other reviewers had.The Emperor and the Empire do not exist in these books, one reviewer griped. This is incorrect. Try reading them.The Centrality = the Empire??? Not at all, friends. The Centrality is a small, self-governed region of the galaxy, much like the Corporate Sector, located in a remote corner of the Inner Rim Territories, between the Cron Drift and Hutt Space.It has few planetary bodies, though it does contain the Rafa System and the Renatasian System. The Centrality was allied with the Empire, but there were few Imperial forces in the area because of its lack of resources. I'd assume that a good number of these forces were destroyed in the battle with the Oswaft at the ThonBoka.Oh, no! Incorrect terminology (\\"faster-than-light\\" instead of \\"hyperspace\\")! Er, yeah. Ships in hyperspace DO go faster than light.Rokur Gepta! Who is he, why is he commanding the Imperial Fleet (or part of it)? Rokur Gepta was one of the galaxy's assorted darksiders who were allied with the Emperor, like Azrakel and Del Korrot (make no mistake, he wasn't one of Palpatine's Imperial Dark Jedi stooges like Hethrir, Ameesa Darys, or Arden Lyn). Emperor Palpatine took interest in Rokur Gepta, the last Sorceror of Tund, and made him one of the most powerful beings in the Centrality, with the power to supersede most government or military operations.Yeah, well, that's it. Hopefully, they'll bring back Vuffi Raa in a future story. That little droid just rocks."},{"Title":"STAR WARS: THE LANDO CALRISSIAN ADVENTURES","review":"Separating them from most of the Star Wars Expanded Universe, the Lando Calrissian Adventures by L. Neil Smith were actually written during the release of the original movies (all three were published in a six-month span right after Return of the Jedi in 1983). They take a sharply different tone from the largely more serious novels that started with Timothy Zahn's trilogy in 1991. Except for the inclusion of Lando and the Millennium Falcon, they barely feel like Star Wars stories at all.In Lando Calrissian and the Mindharp of Sharu, Lando is the brand-new owner of the Falcon and is just about to win Vuffi Raa, a quirky meter-tall starship-shaped droid who will be his constant companion through these three novels. Vuffi is a fun character and I did enjoy the banter between him and Lando; however, at the same time, Lando speaks in a way I find highly unbelievable and very little like his character in the films. Smith tends to amplify small characteristics of Lando's speech and use them mercilessly. For example, if you noticed Lando saying \\"you pirate\\" a couple of times in the films, be ready for dozens of variations on that.Lando and Vuffi set off for the Rafa System, where they quickly find themselves in hot water with the local authorities and Rokur Gepta, the Sorcerer of Tund, who is to be their primary adversary throughout the three novels. Turns out all is not as it seems and they set out to discover the mysteries behind the legendary Mindharp and the strange disappearance of the Sharu people millennia ago. It's a fine story but doesn't feel like it is a Star Wars story; it could easily have been transplanted from any sci-fi franchise with Lando pasted on top.Smith writes in a flowing manner that is easy to read and entertaining. He does a particularly good job with a chapter dealing with Lando escaping a deadly life-crystal tree and Vuffi essentially resurrecting himself after being shot with hundreds of arrows. The prose is strong and it's the kind of scene most of these books would blow by without pausing. Smith manages to make it gripping and interesting.Lando Calrissian and the Mindharp of Sharu is a quirky and ill-fitting book when taken in context of the entire Expanded Universe. It hovers between two and three stars for me, but I'm rounding it to three for its sheer novelty value and readability.Lando Calrissian and the Flamewind of Oseon is the second book in the series. It picks up fairly closely on where the first volume left off, with Lando finding that prosperity is not all he dreamed it would be. Seems he and Vuffi Raa made have made some enemies on their way to the top, including a certain nefarious Sorcerer of Tund.Much like the first book, Lando is forced into a mission by mysterious conspirators. This time he and Vuffi must transport two officers of the law through the beautiful but deadly Flamewind of Oseon (a gigantic stellar storm impacting the Oseon system annually) to arrest the richest man in the universe, Bohhuah Mutdah. Of course, all is not as it seems, especially with the mysterious assailants who are stalking our dynamic duo and the fate that awaits them on Mutdah's personal asteroid.Like the first book, Flamewind of Oseon is a short and easy read. There really isn't too much to the plot, as most of the pages are either concerned with setting up the story or simply getting Lando and Vuffi to the asteroid for the final confrontation. Also like the first book, there is virtually nothing to tie this to Star Wars beyond Lando and the Falcon. Smith does attempt a casual link between Rokur Gepta and the Empire, but there's not much to substantiate it.Speaking of Gepta, he must be one of the most stereotypical, virtual-mustache-twirling villains in the Star Wars universe. He is purely EVIL and delights in the destruction he causes. Like a second-rate Bond villain, he also delights in spelling out his EVIL plots to his victims to showcase his incredible cleverness. In a completely ridiculous sequence, he uses his new method of \\"torture-by-chagrin\\" on Lando, which forces the recipient to relive bad memories (but they are enhanced to be much worse). This is just silly.The three books have a large amount of Earth-based terminology sprinkled through them, such as cigarettes, rabbits, and Doppler radar. Of course, Marvel gave us a six-foot tall rabbit in Jaxxon as a main character for a few issues and The Phantom Menace even gave us ducks, but it seems a little too frequent in this book to keep that \\"galaxy far, far away\\" feel.Lando Calrissian and the Flamewind of Oseon is very much like the first book Lando Calrissian and the Mindharp of Sharu in style and feel. Since the novelty value is gone for this volume, I'm giving it the two stars I considered giving to book one.Lando Calrissian and the StarCave of ThonBoka weaves together some of the events and many of the characters of the first two volumes to bring some closure to the story. This volume is the most far-out of the three, involving gigantic vacuum-breathing transparent creatures, kilometers-long droid starships, and a few surprising revelations about our main characters, including Lando's faithful sidekick Vuffi Raa and the malicious Sorcerer of Tund, Rokur Gepta.This third volume is written in the exact style of the first two: large doses of humor, gambling vignettes, Earth-based terminology, and flamboyant dialogue. Lando and Vuffi get in one scrape after another but with all the humor it is hard to feel very concerned. However, Smith does continue to write in a broadly entertaining style and I will admit that this encouraged me to read and digest these three books very quickly. Also like the first two books, this story feels tangentially connected to the Star Wars universe we know at best, although some sources have retconned various aspects of the story into the more familiar modern framework (such as specifying Gepta's role under the Emperor or locating and explaining the Centrality sector of the galaxy).The inhabitants of the titular StarCave are the massive vacuum-breathing Oswaft. An adventurous young Oswaft named Lehesu is befriended by Lando and Vuffi, leading to their involvement when the Empire decides the Oswaft are a potential threat to galactic security. Rokur Gepta has been designated by the Emperor to control fleet operations in this sector, setting up the final conflict between the EVIL Sorcerer and our hero Lando. The plotline from the second volume concerning old fighter pilots from the Renatasian system hunting down Vuffi for vengeance is also resurrected and concluded. Even Ottdefa Osuno Whett resurfaces from Lando Calrissian and the Mindharp of Sharu and is pivotal to the book's climax.My favorite addition to the Expanded Universe to come from this series is Vuffi Raa, the one-meter tall starfish-shaped wunderkind of a droid. His sparring with Lando is amusing, if a bit relentless, and his storyline turns out to be one of the most intriguing parts of the trilogy, especially when his past and purpose are revealed in this book. We'll probably never see another book feature Vuffi in any substantial way, but it would be fun to see him return and play a role somewhere in the post-Return of the Jedi era.The Lando Calrissian Adventures as a whole are a somewhat peculiar and left-field addition to the galaxy far, far away, but it's nice to see a different perspective occasionally and read stories that try for a more light-hearted tone."},{"Title":"STAR WARS: THE LANDO CALRISSIAN ADVENTURES","review":"The Adventures of Lando Calrissian is a compilation of three stories that occur 3+ years before A New Hope. Although they're not the most riveting pieces literature in the Expanded Universe, I did enjoy them. Here are the plots of each.In The Mindharp of Sharu, Lando wins a droid in a sabacc game and has to go to another planet to claim it. The droid he gets is the endearing Vuffi Raa, which you will see in all three stories. While he's there, he gets arrested. In order to get out of it, he must go to a nearby planet to obtain an ancient artifact called the Mindharp of Sharu that numerous people have been unsuccessful at obtaining. Apparently, the Mindharp contains great power. Power that Rokur Gepta, a sorceror from the planet Tund, is anxious to get his hands on. I'll leave it at that so I don't give away the end.In The Flamewind of Oseon, Lando gets in big trouble again in the Oseon system and another shady deal is struck. The Governor of the Oseon System sets up a sting operation on an extremely wealthy denizen of the System who happens to be addicted to a highly illegal drug. He wants Lando to \\"sell\\" the drug to him while two undercovers are at his side during the deal. The problem? He has to fly to another asteroid in the system during the Flamewind. Every year the sun of the system spits out heinous solar flares for a week or so. Although they are very beautiful to watch, they are very dangerous to fly in. They screw up navigational equipment and mess with anything electronic in nature. Usually, nobody flies out of the system during the Flamewind, but Lando has to. Gepta appears in this story again and of course this whole deal was another setup for Lando. But now, Gepta has a personal grudge against Lando because he screwed up his grand plan in the Mindharp of Sharu.In the Starcave of ThonBoka, a new species is discovered called the Oswaft, a gigantic manta ray looking creature that live in outer space and \\"breathe\\" the vacuum of it. They are also capable of traveling at light speed. The entire race live in a nebula they call the ThonBoka, the Starcave to outsiders. The Empire catches wind of this species and automatically feels threatened and decides to destroy all of them. Lando decides to help the Oswaft defend themselves. In the meantime, Gepta is hot on Lando's heels for foiling him twice now.I thought these stories were very fun. I just love Vuffi Raa and Lando has numerous nicknames for it like \\"old can opener\\" and \\"my little gumball machine\\". Lando comes off as rash and sarcastic, but the things he says just made me laugh. In the Mindharp of Sharu, he has a conversation with a hall (as in a building. Yes the building talked.) that was simply hilarious. Now I know these stories aren't Pulitzer Prize material, but if you want to read something light and adventurous, I think you will enjoy them. Don't expect a lot of character development; just a lot of action and adventure. May the Force be with you!"},{"Title":"STAR WARS: THE LANDO CALRISSIAN ADVENTURES","review":"I have always liked Lando, but after reading Shadows of the Empire, I wanted to read more about him. His characterization was really great in that book. Therefore, when I discovered a book about Lando I bought it. I found these adventures about Lando Calrissian a real treat. As for the book, it is really \\"three books in one\\": The first book \\"Lando Calrissian and the The Mindharp of Sharu\\", the second book \\"Lando Calrissian and the Flamewind of Oseon\\" and the third book \\"Lando Calrissian and the Starcave of Thonboka\\". These books were published well over twenty years ago and about 150 pages a piece individually, so now they have been published together in one volume.I have heard some statements saying that these books or adventures really don't give a great deal of background on the rogue that is Lando. Consequently, I would disagree. I feel this book might not produce a lot of history or origins of the character, but does exploit personality traits and behaviors that aren't seen in the movies. For instance, we all know from the classic Star Wars films that Han Solo won the Millennium Falcon from Lando in a card game. However, that card game is called sabaac, which is a lot like Black Jack. Now in this book Lando is a master at sabaac and purposely goes out of his way to play the game. He finds it somewhat cathartic. Lando also has a smooth sense of fashion and makes sure he had a nice pair of clothes on, when in public and in private. He also relies on his brains instead of his brawn. This basically means that he carries a only a small blaster and his street smarts. Also in the beginning of the first story, he just \\"won\\" the Millennium Falcon in a game of sabaac. In addition, he cannot fly the spaceship at all, which is quite a contrast from the final battle in Return of the Jedi. Again, most of these traits aren't seen in the classic Star Wars film.Now I will break down each story in this book.Lando Calrissian and the The Mindharp of Sharu:Lando has just won the Millennium Falcon and is loving life, despite the fact he has a hard time flying it. He is playing a game of sabaac when one of the players \\"slips out\\" some information about a treasure in the Rafa System. In this opening game of sabaac, Lando wins a droid named Vuffi Raa, who I will speak of later. Lando ends up getting involved with a Governor, with questionable standards, and Rokur Gepta, a sorcerer (who I will also go into detail about later) in order to find the Mindharp of Sharu. The Mindharp is a relic of an artifact that is riches to end all riches. However, Lando has to deal with a subservient race of people, life crystals and a planet that has red sand and a green sky.Lando Calrissian and the Flamewind of Oseon:This story finds Lando and Vuffi Raa traveling to the Oseon system. This is a system of thousands of broken asteroids which life forms have inhabited. Lando of course is there to score some credits playing sabaac. He and Vuffi Raa are at the Oseon during the yearly Flamewind. The Flamewind is the release of \\"unknown\\" gases that produces different colors in the skies between the asteroids of the Oseon System. The colors vary from every color in the rainbow. It is almost like fireworks that light up the entire sky. The Flamewind also has a strange side effect, it tampers with spaceships in flight and electronic devises. The entire Flamewind paints a backdrop for a story that involves political scandals, drug deals, Rokur Gepta, a burnt out fleet of soldiers and a narcotic police officer that is a huge orange parrot.Lando Calrissian and the Starcave of Thonboka:This time around, Lando and Vuffi Raa are aiding an alien race of nave, omnipotent, pacifist pseudo manta-ray like aliens; oh these aliens are also transparent. This race is named the Oswaft and is being hunted down again by Rokur Gepta and his navy. Gepta has conjured up a way to destroy the Oswaft, despite this alien race's power and intelligence. Once Gepta finds out that Lando is involved, it is a two for one. Since this is the third book of three, many characters and situations from the two prior books are brought in. This allows for many aspects to be explained and loose ends tied up.Out of the three stories, I enjoyed the Flamewind of Oseon the most; I really liked the story and the backdrop the Flamewind painted. These stories themselves aren't very long, so they are a quick read. However, a little more development in each story wouldn't have been a bad thing. There were some interesting characters and situations that could have been explored a bit more. Consequently, the stories seem to end before they really had a chance to pick up.After reading some other reviews of this book, I have come to an astonishing conclusion. Many Star Wars fans are persnickety and snobs. The most detrimental element to Star Wars can be a Star Wars fan. Allow me to explain, (many) Star Wars fans love the Star Wars universe, but have no problem ripping it apart. For instance, I can't tell you how many \\"Star Wars fans\\" I know that hated every single one of the prequel movies (Episode I, II and III). Yet, these \\"haters\\" are the first in line to buy tickets; they might stand in line for 24 hours just to buy tickets for a movie they know they will already hate. In addition, these same groups of \\"fans\\" use the argument that the newer movies suck when compared to the original trilogy. They also abase George Lucas and call him a sell out and he doesn't care about the true vision of Star Wars. Okay first of all, you can't compare the original movies to the new ones. The original films are classics and no movie maker, even George Lucas, can top the magic of the first three films. This fact doesn't automatically mean the new trilogy is trash or not worthy. As for George Lucas being a sell out and doesn't care about the vision of Star Wars, that is dumb. George Lucas created the world, characters and other varies aspects, so why would he create all this if he didn't care? George Lucas created a prequel trilogy to complete the saga and give the fans a treat and now he is a sell out. If it wasn't for George Lucas, these Star Wars \\"fans\\" would have had no identity growing up. They also wouldn't have really cool IM names like HanSolo_69 or DrYoda1984. I guess they are biting the hand that feeds them. I say get a life, job and a boyfriend/girlfriend.The reason for the former diatribe is this same notion of hating Star Wars becomes very apparent in the reviews of these Lando Calrissian tales. Many people stated that Lando didn't seem like the same guy we all knew from the Star Wars saga. Alright, first of all Lando really wasn't in the movies all that much, so how do we know what Lando was really like? Lando sold out Han Solo to Darth Vader, in order to save his city. Darth Vader put Lando between a rock and a hard place. Therefore Han Solo is captured; Lando feels remorse and redeems himself by aiding in the rescue of Han Solo from Jabba the Hutt. Omitting some smooth dialogue and blowing up the (second) Death Star, that is Lando Calrissian in a nut shell. People are saying about Lando's actions in these stories, \\"I can't imagine Lando doing that!\\" \\"It is so out of character for him to do that.\\" Doing what? Lando didn't kill children, rape woman, abuse animals or wasn't flat out evil in any of these stories. He was and is an adventure, gambler, grifter, astute in humor and looking to make a quick buck/credit. Do any of these former qualities make him an abomination in the Star Wars universe? Or just contribute to the character we already knew?I did really like two of the other supporting characters in the Lando Calrissian adventures, Vuffi Raa and Rokur Gepta. Vuffi Raa is a three foot high starfish shape droid that Lando wins in a sabacca game. He is a very comforting and smart droid and becomes Lando's good friend. There is a nice chemistry between both of these characters and the result is very funny. There is an ongoing joke in all three stories, Vuffi Raa is always calling Lando \\"master\\" and Lando always replies by saying \\"Don't call me master\\".As for Rokur Gepta, he is the villain in all three stories. He is also called the Sorcerer of Tund; I love how Tund sounds just like Tundra, a cold, desolate piece of land which really mirrors the character. He is pretty much the poor man's version of a Sith Lord in these tales. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing at all, I found Rokur Gepta to a very enjoyable character. I do wish there was a bit more development around him, as well as Vuffi Raa. I wouldn't mind reading more about either one of these characters in future Star Wars books. The only familiar faces in these stories are Lando and the Millennium Falcon.This is the sixth Stars Wars book I have read, it could be the ninth if I count all three stories in here as single books. After all, they were originally published as three books in the early 1980s. Anyway, I have discovered that most, if not all Star Wars novels I have read have many of the same aspects: characters/planets/systems/alien races with strange names I have a hard time pronouncing, different cant, technology indigenous to the Star Wars universe and the reader needs to use his/her imagination remembering it is only a book.When I say it is only a book, I am stating that don't let the story destroy the Star Wars saga for you. For instance, I read the Star Wars \\"Bounty Hunter Wars\\" trilogy last year. These books took place in various points in time during Episodes IV, V and VI. Now we all remember from Return of the Jedi/Episode VI that Boba Fett fell into the Sarlacc Pit and was eaten alive. Well in the \\"Bounty Hunter Wars\\", Boba Fett survived the Sarlacc Pit and was again on adventures. For those of you that didn't read those books don't worry anything with regards to plot haven't been spoiled. The only reason I bring it up is because this book can really alter the movies, yet it didn't ruin my experience reading those books, as a matter of fact they were great books. I do wish there was a book out there that explained why Obi-Wan Kenobi took the first name Ben. Why not Barry, Ted or Philip?I digress the Lando Calrissian Adventures is a quick read that is fun and different. These books were written right when Return of the Jedi came out, so the tone of these books isn't the same as the Star Wars books written today. L. Neil Smith used earth terminology when writing this book: cigars, cigarettes, manta-rays, etc. and written style that is different from Star Wars novels written currently. This again doesn't make this a lousy read, just a different approach. As formally noted, I wish L. Neil Smith elaborated more on each of these stories, but it didn't kill the book(s) for me. Besides it is in \\"The Flamewind of Oseon\\" that Lando grows his famous mustache. Overall, these aren't the worst books I ever read, they aren't the best I ever read, but as a non-persnickety Star Wars fan, I found it an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"STAR WARS: THE LANDO CALRISSIAN ADVENTURES","review":"While L. Neil Smith did occasionally use the wrong terms, one must remember that this was one of the early Star Wars books, before all this knowledge was so widely known. This book is one of the best Star Wars books written. The plots are fantastic, but that's what makes them fun. I found everything interesting. This was a strange book to say the least, but it's funny, has intricate connecting plots, and is just fun to read."},{"Title":"STAR WARS: THE LANDO CALRISSIAN ADVENTURES","review":"Mature readers of the Star Wars Expanded Universe will rejoice at the Adventures of Lando, if they haven't read them already. What L. Neil Smith is able to do that the films weren't is flesh out the characterization of Lando. The films weren't able because, after all, they are about Luke Skywalker. The celebrated (or reviled, depending on a certain point of view) Mr. Smith breathes real political life into Lando by making him, for all intents and purposes, a Libertarian. This makes total sense, given that Lando is a gambler and would like to keep his winnings (and in line with the political characterization of Han Solo, who is a cynical mercenary). In his adventures Lando travels to the Centrality where he is taxed, fined, harrassed, threatened, tortured, and nearly killed a number of times. In the process he wins the Falcon, finds a friend (in the 'droid Vuffi Raa, one of the better EU characters), liberates a people, gains a notorious enemy, saves a race and loses the Falcon. The Lando you find here is a good guy: sentimental and lovable, a charming, slightly rougish dandy who sticks his neck out for those in need--and pays for it in spades, so it's no wonder he tries to protect the citizens of Bespin safe from the Empire at the cost of his friendship with Han Solo. But you'll have to read the book. Sadly, there's the inevetable: contrasting with the late 1990's written material will only cause heartache. Remember, these stories were written before the \\"Lucasfim Bible\\" was compiled, so there's lots of Terran words that are a little too familiar. Even so, Lando comes across like an amalgam of James Bond and 1970's Hustler--and it's exceedingly entertaining in a pulpy way, which is what Lucas intended. I always thought Lando got a bum rap as a kid; I always liked him, but now I love the guy...and it's all because of these stories."},{"Title":"STAR WARS: THE LANDO CALRISSIAN ADVENTURES","review":"I decided to read this book because I wanted to know alittle more about the Star Wars universe. It was an ok book. I guess I'm a stickler for the usual shoot'em up type hero, which Lando is not. Lando is the kinda guy who thinks his way out of problems, which happens to just get him in to more problem in The Flamewind of Oseon. The Mind Harp of Sharu was problely the most interesting because it take a lot of sudden turns and leaves you always guessing. But the one I did not care much for was was The Starcave of Thonboka. That was a bit far fetched even for Star Wars. And the thing that hurt this book most of all is that it's villian Gepta of Tund just keeps coming back blaming Lando for his problems. I have to give this book one star for unqiueness, one for the story line, one for the characters, one just because I'm a Star Wars fan; but I have to subtract a star because of the reaquiring villian, the lack of fighting on Lando's part, and the conflicts of his droids programming. Over all I would recommend this book only if you are a die hard fan or you are looking for a book to lull you to sleep at night."},{"Title":"STAR WARS: THE LANDO CALRISSIAN ADVENTURES","review":"This was one of my favorite reads as a young lad. Very inventive trilogy, even a little \\"out there\\" for Star Wars... but gave a great perspective on the diversity of the universe and fleshed out some really fun stories. A+"},{"Title":"STAR WARS: THE LANDO CALRISSIAN ADVENTURES","review":"I've always felt Lando Calrissian never got enough attention in the Star War Expanded Universe. I read this book a while ago and just picked it up to reread it. While not all Star Wars books meet my expectations as an adult, I've found a fair amount of them do. Of the bad ones, this one was one of the worst. Lando is utterly unrecognizable as the debonaire man we knew from Empire Strikes Back. He just wanders around on silly adventures that failed to keep my interest. The side characters are even worse, from a \\"sorcerer\\" as the main villain to a starfish droid sidekick. Sorcerers, really?The one saving grace is that these books introduced Sabaac, the poker of the Star Wars EU. Seeing Lando play the card table was worth a reread. Lando is a natural as a con artist, not as an adventurer That's why I gave the book 2 stars instead of just 1. If for nothing else, we can thank the Lando Adventures and L. Neil Smith for that."},{"Title":"STAR WARS: THE LANDO CALRISSIAN ADVENTURES","review":"As a big Star Wars fan, I found that I both loved and hated this book. I realise it was written in the 1980's, and before the EU was out at that. Mindharp Of Sharu was really hard to get through. I winced at the corny writing, the thin plot, and what today are considered anachronisms in the Star Wars universe. I really groaned when the author threw in the Trix rabbit at a random inapropriate time in Flamewind. What really worked well for this book was the subplots. The concept of the Centrality, Vuffi Raa, the Oswaft, and especially the strange subplot of the Renatasian System made the series redeemable. I would love to see further EU stories expand on these things in future books. I also liked that it was a refreshing look at the Star Wars universe that showed that it got on without the Jedi or Sith involved in absolutely everything."},{"Title":"STAR WARS: THE LANDO CALRISSIAN ADVENTURES","review":"I thought that overall this was a good book. The stories took a little while to get moving but once they did it was fun to read. The writing style seemed a bit dated but that may be because i'm sixteen."},{"Title":"STAR WARS: THE LANDO CALRISSIAN ADVENTURES","review":"The Lando Calrissian Adventures, being one of the set of older Star Wars novels, are often overlooked by both the die-hard, and the wanna-be Star Wars fan alike. Though the three novels don't include most of the tie-ins with the movies and other Star Wars books out there, Lando Calrissian seems to exist mostly in a world of his own, away from most of the other Star wars adventures. I suppose that L. Neil Smith really wanted to create your average science fiction story, without the need for Empires or Jedi. And boy, he did a great job! Instead of the Force, we meet a mysterious sorceror bent on revenge, and a mysterious race of ancient magic users. Instead of the Empire, Smith gives us police and con men out to swindle Lando at every turn. and yes, we can't overlook the casino scenes! Smith writes a casino (sabaac in the Star Wars universe) scene worthy of Ian Fleming himself. The book also contains some of best plot twists I've ever seen in a Star Wars book. And with that on your mind, go enjoy Lando's adventures, both as a Star Wars fan, and a science fiction fan in general."},{"Title":"STAR WARS: THE LANDO CALRISSIAN ADVENTURES","review":"While this is by far not one of the best books in the Star Wars series, it most definatly worth reading if your a die hard fan. These three books shed light on Calrissian and give the reader an idea of what is out side the control of the Empire. If you read The Lando Calrissian Adventures make sure that you read The Han Solo Adventures, your sure to like them even more."},{"Title":"STAR WARS: THE LANDO CALRISSIAN ADVENTURES","review":"Back in the day when there was no massive glut of Star Wars books, you had Splinter of the Mind's Eye, the Han Solo triliogy, and this very little known saga of Lando adventures. While Han was popular enough to keep in print, Lando struggled. I found two of these stories in old bookstores but never the third. That's probably the only good thing about this book. I FINALLY got to read the elusive Lando story. Sadly, these books lack something and I still don't know what it is. Like the one reviewer said above, Grade B Han Solo ripoff adventures. Still though, a must for Star Wars fans, and the stories aren't that bad... not really...not quite... well,....maybe."},{"Title":"STAR WARS: THE LANDO CALRISSIAN ADVENTURES","review":"I think that this book gives you a better feeling as to why Lando Calrissian is the way he is. Reading this book, was no different then reading the otehr Star Wars book. The exception was that Lando was the main character. If you want to read more about what Lando did before he met with Han Solo, read these books."},{"Title":"STAR WARS: THE LANDO CALRISSIAN ADVENTURES","review":"These were some of the original licensed Star Wars books, and were published shortly after Empire Strikes Back was released. Because of this, they have a significantly different view of Lando than has been built through ROTJ and the new novels. This would be forgivable if they were good books otherwise but, unfortunately, they aren't. The plots are mostly hokey, and a lot of the time they seem like bad imitations of Brian Daley's Han Solo trilogy. The exception is the final book, The Starcave of Thonboka. It stands head and shoulders above the other two, and it's almost worth wading through them to get to it. Oh, and they DO have some good Maverick-style Sabacc scenes, showcasing Lando's main skill. They're moderately interesting, but if you haven't read some of the other SW books yet, look elsewhere first"},{"Title":"STAR WARS: THE LANDO CALRISSIAN ADVENTURES","review":"The book is in good shape and I am happy with the amount of time it took to get here. This helps to complete a collection for my son. Thanks."},{"Title":"STAR WARS: THE LANDO CALRISSIAN ADVENTURES","review":"The Lando Calrissian stories contained in this book were wonderful. While the book does have certain &quot;inconsistencies&quot; that are apparent in other early Star Wars books, it does not detract from the stories. If you are sick of the Jedi/Fett/Solo stories that pervade the Star Wars book series and you enjoy the essentially forgotten character of Lando Calrissian, then pick of &quot;The Adventures of Lando Calrissian,&quot; you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"STAR WARS: THE LANDO CALRISSIAN ADVENTURES","review":"I ordered this book without knowing whatsoever to expect. First and foremost the author describes Lando Calrissian with great detail. You get a wide eyed glimpse into the card player, scoundrel with a flair for the finer things in the galaxy. The author explains how Lando comes across the Millineum Falcon. A great deal of effort is spent into describing the other characters of this nuanced novel. There are three books in one. Without giving to much info, please keep in mind that this book came out in the early eighties! So the \\"Star Wars Terminology\\" is not abundantly present here. If you are looking for some good old fashion adventure with the most suave man the galaxy has ever produced, then i implore you to give this book a try. I gurantee you will be pleasantly surprised."},{"Title":"STAR WARS: THE LANDO CALRISSIAN ADVENTURES","review":"Great compilation of three Lando Tales. Fun intergalactic entertainment!Lando Calrissian and the MindHarp of SharuLando just got the Falcon, and has little ability as to how to fly it, you see, this is several years before A New Hope, and Lando is the only character you know of that will be mentioned of in these 3 books. He goes to a system, gets a droid, Vuffi Raa (Don't call me Master) and goes looking for treasure. He makes folks mad at him. This is one of my all-time favorites. The combination of Adventure, mirth, star Wars and Lando himself make this a great book. Read it, and may the Force be with you.Lando Calrissian and the Flamewind of OseonLando gets arrested. His punishment: deliver some goods, though he's not supposed to during the time when the Flamewind is occuring, making it dangerous. He cuts some deals, gets into trouble and gets away. It's good but not the best of the three. Read it anyway.Lando Calrissian and the Starcave at ThonbakaThis is very interesting. Several new concepts are introduced by this book. These creatures that live in vaccuum are very interesting. Lando begins to Learn how to control the Falcon. As You read on it gets better. He even gambles with these creatures. It's throughly well written and I think should be read by all who claim to have seen, heard of, or had anything to do with Star Wars."},{"Title":"STAR WARS: THE LANDO CALRISSIAN ADVENTURES","review":"I definitely feel that this trilogy as an all deserves a full four stars, for, if nothing else, the pure enjoyment I got out of reading it. Isn't that what Star Wars books are for? While the writing style was not as great as many of the others, considering how early on it written, this author made surprisingly few continuity mistakes. How was he to know at this time that the word for a popular stimulative drink in the Star Wars universe is &quot;caf&quot; and not &quot;coffeine&quot;? However, if these small details really bother you, than stay away from this trilogy at all costs. As for the story, some parts of it are silly, but overall Lando was portrayed flawlessly, as was his irritating little companion. So,if you're an experienced Star Wars fan, and have read at least enough of the mainstream books to know the basic storyline, then yeah, these books are fun to read, but if you're just starting out, wait a while on these."},{"Title":"STAR WARS: THE LANDO CALRISSIAN ADVENTURES","review":"The Lando Calrissian adventures is not the best Star Wars book, but its good. In involves Lando and his faithful droid Vuffi Raa, and their struggle against Rokur Gepta, the evil sorceror of tund. Recommended to Star Wars buffs(Like myself)"},{"Title":"STAR WARS: THE LANDO CALRISSIAN ADVENTURES","review":"\\"The Lando Calrissian Adventures\\" is a three-in-one novel. It contains three Star Wars novels featuring Lando Calrissian as a younger man, before the events of \\"Star Wars: A New Hope\\". These three novels are the only place (other than the early Han Solo novels) that we get a sense of who Lando Calrissian is, and how he came to be the man we see in \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\". We get his history here, and some very strange adventures. Lando's adventures in these novels are perhaps the strangest that I have read about in any Star Wars novel, so much so that if the book didn't have the Star Wars logo on the front cover, I wouldn't be sure that it is the same galaxy.The first novel in this collection is \\"Lando Calrissian and the Mindharp of Sharu\\". Lando has only recently acquired the Millenium Falcon, and wins in yet another game of sabacc a droid. The only catch is that Lando has to acquire this droid from a nearby planet. Shortly after arriving Lando is arrested on false charges and is given the option by the governor and an evil sorcerer to either suffer death/lengthy imprisonment, or to locate a mysterious treasure of the lost race of the Sharu. Lando and his new droid, Vuffi Raa, begin their quest to find the mindharp of the lost Sharu, whatever that may be.This novel is followed by \\"Lando Calrissian and the Flamewind of Oseon\\". Lando was very wealthy following the events of \\"Mindharp\\", but poor business dealings and paying bribes has left him with little more than his ship. Being the gambler that he is (it really is his occupation), Lando begins to win back his money on the sabacc table, but he also has to deal with the fact that someone is trying to assassinate him. Being forced to kill a man to defend himself, Lando finds himself back in jail and once again recruited for a crazy mission in exchange for freedom. This time he must navigate the Oseon system during the Flamewind season (think of really nasty solar flares that can seriously mess things up) to work with the police on a sting operation. Rokur Gepta, the Sorcerer from \\"Mindharp\\" makes another appearance, this time with a vendetta against Lando because of how things went during \\"Mindharp\\".The final novel in this collection is \\"Lando Calrissian and the Starcave of ThonBoka\\". This time around Lando discovers a creature in distress called an Oswaft. The Oswaft is a creature that is able to live in the airless outer space, and physically able to make a hyperspace jump. When the Empire learns about these creatures, fearing what they don't know the Empire moves to destroy them. Rokur Geptra makes another appearance, still hunting Lando and working against the Oswaft with his sorcerer's magic. \\"Starcave\\" fully explains the origins of the strange robot Vuffi Raa, and of course features more of Lando playing sabacc.To be honest, these novels are not very good. They might be somewhat better had they not been set in the Star Wars Universe because they don't seem to really fit in with what we know of Star Wars from the movies or from the other novels. They explain Lando fairly well, but L Neil Smith's stories are fairly weak. They are easy reading, and filled with humor, but the level of quality is fairly low. The one exception is Vuffi Raa. This is a fascinating droid and one which I hope appears in future Star Wars novels. Hopefully this isn't out of the question. I cannot recommend this collection, though i'm sure Star Wars completists will need to read this book. For a better look at a younger Lando, read A.C. Crispin's Han Solo books. Lando makes cameo appearances in Crispin's novels and she does a better job telling a good story.-Joe Sherry"},{"Title":"STAR WARS: THE LANDO CALRISSIAN ADVENTURES","review":"Smith gives us an interesting look into the charming gambler's past with a humorous writing style (watch of the puns on things such as Rose's Lime Juice). Worth a read."},{"Title":"STAR WARS: THE LANDO CALRISSIAN ADVENTURES","review":"This is a very entertaining novel, actually a collection of three shorter, yet continuous novels. Be advised however that it is Star Wars in name only.In the overall SW timeline, Lando's adventures take place years before Episode III, when the Empire ruled unopposed and Han Solo was a teenager. None of this really matters though: true, the hero is Lando (who's character is rendered beatifully) and in a couple of instances vague referrences to the &quot;old Republic&quot;, the &quot;Empire&quot; and the &quot;Emperor&quot; are made; but, other than that, the story's only connection to the SW universe is to feature Vuffi Raa, a character that appears once or twice in the Han Solo Adventures.Identity crises notwithstanding, this was one of the best written sci-fi books I 've read in a long while. L. Neil Smith has created some intresting villains and even more imaginative locales to backdrop his stories; even better, having freed himself from the most soap-operaish of SW constraints, he has constructed a number of very captivating, large scale scenarios, both in size and complexity. [it's hard to explain without giving it away!]If you are Star Wars enthousiast, this is definatelly a collectible, but not necessary piece of the bigger puzzle.However, if you are a sci-fi fan at large, you will definatelly enjoy this book."},{"Title":"STAR WARS: THE LANDO CALRISSIAN ADVENTURES","review":"This is kind of a weak book. The plots were generally bad, the writing was slow, tedious, and missed the point of Lando. I disliked Vuffi Raa because the thought of the all powerful alien droid decided to team up with a smuggler (or allow himself to be won in a sabbac game like property) is ridiculous. The stories took too long to set up and get into, the threatening aspect was never really there, and what was up with the Imperial master mind? Was he an Imperial Moff, a Dark Jedi, or some stupid ignoramous in between?"},{"Title":"STAR WARS: THE LANDO CALRISSIAN ADVENTURES","review":"My son collects this series and has just about every one that comes out. I love going to his Amazon WishList to find which ones he hasn't received yet. It makes buying for his birthday and Christmas and other holidays so easy.

Even on the ones coming from individuals, I have never had a problem receiving them in a timely manner so far. Thanks Amazon!"},{"Title":"Home Building Pitfalls","review":"Our new house is nearly complete and we used the book to guide us through the entire process. The book is laid out logically and very well mirrored our experience. The most helpful information came from the chapters informing us of the missteps that can be made before construction even begins, especially from a legal standpoint. Even though we used a reputable builder, we still had several occasions where our sales person and the construction supervisor tried to pull \\"fast ones\\" on us.You can tell the author knows his stuff. The real life examples of other people's mistakes clearly reinforce the reasoning behind the advice he offers.The only thing lacking was illustrations, but they weren't really necessary. I thought the book served its purpose well and kept our builder honest."},{"Title":"Home Building Pitfalls","review":"I should have read this BEFORE I bought my house...

This work is a more detailed and in depth version of &quot;Theology for Beginners&quot; but a must read even for those who have read the &quot;lighter&quot; version. In fact start with &quot;Theology for Beginners&quot; and then read &quot;Theology and Sanity.&quot;I have read innumerable books on theology with an emphasis, but not exclusivity, on christianity. And this book explains with clear and beautiful reasoning the christian faith. You will not find a clearer yet amazingly comprehensive explaination of the Holy Trinity. If you think the 'triangle analogy' is a good model, you will forever look back on it as a simple 2-dimensional representation, with usefullness to be sure, but without life. Mr. Sheed brings the Trinity to Life!Ever wondered how Christians have come to believe in Heaven, Hell, Angels and the Devil through scripture? Ever doubted that you could come to a rational belief of those concepts using logic, through combining philosophy and theology? Rejoice becuase Mr. Sheed reconciles both of those for you, beautifully and clearly.By the end of this book you will understand why viewing life without a belief in God is insanity and why believing in God is having clear and sane thought. Do yourself, your soul and your spirit a favor. Read this man's works."},{"Title":"Theology and sanity","review":"In an age where philosophy, academia, and society hold religious belief as subrational, Frank Sheed shines as a beacon for those who desire to begin the grave and joyous journey of reconciling faith with reason. His explainations of Catholic theology and the metaphysical realities it upholds prove to be some of the clearest of our time. His explaination of how those realities are translated into practical application,(morality), prove equally lucid. His embarkation into the mystery of the Holy Trinity leaves one with much to meditate upon. I highly recommend this book for anyone seeking to understand their Catholic faith. Only a minimum understanding of the Catholic faith is required to follow the author through some of the most complex teachings of the Church. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Theology and sanity","review":"Sheed does a fine job here of concisely presenting the entire Catholic worldview in a single volume. His explanation of difficult philosophical and theological concepts (i.e. the Trinity) is done in a manner that can be easily understood by those with less expertise in these areas. This book is really a valuable piece, and should be on the bookshelves and in the minds of all Catholics."},{"Title":"Theology and sanity","review":"Unlike the previous reviewer, Sheed never lost me, in the beginning or anywhere else. This is, admittedly, the Catholic view of the universe and I don't think Sheed intended it to be anything else. As such, it is much more an exposition and explanation of that view than a defense against various competing views, although there is some of that. So, if you are looking for defenses of the Catholic Christian faith against Buddhism, Islam, Judaism or even specifically contrasted to some Protestant beliefs, you won't find it done here explicitly. If you are a Catholic or are interested in learning more about how this magnificent religion views God and creation, there is no finer introductory work (although Sheed's Theology for Beginners is on the same par as Theology and Sanity, just shorter). I have now read four of Sheed's works and intend to read everything of his I can get my hands on. Two other points: 1. For the Catholic Church's thoughts on other religions, see the Catechism or the Pope's speech Dialogue with Great World Religions on May 19, 1999, or his Encyclical Fides et Ratio for starters, all available on-line. 2. For books on the Catholic argument for the teaching authority of the Church see Jesus, Peter, and the Keys, among many others."},{"Title":"Theology and sanity","review":"I am a professor of theology at a Catholic university, and I find myself going back to Frank Sheed for help in expressing the depths of the faith in accessible language. I read Sheed and found him extremely helpful when I was a teenager, and now after years of graduate work in Theology I see MORE depth in Sheed's work than before and I marvel that he is able to express the faith so simply without compromising the nuances that a trained theologian would like to see. Absolutely the best intro to Theology for highschool ages and up."},{"Title":"Theology and sanity","review":"Ever wondered what catholics really believe? Why they havesome strange views &amp; practices? Written by a field-testedapologist, Theology and Sanity sets out in layman's terms a marvellously clear view of catholic theology. The title summarises the author's view that insanity is failing to see what IS -- and proceeds to describe what it is the catholic church SEES in its theological schema (ie just who and what are God, Jesus, apostles, Mary, angels, saints, pope, bishops - &amp; theological underpinnings for catholic morality and practice) . Sheed's lucid descriptions are exceeded only by his wonderful prose. Highly recommended to both catholics and non-catholics. Companion volume: Society and Sanity -- an equally well-written exposition of catholic anthropology and sociology. Will be seen by some as somewhat dated, the core truths nevethless shine forth brilliantly."},{"Title":"Theology and sanity","review":"Well, ok, unless you want to go to the real compendium of the Catholic Faith: The Summa Theologica of Saint Thomas Aquinas. Otherwise, this is it. Look no further. Sheed's Theology and Sanity is a masterful, deep yet accessible summary of the mystery of creation, its fall and redemption by the Divine Redeemer.The book covers all the essential aspects of the Catholic Faith and it makes for one of the best Adult Catechisms, Chistian Apologetics and theology books ever written. The reason for its greatness is that this is a book written with the love of a man of great faith and born out of love. Every sentence in the book was tested over 50 years of street corner preaching by its author to crowds not always in agreement with him. And this is the key to this book's clarity: it has been tested by time, the love of its author for the True Faith and his genuine desire to help others make sense out of the Catholic Faith and man's long relationship with God. In reading the book one finds the Faith as beautiful and merciful as the author himself obviously did.Some of the concepts such as the doctrine of the Trinity are difficult to grasp, but their study is by no means impossible and remain enormously rewarding to the mind. If you have never taken theology or philosophy before you may want to start with Theology for Beginners, also by Sheed; otherwise, look no further than this book. Like many reviewers, I had not covered 3 chapters before I decided to read it a second time as soon as finished in order to drink deeper from this fountain of Truth. How much better would the Church be if this book was more widely used in Seminaries, Universities and Schools!Those who upon reading this book find it \\"authoritarian\\", as some reviewers do, miss the point and prove their \\"insanity\\": Sheed properly sets Truth before \\"charity\\", as his concern is with explaining the mystery of the True Faith the way it is, come what may; thereby showing objective sanity, rather than subjective insanity (i.e. making the world an image of one's subjective self) -- This is not another experiment in a zoo of faiths. This is intellect seeking understanding and illumined by Faith above all. It is precisely that understanding that gives intellect its sanity, and it is that grandiose vision and comprehension that is the seed of all love. How can we love what we do not understand? It should be noted that in the Trinity, the Spirit (Love) proceeds from the Son (Word - Truth) and not the other way round. To set charity before Truth is to reverse and falsify the Trinity, and falsity belongs not to God but to the father of lies. We live in insane times. In times where man sacrifices truth every day to a false sense of \\"tolerance\\" for error and calls this \\"love\\". Charity requires Truth in order to be truly Love, and one can hardly love his fellow man if he is not truthful to him. Read this book, it will set your record straight and help you on your road back to sanity."},{"Title":"Theology and sanity","review":"i have read and reread this book four times. Unfortunately i gave this book to a friend.I am reordering it again now. It has the clearest explanation of the Trinity that i have ever read.I guarantee that you will not be dissapointed with this purchase."},{"Title":"Theology and sanity","review":"Frank Sheed's \\"Theology and Sanity\\" is a classic work of Catholic apologetics. The book is a distillation of core Catholic teaching, which comes down to actions of three beings(God, Adam, and Jesus) and four events (Creation, the Fall, Redemption, and Judgement), and the implications that these beings and actions have on Catholics' perception of reality. Sheed believes that without understanding the basic theology behind these beings and actions, that individuals have a limited ability to make sane decisions, because they are not making decisions based on the full reality of life.The chapters in which he defines the Trinity, are worth the proice of the book alone; never have I have such a full comprehension of this doctrine or understood the smenatics implied when Christians pray and invoke any or all of the three Persons. His chapters on Christ ignited in me a greater desire to read all that is written about Jesus, as well as made me more sensitive to dynamics behind his actions in the Bible.The book is written in a style that is simple and accessible, yet still erudite. I recommend this book to all Catholics who want to understand better the concepts with which they grew up. All Christians may benefit from reading the book as a whole, but I don't think it is the type of book to convert people who are opposed to Catholic teaching. Sheed uses scripture extensively to support dotrine presented in some chapters but does not implement this approach with all chapters, which might lead people who are not familiar with the history of the teachings presented to question \\"where in the Bible it says that,\\" though all doctrines are supported by the Bible, this is not a Bible study (but Sheed recommends that people reading the bok combine its study with a simultaneous study of the Gospels). It is a summary of Catholic beliefs about main events and actors in the history of the Christian Church. There is less stress on proving that the beliefs are valid, and a greater emphasis is on articulating the basic interpretation."},{"Title":"Theology and sanity","review":"Frank Sheed, in his wonderful volume THEOLOGY AND SANITY, writes at length upon theological topics which are meant to make a man see the world through the eyes of the Church. Various topics, such as the nature of the Trinity and the Fall of Man, are wonderfully discussed in a few short pages.Frank Sheed writes in his simplistic style that does not water-down Catholic theology, nor does it present it as something incomprehensible to untrained theologians. Using non-theological terms, Sheed works through many aspects of Catholic theology. A wonderful volume that can be knocked out in a couple of weeks."},{"Title":"Theology and sanity","review":"Frank Sheed is a great Catholic Theologian. Between this and his book \\"Theology for Beginners\\" a person can get a really good idea as to what Catholics believe and how it fits into our daily lives.

In addition, he explains why the Catholic view is the only one that makes sense-- hence the &quot;Sanity&quot; in the title.The book is a bit boring at times, but this is probably done so that he will not lose people.Overall an excellent book. If you are interesting in learning a little about theology, I would read this book."},{"Title":"Theology and sanity","review":"Sheed lost me near the beginning of the book, when he defined sanity as &quot;seeing things the way the Church does.&quot; The entire book is an explanation of how the Church sees things - a kindly explanation, to be sure, but backed by the assumption that the reader needs to understand and accept these explanations to be &quot;sane.&quot;Add a little temporal power, change the name of the institution to &quot;the Soviet Union,&quot; and you have the recipe for a story like Alexandr Solzhenitsyn's &quot;Cancer Ward,&quot; in which anyone who dissents is automatically assumed insane with dire consequences.I kept returning to the book, because the prior reviews speak so highly of it and because I am interested in both sanity and theology (I almost wonder whether I read the same book). But the author repelled me, despite his friendly tone; he assumes that Catholics have nothing to learn from other religions, and he states that in spite of the large number of corrupt popes, the Church has never taught anything false. I wonder what he would make of John Paul II's apologies to the Jewish people.This is kindly authoritarian Catholicism: &quot;the Church is right, submit to it.&quot; It's not unthinking, because Sheed is very interested in people thinking well. But I think today's freedom of denominational movement would perplex him: this book works well for Catholics who are born into it and for whom the option of leaving the Church is unthinkable. For today's Catholics, many of whom returned after experiments in evangelism, eastern religions or paganism, it's probably pretty unhelpful.Since Vatican II, the Church's position has been more authoritative than authoritarian: &quot;here is why the Church's teaching is correct.&quot; I find this mode much more interesting and helpful than the authoritarian one; I would give John Paul II's encyclicals, particularly Fide et Ratio and Veritatis Splendor, as excellent examples."},{"Title":"Theology and sanity","review":"I got this book several months ago and have now read it twice. I have also read three of Sheed's other books (Theology for Beginners, To Know Christ Jesus and A Map of Life), and they are also wonderful. Thanks to Sheed, I finally understand my faith! Please see the other 5 star reviews below for more detail."},{"Title":"Theology and sanity","review":"Reading Theology and Sanity is like reading C.S.Lewis, G.K.Chesterton,Pascal, Aquinas, Augustine, Kreeft,Schumacker combined to make a magisterial simple, yet not simplistic volume of essential theology. Every thinker can not afford to miss the joy that comes as a result of reading Sheed's work. It is utterly stunning. Protestants and Catholics alike may have a taste of what C.S. Lewis called:The serious business of heaven, namely, Joy. Sheed is one of my giants....thank God for himDavid Valencia"},{"Title":"Theology and sanity","review":"The late Frank Sheed (a Roman Catholic from Australia) wrote this book in the 1940s during the pontificate of Pope Pius XII. It was later republished by Ignatius Press and remains one of the most essential and unforgetable Catholic books in America.He talks greatly about free will, the creation of Man, the test of Angels and Men, the difference between free will and predestination (the Protestant Calvinist notion), the Sacrifice of the Mass, and more importantly---WHO IS GOD?I love it because it is a great in depth book of understanding Catholic Theology. The Scripture quotations are from the Douay Rheims Bible and the Revised Standard Version: Catholic Edition.I recommend this book for all Catholics and non-Catholics as well. It was one of the best textbooks I used for catechism class in my parish church."},{"Title":"Theology and sanity","review":"This is the most comprehensive overview I have read regarding the overall Catholic philosophy. If you are not Catholic, you may be offended by the basic assertion that the Catholic view of the cosmos is the sane view. If you are Catholic, you will be rewarded with a thorough, precise description of Catholic world view. For this purpose, this book is even better than the Catechism."},{"Title":"Theology and sanity","review":"Frank Sheed will coax you along to have a much clearer understanding of where you are in relation to God, and what is known about the mystery of that relationship."},{"Title":"Theology and sanity","review":"Excellent, reasoned defense of Christianity and the Catholic faith. This apologetic is a classic, a must read for an informed Christian. Much easier to read than Chesterton, this book reminds me of C.S. Lewis in practical writing, with a more in depth examination of theology."},{"Title":"Theology and sanity","review":"I don't want to bore any reader with a lot of commentary; others here have praised this book and sufficiently wet the appetite, I hope, of potential buyers. Let me add only that this is probably among the best five books I have ever read in my 66 years on earth. I read a lot, usually between six and eight books a month since I was in my early teens. Sheen was a post-Vatican II layman before his time. He wrote Theology and Sanity in 1946, back when many thought that only the clergy were sufficiently instructed to write intelligently about theology. If you are Catholic, this book will strengthen your faith and inform you concerning many things you don't yet know(unless, of course, you are already a theologian). If you are Protestant, it will make you want to explore those aspects of Christ's teachings subtracted from the whole by 16th century revolutionists. If you are a non-believer, the book will make you decidedly uncomfortable, but you of all people should read it for that very reason."},{"Title":"Theology and sanity","review":"This was a wonderful book; one that I needed to read given my questions concerning God and His role in our lives. I also needed to read this book to determine how it is that the Church continues to spread the word of God given that the Church is organized and run by man. Man, inherently, because of the fall of Adam, is prone to sin. So how is it that the Church, run by man, who is prone to sin, can be the one organization to espouse the \\"truth\\" of God and His Son, Jesus?The first aspect of this book that I really enjoyed was that Father Sheed takes some very complicated topics and puts them into plain English so that the lay person can understand them. Father Sheed's explanation of the trinity, one of the most complicated aspects of the Catholic Religion (in my opinion), was explained in a most wonderful way. It was explained so that I could understand it and without all the \\"religious\\" terminology that usually accompanies such explanations.The second aspect of the book that I enjoyed was the organization. He takes these issues from step one and then logically continues with the book up to the end. He takes the prior steps and incorporates them into later steps and wonderfully demonstrates how they all fit together.The third aspect of this book I loved was the explanation of why Jesus \\"lowered\\" himself to human form. Father Sheed had a wonderful way of explaining why is it was that Jesus came to do what he did. He ties this in with the fall of Adam and how the fall of Adam severed our relationship with God. Father Sheed also explains what \\"original sin\\" is and why we have it. It is not that the person born has sinned but has the sin of Adam just because we are human. Because of the fall, man was severed with God but Jesus came to \\"bridge\\" that gap and that is what he did.Do not get the idea that the \\"sanity\\" part of the book title means that if you don't live the Catholic Way perfectly that one is insane. This is not what that term means in the context of the book. Sanity means seeing the world as it really is; not deceiving ourselves that the world is differnt that it really is. If we can do that, then we are seeing things correctly and have \\"sanity\\". However, not seeing the world and God as they truly are does not mean you are insane, in the mental aspect of the word. Father Sheed gives us a good idea what it means to not see things as they really are and how to change that in our lives.This is a wonderful book. However, this did take me a long time to read. Father Sheed has much to say and it is all something that you must think about to fully understand what he is saying. You cannot read this book like a fiction novel; you can't or you will miss much of what Fr. Sheed is saying. It will take time but the time is well worth it.I have already purchased two more of Fr. Sheed's books and I look forward to reading them.If you have an interest in learning more about the Catholic, or even just the Christian faith in plain English, then I cannot recommend this book highly enough. It certainly has helped me along in my own search on God and the role He plays in our lives.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Theology and sanity","review":"Helps one discern what \\"is\\" is. Bill Clinton needs to read this along with most of our university professors."},{"Title":"Theology and sanity","review":"Haven't finished the whole thing quite yet, but I'm very impressed by the book! It takes a very logical approach through theology and attends to many vital fundamental issues. If I could make one criticism, it's that Sheed seems to assume a certain amount of theological background at some times, but then later proceeds to discuss (in detail) things that such a background would presumably already contain. That's nit-picking to the max, though.Once again: great read, great theology, great stuff overall. While I'm reading it, I feel like every qualm I have is addressed and resolved almost immediately.Would recommend to anyone!"},{"Title":"Theology and sanity","review":"This book is intended for those who are practicing or non practicing Catholics. Sheed does a great job showing how the world's perspective has invaded our minds willingly or unwillingly and if we desire to grow in our faith we must not only have a Catholic will but also a Catholic intellect. The \\"both and\\" theme that is a common theme in theology is implied and put to practical use in this book. Most Catholics in the pews and unfortunately even in the pulpits are not always expressing an authentic Catholic perspective on the Church's teachings because of a combination of ignorance,sloth and weak faith. I am one of these slothful catholics that can attest to this reality that we need to hunger and thirst to truly know and love our Holy Mother Church as she reveals to us the infinite love of God. Although God has given us all of these lights and \\"graces to know Him and love Him we have not sought Him or meditated on the realities He reveals to us through His beloved Bride. Reading this book has deepened my love and knowledge of God as I try to meditate on trying to see the world through the eyes of Holy Mother Church. God created me and keeps me in existence even as I live only that I might seek,know,love and serve Him. I am currently in the seminary studying to be a catholic priest and give thanks and praise to God for helping me to mature in my faith that I may become another Christ through Mary.May God give me light that I may understand,love and accept the tenets of my Catholic faith that He reveals to me through Holy Mother Church.\\"At that time Jesus said, \\"I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children.Matthew 11:25"},{"Title":"Theology and sanity","review":"Catechesis, dogma, spirituality, and everything you've forgotten or received a poor explanation about is covered here in easy to read English."},{"Title":"Theology and sanity","review":"This book by Frank Sheed reminds us that our faith consists of not just emotionalism or sentiment, but must include our intellect as well. To think otherwise is-- well, insanity. No one can say it quite like Sheed, and if you've liked his other works, you'll like this as well. If you've never read Sheed, give him a try. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Theology and sanity","review":"I learned so much from this book. It is not only a great apologetic for the Catholic faith, but it also emerges you in theology. Definitely some of the best exposition of the trinity I've ever read. A must read for anyone interested in anything!"},{"Title":"Theology and sanity","review":"This is an excellent and engaging book. In the author's own words this is a book about seeing the universe the way the Church sees it because that is reality, and seeing reality is sanity. Seeing the world in any other way is not reality, and therefore insane. As a very early example Sheed writes,\\"...she [the Church] sees all things whatsoever held in existence from moment to moment by nothing but the continuing will of God that they should not cease to be. When she sees anything at all, in the same act she sees God holding it in existence. Do we? It is not merely a matter of knowing that this is so. Do we actually see it so? If we do not, then we are not living mentally in the same world as the Church. What is more, we are not seeing things as they are, for that is how they are.\\"Sheed's writing has a very academic tone to it. In fact he states up front that he is writing about the intellect, not the will. He is clear that salvation depends directly on the will, not the intellect, but at the same time he emphasizes that neglecting the intellect is to our own great disadvantage. In Sheed's own words,\\"But knowledge of the truth matters all the same. It matters for the reason we have already stated, namely, that every new thing known about God is a new reason for loving Him. It matters also...[because] in the appallingly difficult struggle to be good, the will is helped immeasurably by the intellect's clear vision of the real Universe.\\"and,\\"After all, the man who uses his intellect in religion is using it to see what is there. But the alternative to seeing what is there is either not seeing what is there, and this is darkness; or seeing what is not there, and this is error, derangement, a kind of double darkness. And it is unthinkable that darkness whether double or single should be preferred to light.\\"The academic tone to the book will definitely appeal to those who are more intellectually oriented, but the book is much more than pure academics. Sheed spent many years as a street minister and this comes through in the book, making each point hit home personally in one's own life.The book is written in three main parts: God, Creation, and Oneself. And within these three sections the author covers the whole gamut of the Catholic faith including: Thomistic proofs of God's existence, the mystery of the Trinity, God's creation of man, God's personal relationship with man, the life of Jesus Christ, the Church as the body of Christ, the sacraments, the human condition as viewed by the Church, heaven, angels, sanctifying grace, and so much more. In short it is an exceptionally good overview of what the Catholic church is about and how it sees the world.There are a few things one might want to be aware of before choosing or starting to read this book. First, as I've already mentioned, sometimes Sheed's writing, can have an academic air about it that might turn some people off. Many will appreciate the academic tone, but Sheed's passion for the intellect may at times be a little overbearing and rub some people the wrong way. If this is the case for you, try not to let it distract you too much. What Sheed has to say is excellent regardless.In the same way, with Sheed's passion for the intellect, sometimes his writing is not the easiest to read. For the most part his writing is very clear, but sometimes it can be just a little difficult to follow. I mention this simply because I would hate to see someone start the book and then stop reading it because it was more difficult to read than they expected. It is better to know up front that it might be a little difficult in spots, and be determined to push through it, than to give up entirely.Finally, the book was written in 1946 and updated in 1978, so some things may feel a bit dated. Again, I point this out simply so that one does not begin the book only to give up on it because it \\"sounds too old.\\" On the whole, everything Sheed has to say is just as relevant now as it was then.In summary, through a mix of theology and ministry this book provides an exceptionally good overview of how the Catholic church sees the world and what that means for us in our personal lives."},{"Title":"Theology and sanity","review":"This book provides wonderful insights into what Catholics believe, with supporting arguments and justification. If you have ever been at a loss to explain your faith, you should read this book. It's written for lay people, not religious scholars, so it's pretty easy to understand."},{"Title":"Theology and sanity","review":"This book opened my eyes to things I had thought about or pondered for over a decade. Multiple issues were presented concisely, simply, informatively, and in depth, all at the same time: Amazing!

If you think you know your faith, read this and learn you know very little (the section on the TRINITY ALONE IS WORTH IT)If you know little about your faith, this will teach and bolster a new love for the faith and drive you to want to learn move.

She controls servants and men-at-arms with fairness and firmness. She manages accounts and metes out justice with authority and with an even hand. Yet, she is a good-humored, gentle, biddable beauty who loves her BIG dog Brian--given to her by a longtime friend Geoffrey Fitzwilliam.The men who ride with Joanna as she tends to business at all the family holdings, have a high regard for her and protect her at all cost. She goes about her business without fear, but she does fear the tender love of a man. She does not want to suffer like her mother and her friend Ela do when their much-loved husbands go to war. Joanna vows to wed a good friend and companion but NOT to fall in love. This is a strong theme throughout the story.Geoffrey Fitswilliam, bastard son of William of Salisbury King John's brother, is hated by the king and Queen Isabella. They never cease looking for ways to hurt or even kill him. Well-trained in the ways of war by Ian who is Joanna's stepfather, Geoffrey serves the king with his abilities even though neither he nor Ian believe in what the king is doing to his subjects. When the king sends him to subdue the people of Wales with whom he has close ties, Geoffrey is hard pressed to stay faithful.While many noblemen hate the King's overbearing ways and his break with the church, they feel \\"However your head hurts you, it is better to keep it than to have it chopped off\\". They fear their country will fall apart if King John is deposed, so they do his bidding and thread an uneasy path.Secondary characters and how they influence Joanna and Geoffrey's lives keep an undercurrent of turmoil bubbling. Henry Braybrook, the queen's lackey tries his best to compromise Joanna and gets outfoxed time and again. When it seems he will finally succeed Brian, the BIG dog, comes along and plays havoc with the plan (a delightful bit of comic relief).How the people cope with horrific wars, the London fire of 1212, and the court conspiracies adds many sub-plots to Joanna and Geoffrey's story. The war scenes, the court scenes, and the king's conflict with the church overshadow their beautiful love story at times. I found myself skimming to get back to them. Roberta Gellis creates wonderful scenes showing how both of these young people handle responsibility while all the time maturing emotionally. She helps the reader share Joanna's and Geoffrey's inmost thoughts in a memorable way. These two strong characters truly make a \\"hero's journey\\". Their tenacity, loyalty, and unfailing efforts to make a safe and better life for all make Joanna compelling.Originally posted at The Long and Short of It Romance Reviews"},{"Title":"Joanna (The Roselynde Chronicles, Book 3)","review":"I read this when it was first published, but it does not read like an old, dated book.

Start at the beginning with Roselynde. I don't usually do series books but these were the best I've read in a long time."},{"Title":"Joanna (The Roselynde Chronicles, Book 3)","review":"\\"Joanna\\" is Book Three in Roberta Gellis' marvelous \\"Roselynde Chronicles.\\" As with all the individual novels that make up the series, this one stands alone, on its own merit. The novels actually do chronicle history, with meticulous accuracy, so it is helpful to read the books in sequence to understand the politics and reigns of each king. The characters are so richly drawn, even the minor ones, that it is an added touch to watch them grow and mature with every new book.The story opens during the reign of King John. The treacherous, cruel King has taxed his people heavily; there is political intrigue and moral laxity at court; international problems with the French, Welsh, and Irish bode ill for England's security; and the barons are unhappy with their monarch. The Church is unhappy with John also. He has tried to take control of the Church through his choice for the archbishop of Canterbury, and has been seizing Church revenues for the Crown. The Pope has excommunicated him.Joanna, Alinor of Roselynde's teenage daughter, has consented to a betrothal with Sir Geoffrey Fitzwilliam, her stepfather's squire of old, who is now a landed knight and budding warrior. He is also the illegitimate son of the King's half brother, and so has royal Plantagenet blood. Alinor and her husband Ian, leave for Ireland to assist the Earl of Pembroke in keeping the peace. They place 20 year old Geoffrey in charge of their vassals in case of war with the Welsh, knowing that Geoffrey's father will back him up if necessary. Joanna is to take charge of their land holdings. Like her mother, Joanna is literate, independent, and trained to care for her people and land, making difficult decisions when needed. Her temperament is less volatile than her mothers and she keeps her feeling to herself. Although she is pleased with her betrothed, who she has known since childhood, she is afraid to love. She has seen war, suffering and loss, including the death of her beloved father some years before. Joanna is a courageous young woman, but fears to lose her heart to Geoffrey, and hopes for a steady, companionable relationship, no more.As Joanna's and Geoffrey's relationship changes, so does the political climate in England. There are more storms than fair days here, however. A hard war begins with Wales. The Pope absolves all men from their fealty to King John. Philip of France now holds Normandy, which belongs to John. And the King, and Isabella, his Queen, conspire against Geoffrey and Joanna.Ms. Gellis takes us on an incredible journey through the King's court, medieval keeps, sieges and battles for life, land and honor, the horrific fire that devastated London in 1212, the signing of the Magna Carta by King John at Runnymede and his repudiation of the charter later. Civil War tears the country apart and King Philip invades England with mercenaries. This is exciting stuff!Joanna and Geoffrey love, marry and are separated by the many events that impact the country. Joanna, at one point must travel, during the war with the French, to rescue her husband who is near death.I liked this book very much, to say the least. However, it does not merit the five stars I gave the first two books in the series. Because of the turmoil of John's reign, the many problems are reflected in the relationship between the two main characters. While this is realistic, it was difficult to read about depressing times and depressed people. But, hey! Four stars is very good!JANA"},{"Title":"Joanna (The Roselynde Chronicles, Book 3)","review":"Do not let the cheesy 70's cover fool you; this is solid historical fiction and not a mindless bodice ripping romance. Joanna is the daughter of Alinor of Roselynde and heiress to her mother's great landholdings. Her mother and step-father, Ian de Vipont want to betroth Joanna to Geoffrey Fitzwilliam who is the illegitimate son of King John's half brother William Salisbury. As Joanna and Geoffrey are called to court, they are caught up in the prevalent intrigues and corruption of John's court. King John's wife Isabella hates Geoffrey and his father and schemes to have Joanna seduced at court to cause embarrassment to Geoffrey.Joanna and Geoffrey are afraid to admit their feelings for each other, even as the attraction burns between them. They have many ups and downs and misunderstandings and separations as John battles the Welsh, infuriates his barons into rebellion, his attempts to recapture Normandy to the signing of the Magna Carta. As I said previously, this is not a light fluffy romance; a large part of the book is taken up meticulously recounting the history of John and his court, and may be a dry reading for some. However, if you are a fan of historical fiction, particularly Medieval, with a good romance thrown into the package this is worth your while if you can get your hands on a copy. The prices for this used paperback are a bit steep, but I shopped around and found one quite a bit less than listed here."},{"Title":"Joanna (The Roselynde Chronicles, Book 3)","review":"&quot;Joanna&quot; is the 3rd book in the &quot;Roselynde Chronicles&quot; and while it may not be as riveting as the first 2, it is an excellent read nonetheless.

We become more familiar with Geoffrey's history and family, and are entertained once more with the very captivating story of Alinor, who is all a woman should be and then some.

The series was recently released in ebook format so I am enjoying the chance to revisit some old favorites.'Joanna' is problematic for me. Usually Gellis's accurate historical detail and events is her greatest strength, giving strong context for her characters' actions and emotion and immersing the reader in another world. in 'Joanna,' however, context has trumped character, with the protagonists reduced to pawns swept along in an interminable succession of events.This begins early as Alinor, Joanna's mother, describes Joanna as controlled and 'passive,' despite her 'flaming red hair' that signifies her passionate nature hidden deep inside. This gives us a protagonist who is often a recipient rather than an initiator of events and is frequently silent rather than taking part in discussions. We spend too much time inside Joanna's head with her ruminations. This does not make for a warm, appealing or even very interesting heroine.The characterization of Lord Geoffrey is also unusually difficult for a Gellis protagonist. This is Ian's squire from 'Alinor' grown up, but he is no longer the winsome, self-possessed young man we grew to love. In 'Joanna,' Geoffrey does a lot of 'snarling,' frequently at Joanna. Though we are assured Geoffrey loves Joanna, he spends every night whoring, Gellis saying he does it out of frustrated desire during their lengthy betrothal.That may (or may not) be common behavior for the time, and Gellis has Joanna aware of it and not caring as long as these are common whores, not mistresses, and takes place before they are married. All the same, it is a disturbing break in logic for Gellis to condemn King John as a lecherous beast then have Geoffrey engage in essentially the same behavior. It is particularly unattractive in a work of popular fiction for a largely female readership. Geoffrey's sexual exploits are not in any way important to the plot. All it does is make me dislike him.And 'Joanna' feels overlong. Though it is roughly the same length as 'Alinor,' and only slightly longer than 'Roselynde,' the characters slog through an interminable series of events without any real goal in sight. In the first two books in the series, Gellis was able to filter the chaotic history of the times through the needs of her protagonists to create plots with specific goals and logical ending points. 'Joanna' lacks this clarity.Yes, England has a king running amok and an on-again, off-again war with France, but this is a work of fiction set in that era, not a textbook. What really is the plot here? What specifically do Joanna and Geoffrey want and what is stopping them? If we knew that, then we could enjoy the events as stages along the road to plot resolution and fulfillment instead of just more pages to get through.I recommend 'Joanna' only to devoted fans of 'The Roselynde Chronicles.' For those looking for an enjoyable, scrupulously detailed medieval romance, I recommend Gellis's 'Gilliane' and 'Alinor.'"},{"Title":"Joanna (The Roselynde Chronicles, Book 3)","review":"Although this series it's not new I loved it when it first came out and ordered it for my kindle so I could re-read it. This is the continuation of the story of Alinor in the Roselynde chronicles. Joanna her daughter has grown up and this is the story of her marriage to Geoffrey. It follows their lives thru the time of King John and how they work thru a difficult political environment. Although not as forceful as her mother Joanna is a truly self sufficient lady out of character for those times. You can read this as a stand alone story but I really recommend starting from the beginning and reading the first two books ahead of it. By the way it does not have the amount of sex that has become a major part of more recent romance but there is sufficient to develop the relationships."},{"Title":"Joanna (The Roselynde Chronicles, Book 3)","review":"In the 3rd book of the Roselynde series, we spend several years with Joanna and Geoffrey. This book was very frustrating for me, because all through the book (about five years), the two are completely in love and totally at odds. They're both miserable because neither will tell each other what is really going on. They're too busy trying to protect themselves and each other. Then, at the end, instead of us getting a glimpse of some kind of illuminating conversation, they're just suddenly happy and everything is perfect. Wait. What?

The last thing rancher Case Longren expects is a cook who is both young and beautiful. But to his surprise, not only does he find himself admiring her spirit, her rapport with her family, and her cooking, he also ends up falling unexpectedly in love with her in spite of her scar.And Lily is not immune to his good looks, kindness, strength, and charm. The problem is Lily isn't sure she can trust Case to love her forever. She is sure that one morning he will wake up to discover he has made a horrible mistake in marrying a woman with a deformed face. After suffering from her fiance's betrayal, Lily isn't about to risk her heart again. But Case's persistence, his steadiness, and his dependability win her heart in a way she never anticipates.Sharon Sala has written an emotionally heartwarming story about a woman who is afraid she'll never be loved for anything beyond the beauty she possesses and a man who is strong enough to put his heart on the line for her love and that of her family's. Both Case and Lily help each other to accept circumstances of the past that were beyond their control. With the strength of their love, Case comes to terms with his mother's desertion and Lily learns to see beyond her looking glass.

And Lily needed to leave Los Angeles behind -- along with the heartbreak of the fiance and the job she'd lost when her face was scarred in a car accident.From her first glimpse of Case Longren, a giant of a man in a black Stetson standing tall beneath the hot prairie sun, Lily realized there would be no hiding from his penetrating blue eyes. With his handsome face and teasing smile, Case was a man to be avoided at all costs.At first, Case didn't understand why a pretty blonde with sweet red lips would want to cook for two dozen dusty ranch hands. Then he noticed how Lily, like a skittish colt, shied away from people. This lady had come to his ranch to hide. And though he longed to keep her by his side, Case vowed to help her find the courage to face the world once again."},{"Title":"ALWAYS A LADY","review":"You have always been admired; you are attractive and receive constant reassurance of your value and great looks.

She is surprised when most of the cowboys are more concerned with her cooking skills than her looks.The owner of the ranch, Case Longren, is attracted to Lily but senses there must be quite a story as to why a lady of quality would agree to come to the hinterlands of Oklahoma to cook for 3 months.This is a fairly common story line but Sharon Sala breathes new life into it with her insights and writing style.

I liked the story, but I absolutlet hated every single character except for the 2 cats, Dinah & Sylvester. I know that is very strange, but every character in this book pissed me off with their crap excuses. The main character was dumber than a box of rocks, her best friend was in denial, her mother was a drunk who had taken up with a perv, her boss ignored the bad stuff going on, her boyfriend was a POS, and the one person I almost liked, Angelo, did not do enough to save Sam who was the main character. Sam did nothing to help herself. I personally thought she was an over indulged spoiled brat who wanted the easy life, but didn't think she had to work hard to get it. She had the resources to make something of herself and avoid the path she went down, but her motivation to do so was not there. Ughhhh....even talking about it makes me mad.I won't give anything else away, but expect to either be quite angry or quite sad. The story is told in diary format like the book, Go Ask Alice. It's easy to read and with only 168 pages long you can probably breeze right on through it in a day."},{"Title":"Beauty Queen","review":"Oh my. Where to start.. The book wasnt badly written. It didn't suck. But it sure was not realistic. The one realistic portrayal was of her customer and the relationship they had. The progression of her \\"addiction,\\" not so much.

If not, I guess this can be the cautionary, but flawed, tale you look to to find out what it's like."},{"Title":"Beauty Queen","review":"I'm still waiting for this book to arrive!

It takes us into a world that not many of us can experience firsthand."},{"Title":"Beauty Queen","review":"I wanted this book for so long. I was so excited to finally get it, and I wound up being pretty disappointed with the outcome. For me, it was too quick. I read the book in about 3 hours (with breaks).

Sam starts doing heroin so she break through her shyness while stripping. How cliche can you get? This book just feels like it was written by a high school student trying to make an after-school special. She even calls heroin her \\"magical potion.\\" And is not at all freaked out by shooting up, because her CAT is DIABETIC so she's cool with needles. The real problem is that she's totally an idiot. \\"Everyone says bad stuff about my new boyfriend, but they must be wrong, because I can look in his eyes and see innocence.\\" Basically I enjoyed reading it for the comedy."},{"Title":"Beauty Queen","review":"I have read this book in one day, i couldn't stop reading.

It delivered a \\"short story\\" feel that you readbreifly. I bought this thinking it would be a memoir, the back of the bookwas very weak and created a fake image of the author. To feel for thewriting , you shouldn't have to become a heroin addict. Its like sayingsteriods enable athletes to be great, when really youre not an athlete ifsteriods make you win.

This story of Samantha sure shows people what its like surviving on their own when things arn't on a good start. In her Journal, she can't even finish an entry without shooting up heroin, sometimes even more then once. Becoming a stripper, she makes a fortune for all the wrong reasons. This story tells the truth about being on drugs, how you feel, and about what love really is. If only samantha really knew who her real friends were, it might have saved her life. Her devotion to her beloved cat Dinah and friend Nicole were the only healthy thing in her past present and possibly her future. Life without drugs didn't exist. Especially since they were right around the corner of the streets in New York.I recomend this book to all teenagers, if you've read Go Ask Alice, then you'll love this book.

Sam's mom is an acoholic and her moms boyfriend is aways making sexual passes at her. She gets sick of living there so she moves. Once Sam gets her own apartment, she decides she should get a better job so she becomes at topless dancer. She is very scared to go on stage so one of her co-workers shoots her up with heroin and she starts feeling good about herself. She becomes addicted to it and uses it every time she's scared or when she feels bad about herself which is a lot. She falls in love with a police officer but there is something suspicious about him. She doesn't relize what she's doing to herself and it's very sad. This book is addictive just like the drug. As you read what happens to her through the book you will feel her pain. You have to know what happens to her, and what choices she makes so you have to keep reading. Once you see what she's doing to herself you will never want to try the drug.

Sam has a problem and believes that taking shot of heroin will help her get by her problem. Her friends find out and beg her to stop, but it's all a little too late. Sam's addicted and she doesn't seem to realize it. The details that Glovach uses put an excellent picture in your mind as you read along. You will soon realize that the \\"beauty queen\\" is not so beautiful after all. As I read more of the story I found that it was hard for me to put down the book. I enjoyed the book very much. I would recommend it to any one who enjoys reading novels that have to do with teens and what they go through on an every day basis."},{"Title":"Beauty Queen","review":"Beauty Queen was a great book! We really enjoyed reading about Sam and all of her trials and tribulations. The content in the book is very strong! Throughout the book, Sam is engaged in heroin, having sex, topless dancing, and extreme language. For these reasons, We would not recommend this book for elementary age children. We may allow extremely mature eighth graders to read this book outside of class.At the beginning of the book, Sam is talking about the problems that she has with her boyfriend, Teddy. She also introduces the fact that she sees a psychologist, Dr. Kohltari. As the book continues, Sam and Teddy break up. Sam lives with her mother, her mother's boyfriend, Kevin, and her cat Dinah. She does not get along with Kevin at all. She says that he makes her feel uncomfortable. Sam's mother is a severe alcoholic. The only people that Sam likes to talk to are Dinah and her best friend Nicole.Sam decides to move out on her own. Through a friend, Sam and Nicole find out about a strip bar called, The Web. Sam and Nicole get jobs at the bar. Sam takes a job as a dancer and Nicole becomes a bartender. On Sam's first night of dancing, she had still never taken her top off. She was too nervous! Behind stage, Sam sees a fellow dancer with heroin. Sam asks what she is doing and the girl said that she was shooting up heroin and invited Sam to join her. Sam does join her and immediately becomes addicted to the feeling created by the heroin. Sam says that she can only take off her top is she has shot up heroin. She loves the way the drug makes her feel and dance.Sam meets a man, Angelo, that is a regular at The Web. Sam and Angelo become very close. He is extremely wealthy and buys Sam whatever she wants. Sam resists telling Angelo about the heroin. One night, he found out and got very mad. His daughter passed away because of a drug addiction.Later on in the book, Sam becomes involved with a cop named Blaine. Although Sam thinks that Blaine is fabulous, Nicole, Angelo, and everyone else at The Web disagree. Sam disregards everyone's warnings and continues to see Blaine. The two of them get even deeper into heroin!This is the beginning of the end for Sam. This book is compiled completely of Sam's journal writings. All of the information in the book is directly from Sam's experiences. The end of the book takes the reader by surprise. That is all that we can say for now!"},{"Title":"Beauty Queen","review":"I'll admit it was good... Very well writen... and yes- chilling. the desend into the dark denying world of drug addiction. I just don't think it really would have happened so fast. If you DO like this book, I highly highly HIGHLY recomend\\"Go Ask Alice\\". It's more- uh -well- um real cause... IT IS!!! If you want a truly terrifying, unbalivably shocking book. read that!"},{"Title":"Beauty Queen","review":"This is probably the most real book I've read for a long time. All of my friends who read it loved it! It made me cry, plus my friends. I would recommened it to all teenage girls."},{"Title":"Beauty Queen","review":"This book made me cry it showed a lot of emotions and I read it in less then a day! Its a great book and will teach someone a lot if you have the same type of problems as she did! I recommend it to any teenager going through problems and want to learn a life lesson.. It wasn't one of my favoirte books, but it was well written and very real!"},{"Title":"Beauty Queen","review":"Even though this book was a bit of a daring thing, I thought it was very good. It shows you what can happen to you when you are addicted to heroin, and what your life becomes. Sam is a character that you love because she has a problem with self-esteem and needs help with it, even if that help is herion. You just want her to feel better and get back to the way she used to be, nice and not in any real trouble or sadness. The topless dancer part goes right in with the herion, and the whole book just fits in together."},{"Title":"Beauty Queen","review":"&quot;Beauty Queen&quot; tells you about the truths and horror of a killer drug, heroin. Reading this book showed me how one girl dealt with her addiction and the life as a stripper. It was sad to know how much she relied on heroin, her &quot;magic potion,&quot; and not even think she has a problem until her addiction catches up with her. Reading this book will show you how a lot of people don't understand the dangers of heroin, and the serious damage it can do to a person like this."},{"Title":"Beauty Queen","review":"There are almost 70 reviews that precede mine, so the reader already knows what this story is about! What drew me to this book is the unusual task that the author, Linda Glovach, stated on the back jacket of this book that she undertook to author this novel: \\"Writing the book, I saw my old dope dealer and bought $1,500 worth of pure heroin-Brown Gold-and started shooting up ten times a day to get the feel of the book. Well, I did, all right.I Want My Life BackI ended up in Glen Cove General, almost dead. In truth, you make a deal with the devil. He takes away your pain, but he owns you. You live for the next fix. After awhile, it's totally physical, your body has to have it. But I'm off it for good.\\" How many authors would do this to prepare themselves to write?Personally, this story touched so many topics that I finished the last pages with a multitude of thoughts on various subjects. I noticed how Glovach set up the protagonist, a 19 year old woman named Sam, as a prime target for an eventually fatal heroin binge with initial and constant references of low self esteem and self put downs.Low Self-Esteem Misunderstood & MisdiagnosedGlovach has Sam assert: \\"But who would love me, right? I don't even have the brains for college. Even worse, \\"I feel awkward and gawky. I wear a banana-boat size shoe (an enormous 11) and they used to call me the \\"Jolly Green String Bean\\" in high school. What's worse, I feel depressed and nervous most of the time. A mess, right?\\"Sam also is a child of a broken family (her father was a professional hockey player that deserted the family when she was young) and her mother is a full blown alcoholic that is irresponsible, sloppy and neurotic.From Mexico with deathWith Sam being so depressed, self conscious, and anxious, the reader wonders how she will be able to bare herself when she is introduced to the sordid world of adult night clubs and strippers. With the promise of fast money and financial independence from her dysfunctional mother, Sam gets a job as a dancer in a strip club.Strip City: A Stripper's Farewell Journey Across AmericaGlovach writes about the usual regular that frequents a strip club: \\"Most of them have bad marriages, pressure at work or home, are lonely, or just want to have fun\\". How will a girl so self conscious be able to bare herself in front of strangers? Introduced to heroin by a fellow dancer, all of her shyness is solved, albeit temporarily.Initially, Sam describes heroin as the \\"perfect comfort drug\\". Her fears are gone, and she paints a euphoric picture. Glovach writes about Sam: \\"It's so simple. I just do a shot and, in a few minutes, my pain and fear go away and I feel incredibly beautiful, like a real movie star.G-Strings and Sympathy: Strip Club Regulars and Male DesireFrom the whole inside of my being I felt tranquil, like maybe I touched or found God-or he let me know everything was and always had been O.K. I was happy at last. In fact, I wasn't ashamed to be a topless dancer\\". The story continues to talk about Sam's descent into an ever increasing habit of heroin abuse. However, while Glovach goes on about how wonderful the \\"Fugi Powder\\" or \\"Magic Potion\\" makes Sam feel, there is very little mention of the negative consequences of heroin addiction.Chasing the Dragon: One Woman's Struggle Against the Darkness of Hong Kong's Drug DensAbsent are known aftermaths of heroin addiction such as abscesses, aids and sexually transmitted diseases from risky behavior, negative legal consequences, or the ultimate and final fall of anyone on drugs:jails, institutions and death.The novel chronicles how Sam meets a suspended cop, Blaine, who is accused of raping a woman who called 911 for being raped herself. All of Sam's friends warn her to stay away from this man. Giving her a wedding ring and a plane ticket to San Diego, Blaine promises a a trip to paradise. The story ends when Blaine doesn't show up the day of the flight and Sam takes a fatal overdose of heroin. She is found dead on the floor by her best friend, with the journal that this novel is composed of on the kitchen table.Confessions of a WomanizerObviously, Glovach wanted to show that this is a bad road to go down, that one has to learn how to ask for help when in trouble, and that taking drugs to dull pain is never the answer. While the story was flowing and ultimately the lesson of \\"drugs kill\\" is communicated to the reader, I felt that the euphoric effects of heroin were over-touted and the negative and horrible side of the disease of addiction scarcely received it's due attention. Regardless, a very worthwhile read!"},{"Title":"Beauty Queen","review":"I liked the candid style. Craft didn't seem to matter so much because it was \\"genuine.\\" I didn't need a whole bunch of flowery monologues because the heart was on the page. For those who have done the stuff before the book will probably seem like an old confirmation- \\"been there, done that,\\" and for those who haven't, while it might not be a total warning because she writes while high and glowing, it will be like watching the closest disappointments in your life happen in superspeed. Sam's innocence only makes it worse because you feel \\"she doesn't know what she is throwing away.\\" She is quick to decide that Black is for her, and after picking it up ONCE, never puts it down! A bad end does seem inevitable because where else is all this optimism go- it can't go any higher because she starts out dealing with the tragedy in her life by sprouting daisies. it's not go ask alice. I mean sure it has a similar plot, and yes it is also a diary, but it's more like a \\"Emotional diary of an idiot\\" by Maggie Estep except with the polar opposite in terms of character type. While it isn't a funny book, what it lacks in humor it makes up for in seriousness of purpose."},{"Title":"Beauty Queen","review":"The book starts out with an a girl thats unhappy with her home life and leaves, but turns to stripping as a way of money for her everyday living needs.

She decided she should move away from her mother and her mother's problems. Samantha gets a job as a exotic dancer to help her pay for her new apartment and to feed her and her cat Dinah. She has to pay her bills some how.I really enjoyed reading this book, more than I liked reading other books. Usualy I don't like reading books in a journal format. But, this book is acceptable. This book is unlike any other book I have read. It is one of those books you will want to read over and over and over. This book is inappropriate for students of ages 12 and younger. Its more of an adult book.There's nothing I didn't like about this book. It was an unusual book. I liked the way that the author wrote this book in a journal format. It was a fantastic book. It wants you to turn to the next page. To keep on reading the book until you&#65533;re finished with the book. And, after the first time you were done reading the book. You still wanted to read it again.My favorite part of the story is not reallty a part. It's more of a way the author did somthing to the book. The author made the book seem like a real journal, instead of a book. The author Linda Glovach made the book seem like a real journal. This is a good book for students who need or want to learn about what drugs can do to you. This book is very informative in that area. The main character, Sam, is going through so many problems. She thinks that drugs is the way out of her problems.

This girl gurgled down the tubes in THREE months - going from a complete innocent working as a waitress to a mobster's moll, smack shooting, bony-hipped, strutting stripper to an angst filled death. Uh....I *don't* think so!!! If the author was a heroin addict as she says, then she should certainly know better than to publish this dramatic skimpy piece of trash. Puh-leeze!"},{"Title":"Beauty Queen","review":"As I began reading Beauty Queen, I didn't really like it. I felt that it was sort of unrealistic (it seems that Sam develops a herion habit over about three days), and the drug use felt very contrived. Despite these issues I had with the book, about halfway into it, I began to connect with Sam. Although you don't get to know her all that well in the short novel, small details about her--her taste in movies, her endearing naivete, make her a lovable character in many ways. Overall, I enjoyed the book, but felt the drug use was not portrayed very realistically."},{"Title":"Beauty Queen","review":"Beauty Queen is a remarkably written and twisted book about a nineteen year old girl named Samantha, who faces problems that many young adults face. Samantha fell in love with her boyfriend who left her for a woman who is fifteen years older than herself and is left heart-broken and depressed. Samantha becomes desperate to feel happier and begins seeing a therapist who directs Samantha to write in a journal about her daily life and troubles. Throughout the book, the reader is informed of Samantha's deepest thoughts and secrets along with her personal thoughts about events that occur in her life. She has a troublesome past and lived a dysfunctional family life. She moves out of her house and becomes a topless dancer in order to afford her rent for her apartment. Samantha believes that she cannot dance topless without something to make her feel more courageous. In order to escape her problems, she begins to use heroin as a way to escape her reality. While working at the Web, a strip club, she meets a former Mobster named Angelo who she confides in about her addiction and a police officer named Blaine and believes she is in love with him. Although her friends and co-workers tell her to stay away from him and that he's bad news, Samantha ignores their concerned comments and continues to see Blaine. When Samantha believes that Blaine is different from what she's been told, Blaine proves to her that her friends were right about Blaine by going to San Diego without Sam and leaving her feeling helpless and depressed. While Samantha feels miserable because Blaine left without her, she confides in heroin to solve her problems."},{"Title":"Beauty Queen","review":"this book was about a 19 year old girl named sam who struggles with the issues of money, alcholics, and drugs.when she moves out of her alcholic mothers house into her own apartment she knows that she will have to get a new job soon, one that pays more than $5 an hour. so when she accidently goes to a so when she meets a stripper and this women says it pays great she take her up on the advice.this book had good issues discussed in it but i felt like i never really got to know sam the way i get to know other characters of other books. she wasnt someone i could feel for and i felt as though she were not real. the book ends to abrubtly i didnt feel it got to the point that it should have. due to those facts i only rated it a 3."},{"Title":"Beauty Queen","review":"Linda Glovach was a \\"co-forger\\" of Go Ask Alice, a \\"teen diary\\" which was neither written by a teen nor was it any kind of diary a teen would write. The moralizing in the story is obvious, screaming \\"watch out, this can happen to you!\\" But it does no service to anyone when the stories are so obviously fake."},{"Title":"Beauty Queen","review":"This book is excellent, this is coming from a person that doesn't really like to read books. Sam, the main character, is very believable, at first I thought it was a true story. The way it's written makes it even more interesting; it's written in a journal format. It's as if she was talking to you personally, and it's easier to read that way to. I definitely recommend this book. This is perfect for people who need to learn about drugs, specifically heroin, because it shows some of the dangers of heroin use, which can be very informative. If you want to read a great, entertaining book read Beauty Queen."},{"Title":"Beauty Queen","review":"A Review by KelseyA nineteen year old girl, Sam, was told by her counselor, Dr. K, to keep a journal and write in it what is going on in her life at that time. Sam had just recently moved out of her mother's apartment. Her mother lives with her boyfriend and she is a huge alcoholic. Sam is sick of a go now where job at Chicken and Ribs. Her best friend Nicole and she decide to start a cleaning business. It goes well for a few weeks until they clean a very rich lady's house before she has a party. Sam curiously asks her how she made her fortune and the lady said that she was a topless dancer at The Web for almost 20 years. She gave Sam and Nicole the Web's number if they were interested in getting a job. At first Nicole and Sam are hesitating, but once they tried out they decided that this was what they wanted to do. Nicole became a bartender and Sam took the open dancer job. This decision of Sam's leads her down a path that is deadly.Beauty Queen is a dramatic and true story. The story is written in the form of Sam's journal. I like how the \\"author\\" didn't change any of Sam's true stories. Linda may have revised grammar, but besides that everything that Sam writes is true. This book easily someone leading a good life can suddenly go down the wrong path. The language in this book is easy to follow. At times you seem as if you really know Sam and completely understand her pain. As you read along you can tell that Sam's addiction with heroin is ruining her relationships with other people. Nicole finds out and stops talking to her. Everyone else who knows and still associates with her doesn't realize how much heroin is ruining her physically and emotionally. I would give this book a 4 out of five. This is because I like the idea of the author trying to keep Sam's diary, but at times you want to wonder what's going on in the other character's lives. The length of this book was perfect but at times I wanted it to go on. I think this is because in a way I wanted to know more about the problem or event. The ending is realistic and a little alarming.I strongly recommended this book to teenage readers who enjoy real life situation stories. It is pretty easy to read and is an all around good book."},{"Title":"Beauty Queen","review":"If you like novels that grab your attention and deal with drugs use and abuse, Beauty Queen, by Linda Glovach, might be a great book for you. I rated this book a 5 because I could relate to it because one of my friends got hooked on drugs and she wouldn't let anyone help her.Another reason that I liked the book was because it grabbed my attention. It showed me that anyone could get hooked on drugs in a blink of an eye. Sam, the main character, gets caught up in drugs by her peers and ends up getting addicted. Sam wouldn't listen to her best friend Nicole, who was trying to help Sam get off drugs, but Sam said that she had slowed down a lot, which was a lie.A third reason why I liked this book is because the author's theme in this novel is so strong and true. The theme was to be careful whom you trust. Sam's boyfriend was playing around with her heart and playing Sam for a fool. All he wanted was to have sex and leave Sam hanging. Plus, he was a cop and was suspended from the force for raping a rape victim.In conclusion, you should always trust your true friends and listen to what they have to say. I think this novel would be a great story for anybody to read. You could learn a lot about how people think when they are under pressure and what foolish mistakes they can make."},{"Title":"Beauty Queen","review":"THiS BooK iS THe &quot;Go aSK aLiCe&quot; oF THe NiNeTieS!FaNTaSTiC!i WouLD HaVe GiVeN iT FiVe STaRS, BuT (FoR Me) iT MaDe HeRoiN SeeM a LiTTLe Too GLaMoRouS...FRoM SaM'S PeRSPeCTiVe, iT WaS GLaMoRouS (BeCauSe iT WaS MaGiC FoR Her)...BuT aS a &quot;MeSSaGe To TeeNS&quot; a LiTTLe Too RoMaNTiC."},{"Title":"Beauty Queen","review":"This short book impressed me immensley. Written as a diary. It has the ring of adolescent naivetey. Of young adults raised in families that offer no firm moral guidance. Left to thier own resources, they fall in with the easy slide to drugs, prostitution, the whirlpool for those without the resources to pull away from the turgid side of life. The book is a modern tradgedy. Though it may seem some what contrived in its simplistic, almost predictable course of sequences, unfortunately all to often, this is what happens. We can never be reminded to often."},{"Title":"Beauty Queen","review":"From people I know that have used heroin, and many other books I've read on the subject, my understanding is that a person usually gets sick a few times before they become entirely addicted. Sam seemed to get hooked very quickly after being shot up once.Also, Angelo the gangster was a great character, but I found it hard to believe that he would risk his persona to &quot;publish&quot; Sam's diary. Of course, that would give him legitimacy.Lastly, I would have liked more illustrations of Sam getting dope sick. I think the powerful descriptions of what the body goes through in withdrawal sends a strong message out to kids who are romanced by the notion of being &quot;junkie cool.&quot;Anyway, I really enjoyed the book and I will recommend it to a lot of the kids at the high school I work at. The message does come through loud and clear, only I would have liked a few more elements expanded. I hope the author writes some more!"},{"Title":"Beauty Queen","review":"It has been 26 years since the publication of Go Ask Alice and it seems like the storyline of: teenager + drug abuse = death is still worthy of publication. This time the drug of choice is heroin. Many people will not want their children to read books like this, they'll say it will foster the mindset of promotion of drug abuse, but I don't think that is true. I have never taken drugs, and reading about a person taking drugs has never prompted me to indulge. (I have also seen 1000's of acts of violence on Tv and in the movies, and I have yet to committ felonious assault.) If you deciede to read this book, please read Go Ask Alice too. If this book does not scare you, then I'm not sure what would."},{"Title":"Beauty Queen","review":"Beauty Queen to me was an amazing book. I would recommend it to anyone. The author got me hooked because it was written in a journal entry style, and it was so similar to her life. The author was a heroin user just like the main character Sam, in the book.Sam always wanted to become an actress but never had the confidence to go to an acting agency. She went to a strip club instead, where her and her friend Nicole began to work. Sam was a stripper and Nicole was a bartender. Sam didn't have any self-esteem. It was difficult for her to take her top off so she started to use heroin. It took her pain away and it helped to raise her self-esteem.She began to use heroin more and more. While she believed that she didn't have a heroin addiction. She also believed that a filthy, dirty, cop, Blaine Johnson, would love her and marry her. He became a part of her problems. As soon as they became a couple she started to use massive dosages of heroin.Beauty Queen really gets to you because you don't want to put the book down at all. It'll catch your interest from the minute you open that book! It can also teach a person a few things about what drugs can do to you, or how you'll end up if you use drugs."},{"Title":"Beauty Queen","review":"Samantha is supposed to be nineteen-years-old, but Glovach gives her the voice of a fourteen-year-old. She has lived a rough life with her alcoholic mother and the mother's creepy verging on pervy boyfriend. No way would this woman be so immature and naive at the age of nineteen.The other thing is that there is only about three days time between Samantha's first experience with stripping and heroin before she is profoundly addicted to the drug, and inexplicably now a seasoned professional stripper. And again only a few more days until her whole new life of mobsters, obsession with a dirty cop and general desperation.The most unpredictable thing about this book is that nothing unpredictable happens. You keep waiting. The mobster and the dirty cop inspire a little fear, but ultimately fall flat. I finished this book only out of a morbid curiosity to see how bad and ridiculous it would get. If you look at it that way you won't be disappointed!"}]`),L={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:E,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},W=["disabled"],x={key:0},R={key:1};function H(n,e,s,c,r,i){const m=f("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",M,[(t(!0),a(g,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,y)=>(t(),p(m,{key:y,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",R,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",x,"See more"))],8,W)):b("",!0)])}const B=u(L,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-eb7ae801"]]),F=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/34.md","filePath":"quotes/34.md"}'),O={name:"quotes/34.md"},q=Object.assign(O,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(B)]))}});export{F as __pageData,q as default};
