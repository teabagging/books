It is truly an excellent piece of literature. It is a story of appearance and reality. The author, Jane Austen, uses extensive and challenging vocabulary. The words flow off the pages. Sometimes, I read the same passage three or four times to fully understand what it was trying to convey. The main character, Mr. Darcy, is extremely proud. He is selfish and rude, until he meets Miss Elizabeth Bennet. But, Miss Bennet is far below his social standing. It is interesting to see how the characters change in the book over time. If you want a challenge, have some time, and love good literature, this book is for you!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"There is not much for me to say about this book, other than to add my voice to the choir singing the praises of Jane Austen and &quot;Pride and Prejudice.&quot; I recently read it for the first time (although I have been a long-time fan of the BBC series), and I was absolutely blown away. Without a doubt, one of the best books I have ever read.Jane Austen proves that brevity is not the soul of wit. Here razor-sharp pen peels back the outward polish and fine veneer of a host of stuffed shirts. Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy live and breath, and I am addicted to their story even though I know the outcome. Plot is not the reason to read &quot;Pride and Prejudice,&quot; rather it is just to take pleasure in good writing and cheer.After this book, I am diving headfirst into the world of Jane Austen. Amazing that it took me this long to discover her."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"When I first started this book I thought I would find a novel with alot of old time english and bore. But as I started to read this classic I found that it was quite an interesting story.Pride and predjudice, I think,is a wonderful story that tells the reader that they should learn to know a person before they make assumptions about them.The way that Jane Austen sews romance with mystery and bewilderment makes it so that I would gladly reccomend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"You will find Jane Austen in high school classrooms, as inspiration for contemporary movies and fiction (Clueless, Bridget Jones' Diary), and at a book club or two. Otherwise, she is not part of us: Her laser-eyes, scathing commentary about society, and merciless fun at the expense of over-the-top piety are missing. In our current Press-Release era, where ads blanket our cities, and celebrities alter their image every other week, Jane would have a field day-- her observations would have been invaluable, her sharp humor liberating.\\"Pride and Prejudice\\"-- the story of independent-minded Elizabeth Bennet's journey to a happy marriage and her rousing rebellion against the stultifying and stale social system of 19th-Century England-- is an adrenaline-rush of a book.As Elizabeth battles the defenders of society (her marriage-obsessed mother, a condescending suitor, and several members of the \\"upper-class\\" trying to stem her promising relationship with the affluent and handsome Mr. Darcy) we sample a world where family, money, and class dictate your friends and suitors.When Elizabeth and Darcy move to his stunning home, they leave the hostility of an uncaring society behind. Through rebellion and stubbornness, they have found Eden."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I've just finished reading this book again for probably the 20th time. The first time I read it was in my early 20s. I was amazed that Elizabeth, the main character, a young woman in her 20s from early 19th century England,was so likeable and full of life. I definitely related to her.Seeing the famous BBC/A&amp;E production in the mid 1990s only increased my joy of this book.Austen was an incredible observer of the manners and mores of her time. This book lets her playfulness and human spirit shine through.This is one title I will never tire of reading."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is filled with memorable characters and beautifully written prose that deserve applause. I instantly liked it from the first paragraph. Certainly literature that demands a second reading."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is surely the most delicious of Jane Austen's novels. Austen writes with superb insight of the era she was living in!The characters are wonderful - the spirited and rebellious Lizzie Bennett, proud and handsome Darcy, the gloriously silly Mrs Bennett and the ogre that is Lady Catherine de Burgh. If you only ever read one classic novel, then this is the one to read. Follow it with the BBC video version (1995), a glass of wine, a large box of chocs. and curl up on the sofa. Enjoy !!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I was forced to read Jane Austen's &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; as an assignment in my British Literature class. Though it was not a voluntary thing at first, it soon became one. I could kiss my english teacher for making me read this! I read it in three days, hardly stopped to put it down, it was so engrossing. After reading it I promptly went out and watched the 5 hour A&amp;E movie (Colin Firth is to die for, and it stays truer to the book than any other movie I've seen thus far).Austen's writing style is brilliant and has such a nice, familiar tone that even though she is poking fun at much of society, she was probably quite fond of her characters. Elizabeth Bennet, the heroine, was a wonderful character and is by far one of the most real fictional people I have ever had the pleasure of reading about. I love how her relationship with Mr. Darcy changes gradually and his true character is revealed. My only wish is that sequels were in style then and Austen had thought to right one or simply make the book longer.I had to read this book because it is a classic. However, I would recommend this book to everyone, not because it is a classic, but because it is such a beautiful story with 3-dimensional characters who will pull you into a world you will not want to leave."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is an amazing, amazing critique and representation of nineteenth century society. All I have to say is wow. This edition, however, is very small print, and definitely not easy on the eye. I am reviewing this one because it was the version that recieved from school. It is so enticing, once i reached about halfway through the book, I couldn't put it down at all. I was delighted with the complexity of the characters and the way in which Jane Austen opens up the thought process of the main character, Elizabeth. This is one of the few classics that deserves the word &quot;classic&quot; to be applied to it. Pride and Prejudice is a must read for anyone, but requires a substantial amount of thought and maturity. I loved it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I must admit that when I finally finished reading Pride and Prejudice I wish I hadn't finished. This is by far the best story i have ever read in my short life. This woman is one of the best writers I have ever encountered and this novel got me hooked. I was so detirmined to finish it that i stayed up all night long reading. I could not wait to see what was ever to become of Elizabeth and Darcy. I started reading it as an assignment for my 9th grade honors english class one week ago and was kicking myself at the end of the book for not reading it on my own. I have now started Sense and Sensibility but I am sure that nothing could be as good as Pride and Prejudice. If anyone hasnt read this you are missing out on a great story. I have yet to see the mini series but i plan on borrowing it from my teacher. I urge everyone to experience Pride and Prejudice."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The book was recommened to me and I did not think that I would enjoy it, but I started reading it anyway. The book drew me in adn I could not put it down. The characters are all so charming. Elizabeth Bennet is by far my favorite character. She is very admirable, witty, smart, well informed and always polite. She was always more concerned with her sister's love life then with her own. This brings us to another character, Jane Bennet. Jane is the prettiest in the Bennet family and her mother's favorite child. Her relationship with Mr. Bingley, the new neighbor, is the talk of the town. Their relationship is referred to a lot in the book, but the novel focused mostly on Elizabeth and her relationship with Mr. Darcy. This is waht kept me interested in the book. The story line is romatnic and kept me guessing as to what was going to happen next. The question throughout the novel is if anything will happen between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys romantic story lines."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I had expected this book to be so dry and boringly romantic that I almost loathed the idea of starting it. Once I got into it, however, I had to admit that not only was this book really well written, but it was far more captivating than I ever imagined it would be. The book is true to its title, using the plot of Elizabeth and her sisters and family to illustrate thoroughly the concepts of pride and prejudice as they related to 19th century England society. This book and its sister novel, &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; are both not only better written than most contemporary novels, but also share appropriately the attributes of being timeless novels. Though much lighter in spirit than many other &quot;timeless&quot; works of that and other early eras, particularly Joyce or Wilde, the novels nonetheless convey well an important intellectual body of work and culture."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I love this book! I read it first when I was 11, and hated it. I thought the language was stuffy and the plot contrived. But then I read it again when I was 15, and it has quickly become my favorite book. I reread it every few months. However, those who don't enjoy a fast-paced plotline, beware: the action is slow. Just make it through the first hundred pages and you'll gobble up the rest. For guy readers, I can only say that this is one of my father's favorite books; whether he is abnormal or just romantic I don't know, but anyhow this is such a good book that it should be required reading! Also, for anyone who did not like the slow action in the book, you must see the BBC movie with Jennifer Elhe and Colin Firth. I promise you'll love the book after seeing it (not to mention Colin Firth). Thanks for reading my review; now go read P&amp;P!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Last Fall I saw a A&amp;E version of P&amp;P. I enjoyed the movie. If I had not seen the movie I probably would not have finished the book. The problem with this is that one can not develop their own picture or opinion on the characters.What I liked the most was the amount of wit displayed between the characters interaction. It is a true book about people. It is funny, charming and romantic. It really opened my eyes to society in the 19th century."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Nearly 600 reviews have been written on this book at the time of this writing so I suppose there is little I can say that has not already been said about Austen's masterpiece Pride and Prejudice. What I can say is this: this is probably my all-time favorite book and seems to be the same for countless others.Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy are the two main protagonists and are surrounded by the ill-matched Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, the fatuous Mr. Collins and his condescending patroness Lady Catherine de Bourgh and the unscrupulous George Wickham. As the story unfolds, there are twists and turns in the plot as the reader keeps wanting Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy to give up their own pride and prejudices about each other.A wonderful portrait of nineteenth century English society as well as an entertaining satire on Jane Austen's England. A must read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Women in Regency England had few options in life except to marry well. They usually received little, if any, formal education, and their aim was to become \\"accomplished,\\" proficient in the social graces like music, needlework, sketching, whist and &quot;acceptable&quot; literature. Considerable pressure was placed on women to marry in order to obtain financial security, not just for themselves, but also for their immediate family. Love matches were rare. Ms. Austin writes, &quot;It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.\\" So there you have it. The men and women of the Regency period, nobility and emerging middle class alike, were very focused on the business of marriage.Our story opens in the small community of Longbourn, Hertfordshire. Word is out that the empty Netherfield Estate has been leased to a new occupant - a wealthy bachelor. Mothers and daughters suddenly upset their daily routine, and shatter the local tranquility - buying dress material, sewing, embroidering, planning and fantasizing about balls and marriage. Nowhere is there more excitement than at the Bennett home, where five very marriageable daughters anticipate news of their neighbor. The Bennett's have a particular reason for wishing their girls settled. The Bennett estate, Longbourn, is entailed. It can only be inherited by a male successor. Since the Bennett's have no son, their entire estate will go to Mr. Bennett's cousin. The girls must be married well, so they will have a secure home when their father dies. If their mother should outlive her spouse, they will have to provide for her also.There is a ball in honor of John Bingley, the new resident at Netherfield, and for the friends who accompany him. Bingley is very taken with Jane Bennett, the eldest daughter, and a lovely young woman with a sweet disposition. The feelings are reciprocated and the two form an attachment. It is at this ball that Elizabeth Bennett, the family's second daughter, meets Bingley's friend, the aristocratic Fitzwilliam Darcy. Darcy, is much richer than Bingley. He is a handsome, intelligent man, and the Lord of Pemberly, a large, sumptuous estate in Derbyshire. Darcy, however, is the epitome of haughtiness when he arrives on the scene, and looks down his nose at the local yokels. Elizabeth Bennett, is quite different from most young women of the Regency Period. She had been encouraged to use and develop her strong intellect since childhood, and she has become quite literate, and enjoys fine books and literary conversation. She is bright, with a sharp wit, much more independent than her sisters, and very pretty. Darcy is attracted to her immediately, but snubs her unknowingly. She responds in kind, thinking him to be boorish and far too proud. Thus she is prejudiced against him from their first meeting.The novel is filled with Ms. Austin's humor and delightful characters, including: George Wickham, a handsome military officer who further prejudices Elizabeth against Darcy with tales from their mutual past; William Collins, a pompous clergyman, cousin to the Bennets, and probable heir to the family holdings; Charlotte Lucas, a young neighbor and dear friend to Elizabeth and Jane; and Lady Catherine De Bourgh, the quintessential aristocrat. Jane Austen weaves her plots and sub-plots with elegant prose and wit. Her clever use of irony, reveals her characters' charms and flaws. At one point, Mr. Darcy actually insists that Elizabeth is the proud one. It is pure pleasure to read her narrative and dialogue. And the characters are so believable that is difficult to remain disinterested in their lives and foibles.Mr Darcy learns more about Elizabeth with each chapter. He discovers her wit, intelligence and charm. She almost always spurns his awkward attempts to woo her. When she finally admits to herself how much she admires Darcy, he puts his foot in his mouth. He tries to tell Elizabeth of his deep feelings for her. However, he explains that his strong emotions go against his social background. He is prepared to marry someone of lower status, prepared to suffer hostility from his relations, and society in general, in order to be with her. All of this, sounds condescending to Elizabeth, and he infuriates her. It is as if Darcy is doing her a favor by loving her. He also tells her, honestly, that he has sabotaged the relationship between her sister Jane and his friend Bingley, because he fears Jane wants to marry Bungley for his money. So, once again, Elizabeth rejects him because of his pride.If the young couple would be able to understand and let go of their shallow pride and prejudice, a wonderful love and friendship could form and flourish. Elizabeth also exhibits her prejudice against her close friend, Charlotte, when she marries for convenience instead of love.Ms. Austin paints a vivid picture of various relationships, and the marriage mores of Regency England. She portrays the relationships of the senior Bennett's, of Charlotte and her new husband, and of young, frivolous Lydia Bennett who marries at fifteen. Ms. Austin stresses the necessity of compatibility in a marriage, since divorce is almost impossible. She demonstrates the various forms compatibility takes in her characters' relationships.This much beloved Jane Austin novel is one of my favorites. It reads like a dream and is difficult to put down. I can't recommend it highly enough. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"A novel I have read and re-read, and will continue to do so with great gusto - every time, falling hopefulessly in love with the characters all over again. It is by far, my favorite.Published in 1813 and premiered under the title First Impressions, Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" stands as one of the most universally loved and admired novels of English literature. Not only is it a tale of rural romance, but also a witty and shrewdly observed satire of English country life.The story takes place in a remote Hertfordshire village, in George III's England. Mr. Bennett, a country squire of no great means, endeavors to marry off his five vivacious daughters. At the heart of all this all-consuming enterprise are his headstrong second daughter, Elizabeth Bennett and her aristocratic suitor Fitzwilliam Darcy - two lovers whose pride must be humbled and prejudices dissolved before the novel can come to it's splendid conclusion."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Someone once said that a classic work of literature is one which everyone loves to be able to acknowledge having read but which no one actually enjoys reading. To be fair, there is some justification in this sentiment, as many classic novels are not readily accessable to readers not versed in various literary devices, symbolism, and so on. Fortunately, Pride and Prejudice does NOT fall into that category. It is a novel which has an interesting, captivating story that is easily accessible and humorous yet intelligent, insightful and extremely witty--in short, it's a novel which is a joy to read and re-read. It is also my favourite Austen novel.Briefly, for those unfamiliar with the novel, the story concerns Miss Elizabeth Bennet, a spirited, quick-witted and intelligent (not to mention beautiful) young woman from a family of modest means, and the wealthy Mr. Darcy, a handsome but very reserved and indeed proud young man. Darcy falls in love with Elizabeth albeit against his will (for he deems her to be socially inferior and cannot abide her silly mother and sisters). Elizabeth (who displays a quickness to judge others based on appearances and \\"first impressions\\"), however, does not care for the arrogant, proud, ill-mannered Mr. Darcy. It is the tension between these two main characters that comprises the central story and gives it its spark. I won't say any more, for I don't wish to give the story away. Suffice it to say that although it takes place some 200 years ago, it is every bit as relevant today as it was then, for human nature is no different now than it ever was.Now to address the merits of this particular edition. (As reviews unfortunately are posted next to all editions, regardless of the one to which they may apply, the edition to which I refer is the hardcover Modern Library edition with the picture of Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle on the cover). Generally, when one is looking to purchase a hardcover of one of the classics it is because one is looking for an edition that will be a more permanent addition to his or her library--one that looks nice and that can, perhaps, be passed on to future generations. Personally, my first choice for hardcovers of the classics are those published by the Folio Society. Having said that, this edition has a lot to recommend it. Most importantly, it is printed on acid-free paper, so it will last without the pages turning brown (unlike those nice-looking but disappointingly cheap-quality bargain hardcovers one usually finds on the sale table in one's local bookstore).Secondly, the print is beautifully crisp and clear. The print is not as large as one might hope for in a hardcover, but it is a vast improvement over the cheap \\"mass market\\" type paperbacks. Actually, I was surprised to find that it's only minimally smaller than my Easton Press edition, although the lines are further apart in the latter edition (which does make a bit of a difference).As if that's not enough to recommend this edition, it has the added benefit of being housed in a very attractive dust jacket which looks beautiful alongside the BBC/A&E; video collection--the definitive dramatisation of the novel and definitely a must-see. (This edition was initially released as a companion to the video collection).In conclusion, I give 5 stars for the story, and I have no hesitation in giving 5 stars for the Modern Library edition of the novel--it's a lovely edition. Considering the quality, it is very well priced--definitely good value for one's money. And for those who've steered clear of the classics for fear that they must necessarily be dull and incomprehensible, give this novel a try--I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen is a literary genius. Her writing is full of delightful irony and witty dialogue. There are so many things that I love about this book that it is hard to know where to start. You have to love the characters of Elizabeth and Mr. Bennet they both have such a great sense of humor that they keep me laughing the whole way through. Elizabeth is such a feisty and intelligent character, and she is so full of energy and love of life that you cannot help but fall in love with her--I can definitely understand why Mr. Darcy falls in love with her despite her poor connections. I also surprisingly love the character of Mr. William Collins, who is so absurd and stupid that I cannot help but laugh myself silly over the things he does and says. His marriage proposal to Elizabeth is one of my most favorite events in the book. Another classic scene is Lady Catherine deBourgh's confrontation with Elizabeth over Mr. Darcy. She is another rather absurd character, and it is really great that Elizabeth has the tenacity to stand up for herself to that woman. There is only one thing in this book that really depresses me--the fate of Charlotte Lucas. As much as I love to laugh at Mr. Collins I would absolutely hate being married to him. I really feel sorry for Charlotte Lucas despite of the fact that she is able to arrange things so that she spends as little time in his company as possible. Also having to put up with Lady Catherine's constant lecturing and prying must also be hard. Despite this one semi-depressing aspect, this book really is as close to perfection as one can get. Another really good aspect of this book is the fact that in many ways it is a very accurate portrayal of what a woman's life was like in the early nineteenth century."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I particularly love the opening sentence of this novel -- \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\\"Indeed this opening sentence has been claimed as the greatest in English literature. It certainly sums up the central concerns of the main female characters and the tensions of the novel in extremely short order.I wish the same could be said of the closing chapters of the novel, as they are in my opinion one of its major flaws, they tend to drag. The other that always strikes me when I reread this novel is how superior and full of pride seems the novels heroine, Elizabeth Bennet. For indeed the novel is well titled, it is full of characters who display both pride and prejudice.When we first see Darcy, our hero, he is described as a \\"fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien.\\" We also hear he has \\"ten thousand a year\\" -- more than enough to raise the avarice of those that might wish to marry for money. Not enough, however, for Elizabeth who clashes with Darcy who answers his snobbish indifference to her with angry pride.From this point we have a novel that unfolds as Elizabeth and Darcy go through far reaching assessments of themselves and thier social pride and prejudices. Through this they also gain different views of each other, dragging the reader along.Elizabeth Bennet was Austen's favourite of her own heroine's, it is not hard to see why. She is sharp witted, intelligent, reasonable and a thoroughly modern woman. Her attitude to Mr Collins is a perfect example, while he praises her \\"modesty\\" and \\"economy\\" she denies these and at the same time spurns the then middle class ideal of a woman as submissive and domestic. When she tells Lady Catherine that she could certainly marry Darcy as \\"he is a gentleman, and I am a gentleman's daughter\\" she is rejecting her attitude of class through social and family connections.The novel has all of Austen's typical strengths, good characterization, compelling plot, a sharp wit and a wonderful eye for the detail of the life of English rural gentry. This novel and \\"Emma\\" compete as the favourite among readers (I'm an \\"Emma\\" fan myself) while it competes with \\"Mansfield Park:\\" among critics as her best work.When you're deciding which edition to buy I would recommend the &quot;Penguin Classics&quot; edition for Vivien Jones' excellent introduction (which should be read after the novel unless you already know the entire plot from a previous read or a movie.)"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"THIS IS A WONDERFUL LOVE STORY THAT HAS EVER BEEN WRITTEN. JANE AUSTEN SUCCESSFULLY DESCRIBED EACH PERSON'S HUMANITY. THE FIVE SISTERS OF BENNET REALLY PULL OUT A LOT OF INTERESTING SCENES IN THIS BOOK. AFTER READING THIS, I FEEL LOVE CAN REALLY PULL TOGETHER THE DISTANCE BETWEEN EACH PERSON, AND AS LONG AS WE HAVE LOVE IN OUR MIND, THERE IS NO PROBLEM THAT IS UNSOLVABLE. WE SHOULD GO BACK AND READ THIS BOOK EVERY COUPLE YEARS, BECAUSE EACH TIME WE READ, WE WILL HAVE DIFFERENT FEELING. AND THE MORE WE READ, WE WILL DISCOVER MORE NEW MEANINGS FROM THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The book gets 5 stars of course. But the printing of this particular version is TERRIBLE. It's apparently a \\"print on demand\\" book from Tribeca Books. Instead of using real quotation marks and apostrophes, they use inch marks and foot marks. It looks terrible. The margins are tiny and the text is packed onto every page, making the book only 253 long, hard to read pages (when properly set it should be at least 350 pages). Yes to Jane Austen, no to Tribeca Books, who basically are just ripping off a public domain book and typesetting it horribly. I had to walk into a bookstore and buy a different publisher's version of this book it was so annoying. The one I got was only $5 and much easier to read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I remember liking Sense and Sensibility in college, but I struggled through this one a bit. It took me about half the book just to get used to the language, but once I did, it was mildly enjoyable. The Bennet family drove me a little crazy, especially Mrs. Bennet and Lydia. But I loved the evolution of Lizzy's feelings for Darcy and the conclusion of the \\"happily ever after\\" marriages. I don't think I'm up for the challenge of Jane Austen again any time soon, but I'm glad I read this classic."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I've been a fan of Miss Austen from day one; and I firmly believe that she has a bright future ahead of her as a novelist.Don't buy all the \\"critics\\" commentary and praise regarding \\"Persuasion\\" and some of her other works as being superior to P&P.; That's pure contrary-ism at its worst.If you only read two of her books, then read this one twice. And then resolve to read more than two and check out her other novels, because they are great as well.The A&E; miniseries for P&P; is outstanding and comes highly recommended.No, I don't own stock in A&E; but I am over the age of 13... in a few weeks."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (originally titled \\"First Impressions\\") is a witty, smart, sharp, and insightful comedy/romance of the 18th century. The plot, centering around the playful, but sensible, Elizabeth Bennet and the grave, haughty Mr. Darcy is dellightful, as they both learn to overcome their pride, artificial sensibilites, prejudice against eachother, and the economic and social differences of the time. The language is not hard to understand, unless you are completely unnacustomed to good, well-written fiction. The dignified and often unwilling chemistry between the two protaganists is spellbinding, and the humour sharp and astute. The lesser characters provide much of the humour, from sheer stupidity, sarcasm, and blatant ignorance of what is sensible or dignified. This book is for any age (I read it at 12 years old and enjoyed it) and the enjoyment in it increases after several readings. I hightly recommend it as one of the most well-developed, well-written, and amusing books I have ever read.Also, if you like the book, I suggest buying or renting the A&B; mini-series, Pride and Pejudice starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. If you read the book, watch the movie, and read the book again, it is even more enjoyable in my opinion than reading it without having watched the series."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is a wonderful and timeless classic. But be forewarned that it is not a light read. Because it was written in another era, the dialogue takes some getting used to and I found myself re-reading sections to make sure that I fully understood the conversation. In any event, readers will fall in love with the characters, especially Lizzy and Jane, and delight in the many entertaining scenarios."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"What can I say about Pride and Prejudice that hasn't already been said? I read this when I was in junior high and didn't really like it. What was I thinking? It's been my all-time favorite novel for the past ten years or so. Its themes are the basis for hundreds of novels, movies and plays. Just think of how many stories you've read or seen that have the two main characters disliking each other, bickering and finally realizing that they love each other. If you just can't get enough of Pride and Prejudice, I suggest reading Pamela Aidan's series which tells the same story from Darcy's point of view."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The main plot of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" by Jane Austen is about the relationships of people and the misperceptions we sometimes make on them. The main character is Elizabeth Bennet, an outspoken and somewhat modern girl for her time. She resides in the country with her family; her obsessive mother, quiet spoken father, and her four other sisters, her elder and loving Jane, sentimental Mary, and the two flirtatious Kitty and Lydia. When a prosperous man named Mr. Bingley arrives near the Bennets, Mrs. Bennet's first idea is that Jane shall marry Mr. Bingley. At the ball which he first makes his appearance, he brings along his friend Mr. Darcy, a man who is even richer than Mr. Bingley. It is soon discovered that Mr. Darcy has somewhat of a prideful air about him, and after saying an offensive statement about Elizabeth, she is prejudiced against him. The book goes on to show how Elizabeth and Darcy grow closer to each other, from her finding out about his past to him helping her family out when Lydia elopes with an officer in the military. The ending is probably no surprise to anyone, but the way the book progresses is so fascinating that you want to keep reading it to find out how everything will turn out.My personal thoughts on the book are thus; the characters are very involving, as is the plot. The choice of words and dialogue are a bit hard to comprehend, but that's how people spoke in the 18th century. The book is more enjoyable than the movie adaptations I've seen, although the A&E; version was great in my opinion. I think the way Jane Austen was able to capture each character's feelings and actions as she did in the book is so fascinating; mainly because she did that by observing all the people in the countryside she resided in. Personally, my favorite characters so far are Darcy and Elizabeth, the latter being a close second. I just feel I relate to both of them well in the way that I speak my mind and am misunderstood at times. I believe people interested in the behaviours and relationships of people during a certain time period would best like this book. Compared to books written today, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is totally different. It has small humour, an interesting plot with many sub-plots, and great characters where there is a type assured for anyone."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have read this famous Jane Austen's classic when I was a kid. I remembered I loved it so much and it remained as my favorite for a long time. This second time is even better! Can't say enough how I enjoyed reading it. The conversations between characters are so vivid, and the stoy flows so smoothly on. It was such a pleasant journey and I can't stop reading until I finished."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I must say I am not overly taken to reading romantic novels but I made an exception in this case.It was singularly refreshing to read about a female heroine, especially one as well developed as Elizabeth, written at a time when women were seen as nothing more than a means to wealth or progeny through the institution of marriage.We see in this novel the undercurrents of societal bias and the expectations put on women to marry in light of their limited role in society at the time. The novel comments on a wide variety of marital arrangements ranging from those of pure convenience to those based on love each with amusing consequences.In reading this one is rewarded with a wide variety of well developed characters written by an author who has an eerie command of the english language.I was so impressed with the attention to detail and psychological commentary ( hence the title pride and prejudice ) that I have resolved to read the other 5 novels written by Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"When I opened up my copy of Pride and Prejudice, I didn't know what to expect. I had heard from my friend that it was good, but I really didn't trust her taste. I am forever thankful to her.Elizabeth Bennet, a young woman in a middle class society, and her sisters must marry in order to be guaranteed a comfortable life. When Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy (two upper class men) come into town, Mrs. Bennet is determined to make the men fall in love with her daughters. This leads to conflict, etc (sorry I don't want to give away too much!)I think the main reason why I love this book is that it is difficult to put down. Austen's witty characters bring to Merrytown, never knowing what is going to happen next. This book was, \\"Impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to long to know\\"(59)."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The Bennet family has five unmarried daughters and when Charles Bingley, a rich bachelor, arrives at nearby Netherfield, Mrs. Bennet sets her sights on him as a prize catch. At a ball at Meryton everyone agrees they like the openhearted Mr. Bingley, who has developed an affection for the Bennet's oldest daughter, Jane, but they find his friend Fitzwilliam Darcy to be an arrogant and disdainful fellow. For their part, Mr. Darcy and Bingley's sisters are repelled by the Bennet's lower status and the embarrassing Mrs. Bennet. At the ball, Elizabeth Bennet, the second oldest daughter, overhears Darcy the man say she is not handsome enough to prove a temptation to him. However, when Jane becomes ill on a visit to Netherfield, Lizzy arrives to nurse her sister. Mr. Darcy is impressed with her lively mind, but cannot see himself falling in love with someone from a poorer family.The Bennet's estate at Longbourn is entailed to Mr. Collins, a clergyman who is Mr. Bennet's nearest male relative. In search of a bride, Collins arrives to consider the Bennet daughters while prattling on about his patron, Lady Catherine de Bourgh. Meanwhile, Elizabeth becomes infatuated with George Wickham, a handsome and charming militia officer, who has apparently suffered great personal wrong at the hands of Mr. Darcy. Elizabeth now considers Darcy to be not only proud, but cruel, and she is only to happy to have her own prejudice against him confirmed by Wickham. Bingley is removed to London, where his sisters and Darcy can keep him away from a heartbroken Jane and when Elizabeth refuses Mr. Collins's proposal of marriage, he is accepted by Charlotte Lucas, Elizabeth's best friend, who sees it as a calculated move of social advancement. Even more shocking, Elizabeth receives a second proposal from Mr. Darcy, who speaks disdainfully of her family and ruefully admits he has been unable to conquer his imprudent affection for her. Of course, Elizabeth rejects this insulting proposal as well. But then she begins to learns things that call Wickham's character into serious question, and have her rethinking her low opinion of Mr. Darcy.&quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is probably the most popular of Jane Austen's novels, with its emphasis on character and her comic look at the human condition where considerations of class are ultimately no match for true love and a temperant meeting of similar minds. Certainly we can point to more important novels in the history of Western Literature, but we would be hard pressed to find as important a novelist as Jane Austen, with her rejection of the tenets of Romanticism. Whereas the romantics celebrated the power of emotions, Austen's work embodies a strong belief in rational thinking, which finds no better embodiment than in the character of Elizabeth Bennet. The selection of this as the one Jane Austen novel to read if for some silly reason you decide only to read one in your entire life would be justified on that character more than the plot line."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This will certainly be a classic forever. In this book, she proves how well she can manage a story almost entirely on pure dialogue, for she isnt that very descriptive about her characters or the places they inhabit- she sticks to the basics- but wonderfully constructs all the dialogues throughout the story. Not only are the dialogues very well elaborated and the ones that keep you reading, but in them she very subtly gives a critique about society - reflecting, most probably, her own opinions about her own time and the way society worked. A good critique of her own era.And what to mention of the story itself!!! The dislike between Darcy and Elizabeth , Jane's impossible love for Bingley, Bingley's horrid sisters... she keeps you turning page after page!In any angle that you analyse it, you'll find it to be an excellent book!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is the first novel of Jane Austen that I've read, and I began here because it is such an often quoted novel....and I wasn't disappointed. Granted, I am forty years old....most begin reading JA when they are girls, but I am happy to say that my advanced age did not spoil my enjoyment of the novel.Jane Austen is a superb storyteller with a wonderful sense of humor and insight into the social conventions of her era and the timeless and often humorous relations between men and women.By the time I finished the last page and saw Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy happily married, I sighed and then immediately picked up another Jane Austen novel to read....and intend to continue doing so until I've read all of her novels and hopefully the biography by Carol Shields.Other reviewers will tell you more about the plot....I want to convey the enjoyment you will recieve by reading Jane Austen. Yes there are happy endings....but there is also a lively social satire, conveyed through dialogue and narration, and writing that is beautifully crafted into plots that keep you turning the pages. So start with Pride and Prejudice....and begin a life-long love affair with a great author."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"As embarrassing as it sounds, I must make a confession: I, a male college student, was up till two a.m. on a Saturday finishing this book. In short, the novel is well worth the attention of any personality type, any demographic, any fancy, any interest. It is a marvelous story, written flawlessly, and with such a humorous personality to bind it all together that one might frequently erupt aloud in laughter.The laughter, while abundant and universally entertaining, does not supercede the primary intentions of this novel, signified in the title by &quot;Pride&quot; and &quot;Prejudice.&quot; And, indeed, in these two arenas, Austin succeeds marvelously in creating a tale that thrusts upon the reader both of these emotions, causing him to experience and be embarrassed by his own possession of these two traits. In that case, Pride and Prejudice is a work of pure genius. Especially with the subject of the Prejudice, the reader becomes so involved in the misconceptions and assumptions between one character and another that he is thrown through the tumultuous emotions that form the characters into more just and honorable characters at the novels conclusion.Having had only Sense and Sensibility as a prior introduction to Jane Austin, I emphatically commit that Pride is the greater, more humorous, more emotionally charged, and more intellectually potent novel. To the very degree which the reader wrongfully dislikes--even abhors--certain characters in the book, makes the conclusions finale--long awaited and anxiously feared to be tragic--the more powerful of a climax. Never before have I read a book that so forcefully charged me to reevaluate my own convictions and prejudice of other people. It is truly a masterwork of reader manipulation, as the characters in the book are pulled ride along side, and both the fictional and non-fictional assumptions are cast aside and replaced with shame and embarrassment.In conclusion, there are so many reasons to read this book that it is impossible to deny. Read it for the laughter, for the story, for the passion, for the irrefutable and welcome reversal that it will no doubt spur in each reader who picks the novel up. There is so much to learn and so much fun to be had with this book, that no one should be deprived of the experience."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I read this book when I was 12 and because I had watched the Wishbone show and did not believe that the main character could be a dog. The words were a bit difficult but I read it and was really surprised. It starts out a bit slow, but after the middle, it became really interesting and after the book, I felt really good. I actually read the end a couple times again. The characters are really charming, especially Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth. I guess you could say it was the ultimate miscommunication. It is an adult fairy tale, is what I can describe it as."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"But for this book I have to. I first picked up Austen's P&amp;P when I was in middle school and it failed the 3 chapter test. (You know the test: if you aren't interested in the book by chapter 3 put it down.) I picked it up again a few years later and simply fell in love with the wonderful story.Austen may have written the book over a century ago but the themes that play out within its pages are universal today. Pride, wealth, and station in life are still as important today as they were when Mrs. Bennet was hoping to find husbands for her daughters. In P&amp;P Austen writes about falling in love, how we view it, and how we don't always understand it. Is mutual regard enough for a lasting marriage? What about passion? And does passion or regard equate to love? I reread this book every time I need a reminder that love isn't always fanfares and fireworks."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book was execellent.

I've always liked Jane Austen's style, and I'm much interested in books during this period. This novel is a perfect example about feminine frivolity and Victorian ways of mind. It's also epidemizes the importance of humbleness.All the characters plainly suggest that the highest standard a woman had in during the early 1800's was being a rich man's wife. Pride and Prejudice narrates a story about a poor man's daughters and their stuggles in &quot;catching&quot; a man of high society.Jane, the beauty, longs for the attention of Mr. Bingley, the owner of Netherfield Park. Through parties, dinners, and occasional ailments, their love blossoms into a possible proposal.Elizabeth, the easygoing, proud daughter, battles the intolerably rude and snobby blueblood, Mr. Darcy. Though they can't stand each others company, this friction grows into love. The only problem is their stubborn pride, each refusing to acknowledge the fact that they've fallen for people whom they regard as the scum of the world.Lydia, the youngest and the rashest, hopes to marry the crooked Mr. Wickham, but Wickham has different ideas.I loved Pride and Prejudice, and I recommend this book to anyone who loves romances."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I love this book!

And of course for everyone who haven't. You don't know what you're missing!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The book Pride And Prejudice is a very good novel; it takes place during the 19th century, when women were inferior to men. The title of the novel Pride And Prejudice has an actual meaning in the story that describes the main characters. This novel has some similarities to today's society in various ways.The meaning of the title describes the personality of Darcy and Elizabeth. Darcy had the personality of being proud, and Elizabeth was very prejudiced. The reason Darcy had that personality was because he was a wealthy man who didn't associate with people who were from a lower social class. He didn't have the confidence to tell Elizabeth that he liked her because of his pride. Elizabeth was really prejudiced because before she met people, she distrusted them. Elizabeth thought Darcy's love for her wasn't real when it actually was true. I think the way that Darcy and Elizabeth were acting was foolish because pride and prejudice are not good things to have. It causes problems among people.In the story the strong one was actually the woman because she did not let him play with her and that attracted Darcy to Elizabeth.. Chapter three appealed to me because that was the beginning of all of the misunderstanding in the novel, which made it interesting for the readers to read. The sparks lit up in that chapter. The pride and prejudice of Darcy and Elizabeth started and kept on getting worse throughout the novel because even though they felt an attraction for each other they had misunderstanding that made them have bad feelings. But like all stories it always has a solution at the end. I liked the misunderstanding because it kept on make me feel a great suspense that made me want to keep on reading to find the answer, especially when Darcy asked Elizabeth to dance and was rejected by her. This part of the chapter was the best part because it life me with questions about what was going to happen later in the story with them, and it also confused me because I didn't think that they were going to end up marrying at the end.I liked this book a lot. It is one of my favorite books right now. The rating that the critics gave this book was a wise decision, five stars, because it was well written and interesting. This book is appropriate for people in the age of 14 and up. If you like to read suspense novels, you will like this novel."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, although I found it to be quite difficult to get into at first, proved to be a truely enjoyable reading experience. Despite its difficult language and rather lengthy descriptions and dialog, which tended to confuse me and cause me to lose interest at several points throughout the novel, the plot and events of this book left me in uplifted spirits and with the positive feeling that love truely can overcome any obstacle put in its way. The romance between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, as well as the relationship between Jane and Mr. Bingley, left me guessing throughout the entire novel, and motivated me to trudge through the somewhat uneventful chapters inbetween exciting events. I recommend this book to any person with a high attention span interested in reading an uplifting story about the powers of true love."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It is generally considered a pretty, romantic book - like a swan on a lake. But much like the swan, it's what happening underneath that's important. I have always admired this book for its wit and sharp observations but also for the title. Clever and astute, as usual. But is it Elizabeth who is proud and Darcy who is prejudiced? Or vice versa? Or are they both proud and prejudiced? These questions keep me re-reading this masterpiece at least once a year and I change my mind about the answers every time. This book will give me a lifetime of pleasure."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is probably one of the wittiest and most delightful books I've read in a long time. I recall reading Jane Austen several years ago with Northanger Abbey and I absolutely despised it. But after, adoring the miniseries for Pride and Prejudice, I figured it would do justice to read the book. Pardon my disastrous attempt to sound sophisticated, but it is sometimes amusing to mimic another author's style while reviewing her book. I can hardly wait for Burgess.:PThe book certainly renewed my love for the movie as well as literature of the Victorian era. I've never been a big fan of literature from that time period, despising books like Oliver Twist, Phantom of the Opera, Wuthering Heights and Frankenstein because they dragged on and on with melodrama. Jane Austen varied in the sense that her book was light-hearted and full of comedy and wit.Her characters were lovable. Elizabeth was well-rounded and respectable and if I could have but half her wit in her replies, I would be much indulged. Jane possesses good nature beyond what one would deem natural. Mr.Bingley was good natured as well. And finally, Mr.Darcy who had that air of mystery about him soon grew warm in my heart with his charitable acts. And as the book progressed, I became more and more interested in their well-being and future happiness. However, the most memorable characters would be the secondary characters. Mrs.Bennet was absolutely hilarious. I was equally embarassed as Elizabeth of her mother and her immaturity and lack of understanding. Mr.Bennet on the other hand, with his odd and wry comments provided even more amusement. He has the dryest sense of humour. Lydia is virtually insufferable with her youth and fails to understand any of the pain she has caused her family. Poor Miss Bingley seemed to be such an annoyance to Mr.Darcy with all her attempts to win his attention. And Mr.Collins was a laughable mess. I could not help but love to hate him.Unfortunately, having seen the movie first, I had an irreversible tendency to think of the scenery and the characters in terms of the movie. However, I found it rather pleasurable since this was perhaps the first time I've read a book with a concrete image of the characters and the scenery since I usually ignore such facts and descriptions. The descriptions were never excessive either as they tend to be in Victorian novels. Scenes were never described beyond half a page. Comments were often made on the characters but they never dragged on for pages on end. Usually, at most, they lasted about half a page. As for the emotions of the characters, Jane Austen did not linger on them for long. Enough indications were given to entice the reader, but not excessively as to bore.The dialogue was the most memorable and quotes of Austen popped out everyone. I was disappointed to find that at certain places, Austen merely described the coversation instead of actually carrying it out through dialogue.I find the book is still nevertheless romantic in nature and more redeeming to females as it would be to males. But I suppose all you guys are just missing out! I'm not normally a fan of romance but the book pursues it with such intelligence that I could not help but like it. I'm still a bit unconvined of the actual plausibility of the marriages in the story but they seem so satisfying, you might as well take them to be true. Romance books are nice in the sense that in the end, that undeniable happy ending is always guaranteed to be there to satisfy. And overall, Pride and Prejudice and satisfied me at the end with a warm and happy ending but nevertheless leaving me wanting to know more of the characters. It is book whose charm lies in the style and the characters and could be easily read over and over again. This book definitely will be one of my favourites.My goodness, I am embarassed by my own review. I sound like such a ...!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I must admit that this is a very well written book: the situations, the characters, the idea. I must also admit, though, that for that very fact, I didn't enjoy the book. The book was a comedy of manners on society and people. Most of the people were irritating, and I couldn't get into it.

For me, it was a perfect introduction to the Classics. The language is similar to books such as Anna Karenina and the like, but there is an element of humor that even us twentieth century dimwits can relate to. Sometimes subtle, and sometimes not, Jane Austen keeps us on our toes with her eighteenth-century characters that somehow manage to be hip. No matter who you are, you will find yourself rooting for one or another of the characters as they struggle for something ... if not hapiness, then an extremely desirable position in life."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This review is for the Recorded Books Classics Library on CD.Austen is Austen, so the quality of her writing and character observation will ultimately elevate any spoken performance of her text. Of the dozen or so books I've listened to in the Recorded Books Classic Library series, though, this is the first where I really felt the reader let me down.Flo Gibson reads fast, notjustbriskbutfast. I understand the desire to keep things moving, especially in a text that has as many descriptive passages as narrative ones, but I also think Austen needs to be savored a bit to be optimally enjoyed. The cadence never quite gets to the point where the reader is talking so fast that you can't understand her, but it does get to the point where you really have to listen intently, which can be hard to do while driving (which is where most people I know listen to books on CD). I found myself rewinding or back skipping the CD several times to say, \\"What was that phrase?\\" Again, not enough to ruin it, but enough to make it a more frustrating experience than a pleasurable one.Acceptable for those familiar with the novel who want to revisit it, but if this is your first time through, do yourself a favor and curl up with the book first. You won't regret it.[For a good contrast or alternative, check out Barbara Caruso's reading of Edith Wharton's The House of Mirth in the same series; it is superb.]"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I started reading this Kindle edition today and was very put off by the ALL CAPS used for emphasis.

It applies only to the edition of P&P; with ASIN 'B008476HBM' (Pride and Prejudice) and only on basic Kindle, Paperwhite, and Kindle Touch (these pay attention to language attributes so as to use a 'matching' dictionary).This happens to be the only edition of P&P; enabled for WhisperSync for Voice (with a free audiobook available from Audible) which is why I got this edition and have discovered this issue.Otherwise, the formatting is good, and (so far as I've read) free of typos.

We all know it as a timeless classic and it's difficult to review. What can I say that hasn't already been said? Thus, I'll continue.Lizzy Bennett: She's grown up in a humble and somewhat poor family. The only people she really see's eye to with in her family are her father and her sister. She's stubborn, passionate and proud of her family and life style.Darcy: He's grown up in a rich family and taught that he is the best as far as social interaction. His parents have since died and he is extremely close to his only and younger sister. He's persistent, quiet and sure he is the highest ranking person.So when the two meet, they're not exactly fond of each other. In fact, there's immediately animosity on both ends. They don't really expect to see each other often until Darcy's best friend falls for Elizabeth's sister. Inevitably they are brought together on numerous occasions. And as time goes by his feeling toward her change drastically.I realize that I could never give the story justice. It's classic for a reason. Beautifully written and surprisingly easy to relate to. It is also a great insight for the time period. A must read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The novel Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen intrigued me just by its mysterious title in which the two seemingly irrelevant words are put together. After I finished the first reading, I was impressed with her witty and sophisticated language that enlivened the characters with distinctive features and the descriptions of landscapes and atmospheres of that certain time period. Moreover, the most remarkable aspect of this novel was the title itself- Pride and Prejudice. The two words do not agree upon a uniform theme but after the reading, I could make multiple links between the plots/themes of the novel and the title. The only aspect I did not really enjoy was how the basic structure of the entire essay was stereotypical and the plots being somewhat hackneyed to the readers who are exposed to a wide range of romance novels.Before I started the novel, I could not really expect in advance what would happen and how the characters would advance. However, as I finished up the novel, my curiosity was fully disentangled. Some readers may interpret the title as Darcy being the proud character and Elizabeth being the prejudiced character. However, from another perspective, one can also interpret the title as that both characters are prejudiced by their first impressions and their social classes and are blinded by their pride, which explains why they both continue to be put in a form of conflict. Either way, the title lets the readers expect something that they have never thought and thus turns the thing around after the reading, which maximizes the dramatic aspects of all.Jane Austen's use of language is certainly highly sophisticated and classy especially when she describes the background scenes or setting of 18th century of England. Without watching movies, I could easily imagine each scene vividly. When she describes Longbourn, a typical country town, or Darcy's estate, it gave me right away an impression of what it was like during that epoch. Also, not only her picturesque and descriptive language, but her actualizations of the atmosphere of that certain era were directly conveyed to me that I once thought I was one of those daughters of Bennet family. She uses lots of details to offer the most explicit mood of realistic lives of an ordinary family in England and she successes regard to that.Austen's characters and perspectives are also some aspects that did captivate me a lot. The protagonists Elizabeth Bennet and Darcy stand out as very distinctive characters but minor charactors such as Jane, Bingley, Collins, Wickham, Lydia, Lady Catherine, and even her parents play tasteful roles that keep the novel stimulating until the end. The setting and background of this novel is something to focus on also because the lives of people in England during 18th-19th century were typical while the novel and plots deviate from such clich&eacute; by Austen making characters unique and distinguished. Elizabeth Bennet is unlike other women who were expected to be obedient and passive; Elizabeth seems vigorous in expressing her opinions, honest, straightforward and intelligent (and problematically she knows it too well). In a scene where Elizabeth confronts Lady Catherine, she does not fall back or cringes due to her lower class, but rather, she stands up defending herself and remain confident in saying what she wants to say to Lady Catherine. Her unique characteristic definitely explains why Darcy is so attracted to her in the first place.Austen integrates basic components of the lives of ordinary people naturally so that the readers today can easily compare their lives to that of old live and easily understand and even sympathize with the characters. She makes several conflicts between different class such as between Elizabeth and Lady Catherine or Ms. Bingley looking down on Jane to demonstrate how class distinction was so conspicuous during that time period. Also, the typical mindsets of women are displayed when Mrs. Bennet is very desperate to let all her five children be married to rich men or when Elizabeth's friend, Charlotte marries to Mr. Collins even without love. It was a prevalent thought back then that love is not the most chief determinant in marriage (This is why Elizabeth-Darcy relationship is more enthralling). The readers today can easily perceive what it was like in England by reading the novel and place themselves in the middle of the setting. Nonetheless, along with this, it was also an intriguing component that Austen used four different couples to demonstrate that diverse situations allowing the readers to compare.Except the fact that the basic structure of the novel was formulaic, I enjoyed the novel and I would like to recommend to those of my age because anyone of my age could easily relate to Elizabeth and be easily impressed by her attractive characteristics and eye-catching development of Elizabeth and Darcy's beautiful relationships."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It wasn't hard to not like, but it is introduced to me by my mom. In fact, it is her favorite translated books and so well known, it connected us to a time where everyone still cared about society decorum. It was more about finding love and still believe domestic live is still good for reason. It made women look good but made the truth more bearable about the constant bickering around home. It explained like Mr. Roger in the Neighborhood about who is coming and going in the social circle, and it made serious strive to explain the role of women in society and politics, but it did not aim to increase their role. It was a cup of tea on the role of gentlemen in their children's education, and it made their role around home more explainable. It made warring segment of the society less popular, but it reflected the sentiment of the times, it made peace more acceptable and finding the person to share life more condoned. It was the voice of the unpopular and the bluestocking type of \\"Jane\\" at the time, who wants their men to stay home and their women to enjoy the social life more. It is nothing but deplorable people who marry unsuitably and this reasoning made it ways to every nook and craning, essentially, it set out to destroy as much of unsuitable marriage as possible. But it did this elegantly, and the main character there, Elizabeth and Darcy, as well as Jane and Bingley as good as married. It does not seek to destroy any more thinking process on the other facets of the ordinary life in unordinary times, but it brought unrealized expectations as well. The thoughts of English ways does not prevail in their society is like reducing the mind to think only of the times they were conquered by the Normans, but it does not however, make the case for the natural ways people will continue to live their life as much as possible. So, at the end, everyone hoorayed at the English marriages and made sure whoever named Eliza will marry Fitzwilliam Darcy in the End, and not anyone forgot about Jane as well.The less known character then all got their satisfaction and knowledge that they all had their share of matrimony of stable life, which in fact, is the well-known intent of Jane Austen in almost every single one of her books. Perhaps all of them, though their maybe one or two which is read by the reviewer or because it is only partially finished. Most like the latter.So, who really cares about the malapropism of the weaker characters or the seldom attuned to reality Eliza, it was actually more fun to read it and not have to over think on who could possibly love the Darcy and Bingley set of the world. It was so well described, and it made the whole Bingley and friends' family the most beloved or the most hated family of all time. It made their social gatherings the crown of the gazette, all to serve and divert the attentions of the war. It also made some of their actions unforgiving at the same time as well, so in as much as the Bennet family created happiness by entertaining their social circles, it made the Bingley family more unimpeachable when the made the match for their son, right when they made the error of crossing over their duties their neighbors for more frivolous things like work and better gain for themselves.Reading through Pride and Prejudice is also a worrisome venture when in fact the reader is often at a loss on how to cope with the idea that Jane Austen herself is at the lower level of the society, without either access to explain their actual lives or scientific tools to deduce on how people like the unforgiving aunt of Darcy. It took witticism and it took the audacity to write based on hearsay, and it made philosophy more acceptable to women, perhaps. Least in my opinion it did."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I couldn't find anywhere whether or not this was an abridged or unabridged version.

I guess you get what you pay for, right?"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The marriage, property and inheritance laws of the late 18th and early 19th century, by today's standards, can be considered cruelly misogynistic.The Bennett family estate is entailed and, as Mr Bennett's family consists of his wife and five daughters (nary a son in sight), there is a strong likelihood that, when he passes away, the six surviving ladies will be left homeless and with no income or property. Mrs Bennett is deeply concerned with the situation and frantically searches for the expedient solution of the day (marriage to an eligible man of property whose family would provide her daughters with both a home and settlement of a suitable annual stipend for living expenses). On the other hand, Mr Bennett's approach is much more relaxed and he gives the impression that he feels the marriage of his daughters will take care of itself in due course and that all will ultimately turn out for the best.PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, told primarily from the point of view of Elizabeth Bennett, the most sensible daughter in a family of ladies whose general attitude seems to be quite vapid and utterly self-centered, is a story driven not so much by plot as by character development combined with a comedic critique of the issues of early 19th century mores among the landed gentry - manners, upbringing, morality, education, marriage, conventions, etiquette, leisure, societal behaviour and so on. It might be compared to a much more modern equivalent in F Scott Fitzgerald's THE GREAT GATSBY or on a considerably lighter note, television's famous sitcom SEINFELD. The common factor here ... in a background of purely social commentary, nothing of note really happens. The social commentary IS the story!PRIDE AND PREJUDICE has withstood the onslaught of time and remains to this day (and justifiably so) one of the most popular novels in the entire pantheon of English literature.Highly recommended.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I had to read this for school, but I actually turned out liking it.

I am now surprised at myself that I had not read a single Jane Austen book at nearly 30. I fully intend on reading all of her works. I loved how dialogue based this novel is."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I read this for the umpteenth time on the PC Kindle, and the formatting seemed fine to me, so maybe it's been sorted by now. Either that or I was so bedazzled by the story that I simply didn't notice any problems.A librarian once remarked to me, upon my commenting how few people were in the library that particular day, that if people had to pay to gain access the line would be around the block. This seemed to me to display a wise understanding of human nature.Just because something is free does not mean it is worthless, any more than there being a guarantee that something costing a lot is bound to be valuable. The reason this book is always free on Kindle is that it is long out of copyright. This fact alone shows that it has stood the test of time, along with Jane Austen's other novels.Many people shy away from reading so-called classic novels. They feel that they will be full of long descriptions or such dated language that the narrative will be impossible to penetrate. To anyone reading this book for the first time, therefore, the writing will be a revelation. It is perceptive and witty in its social commentary, and full of interesting, sympathetic (and sometimes unsympathetic) characters who remain forever in the memory.The story itself is the great-great-great-grandmother of all romances, even predating Jane Eyre, which so many people liken to Mills & Boon or Silhouette romances. The heroine and her hero are real, flawed people rather than cardboard cutouts. When you consider that Jane Austen's settings and characters genuinely reflect her own time (the late 18th/early 19th century), rather than being researched in modern times, there is added interest from both cultural and historic perspectives.If you have never read this novel, regarded by many as the writer's best, please don't pass on it this time. Not only is it a wonderful experience in itself, but it may open for you literary doors to other fascinating worlds that you have kept firmly closed until now. If you have already read it once, of course, this review is preaching to the converted, for you have probably done so several times, with its charms only increasing with every reading."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It is the first book I happened to read on my Kindle.

The topic at hand was Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, and the class was a noisy, disrespectful circus. It may be that this novel is essentially inaccessible now to all but a handful of young readers, and probably many older ones as well. A terrible shame!The book has much to teach us, after all, about the human condition, and the ways in which we handicap ourselves in the pursuit of happiness. Elizabeth's travails, and Mr. Darcy's, are as much self-inflicted as they are levied by the society in which they live. That said, Austen has an exceedingly generous and sympathetic touch with all of her characters, and the novel is one of the funnier pieces of the period. It goes without saying (or should) that her mastery of the English language is without peer."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Great read I loved the descriptions and I want to applaud the author.Be get the red fall but then"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I had never read this book but always heard about it....loved it,great exppression on the turmoils of the human heart and people in general."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a wonderful classic novel.

He is a rich and seemingly arrogant gentleman and she is a poor and very feisty young lady in a large, happy family of girls who must marry well.

They clearly love and care for books as much as I would hope - so do not hesitate to buy from this publisher."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"From time to time I read a critical opinion on Pride and Prejudice that, while acknowledging its excellence, wonders why Jane Austen could not in her genius provide some more gravitas. It's rather more observant and intelligent than your run-of-the-mill romance, to be sure, but a romance it is at bottom. No political savvy, no real attempt to face the role of women in Regency England, just a cute love story with an enjoyably satirical bent. Miss Jane herself seemed to agree with that assessment - she once called it \\"a little bit, two inches wide, of ivory\\". Decorative, but hardly important.Would someone please tell me what these people were reading? It certainly isn't the same book that I read. Or the one that thousands of people have fallen in love with and has produced at least four separate movie and television versions (which is a detail that allows me to give away certain plot points below, confident that most people already know them).It is indeed a very romantic love story, if by romance we mean the attempt of people to open themselves up and accept each other with their good and bad qualities - not only accept each other, but admire each other and want to be together just as they are. That process is difficult enough in this day and age, with the whole lot of us positively encouraged to be as frank as possible. Back in Miss Jane's day it seems to have been a good deal harder, what with the restrictions placed on people in the way of acceptable behavior and the disastrous consequences for breaking the social rules.If, however, we understand \\"romance\\" to mean the story of a woman who doesn't know her own mind, who has been so hurt that she can't stand the thought of love, who is too headstrong to allow anyone to tame her, and/or who eventually finds her way into the arms of a muscular hero type and melts on the spot (which is, after all, exactly what happens in plenty of perfectly good romance novels), that's not precisely what we have here. To be sure, the heroine of Pride and Prejudice does indeed begin the story entirely too headstrong to submit to marriage for its own sake, and she certainly finds her way into the arms of a man she previously despised (offstage, of course), but she doesn't exactly melt. It would be more accurate to say that she learns to think for herself. Whereas before she rejected her society's more foolish standards by reflex, she gradually comes to accept or reject what she's told by thinking it over first. And people think that Jane Austen didn't consider the place of women in her world? That there's no understanding of the big picture in Pride and Prejudice? Baloney.Now, Pride and Prejudice doesn't mention the big picture very often, although it's always present. The Bennett sisters get into trouble largely because a company of militia moves into a nearby village, and you and I both know that they're there to drill and train because at some point they will probably have to go fight against Napoleon Bonaparte, even though no one ever mentions his name. The sisters also have problems because they have no brothers, and know that a distant male relative will therefore inherit their house when their father dies. Rather than complain about these various disasters, though, the author shows us what their effects are upon the family in its daily life - the temptation to a group of young woman of handsome men in uniform hanging around, the scramble for advantageous marriages, and of course the question of whether one ought to seek a man one loves or a man with money if one can't have both. Great authors know, especially when it comes to two-inch pieces of ivory, that it's much more powerful to show the impact of great historical events than to talk about them. Jane Austen was a very great author.If she simply showed the workings of her society, though, she would have been simply a very good essayist, not a great author. Fortunately for us, she was also an extraordinary stylist, and she had an enormous gift for irony, very much on display in Pride and Prejudice right from the famous first sentence. That same twinkle remains in Miss Jane's eye right through the first sentence of the last chapter - \\"Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennett got rid of her two most deserving daughters.\\" Few authors would dare spend hundreds of pages setting up two weddings and then dismiss them both like that. It's positively delicious. With that kind of language, that sly inclusion of social criticism and such intriguing characters as Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy, you can call Pride and Prejudice a cute little romance if you want, but I'm warning you - it has hidden depths.Don't let that scare you, though. I told you, it's delicious.

I fell completely in love. I had to buy it for myself. I already knew the story, having read it a few times myself, but hearing it read on this set, it was so much more beautiful. Ms. Williams voice is lovely, I love the way she speaks as Lady Catherine, and her voice for Lydia. Both hilarious but real, exactly as I would expect them to sound were I there.This is one of my very favorite stories ever, and Ms. Williams made it that much more wonderful for me. I recommend this product to everyone in the world."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"There is no other story told and re-told as much as P&P. This book transcends many generations with a true and tested story. The characters and story line are so similiar to this day and age.

Correcting this mistake proved interesting. While the style is dated, Austen's take on \\"polite society\\" is very funny and the title particularly apt.The characters remain true to their own inner logic and this comedy of false assumptions plays out to a pleasent and thoughtful end. I don't know if I feel obligated to read the rest of Austen's work, but I do agree her work has withstood the test of time very well."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen is a pretty good book although there are some dull moments for me as a reader. As for female readers, they will probably enjoy this book greatly and it will most likely become a great book for them. As for male readers, it will probably be dull for you just like me.The story most of the time is centered on one girl named Elizabeth and there are many fights over whom will marry who. Many events happen and after some of Elizibeth's lovers have been taken by other rich people who have power, she settles over a person called Mr. Darcy who has known their family for many years and seems to notice everything going around and gives an aura of some sort to other people. Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy marry and the book ends there.Overall this book is a pretty good book and I enjoyed some parts of it fairly well."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Gotta love this classics.

Everyone can get something out of it, whether that be knowledge, or just another wonderful and fun read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"\\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\\"With that incredible sentence Jane Austen draws the reader into her story. Is she serious we ask? 'A truth universally acknowledged' is the language of mathematics, of science, of logic; it is like saying: \\"we are dealing with self-evident truths--axioms.\\"How does this statement apply to society? to families? to manners?Although I have read many articles and reviews on Pride and Prejudice, its perennial enchantment has eluded me until now. What makes this novel a favorite of so many readers after so many years?The title to begin with, is provocative. Both terms pride and prejudice are applicable to Elizabeth Bennet and Darcy. But prejudice is directed more towards Darcy than Elizabeth. I would have like Jane Austen to use the word 'Prejudgement' as opposed to prejudice because the former word is laden with situational biases such as when Darcy prejudges Elizabeth: \\"She is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt me.\\"Ah, the title is also alliterative; and it would have also worked with prejudgment.Not wanting to walk along the trodden path I want to propose a few personal impressions. First, it is a syntactically flawless--British English at its best-- narrative which is never boring; perhaps due to Austen's adroit handling of the Indirect Free Speech. Second, the characters are diverse: some attractive (Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy, Jane and Bingley) and others picturesque (Charlotte Lucas and Mr. Collins, Mrs. Bennet, and Lady Catherine de Bourgh). Third, that it is a moral work in which not only good manners and judicious decisions are privileged, but also virtue.When Plato cast poets and artists out of his Utopian Republic, little did he realize that one can learn virtue from literature as well as from philosophy. And that is a 'truth universally acknowledged.'[...]"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"i thank god for ms austen. amazing writing, i just don't have the words.

I have wanted to read this work for a long time after becoming interested in 19th Century classics, I wasn't disappointed. Lizzie being so bright and level headed was refreshing in comparison to her younger sisters and even with her older sister Jane, the kindest one. The one character, Mr. Darcy was hard to understand his aloofness to the point of being extremely rude just didn't seem to fit at first meeting since later in the book he showed himself to be so totally compassionate and sensitive to Lizzie's trouble's with her younger sister's plight.

The characters, especially Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy are quite well drawn. One of the best aspects of the novel is the vantage point from which it is written.The reader learns everything through Elizabeth Bennet's point of view and sees the world through her prejudices. The point of view broadens as Elizabeth develops as a character and loses her prejudices, particularly against Mr. Darcy.Pride and Prejudice continues to be extremely popular and inspires many spin-offs including Pride and Prejudice and Zombies. Its influence on English literature and its continued appearance in popular culture alone make it worth reading.Trev @ trevsliteraryreview.blogspot.com"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is a really good story, it has been revised, so I was a little disappointed by that.

The art of which the author incorporated the economical push on relationships was done very well!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"As I find with most \\"classics\\" this novel took some time to completely capture my interest. Once it did, however, I was completely enchanted. Our 21st century need for speed and immediate gratification takes a backseat as we move with Jane Austen through the every day lives and loves of her characters. The slow but steady pace of the novel allows the time to actually get to know and connect with the characters. Austen brings you fully into her world of 19th century England: with no difficulty you can feel the joys and sorrows, happiness and tribulations of the Bennet sisters and especially Elizabeth and Jane.Classic themes: scheming mothers, class distinctions, vanity, pride,false assumptions and misunderstandings abound...until by the novel's conclusion I could not help but find myself rooting for Elizabeth and Darcy.I thoroughly recommend this to anyone who loves classics and doesn't mind the slow pace that generally characterizes them."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Adopted the thrift edition of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice to reduce the textbook expenses for a college-level literature class.

The story is a mixture of intrigue and passion with an appropriate ending. The goog guy should always triumph!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I admit I'm one of those bibliophiles who collects the different editions of favorite titles, and I could not resist this cover by artist Ruben Toledo. The book itself is a classic, and timeless in its appeal. Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a well-written satire on the hypocrisies of Regency society as exposed through her various well-delineated characters. Mrs. Bennet is eager to marry off her five daughters - the beautiful and quiet Jane, the strong-willed Elizabeth, Mary, Kitty and flighty Lydia. So when a young man of means moves into neighboring Netherfield Park, Mrs. Bennet is determined that one of her daughters should snag the gentleman in question, Mr. Bingley. Mrs. Bennet's character is truly a caricature and an almost scathing portrayal of the society of the time - mothers desperate to see their daughters married off, especially given the Bennets' predicament - with no male heir, the family home and fortune would be entailed away from the Bennets' in the event of Mr. Bennet's death.It is also a harsh criticism of the hypocrisy and pride of the ruling classes as well-embodied in the character of Fitzwilliam Darcy, whose pride makes him look down upon the Bennets and the rest of society not equal to his own station, though of course he doesn't count upon his own traitorous feelings when he falls for Elizabeth Bennet (whose prejudice against Darcy almost blinds her to the flaws in another). The lively and almost fiery exchanges between Elizabeth and Darcy are one of the most interesting and captivating aspects of the novel. There are a host of other characters that make this novel an engrossing read - the haughty Lady Catherine de Bourgh who is hell-bent on marrying off her sickly daughter to Darcy, the comical and 'greasy' Mr. Collins who reveals his own mercenary tendencies despite being a man of the cloth, the morally bankrupt Mr. Wickham, and many others. It is a delightful tale of the battle between the social classes, and a wonderful character study. Though the language takes some getting used to (it can appear quite stilted to those unused to reading this style of writing - the flowery, stuffy sort), the story itself is compelling enough to make it a worthwhile read. In fact, having fallen in love with the novel about two decades ago, I've since re-read it countless times!As for this particular cover by Ruben Toledo, I have to say it makes for a fun interpretation of the dynamics between Elizabeth and Darcy, the novel's two main characters. Illustrated in black and white with the characters presented in silhoutte, this is a fun and inspired take on the classic which will extend this novel's appeal to a younger generation of readers. This is a novel to be savored time and again - highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"There are literally thousands of review of Austen's seminal classic Pride And Prejudice out there already.

I know there is a lot that I'm missing since I'm not an Austen expert on her subtleties and innuendos on society, but that's what makes it a timeless classic...it still speaks to everyone even without knowing everything that she was intimating in her social commentary.

So give it a try!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"My copy of P & P had pages falling out so I browsed for a replacement and I really liked this cover.I really love the whole new look Penguin Classic Deluxe has going on."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is undoubtedly one of the most beloved classic novels in history -- it's had countless adaptations, sequels and homages lavished on it over the years.And Jane Austen's grand opus is still beloved for a good reason. While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of a halfway decent marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...Reading \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Lizzie and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Jane Austen about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).The only real problem: Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.But despite that formality, Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other. She also wrote some unbelievably sharp-edged dialogue with plenty of witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But Austen also weaves in startlingly romantic moments between them (\\"No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting\\").It's hard to imagine a better fictional couple than Lizzie and Darcy, despite their rocky start (a major-league snub at a dance). Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways, with quick minds and even quicker tongues. Darcy is a selfish, rather haughty man man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.It also has a solid supporting cast: the painfully practical Charlotte Lucas, slimy clerics, virtuous-looking rakes, sisters ranging from saintly to snobby, and the lovable Mr. Bingley and perpetually optimistic Jane. Lizzie's family also adds plenty of color to the story, including the screechy and hilariously mercurial Mrs. Bennett and the barb-tongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love. An absolute must-read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is made for everyone!It is hardly ever slow, although some people might not be use to the writing style of that time, and has a delightful, strong lead heroine who never falters in her strength like most female characters now-a-days.So beautifully written and should be in everyone's bookcase"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Great writer and one of the best observation of human social interaction and capturing the associated emotions.of social interaction.

She Has a great writing style and knows what it takes to make a good book. The clashes between Darcy and Elizabeth are pricless and add zing to the book.I wish she had written a sequel though. Looking forward to reading her other books!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice was originally written by Jane Austen in 1797, but it was not published until 16 years later. Jane Austen was born in 1775 in southwest England. She was born to a middle-class family, and her background greatly influenced her writing, which is evident in Pride and Prejudice.Pride and Prejudice is the story of Elizabeth Bennet and her family. Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth's mother, wants nothing more than for her five daughters to be married off to wealthy men as soon as possible. Lydia and Kitty, the two youngest daughters, like to flirt with the officers that are stationed in a nearby town. Mary is content to sit at home and read books. Jane, the oldest daughter, grows attached to Mr. Bingley, a wealthy, single man who recently moved to town. Elizabeth is a lively girl who always speaks what she feels. She begins to have a relationship with Mr. Darcy, Mr. Bingley's extremely wealthy friend. She denies a marriage proposal twice in the book, much to her mother's dismay.The title Pride and Prejudice is an example of some of the issues Jane Austen talks about throughout the novel. Most of the characters in this book show signs of pride and prejudice in their behavior. Characters in all classes have prejudices against each other. Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth are prime examples of the pride and prejudice that occurs during the novel. They both have a tendency to judge harshly, even against each other. Their pride keeps them from expressing their true feelings.This was an excellent book, and I recommend it to anyone looking to read a great classic. At first it seemed a little slow, but the book became more interesting as it went along and I truly enjoyed reading it. Though I don't normally enjoy such flowery language, it seemed to fit this story and the characters very well. Once I got used to the language of the book, I really got into it and it was fun to read. This book had interesting characters and a happy ending. I would definitely choose Pride and Prejudice as my favorite classic book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I just started reading Jane Austen, and already I'm a life time fan. At times it can be a bit difficult to understand, only because of the old english used in that time. Besides that it is a wonderful story. It has it all, characters you will love and love to hate. I could not put it down, and when I was finished it was bitter sweet. I felt as if I knew these characters personally, and in me ending this book was like ending our friendship. That may sound silly but ask anyone who loves Jane Austen and they would agree... All of her books are beautiful and if you are serious about reading you will love it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"If you haven't read the book Pride and Prejudice, it is one I would quickly recommend. I am at the moment reading classics and currently in the middle of reading most of Jane Austen's books. All her stories are delightful, but I can honestly say that this one is my favorite so far. It has a good and interesting storyline, as well as some very likable and some unlikable characters. You will quickly grow to like Elizabeth and her sister Jane, while their mother and younger sisters may annoy you to no end. All in all though it is a good book.For those of you who are not familiar with the story, it is the tale of Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy, who at the beginning of the book seem to be polar opposites, with the only thing in common being their great dislike for each other. The story also involves Elizabeth s sister Jane and Mr. Darcy s best friend Mr. Bingley, though Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy are by far the main characters. Besides having quite a bit of witty dialogue, it has a few surprising turn of events that seem to make the book even more interesting. At first like Elizabeth, you too may greatly dislike Mr. Darcy, but as the book goes on he tends to grow on you, and by the end of the book, you'll be firmly in love with both of them.A good lesson can be pulled from the book as well. Elizabeth jumped to conclusions and let some people prejudice her against Mr. Darcy, while at the beginning of the book Mr. Darcy was as proud and arrogant as could be. Which can teach that we need to be careful on judging other people, because the way they act and what we may hear about them may be entirely false. It s also a good illustration on how pride can really mess up your relationships with others.If you're interested in reading this book then go for it, and don't let the fact that it s quite a long book deter you. Take the book in strides. I know I usually read very fast, but at first I read it rather slowly and I honestly didn't really enjoy it until I got to section two of the book. So even if at first you don't like it, try to keep reading, it gets better as you go on. It really does! Don t let the fact that it's a classic, written in the early 1800s bother you either, broaden your horizons a bit and learn to appreciate classic literature- it's truly a delight. After all, they had to become famous classics for a reason! So enjoy your turn at Pride and Prejudice, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Austen is undeniably important in the history of british culture and the central themes of this book fully justify her position, particularly the idea of female emancipation. That said great themes do not make interesting reads (e.g anything by Hegel). What makes this book is the writing, the prose is light and fast and you can't deny she has a sense of humour. Great book, makes it's points without bludgeoning you on the head."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"If you want to understand \\"relationships\\" better ( I would like to think we all do) and you have limited time, that you can use to read, say, \\"Pscychology Today\\" and watch Oprah and Dr. Phill -- or read Jane Austen's great work -- I say go with Jane. You will learn more and enjoy a classical reading experience in the process."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is my mom's favorite book, which I have finally read this year after long years of her trying to get me to read it. Since I had to read Sense and Sensibility for my college course, I went on to reading all of Austen's novels. I am currently on my last one; Persuasions. Pride and Prejudice is the most popular of Austen's novel, I think, and for good reason. The characters are funny and interesting, the plot is original, and the social satire of England in Austen's time is hugely enjoyable. Elizabeth Bennet, Austen's own favorite character, is a headstrong, affectionate girl who represents the \`prejudice' of the title. And Fitzwilliam Darcy (aka Mr. Darcy, but I like his name O_O) is the \`pride' and is filthy rich, arrogant and rude. It goes without saying that I fell in love with him at first sight (or first mention of him in the story). Mr. Darcy, Mr. Knightly and that hero from Northanger Abbey are the cutest heroes of all Austen's novels!!! (=^-^=) &lt;Purrrrr)Anyhoo, enough drooling. (Mentally slaps face-get your act together--!!)The characters of the novel, though the most colorful and animated, are also the least believable. They are larger than life, great for the story, but I don't see them as flesh and blood people. Mrs.Bennet, with her obsession for marrying her daughters is perfectly understandable, but her happiness even when one girl elopes with a good-for-nothing, and the way she won't understand her husband's complete disapproval is just mind-boggling. The stupid characters are soooo stupid, Elizabeth's father- even though he is very likeable- is actually a pretty bad father concerning his duties towards his daughters and fear for their welfare, though all that changes near the end.In any case, I loved the book, it was funny and highly enjoyable. I'm glad I read it. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in reading a classic, and even those who are not. If you don't mind quaint-sounding passages and writing that is sometimes a bit confusing, try out Jane Austen. Once you get the hang of the language you can really enjoy this great book!! Buy it now!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"i am fourteen years old. i am an avid reader. i read pride and prejudice when i was in 8th grade. i have now read it atleast 4 times. my friend had let me borrow her book telling me it was good. i just started reading for the heck of it. i finished it in a week, which is hard considering how much work i usually have. but, anyways, the book is excellent. elizabeth is the perfect heroine for any novel. she is witty, intellingent, kind, and pretty. she is the perfect female. mr. darcy is a man. proud yet sweet in his own way. they are perfect. mrs. bennet is a character of her own. lydia is amusing. the whole book is great. it has humor, romance, wit, and a great plot, all in one book. it isn't overly lengthy like many other jane austen novels. it is has more brevity than other novels. it is certainly sweet. it allows you to relate to characters in your own way. maybe it could be the siblings, suitors, parents, loves, or anything. but it definitely worth it. if you haven't read it you must. if you have read it and don't own it, you have to buy it. i have already read it 4 times, and i can't get tired of it. it is just a satisfying read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Though I have heard much praise of Jane Austen, this is the first time I've actually sat down and read one of her books. I was impressed. Though the plot would seem shallow now (it centers around marriages); then that was central to most women's hopes and desires. Besides the plot, the characters are amusing and Elizabeth is finely drawn. She is very self-confidant and will not allow others to look down on her for her ill upbringing. I don't believe men would enjoy this book, because the male figure is not drawn very realistically. I seriously doubt that all men thought or talked about were marriage and love. Walter Raleigh phrased it correctly by saying that &quot;Austen's men wouldn't be allowed in any club in England!&quot;. I didn't find it to be at all boring, rather, a page-turner to see how everything was going to turn out (though in the end it became predictable). The formal language is confusing at times, but provides a bit more color with it's detail. Though many parts of the book are obviously contrived, and I feel as if Austen is trying a little too hard to invoke emotion within me, in many ways the book is ahead of it's time, and for that, it is commendable to be certain."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"PNP was a delight to read. I'm not a fan of Jane Austen. I was in fact, dismissive of her work as being too boring and feminist (though I insist that the two are not necessarily related!) which led me to pick up this novel to see for myself. For a story so well told, it's surprisingly well paced with little attention to insignificant details and events. I would have though Jane Austen novels spent page after page describing beautiful English scenery but it's feelings and relationships that are the focus of PNP. I can now understand why it's hugely popular with women; it reads like a very sophisticated soap opera. There are handsome young men and ladies, a dodgy character or two to make things interesting, and romantic entanglements aplenty. I quite enjoyed following the relationship of Elizabeth Bennet and the enigmatic Darcy. Things change a lot in 200 years, but not when it comes to love. The language could be hard for many to grasp, but that is my only reservation. Pride And Prejudice is a fine book and one I recommend to anyone."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This review was written by my class's literature circle group:Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen, was a humorous tale of love and drama. It all starts when Mr. Bingley, a rich man moved to town. His friend, Mr. Darcy, moves in with him. When they attended a ball they meet Elizabeth Bennet, a very prejudice woman, and the story changed drastically. Will they ever set aside there differences? Will they ever fall in love...?In this book the characters vary a great deal in their personalities. Elizabeth Bennet is the very prejudice character. She often will voice her opinion but she normally won't show her true feelings when she likes someone. Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy is very proud; partly because he is rich and partly because he is very argumentative. He, like Elizabeth, doesn't show his true feelings toward someone. Jane Bennet is the character that is always in a good mood and tries to see the silver lining of any problem. Mr. Bingley is a rich man who is good natured and is a very welcoming person. He has very good manners and is very gentleman like. All of theses characters make this a very unique, well thought-out book. The author, Jane Austen, makes this story believable because things that happen in this story are just like real life.The plot of this story was definitely the love and drama of life. It shows the tough spots you can have in life. An example of the main theme was when Mr. Darcy tells Elizabeth he loves her and his affection is denied by the young girl. This book shows how life isn't perfect. There is definitely going to be rough patches along the way. That is why this book is so great, is because it isn't a fairy tale where every thing is perfect. That is why we believe this book is such a wonderful classic.The main style of Pride and Prejudice is old English. The author,Jane Austen, made this very clear early on. Some of the things that happen during this book, because of the style, leaves great pictures in your head. Jane keeps you interested in this book by making believable when she uses real life situations. That is what makes this book a one of a kind story.We rated the book Pride and Prejudice around 4 stars. The old English language in this book is harder to understand and must be fully understood. The many humorous parts in this book help make it a classic. Jane Austen helps you connect to the women's point of view in the 1800's. The author did very well on this book by showing how to love and be loved. We would recommend this book to anyone who can understand the style of Pride and Prejudice. This book is not only for the women, but wonderful for men, because in our book circle we have four boys and they each enjoyed this book as much as the girls did. This book is truly a timeless classic that can be enjoyed by all."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"One of the only reason why I have read this book is because I had to pick a British Author to read about and then write a paper on. At first I didn't pick Jane Austin, I was unaware that she was British, then when my teacher passed out a list of authors I saw her name and automatically thought 'Pride and Prejudice' and I wanted to research Jane Austen. I first saw the movie when I was younger and I didn't understand it. Ever since then I have had an interest in it. When the newer movie came out with Keira Knightly came out, I wanted to go see it but ended up not going. I took this oppertunity to read the book. As I began to read this book, I had trouble understanding it. I am not good at the old English and by the end of the book, I still didn't fully understand it but I managed to get the full story. I did use Cliff Notes to help me understand each chapter because it didn't always make sense to me but after I read the summeries of each chapter I was able to understand the story.I found the story very romantic. I thought it unusual how Mr. Darcy acts in the beginning, by ignoring Elizabeth and saying rude comments about her then when she stays at the house for a couple of days because her sister is sick, he starts to like her. It is charming to read about a guy who like this girl so much that he'll do anything to get her. In my opinion that is one sign of true love. Elizabeth isn't too fond of Mr. Darcy because of what he said about her, but he goes on in the book to prove his love for her and in the end win her over. Mr. Darcy has to go throuhg Elizabeth liking Wickham, Mr. Collins proposing to her, being turned down by Elizabeth with his first marriage proposal, and the critism from other older women about not marrying Elizabeth. The book shows how much one guy can love a girl and make everything happen."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"One never gets tired of reading Pride and Prejudice. I cannot remember how many times I have read it, but each time I do I enjoy it more and more. Jane Austen's Books never cease to take you back to a time when people cared about good manners, and people were expected to behave politely. Of course, the emphasis placed on marrying based almost exclusively on material things shows us what a long way we have come in some respects, but how little we have changed in others. Ultimately, this story is one about the triumph of true love despite obstacles, and is timeless in that sense."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austin was a fascinating author! Pride And Prejudice is by far one of her best novels. Her characters are so enduring and spontaneous. Every reader will not be able to help him or herself from falling in love with Elizabeth and her down to earth behavior. This is a romantic comedy as I see it for I found myself laughing at the humor and humiliation through out the whole novel. You don't have to love romantic novels to want to read this book. Pride And Prejudice is filled with the \\"Battle of Sexes\\" and the \\"Battles of the Richer and the Poorer!\\" You can be 13 or you can be 35 and you will still love the novel ever more. It is a story that has stood proudly against the tests of time and will continue to astonish its readers for years to come!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Written in the early XVIII Century, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is Jane Austen's most popular and loved novel - but not really her best. One of the first works she wrote, the novel is sometimes a little undercooked compared to her most complex works, like \\"Emma\\" and \\"Persuasion\\", however, it is still a joy to read. In this book, she created her most famous romantic hero in Mr Darcy, an unforgettable stubborn who makes a perfect match to Lizzie Bennet. They were meant for each other.The only problem is that they haven't figured it our. On the other hand, any reader can realize it from the first moment the couple meet. In other words, we do know how the book ends, so why do so many people keep reading, and rereading this novel? One reason is that Austen has created some very believable characters - and also very endearing. That's because they are very human. Lizzie and Mr Darcy have very wrong first impressions of each other when they met and that's why it takes so long for accepting their mutual love.In this sense, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a story about overcoming our prides and our prejudices acquire in the first impression, and changing one's mind. Both Lizzie and Mr Darcy realize before the end of the story they were made for each other - but the problem is that their wrong impressions lead them to make choices that become barriers to their love. The path they will have to follow in order to find the fully accomplishment of their mutual feelings is the strongest plot in the novel.At the same time, the reader is fed with details about class and courtship from the time the book was written. In Jane Austen's work, her characters are sometimes like small figurines that represent the whole world - or at least England. And the writer does it with charm and style. Her books are a document of a time, tackling its fashions, moral and behavior.Peguin Classics is probably the best edition, since it has many notes and an extensive introduction, dealing not only with Austen's works in general, but also with an detailed essay on this book. \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is one of those books that will be read forever, and should be read from people in different time of their lives. We find different approaches, and understanding as we grow older."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I love this book. I first read it when I was 16 and thought it was fantastic. Now, ten years later, it still remains my favorite book. I also love Austen's other novels."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"My wife is a Jane Austin fan so I gave this book to her for Christmas. We were teasing each other one night and as I lark I told her I would read it instead of the Star Wars and fantasy books that I usually read. So I actually did read it..... and strangely enough I loved it. This book is definitely geared towards women but there is more than enough substance that any man with any character would enjoy it as well.While you can tell that it was written nearly 200 years ago it's still easy to comprehend what's going on just like any modern day book. The characters are so rich and the twists and turns are so amazing that I just couldn't put it down. I really loved Elizabeth and her responses to people, especially to Lady Catherine near the end. It's amazing that Jane Austin was able to come up with all that witty dialogue. The conclusion for Elizabeth and Darcy and all the characters for that matter was just perfect. It's no wonder it's been a classic all these years.... it will be around for a long time still to come."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I am not one of Jane Austen's fans, not really. I love all kinds of books, but hers tend to bore me, with a glowing exception: \\"Pride and prejudice\\".I read \\"Pride and prejudice\\" (1813) more than 15 years ago, and I loved it immediately. I didn't have to read it for school, I just happened to buy it based on a whim. I didn't know who Jane Austen was, but I risked disappointment and tried a \\"new\\" author. Thankfully, I found a book that was well-written, but also thoroughly entertaining, engaging enough to catch the attention of a 12-year-old and keep it without difficulty.The plot is not overly complicated, and it tackles wonderfully themes such as relationships, love, class distinctions, and of course pride and prejudice, all from the point of view of what happened in 18th century England.The story begins in the small town where the Bennets live. Mrs. Bennet has five daughters, and her mission in life is marrying them off. Mr. Bennet is an intellectual, who often escapes to his library in search of silence and to avoid Mrs. Bennet's nonsense. The two more important daughters, from the point of view of the story, are probably the eldest, Jane (extremely beautiful and amiable) and the second, Elizabeth (witty but perhaps too proud).The dynamics of the town are changed when \\"a single man of large fortune\\", Mr. Bingley, arrives to Netherfield Park, an estate not far from town. Mr. Bingley comes with a friend, Mr. Darcy, and the Bennets meet both at a ball. While Mr. Bingley immediately caughts Jane's eye, and is considered nice by Elizabeth, Mr. Darcy has not such luck. By sheer chance, Elizabeth overhears him making a negative comment on her, something that hurts her pride and spurs her to consider him a hateful man. But will that change? And if so, how will that happen, given that Mr. Darcy is extremely conscious of his high social standing?Truth to be told, I liked the story, and the way in which Austen fleshed out the different characters through dialogues, instead of long winded descriptions. I also liked Elizabeth, and even though she was prone to mistakes, I preferred her to Jane, her extremely nice but too perfect sister. Moreover, I enjoyed reading about what sometimes happens to \\"hate at first sight\\" when time passes by, and how the main couple dealt with that, despite the fact that pride and prejudice made it difficult for them to really understand each other.Finally, I would like to highlight that I reread \\"Pride and prejudice\\" from time to time, and each time I am astonished by the amount of social criticism Jane Austen managed to include in what a first sight might have seemed an innocuous book. The author, who wrote \\"Pride and prejudice\\" in 1813, weaves in the story many themes that were relevant in 19th century England. Considerations of class are present throughout the book, and I think that the fact that Austen depicts so well their importance makes it easier for the modern reader to comprehend how constrictive they were. Austen also makes the attentive reader realize that the idea of marrying for love was a luxury very few women had then, as most had no other choice than to marry the first man that proposed. Elizabeth, who wanted to marry for love, was an exception rather than the rule.In my opinion, \\"Pride and prejudice\\" is the kind of book that never loses its charm, notwithstanding the age of the reader. All in all, I highly recommend this book as one that you will enjoy reading not only once, but many times. So, go for it :)Belen Alcat"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"When I first started reading Pride and Prejduice, I was 13 years old, and didn't understand it much. The vivid and detailed literature with underlying hints of sarcasm didn't make me laugh because I was illiterate to the writing at the time. I had even resorted to cliffs notes and such to help me through the book, even though I was reading it on my own accord. Now that I am older and far more wise, i read this book and love the romance, social placings and every moral connected to this book, but the male sex will turn up their noses to this amazing novel because it will be \\"too girly\\" for them.

I have read it many times, and love it more and more with each reading.Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy's journey to find each other was brilliant. The witty dialogue and the entertaining characters make this book quick and so much fun to read.Jane Austen does a brilliant job of portraying the 19th centuty woman's plight in Pride and Prejudice through Elizabeth and Jane Bennet. It was a time where women were only expected to do one thing in their life: marry and marry well. An outspoken and intelligent woman was looked down upon. A woman was not supposed to think, only to please the men in her life.Jane Austen was many years ahead of her time in portraying the unjust social restraints that women had to endure. Her books were the medium that she chose to express her feelings about the social situation of women. Her writings foreshadowed and inspired succeeding generations of women as they fought to obtain equal rights."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Classic!

I first read Pride and Prejudice when I was 6-7 (I know, a little young, but I love to read), and I loved it. I've read the book 12-13 times, seen both big TV miniseries and the Laurence Olivier movie adaption, and a stage adaption. It remains on my list of top ten favorites. I love everything about it. I love the charming Edwardian language, the character's, and the plot. This book is not a girly fluffy book, even though the plot is a bit of an old one (who knows, maybe the plot came from J.A.?). I fell in love with Darcy and Elizabeth from the very start, and I still love them. I've read this book at least once every year since I first read it, and it just get's better every time. I laugh in it, which is unusual for me, I rarely laugh in books, even funny ones. What more can I say? If you haven't read it, then you ought to, don't just watch the movies. The only thing is that I've never found a guy who has willingly read it, and I've never found one that liked it. What's wrong with our guys?"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I absolutely hated &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; when I tried to read it in high school. While I absolutely loved romances and novels set in the 19th century, when I attempted &quot;P&amp;P,&quot; I got as far as the scene where Elizabeth strolls around the room with one of Mr. Bingley's sisters and thought that all this walking up and down was the stupidest thing anyone could do and quit reading it.I didn't start appreciating Jane Austen until I read &quot;Persuasion&quot; for a graduate history class that explored how the concept of womanhood changed between the late 18th century and the beginning of Queen Victoria's reign. Our goal was to examine whether the new Victorian ideal of womanhood was something women themselves embraced or a role thrust upon them. And at last, I began to appreciate Jane Austen.By the time I got around to rereading &quot;P&amp;P,&quot; Emma Thomson's delightful adaptation of &quot;Sense and Sensability&quot; had made it to theaters, and I was old enough to appreciate that love at first site can be a disaster.Jane Austen may have been the first novelist to write about love from a woman's point of view--and wrote at a time when marriages were becoming more about love and not just financial considerations. Throughout many of her novels, Austen struggles with whether money should matter in matters of the heart. She seems to want to say that money shouldn't matter, and yet recognizes that when a young woman's entire future depended on her husband's financial status, money still had to matter.&quot;P&amp;P&quot; begins with the wealthy Mr. Bingley renting a house near the home of the Bennetts, a family with five daughters, no sons and an entailed estate that would have to pass to the nearest male relative. Much to her daughter Elizabeth's frustration, Mrs. Bennett immediately begins plotting ways to snag Mr. Bingley for one of her daughters. At a party, Elizabeth first encounters Mr. Darcy. Overhearing his criticism of her immediately gets them off on the wrong foot. As the novel unfolds, Darcy and Elizabeth discover each other's true nature, and eventually misunderstandings are repaired, and they develop an appreciation of each other. The pacing of &quot;P&amp;P&quot; more realistically reflects the growth of true love than many novels that I've read. Austen's witty commentary about courting rituals makes the book highly entertaining.To enrich the experience of reading &quot;Pride and Prejudice,&quot; pick up a copy of Fay Weldon's &quot;Letters to Alice Upon Her First Reading of Jane Austen.&quot; Weldon's collections of essays to her fictitious niece enrich the experience of reading Jane Austen's novels by exploring what makes certain works absolute classics, what life was like for women in the early 19th century, and what Austen's life was like as she was writing these novels."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"One thing I have learned form reading this book and then reading some reviews, is that one can either hate it or love it. Or love it and hate it at the same time.In my case, I loved the tale, it is one of must-read classics, and who ever enjoys romantic novels of any sort will fall in love with the story.Jane Austen, a great author, certainly has captured my heart making this tale to remind me of love when everthing else doesn't."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Blinded by beauty, Mr. Bennett married his lightheaded Mrs., and ever since has been skewering her with his wit--with beauty faded, she remains lightheaded and his target.

Had there been a son, something could have been done, but as it is, the daughters' only hope of avoiding eventual poverty is marrying well, for themselves and for their mother.Our focus is on the second daughter, Elizabeth. More thoughtful than her sisters, she is her father's favorite. We are not the only ones to like Elizabeth, the prideful and immensely wealthy Mr. Darcy also finds himself falling for her. She rejects him because of the prejudice she has formed from his foster brother, the untrustworthy Mr. Wickham. The rest of the novel allows us to watch as these characters manoever to finally get into a position where they can accept each other.Absolutely stuffed with memorable characters and scenes. I rate it as her best, slightly better than Emma, but reasonable minds can differ about this one."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen certainly seems to have done a great job earning her name in the literary world. I can only imagine how difficult it was for her to have been able to earn such a status in the very much male dominated era that she belonged to. This book illustrates two major themes of that period - the somewhat male dominated society, and the class structure in the early 19th century England.At the beginning of the book Elizabeth Bennet the heroine of the novel seems doomed in every sense. She is both female, and does not have an inheritance that will earn her a respectable marriage. However, what she does possess are things that cannot be bought with money - she is by far the smartest woman in the book, and has an incredible sense of humor. It is in fact these two traits that the aristocratic Mr.Darcey finally finds irresistable, and leads to him proposing marriage not once, but twice. It is only at the very end of the book that Elizabeth gives in, and agrees to the marriage - much to the surprise of both her parents and her older sister. This marriage is significant in that it brakes steadfast barriers. It seems almost as though it is the beginning of the end for the English class structure.Jane Austen is a brilliant writer and you will find her work easy to follow. I can assure you that you won't regret reading it - I haven't, and I have read it many, many times. It is almost addictive."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"You must read this book, especially if you are just beginning to explore the world of classic literature. Out of all of Jane Austen's work, this is the best. It's pace and structure are perfect, the characters are so well defined that you could recognize them on the street, and the prose is delicious. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Can anything be better than reading Pride and Prejudice? I feel so stupid about myself now after having seen by my own eyes the creativity, the skills, the intelligence, and the passion for love that another being of my race can possess, and even more embarrassed that that person has also a heart so good as to venture the task of puting all these into use in a single book of unbelievable plots and conversations. I suggest you not to read any reviews here at all, for they will spoil the elements of surprise.OH, how much I wish I can love like them!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a very well written novel by Jane Austen. When i first began to read it, i thought i'd instantly hate it. i'm not a big fan of romance novels, but i decided to give this book a try. I was delightfully suprized with the vivid language and great dialogue which Austen used, and the novel kept my interest better than i had ever expected. from the famous opening lines, &quot;It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife&quot;, to the wedding at the end, this was a great book. At some points, i got confused py a paragraph, or even chapter, and i had to re-read it carefully so i could fully understand the authors point, but other than that, i could comprehend the book easily. It is the first romantic book that has ever kept my attention, and i hope this will inspire me to try other books that i would otherwise walk right by without giving it a thought. The book did a very good job of developing the characters, as well. By the end of the book, i felt i had a good grasp on who's personalities Jane Austen wanted to emphasize, and what each character's roll in the plot was. Overall, i feel this was an excellent book, and i would reccomend it to enyone who loves to read, even if you're not a reguar reader of novels such as this one."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen is a wonderful piece of literature. I have never read a truly great book until this. I have loved many books that I have read, but this book is beyond compare. As soon as I began reading, I became engrossed in it. I finished this book so fast it felt like the book was only 100 pages. I t was such quick read that I read approximately 250 pages in one weekend; I couldn't put it down. I strongly urge everyone to read this book, whatever the age. I am only in ninth grade and even now I'm able to understand its literary value. Although I can speak highly of the novel, there are some things that I can criticize. The most complicated aspect of the book was the language. At some points I had to go back and reread a passage to fully understand it. It is true that the language is beautiful, but frankly, I find it confusing. If you are not up to the challenge of figuring out the meaning of some different words, do not read this book The only other aspect of the novel that at times seemed irksome, was the long passages in which there was little dialogue. These passages sometimes contained Elizabeth's thoughts and observations, but it was the parts other than these that bothered me. The long descriptions of the fields and rooms bored me. This was unnecessary because it did not advance the plot or carry a large amount of importance. When a new plot line suddenly came into existence, this would be weaved in. In moments of suspense I just skimmed through these parts because they were not entirely related to the plot. My favorite plot line was the development and change of people and their feelings, especially love. This novel genuinely showed me how humans' feelings towards one another change, along with their judgments and prejudices. Throughout the novel the two main characters, Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy profoundly changed in enjoyable ways. Additionally, these changes describe the title, which I found most appropriate. When we first met Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy he was presented as aloof, cold, and full of abominable pride. As the story progresses we see a profound change in his character, which commences when he professes his love for Elizabeth. After this, we begin to see the real, improved Mr. Darcy. By the end of the story Elizabeth even says this about him, \\" Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable.\\" By overcoming his pride he leads Elizabeth to make a few changes of her own. Elizabeth is the character that I feel made the most significant changes throughout the story. I feel this way because she altered two major things in her life. The first, which I feel led to the second, is when Elizabeth realized her prejudice and surpassed it. She does not find this out about herself until wonderful Mr. Darcy places a white envelope in her hands. After reading what was inside the envelope she describes herself as, \\" blind, partial, prejudice, absurd.\\" The second thing that changed about her was her feelings towards Mr. Darcy. Over several months her feelings for Mr. Darcy grow fonder each time they meet, until she realizes her overwhelming love for him This is a classic love story, which I believe deserves much attention. In one word, this story is enchanting. The story of the Bennet girls will be one I will treasure forever. Finally, I will never forget the way Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy came together and overcame, their pride and prejudice."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is not only an epitome of classic literature, it is actually interesting. I bet if they made a poll, the people who read this book would be happier in life than most. I love this book so much. Ms Austen truly made a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice was a very slow going book, but a very good one anyways. I enjoyed and hated the running arounds of Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth. I wanted them to fall madly in love (finally) and everytime that I thought it was going to happen something got in the way. It was a terrific book and I enjoyed the ending the most! :) I would recommend it to anyone with a high tolerance for boredom and also one that has a lot of time to actually read the book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is just AMAZING! Once you begin to turn the pages you just can't stop! I've read it five times and I still read with the same number of heartbeats(which must be like 1000 per minute!) Pride and Prejudice is one of the best books in the world. I just love the story of five sisters and their foolish and funny mother who thinks about nothing but marrying her daughters. Mr Darcy ,who marries Elizabeth, is my all time favorite male novel charachter. His passionate love for Elizabeth and his incredibly romantic nobleness will make him a favourite with female readers.There are people who consider the book boring , but if it is because of the Victorian English I think it just makes the book more classic and valuable."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"First of all, let me start out by saying, I love this book! I'm 17 years old and Pride and Prejudice has been my favorite book for years. It was the first work of Jane Austen's that I had ever read and it prompted me to read her others. In my opinion, Pride and Prejudice and Emma are her two very best. Her characters are so well-developed that you feel like you actually know them. Elizabeth in P&amp;P is an amazing and intelligent young woman. She has so much spirit that it's admirable. Darcy is intelligent as well and he has a self-confidence that makes him very attractive. The plot is always moving, always interesting. I've read P&amp;P so many times and I never get bored. Everyone should have this book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Loved it. Gave me bags under my eyes, staying up late to read just one more chapter. I would highly recommend it to anyone that wants to feel gitty about a book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This timeless classic's appeal remains undiminished through the ages. Drawing on the universal topic of love and marraige, Jane Austen's most \\"sparkling\\" work addresses the role in society of women, social/class differences, and well...pride and prejudice...with scintillating wit. Producing two of literature's most loved protagonists, the witty Elizabeth Bennet and haughty Mr. Darcy, Pride and Prejudice remains a joy to read. Having inspired books and movies such as Bridget Jones' Diary, P&P is one of the must-reads of English literature!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austin wrote a story set in what i originally thought of as a boring period in time. Her story, however, is about five daughters and their love lives. The parents in the story are funny(the father is very sarcastic and the mother is obsessed w/getting her daughters married well off). I was surprised at how easy it was to read and how much it reminded me of modern teenage drama."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is definitely a book I would want my daughter to read. I first read it in high school and can not get enough of it. I love the characters and storyline. It is amazing the way she writes. I love watching Elizabeth and wishing she was a 90's woman who could tell Darcy what she really thinks without worrying about the do's and don't's of her time. I live for the ending when Darcy calls her his most dearest Elizabeth. Romantics this is a book for you."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This work is just wonderful and once you've read it, you can't forget it. Elizabeth seems so close to us, women, and Darcy so cute that their story makes everyone sensitive dream. With Charlotte Bront's Jane Eyre, P&amp;P remains the treasure of Victorian Literature.Just read it and you'll understand."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"As a fan of other types of literature (Stephen King and Steinbeck, for instance) I can't begin to express the way I devoured this book! Not only did I find the character development incredible, but I also enjoyed how Austen brought in other themes such as extreme embarrassment caused by relatives (haven't we ALL been there...)the ability to laugh at oneself, the empathy for a family member that has been wronged and regret of a decision. I liked this book so much that I went out and rented the A&amp;E production and liked that so much I bought it. This is one story I will revisit again and again!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I saw the 1995 tv series before I read this book, and I think that was good. Although the book is better than the series, I don't know if I'd fully understand the sarcasm and irony in the description of the characters. I despise Mr. Collins, but I also find him very amusing. And I admire Elizabeth for her honesty to herself and to others. Despite the fact that it might seem trivial at first, Jane Austen wrote a truly remarkable book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"P&amp;P is one of my favourite books.The attention given to minor details and the portrayal of both Lizzy and Mr.Darcy is very endearing.I loved the witty remarks and the satire in the descriptions.I think Austen's command of the english language is enviable.Each sentence has it's own significance and there is no line in the book I would have omitted. I particularly liked the scene between Lizzy and Lady Catherine where Lady C demands a promise of her-that of never agreeing to marry Mr.Darcy-every dialogue is so well thought out and even though there is so little of a story to relate,the way the book keeps you rapt with attention is amazing! Whenever I feel lonely or left out this book makes me feel like a part of all its frolicking and ball-dancing.I think that is the power of an author-to be able to make a reader empathise and live thro' the pages. I am still living in the glorious days of Pemberley and Netherfield!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have read Pride and Prejudice so many times that by now I should have the book memorized. But, I don't. Instead, I cringe every time Elizabeth Bennet refuses Mr. Darcy's proposal and sit in suspense as I near the part where I think he should propose again. What if this time, they don't meet by chance as they ought? Or what if Mr. Darcy decides not to propose again? What if Elizabeth doesn't realize how wonderful I know he is? Jane Austen is the only author who captures my imagination so vividly every reading; I love her for it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I love this story! The characters are so consistent and so very realstic, it's amazing. You can't help but admire them, not only for their realism, but for who they were, and especially Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, whose opinions changed so very much, and how they came to accept each other. Not only is the main plot excellent, but secondary characters such as the droll Mr. Collins and the imperious Lady Catherine are real gems. This whole novel is well worth taking the time to read it!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I've lost count of how many times I've read this book. I keep it permanently on my nightshelf and will often just read a few pages whenever I feel overwhelmed by uncivilised people (like after my evening commute sometimes...). It's a tonic against stupidity. I also recommend the A&amp;E video production. So well cast &amp; produced you are able to focus on the story &amp; not be distracted by production issues (e.g. &quot;THAT's different from the book...&quot;). My ultimate test for the relevance of a story is how many lines I plagiarize from it to use in normal conversation, and this story has some classics. My favorite is &quot;I am most seriously displeased.&quot;My husband has a new cliche: &quot;what's better than one wedding at the end of a jane austen story? TWO weddings at the end of a jane austen story.&quot; as another reviewer noted, it's not the destination that delights, it's the journey along the way. these characters will keep you in good company and refresh your optimism in the potential of the human race."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"After the movie adaptations of &quot;Sense and Sensability&quot; and &quot;Emma&quot;, I always wanted to try reading one of her books. No movie could do this author justice. I stayed up way past midnight last night to finish this work of art. I had tears in my eyes by the end."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is truly good literature with two other advantages:1. You can enjoy reading it at the beach2. If you are studying for the GRE's or SAT's, the vocab will get you halfway there.I adore this book. I think it the best of Austen's work. It is a book you will go to again and again."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is one of the best books I've ever read! Definitely in the top 10! It is a book of real life drama and intense love. I couldn't wait to see if Miss Elizabeth Bennet would drop some of her prejudices or if Mr. Darcy would look thru his pride or if Miss Jane Bennet would end up with the one she loved.This book is excellence in writing and in overall story! It was a book that I will read again!! Beyond doubt!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It took me a lot of endurance to get through the book, and I had to re-start more than once. However, all in all it was a very good book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is one of the best books I've ever read. It's wonderful!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is an account of society in the early nineteenth century. Austen primarily focuses on the ridiculous pressure to marry. She does an exquisite job satirizing or \\"poking fun\\" at the extreme views of those who lived during that time. She gives the reader a good look at how truly important first impressions are and how love can conquer all. Austen develops her main characters Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy, with very conflicting character traits. These conflicting traits allow the build up of tension between these two characters. This gives the novel a pleasant amount of intensity that leads to an ousting ending. Austen sucks you into a thoroughly enchanting world, making the novel impossible to put down. I recommend this novel to those who enjoy intellectual wit and have a soft heart for romance. Pride and Prejudice is a wonderfully endearing novel that is bound to touch women of every age."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I thought it was absolutely amazing! It's one of those books u can't put down! I new Mr.Darcy from the beginning. Well anyway i'm 14 and i thought the words were a lil' big, but other then that i learned alot."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"In Jane Austen's &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet realize their own pride and prejudice through dramatic twists and turns of one of the 19th century's greatest novels. The Bennet family women, destined for poverty, vie for the attention of men belonging to a higher social status. Due to the mother's greedy nature, the affections of these men have been turned away. However Jane, the oldest daughter, finds the affection of one man, Mr. Bingley, only to lose him when he is convinced by his good friend Mr. Darcy that she does not love him. In an attempt to reclaim Mr. Bingley's affection, Jane moves to London to be nearer to him. In the midst of this drama, Lizzie finds herself smitten by an Officer whose negative opinion of Mr. Darcy influences her greatly. Because of this, the resentment that Elizabeth harbored towards Mr. Darcy from moment she met him is magnified. Lydia, one of Elizabeth's younger sisters, fails to act in a socially acceptable manner involving the Officer with whom Elizabeth was smitten. This behavior leaves the family vulnerable to public disgrace. Through this course of events, Elizabeth discovers the Officer's malicious nature, and her opinion of Mr. Darcy begins to change. Will the Bennett family women attain their much longed for higher social status or will they experience the repercussions of Lydia's careless decisions? Is the prideful demeanor that Mr. Darcy displays an indication of his true character? Has Elizabeth's prejudice obstructed her chance for true romance?"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is one of my favorite novels. I was the first novel of Jane's that I've read and I could not put it down. The suspence and humor of this book makes it great.... you must read it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I found this book to be humorous and light-hearted. It was also satirical about society during the eighteenth century. Historically, the book was accurate and interesting. The book had a variation of themes; comedy, romance, irony, and so on. The style of the book enables you to feel the moods of the main characters. I felt hatred for Mr. Darcy and his stubbornness. Mr. Bennet's attitude about his wife and family was witty. Each character had their own unique characteristic, which showed the differences and faults of society.The situation between Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy grows along with their love. The irony of how subtle their love has grown for each other is very entertaining. No one truly believed that Elizabeth loved Mr. Darcy rather she was spiteful towards him. But as the book progresses, she learns about her harsh judgments about him and falls in love for him. Her sister, Jane does not even believe in this love.The book also shows how life sometimes works out for the better when expecting the worst. The complications and different views on marriage show how people do not think a like. Charlotte Lucas, Lizzie's friend, does not believe in marriage for love, rather she thinks marrying comfortably is more than enough. In life, there are ups and downs, along with each human being. She rather learns about them after she is in wedlock, then learning before hand. Although everyone believes that Jane and Mr. Bingly would be married and loved each, conflicts occur. Different people, separating the two, misled Mr. Bingly and Jane. Luckily, the truth is learned and things work out. Lizzie has the most conflicts of them all. She finds a new guy that she likes, but realizes she loves the person who she least expected it from, Mr. Darcy.Overall the book was well written and I enjoyed the letters from others, showing each person's different perspective and styles. The details and descriptions are magnificent and captivating."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"although some may not notice it, this Austen novel is romantically-centered. The subtlety of the liaison between Darcy and Elizabeth and their psychological games leave the reader with the impression that the protagonist is doomed to spinsterhood, while her sisters one by one are exfoliated away by their respective bridegrooms.It's not until towards the conclusion of the story that Austen finally gratifies her desires by ( spoiler! ) bringing Darcy and Eliza together. Romance, courtship, and flirtation perceived as daring back in Austen's pre-Victorian era are so uncouth and perplexing to the modern reader that he/ she might miss out on a truly light-hearted romantic comedy with ludic characters and good-natured humor.This is one of Austen's finest works and I regard her as one of the great writers, female or otherwise."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"When I first found this I thought that it was the soundtrack to the 1996 A&amp;E version of Pride and Prejudice. It is actually the book on CD. This would have been great, except that it is abridged. This book is one of the great classics. I do not think that it is appropriate for someone today to decide what parts of a book written in 1813 are important and what are not. I did not actually keep and listen to this selection. I was not interested in having PART of Jane Austen's great work. Therefore, I suppose that this can not actually be called a review of the CD, only of the case."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I know Jane Austen was a famous author but this book was written 200 years ago.

In short: love the book, hate the formatting.There are many typographical errors from simple typos to random line breaks in the middle of paragraphs, often following a title (Mr./Mrs.). For some reason the book is void of italics and emphasized words are in all caps, which is rather ANNOYING, don't you know? The errors haven't kept me from reading, but they are an irritating distraction.If I knew of the slipshod manner in which this book was transcribed I would have just sprung for the $0.89 version. In fact, I think I will now."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I might be wasting the readers time on things that really spread no knowledge of the book reviewed. I'll not spend words telling you the story, describing the characters or the time, offering opinions on the social state of Britain at the time of the novel. There are other reviews that attempt this. Jane Austen is much better at these tasks than I. The reviewer is an anglophobe. If it is given five stars here it should tell you a great deal about the value of this novel. For one who protects what is left of vision to read this book three times should say even more. It is strongly suggested reader that you uit wasting time on reviews and read the book. You may believe from the title of this review that the reviewer is prejudiced. What took you so long to figure that out? Age and other afflictions of the eyes have robbed my ability to read to some degree but this edition is very kind to us ancients. Oxford has a good reputation and this publication will not detract from it. The editorial material is even somewhat amusing.There is nothing amusing about the War of 1812, the use of the wordswhere we Americans would more likely use is symbolic of the British conception of our republic. But we digress. Austen has been a favorite since I first encountered her in college. It was much later I realized one reason for the fine prose in Hiram Grant's Memoirs. He spent many hours at West Point reading Jane Austen novels. There he was given his more familiar name Ulyses Grant, hero of the Civil War and Republican president of the U. S. Had he spent his time reading the French tacticians as his classmates did the war may have been prolonged to allow McClellan to beat his opponents."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Since reading this several decades ago, it has been my first favorite book.

It is a story about an empty-headed mother and her search for proper husbands for her five daughters. The book is a prime example of the manners and morals of the gentry in a small English village in the early nineteenth century. Ms. Austen does such a good job of displaying these strictures and morals in her novels, that to us in the present day it appears to be an entirely repressive era (which it actually was). The plot and the characterizations in this book are wonderful as in all Ms. Austen's works, and it tells a dazzling story. It is a charming and wonderfully warm tale that I never tire of reading."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It is not your ordainary 19th century novel. It is so much more.

I laughed aloud at the wit; I smiled at the *ahem* 'cute' romance; I shouted at the characters when they missed obvious signals and acted like idiots...but such as it is, lets just say that I was truly affected by this book. Touching, witty, and with happy weddings in the end...in short, a true Austen novel. I found this book immensely enjoyable to read, and it is among my top ten favorite books of all time (although, I must admit, my 'top ten favorite books of all time' list is often prone to change, as I am not very old and shall devour other books yet)...Nontheless, I would recommend this book to anyone who has ever liked any other Austen or Austen-like book, as this is perhaps my favorite written by this particular author."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I've read three incredible books lately and NONE of them were remotely connected by theme, style, or author. &quot;Song of Solomon&quot; was the first, &quot;The Bark of the Dogwood&quot; was the second, and &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; was the third. While all were excellent, P&amp;P was so great for me, simply because I didnt' expect it to be great. If you are like I was before reading this wonderful book, you probably can't imagine what could be so wonderful about Pride and Prejudice. How can it be interesting, you're thinking, when it's written in such a stuffy time period? I'll stick with my science fiction/romance novels/westerns, thank you very much. And it's true, you can't find any lusty young rogues, aliens, or gun fights, but that doesn't keep it from being an extremely wonderful book to read. The characters are full of life, the plot well constructed, and the entire story full of charm and humour. Don't be put off by the language either. It takes some getting used to, but once you're going it's not only completely natural, but makes today's English seem completely dull and simple. I cannot stress enough how wonderful this book is. Also try &quot;Bark of the Dogwood&quot; and &quot;Song of Solomon.&quot;"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is an amazing book; when I read it I just can't seem to put it down. This edition which is published by \\"Penguin Classics\\" proves to be a wonderful read because of the information included in the back.Ms. Jane Austen does an impeccable job of describing the characters in the story.

Mrs. Bennet is especially cute, the way that she is always talking about the fact that she'd like her daughters to marry, and seems to think that it would prove to be the pinnacle of her life if one of them married into wealth. When Mr. Collins comes into the picture and decides to marry Charlotte, he can't stop praising the house in which will one day be his.This is where the book really picks up. At the conclusion of volume one, an individual is left only to imagine what could possibly be happening with Mr. Bingley and his beloved Jane.In this charming love story, two people learn to \\"get over themselves\\" and develop feelings for one another."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I welcome this new edition from Penguin Classics with expanded notes.How does one demarcate pride and prejudice, or bias and stubbornness? In Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen deftly exposes the folly of and further ridicules judging by first impressions.When Elizabeth Bennet first met the fine, tall, handsome eligible bachelor Fitzwilliam Darcy, she immediately deemed him arrogant, conceited and utterly obnoxious. Her first impression of Darcy, who was initially looked upon with prodigious admiration, was quickly assured as his conceited manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity.Darcy's conceit and selfish disdain of the feelings of others formed the foundation of Elizabeth's disapprobation on which succeeding events had built so inevitably a hatred. When she later found out Darcy had deliberately altered Bingley's opinion of her beloved sister Jane and determined to separate them, she was determined to exasperate herself as much as possible against Darcy.In the comedy of manners that follows, Austen, in a superb manner and prose so elegant and lyrical, verbalizes the stubbornness, bias, and prejudices of Elizabeth toward a man whom resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of his admiration for her escaped him. Despite the fact that he struggled to maintain his composure, in his breast there existed a powerful feeling toward her, which soon procured her pardon and directed his anger elsewhere upon Elizabeth's weighty accusations of him.Pride and Prejudice presents us a romance comedy with a modern feel and touch. The opening of the novel Fitzwilliam Darcy is blackened as the most obnoxious snob for whom \\"there is not another woman in the room who it would not be a punishment\\" to him to stand up with. To Elizabeth, almost all of Darcy's actions \\"maybe traced to pride\\" and \\"pride had often connected him to virtue.\\" No sooner had Darcy's superiority of mind (pride) been fully exposed than Elizabeth's prejudice was revealed.Unlike her sister Jane, Elizabeth was more hasty in censuring anyone (especially Fitzwilliam Darcy) and never supposed the possibility of any extenuating circumstances in the case, let alone urging the possibility of mistake and misunderstanding. In confronting Darcy of his inexcusable act of separating Bingley and Jane, Elizabeth judged from assumptions, suspicions, and the biased first impression. In a sense she sought to discredit Darcy and the relation of events that might be capable of a turn which must render Darcy blameless throughout the whole affair.When Elizabeth finally considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided Darcy, her anger and indignation was turned against herself and Darcy's dejection (more or less disappointed feelings toward her) became object of her compassion. Elizabeth's folly and rashness also become object of our compassion. How awful her petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting Fitzwilliam Darcy.Pride and Prejudice evokes the fact that human nature is prone to pride and very few of us do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or another. Pride usually relates more to our opinions of ourselves, of which Elizabeth has epitomized. Pride is the real superiority of mind, when along with stubbornness, bias, and determination, would casue irremediable regret. The novel also evokes the friendship, the values of marriage, and snobberies of English middle-class life in the early 19th century. 4.5 stars."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Fast and quick delivery.

It is part of an excellent series of Penguin Classics that are being re-released with superb cover art. Normally cover art bears only a fleeting relation to the actual content of the book, but the covers in this series are all very fitting for their books.

She needs to do more Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I first read this book when I was eleven or twelve, and I really enjoyed it. Now, I am spending a year in a foreign country, and found a couple of Jane Austen books on sale. I bought both Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility. And it was simplly wonderful to have such a classic to comfort me, while being surrounded by another culture and language.This is a romance story, but for me, though I am a die-hard romantic, I have fallen in love with the prose, and romance of the age, not the actual romances between the characters."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"When you finish this book-you'll sigh* (I did) and then you'll be stuck remembering all the characters and how you recognize them in your present relationships (Lizzy's dad was one of my favorites) -- you'll find yourself thinking about Jane Austen and wondering what she was like... so you'll talk about her and find that EVERYONE loves her. and then your neighbor will lend you all the Austen movies (that BBC one will steal your entire afternoon!)--and she'll actually have a whole bunch of literary criticisms and Austen biographies...and you'll become obsessed.

After all, I am a guy and disposed to guy-ly things like action movies and bbq ribs. Pride and Prejudice, on the other hand, is a quaint British novel about a group of daughters and their various courtships and marriages. The main plot concerns whether one of these daughters-Lizzy-can or cannot overcome her initial dislike of a good man who subsequently falls in love with her. The device by which this plot operates, and extends into over three-hundred pages, is that everyone is either too scared, or too proper, to say what they really feel. The novel is conversation, conversation and more conversation, and almost all of it in an affected upper-class British speak where one talks around things, never about them. It does not entail much action-when it does it is usually characters traveling to a new locale to talk some more, and there is no bbq to be found at all, and so as I say, it is not, and by its nature cannot be, my favorite novel of all time. And yet, it is a testament to the skill of the author (and this is the first Austen I've read, and she has lived up to the hype surrounding her name) that, despite my lack of inherent interest in the subject matter, she managed to sustain my attention and, what's more, I can say that I completely enjoyed the reading. I would even be willing to read more of the same by the same. Her characters are interesting, distinct and likable, her dialogue true, and her descriptions sparse, witty and to-the-point.I give the novel 4 out of 5 stars because I enjoyed it, liked the characters and thought it well-written overall. It only loses its one star for being about things that do not compel me particularly; I'm sure that those who are predisposed to like conversation-driven British literature about social mores and marriage will rate it the full five."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"My first experience with Jane Austen was an unfotunate one since, like many people, I had her prose rammed down my throat by a dodo high school English teacher. To make matter worse, the instructor, Ms. Z was a retired hippie who wore burlap sacks to school and worshipped Freud. At one point she had me write a paper comparing the three principle characters to the id (Lydia) the ego (Elizabeth) and the superego (Jane). At the tender age when a youth's mind is ripe for absorption and exploration, mine was already acclimated to the professional academic practice of ideological regurgitation of canonical literature.But years later, I saw the mini series and really enjoyed it. I promptly reopened the novel after many years and discovered the intensely liberating sensation of rereading required highschool texts without pedagocical intrusion.Austen's portrait of Victorian society is a sociological gem. And this time instead of taking my teacher's word for it, I actually found the book enormously funny. Much of the language, environment, and social circumstances are completely out of date, but in order to appreciate them, one must read the book in context. Some argue that it is too verbose. But there were no malls, cars or televisions in Victorian England. People entertained themselves, among other ways, by reading and writing and corresponding with each other. Words played heavily in the day to day lives of the middle class and aristocracy.I recommend that anyone who detested this book in high school, reread it and enjoy it. And I recommend that educators present this book in context so that students can appreciate it's humor, language and historical perspective."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Even if one considers Pride and Prejudice to be a cautionary tale for men to avoid getting caught up in the affairs of women, or with recognition that Austen is truly showing that women have an amazing ability to manipulate men and essentially control their world, one cannot overlook the sheer boredom that reading Pride and Prejudice creates. Set this one aside and pick up The Scarlet Letter if you are looking for a classic worth reading."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Read this and many of Jane Austen's other novels as a teenagers. Downloaded this on to my new kindle and was as enchanted as the first time I read it. A classic romantic novel with exquisite characters and reflections on the way of life of that time. Timeless and a must read for the sad romantics amoungst us."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have been reading classics, but this did not rate for me. I read half and stopped. I found it extremely boring, the descriptions went on and on, and the book was hard to read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"What makes a book a \\"classic\\"? Is it the language? The fame of the author? The date of publication? Or, as my high school English teacher used to say, is a book a classic \\"because it still says what it needs to say\\"? In the case of Jane Austen's masterpiece, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", I'd venture that it is all of the above. Though it was one of her first published novels, it's probably her greatest, and features some of the greatest characters ever written in what is quite possibly one of the oldest stories ever told.The plot itself is timeless. The Bennet family of Hertfordshire has five daughters, and with no sons and an estate entailed along the male line, it is important that the girls find good husbands if they don't want to be turned out of their home upon the death of their father. As is common in most families, each child is very different. Jane, the eldest, is quiet and serene, and always sees the good in everyone. Elizabeth is intelligent, while Mary is preachy and a stuck-in-the-mud. Catherine (Kitty) is a follower, and the youngest, Lydia, is an out-of-control flirt. The story begins, rather famously, with the arrival of new neighbors at Netherfield, a home a few miles away. The house has been taken by a young man with a large fortune, and almost immediately, Mrs. Bennet begins scheming that the as-yet-unknown Mr. Bingley will marry one of her daughters - preferably the eldest.As luck would have it, Bingley and Jane hit it off right away. The same cannot be said for Bingley's socially-awkward friend, Mr. Darcy, and Jane's sister Elizabeth. Almost immediately, the two get on each others' nerves, begun with Darcy insulting Lizzie within the hearing range of the latter and continuing as the Bennet family (with the exception of the two eldest) make fools of themselves at every opportunity. When a regiment of soldiers comes to town, Elizabeth is quick to enjoy conversing with a Mr. Wickham, one of Mr. Darcy's least-favorite people, and eagerly believes everything Wickham says about his former childhood friend.Of course, not everything is as it seems. Darcy and Elizabeth continue to meet over the course of the next year, while she is visiting a friend near his aunt's home, and even on his estate at Pemberley. The more they get to know each other, the more they realize they may have been mistaken about one another. And when Lizzie's youngest sister does the unthinkable, the Bennet family's misfortune may end up being the shove Elizabeth and Darcy need.The greatest thing about this book is its characters. Jane Austen was a master of the absurd, and she has captured it beautifully in the obnoxious Mr. Collins, the haughty Lady Catherine deBourgh, the foolish Mrs. Bennet, and so many others. Everyone is drawn to life, and as you are reading it, you realize that, even though the book came out two centuries ago, these are personalities that still exist in all of our lives. The dialogue is witty and to the point, and though the novel is relatively short, the action never lags. There's a reason the 1995 BBC miniseries adaptation clocks in at close to five hours; a LOT happens in this book. With the 200th anniversary of the novel happening this year, it's definitely time to take an enjoyable look back at one of the most famous - and well-loved - books ever written."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I had seen the films, and knew what was going to happen. This may be part of what bored me about the book, but I just couldn't bring myself to finish it-- I don't normally quit reading a book either."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I read this book quite a while ago, in fact when i was in year 9 and my older sister was studying it for GCSE, i saw the book and seeing as i was bored i decided to read it. to my surprise i actually liked it. it turned out to be very interesting and amusing at times too. the relationship between Darcy and Lizzy interested me very much as i found Lizzy's retorts and critical behaviour great as i am a great believer of speaking your views. For Lizzy to do that in that kind of society was very brave of her and i admired her for it. Since then i have read this book so many times it's unbelievable and it still interests me greatly. i never get bored with the storyline and i live along with the characters and feel for them as if i was reading the book for the first time. It's an absolute classic and i love it. i really recommend everyone to read it. don't be put off by the fact that it is set in old times. U will be pleasantly surprised to find that it's actually great."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Austin lays out all of her witt and charm within the first three pages of this novel and by the third and fourth chapters you won't be able to put the book down. If you find yourself unable to keep up with Georgian style of writing (or if you are guy), however, this may not be the best book for you. ;)"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Being a student (10th grade), I feel obliged to relate to other students not only how much I enjoyed this novel, but also that it may not be right for everyone. It seems that many other students do not particularly like the novel, especially the male crowd. If my class was ever assigned P&amp;P I am sure that there would be many complaints from my classmates... but they complain about every novel we are assigned, and therefore I can never really trust their opinion. If you are a student looking to read P&amp;P I highly recommend it. My own ideas on this novel are quite favorable. I am sorry that not everyone has a taste for Austen. I consider her one of the best authors who ever lived. I enjoyed reading Pride and Prejudice as well as other Austen novels. Her novels, especiall P&amp;P, are quite funny and I have often found myself laughing outloud on many occasions (which is not an easy feat). Pride and Prejudice is not a novel to be over looked."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is one of the finest of Jane Austen's work. The novel centres around the Bennet family, who are the principal inhabitants of the village of Longbourn. Mrs. Bennet is a marriage obsessed mother, whose dearest wish is to see her five daughters married and settled. As it is, the Longbourn estate is entailed on a distant male cousin, for Mr. and Mrs. Bennet lack a male heir. This makes the five sisters, Jane, Elizabeth, Mary, Kitty and Lydia, increasingly dependent on husbands to provide for them, if their father was to die. We see the different personalities of the five sisters, but the two that stand out are the two eldest, Jane and Elizabeth. Elizabeth Bennet, the heroine of the novel, challenges and changes the established rules of class barriers. Her marriage to Mr. Darcy, an aristocrat who has an income of \\"ten thousand a year,\\" allows Elizabeth to climb the social ladder and cross social boundaries, despite the strictly stratified class lines of Austen's time. Elizabeth's eldest sister Jane, also makes an advantageous match with Mr. Bingley, a member of the noveau riche. Times were changing even as Jane Austen was writing. Although Mr. Darcy's aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, lamented over her nephew's and Elizabeth's engagement, her angry objections were overruled. The ancient aristocratic voice became faint and was silenced as times changed."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is my favorite book of all time. I have read it so many times that the cover is falling off and the spine is incredibly damaged. Basically, Pride and Prejudice focuses on Elizabeth Bennet, a young and independent woman whose mother is trying to marry off her and her sisters to the highest bidder. They have several suitors, including Mr. Darcy, Mr. Bingley and Mr. Wickham. At first glance, Pride and Prejudice seems just like a regular Regency romance (making you wonder why it is such a widely acclaimed book); however, it is much more than that.In Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen offers social commentary on a wide range of subjects, including corruption of the Church, marriage, and women's rights. In addition, each time I read it, I realize more and more that not only is Jane Austen a genius, but she also has a great sense of humor (this can been seen through Mr. Collins, the wordy church leader, Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth's social-climbing mother, and many of the other characters). Several of the minor characters are used as stereotypes in order to get Austen's point across (for example, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, one of the snobbiest rich women in all of literature, and Lydia, Elizabeth's flighty youngest sister).Even if you don't care about Jane Austen's views on the society of her time, Pride and Prejudice still offers a lot. Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy have perfect chemistry, as do Jane and Mr. Bingley. Elizabeth is way ahead of her time--no women of her stature were expected to be picky about who they married, but Elizabeth is not willing to settle for anything but the best. Then of course, there's the idea that you shouldn't judge people before you get to know them and that you shouldn't let your pride get in the way of your opinions about others (hence the name Pride and Prejudice).This book is great for everyone-it contains romance, comedy, and even politics of Austen's time. Although the language might be hard to understand at first, it's definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It is almost 200 years since \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" was first published. It ought to be the equivalent in literature of those faded, dried flowers that used to be found pressed between the pages of the old family bible. Instead it is redolent of freshly cut flowers still carrying a sprinkling of morning dew.The freshness and the perfection of form are certainly astonishing. Jane Austin is as good as story teller as ever picked up a pen, knowing exactly how to construct plots, and what incidents and dialogues to detail in full and what to briefly summarize. Her \\"world\\" is small but intricately constructed. Every characteristic, quality and idea has a precise and fixed value, all being ranked strictly and sternly according to decorum, logic and morality.Despite its architectural perfection, however, a recent re-reading reveals one or two construction features that are questionable. How could it be, for example that Fitzwilliam Darcy could have such a dragon for an aunt? I also wonder about the friendship between Darcy and Bingley. How did it begin? It is obviously important to each, but we are given nothing of its history.Jane Austen lived long enough to see this book published and enjoyed amongst her own family and a small readership. Her mother entertained family members with it, reading it, in Jane Austen's estimation, a little too quickly. Distinguished British actress Lindsay Duncan reads it with perfect timing and inflexion in this highly recommended audio tape format, which presents the novel in an unabridged version of just over twelve hours."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is the best book I have ever read.

I highly reccomend it!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"If you like this kind of story...Pride and Prejudice is the best relationship story I have ever read. There have been many off-springs, sequels, movies etc. in the tradition of P&amp;P. Jane Austen is the master of interpersonal relationships and her tales take us back to a gentle era where things not being equal, women have to make the most of whatever situation they are born into. Austen introduces us to Elizabeth Bennett, a strong woman who is a devoted sister and daughter and very honest with her heart. She has become one of my favorite heroines in Literature not only because of her heart, but also for her ability to grow. One of the most enjoyable aspects of this book was watching as the main characters are transformed throughout the telling. Mr. Darcy, who is perhaps one of the more idealized men in fiction, recognizes his weaknesses through Elizabeth and she in turn learns from him.The cast of characters are some of Austen's most unforgettable. Mr. Collins the dim-witted cousin who thinks he is quite a pious man and a good catch for any women. The annoyingly cheeky Lydia, Mrs. Bennett the nagging mother with not much upstairs, but good intentions none the less, and many more. They all held my interest throughout the book and left me wanting more of them. I highly recommend this book to be read and re-read many times. You will see how great characters are developed and a great relationship is formed."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride And Prejudice, two of the worst things in our society (since like...forever).

When I was young, I read Nancy Drew, Perry Mason, and Agatha Christie novels like food. I found the titles of such classics as Pride and Predjudice, One Flew over the cuckoos nest, The Great Gatsby, Death of a Saleman, and Wuthering Heights, to be pretentious; and if they didn't have murder and suspense, I didn't bother opening the cover. But one day while watching A&amp;E, I saw a glimpse of the BBC production of Pride and Prejudice, and I was hooked. I was amazed that a book written way before my time could be of any worth. After watching the movie, I picked up the book, and read it from cover to cover. I found that Mr. Darcy and Ms. Bennett were intriguing characters, and I was utterly surprised when Mr. Darcy confessed his &quot;ardent love&quot; for her, also when he wrote the long letter of rebuttal to her claims to his bad character. At first, you despise Mr. Darcy, but as the book progresses, you find yourself liking him more and more. This whole book was very well-written and interesting, and now ranks with my favorite novels of all time, along with the classics listed above. For those who don't see how special and unique this book is, I suggest that you watch the video (starring Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth), because anyone who has ever seen it that i know of has turned into a huge english literature fan."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is a wonderful work that definitely is a window into the life of the 18th century. However, the reading of it is bogged down a little because of the speech ( wonderful, but tedious at the same time). Not for immediate gratification people but I will be reading all her works in due time..."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I read the book Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austin. It takes place in 18th Century, Longbourn, England. The two main characters of this book are Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy. In the beginning of the story they do not get along at all. I think that the antagonist of this story is Lady Catherine de Bourgh. This story is about the interaction between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. They have several encounters throughout the book and some of them weren't so friendly. Elizabeth is witty and sarcastic, while Mr. Darcy is perceived as proud and arrogant. This book is about the both of them learning to overcome their differences and falling in love somewhere in the middle.I really like the way Jane Austen writes, it is very descriptive and you can see a clear picture in your head of exactly what she's saying. She starts out with her main character and you know exactly who they are and where they're coming from. But then you get to read and see how they change throughout the story. I think that the theme of this story is to look from other people's perspectives and not be so centered on yourself and you might be surprised what you find. When I was first assigned to read a classic I wasn't thrilled, but then as I got reading I came to find that I really loved this book and now it's probably one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"That was a very interesting audio book - I had never read the book and now I know."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride & Prejudice has turned out to be my favorite book when it comes to romance novels...and that's saying something since I'm a 21 year old who reads ALOT.Elizabeth Bennet is such a smart and kind, yet of course flawed heroine, that I felt like I actually got to know her. Austen made her characters so tridimensional I was amazed...not many writers arecapable of that.When it comes down to Mr.Darcy, I was extremely satisfied with him as well, and every time I read a scene with him and Elizabeth , I giggled at their witty replies to each other, they most definitely made me swoon.Learned from this.

This novel didn't get interesting to me until page 202. If you look above at the total page number, you'll see this is WELL into the novel.I didn't feel any tension? Any real conflict?So there's a woman living in a house with her parents (both of whom are pretty kooky, though Mama Bennet takes the cake) and four sisters (only one of whom seems remotely redeemable.) They talk, they walk, they go to parties, they get interested in marriage then get dumped, then someone else wants to marry one of them but moves away, more parties, some sewing, some cards, yada yada yada.I read this novel searching for WHAT in the world it is people like about it.Then it hit me: the tension is the life depicted.Jane Austen was living this life-an exceedingly intelligent woman (evidenced by her prose) who is made to reside behind doors hoping a man will marry her and hoping he is someone she'll respect.An insipid existence. A passive life for an active mind.The conflict isn't within the characters. The conflict is between the author and her readers.So how does Austen portray the absurdity of her life without alienating her readers? She creates an intelligent woman and then contrasts her with absurd characters. She gives us Jane, a sweet woman who is considered beautiful by everyone (though her mind is given no notice.) She gives us Elizabeth, a smart girl who is forever compared to her socially perfect sister. She gives us a mother who wants nothing but five sons-in-law, a father who can barely stand the presence of any of these women (or their prospective boyfriends), and a trio of silly sisters either buried in books or the mirror. Their ultimate life goal? Marriage.Having no money makes acheiving this goal very difficult.Wanting love? Equality? Conversation that isn't empty? Nearly impossible.Along comes cranky but rich Mr. Darcy.Somehow Austen has to find a way to make the rich guy see the poor woman's intelligence, and the poor woman see the rich (arrogant) guy's shrewdness.Both of them are trapped in an absurd game. Both of them know it's an absurd game but neither of them can say it's absurd, and Austen daren't let on she knows it's absurd because everyone buying the book is trapped in the very same game.She displays her novel as a light-hearted love story. In truth, I think it's a firestorm. She's shouting, as loud as she dares, \\"Does anyone else think this is stupid?\\"If you're reading for entertainment, it starts around 202. If you're reading to see Victorian society laid out on a surgical table and diced with style, it starts at page 1.4/5 for Pride and Prejudice."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Published in 1817, twenty years before Queen Victoria came to the throne, this novel allows the reader to travel through time to a bygone era where the pace of life was much, much slower than what we experience today. News came only through the mail or newspapers; travel was by horse-drawn coach. Listening to this work is thus a truly refreshing experience.In addition, the main characters, the Bennett sisters, have limited interests. With no educational, professional or political concerns, their only concern is to get married, what will guarantee their future social and financial status. They lead simple, sheltered lives and apparently have no notion of the work and efforts put in by servantsto produce dinners, balls, gowns, etc.The writing style is congruent with the times. The work itself is very long, meticulously written with very slow, restricted action.The audio book's narrator is truly excellent and succeeds, while remaining unaffected, to add dramatic interest by very astutely modifying her voice for each character.All in all, this novel is heartily recommended for a worthwhile escape from our hectic 21st century."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is amazing and perfect for anyone just being introduced to Austen.

It is unfortuante I waited until my 30s to read it. A true classic I'll never tire of reading again and again!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"What could I possibly say about Jane Austen's most famous novel that hasn't already been said? Even those who haven't read it surely know the name Mr Darcy, and how he's the romantic ideal of every housewife around the world. Everyone knows that he and Elizabeth Bennett are one of the most famous examples of a dislike-at-first-sight acquaintance that gradually matures into mutual respect and understanding, and I'm sure a healthy portion of that generalized \\"everyone\\" also knows that the novel also contains Austen's requisite commentary on class, marriage, wealth and families. Witty, self-deprecating Elizabeth is one of the most beloved heroines of all times (to this day, I find that I will always like a female protagonist if she reminds me of Elizabeth) and the novel itself begins with what is one of the most famous opening lines in English literature: \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of good fortune must be in want of a wife.\\"The true meaning of this line is obvious, and sets the tone for the entire novel: that it is not young men who are on the search for wives, but young women who are in want of eligible husbands, and that it is only society and decorum that dictates that the search should be undertaken by the men. Like all Austen's novels, the story is told from the point of view of a young woman, just beginning to find her place in the community and the world, and who is expected by everyone around her to be on the look-out for a husband. Yet this is not the first thing on Elizabeth Bennett's mind - as the second of five sisters, she's more preoccupied with keeping her younger sisters in check and making sure her beloved elder sister Jane is well matched in life. And if it's to a wealthy bachelor, then so much the better! Although reasonably well-off, the Longbourne estate is entailed on a cousin of their father, and so the girls face grim futures if they do not marry well before their father's death.A cynical and sarcastic recluse, Mr Bennett spends most of his time either baiting or avoiding his vacuous wife, whose most pressing concern in life is to marry off her daughters. Her prospects are suddenly promising when news comes that the neighboring estate of Netherfield is being lent out to a young man by the name of Mr Bingley: pleasant, wealthy, and immediately smitten with Jane. However, society is considerably less impressed by Bingley's companion. Mr Darcy is cold, arrogant and snobbish, who, on being invited to dance with Elizabeth, says of her: \\"\\"she is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt me.\\"Elizabeth takes an immediate disliking to him, an attitude that is only enforced when she meets the charismatic Mr Wickham who tells her he was the son of the late Mr Darcy's steward, and that the present Mr Darcy robbed him of his rightful inheritance as stipulated in his father's will. A further black mark against Darcy is drawn when Elizabeth learns that he (along with Bingley's spiteful sisters) has deliberately forced a wedge between Mr Bingley and Jane, in the attempt to \\"save\\" his friend from a bad match.It is to her utmost astonishment then, when Mr Darcy tells Elizabeth that he's in love with her and proposes marriage. Telling her that he's struggled against his will, reason and character in order to take this action, (and pointing out obvious disadvantages of the match - on his side), Elizabeth is hardly impressed by his assumption that she'll accept him, and takes the opportunity to tell him exactly what she thinks of him.And yet after this disastrous encounter, Elizabeth begins to learn more about her rejected suitor and his circumstances. Perhaps she's been blinded by her own prejudice against him, just as his pride initially made him so un-gentleman-like toward her...One misconception concerning \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the belief that Elizabeth and Darcy are an early example of the \\"belligerent sexual tension\\" clich&eacute;, in which two characters hide their secret attraction to each other by pretending that they dislike each other. This assumption has always bugged me, as it is certainly *not* what is at work here. Austen is not only poking fun at the notion of love at first sight, but more importantly, is riffing the idea that two people would try to hide their passion by pretending that they don't like each other (the foolish Mr Collins believes that Elizabeth deliberately refuses his marriage proposal just because women often pretend to reject their suitors to hid their true feelings). Elizabeth and Darcy are legitimately unimpressed by each other at the start of the novel, but it is their growing understanding and desire to become a better person for the sake of the other that makes up their storylines. Both of them have to change in order to deserve each other: Elizabeth to overcome her prejudice, and Darcy to realize that he \\"has been a selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle.\\"In a similar vein, it's important to note that Elizabeth - although prejudiced - is not entirely mistaken when it comes to accessing Mr Darcy's character. Although there is more to the Wickham story than meets the eye, her perception of him as arrogant and proud is indeed correct. It is her words to him after his proposal that force Darcy to reassess all that he's learnt in his lifetime; yet when she learns the truth and cries \\"till this moment I never knew myself,\\" we can see just how shaken she is to learn that her judgment is not as infallible as she thought it was.Different readers take different things from \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" - at its most simplistic, it's a Cinderella story about a worthy young woman who marries the man of her dreams and by doing so elevates her social standing. On a more contextual level, others approach the text as a vigorous satire of the social norms and expectations of Austen's day, in which the desperate hunt for a husband to ensure a woman's future has to be hidden beneath the constraints of civilized society.Although the novel may seem deceptively small in scope and content (in regards to the setting and general theme of marriage) this is a story that explores the depth of human relationships and the need for personal growth; a simple story about complex characters. Though it is not widely thought to be Austen's best novel - that distinction often goes toEmma- whichever way you look at it, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is considered Austen's lightest and most entertaining read, and is certainly her most famous. If you haven't read it yet - what are you waiting for?"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's timeless classic. This is a fantastic edition! These little books are well-made, hand-sized, have a slip cover to protect the fabric book binding, and include an attached ribbon bookmark.

A loss to libraries everywhere if they're gone for good.UPDATE: March 2009It appears that Barnes and Noble only sold these little books with their name attached! Most titles (and many additional ones) are still readily available on Amazon.co.uk.

Thanks!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This -its author's most popular novel-revolves around the Bennett family which consists of Mother,Father and 5 daughters.The family is not wealthy and marrying off the progeny to suitable young men is a financial necessity, something felt particularly sharply by the Mother.The family and the district roundabout is thrown into confusion by the arrival of 2 wealthy young men both of whom are unattached.There is Charles Bingley who leases a house close to the Bennett home ,and his friend Mr Darcy with whom he shares. Visits are exchanged between the households and Bingley falls in love with the eldest Bennett daughter ,Jane.The second daughter ,Elizabeth, and Darcy circle each other warily.There is much verbal sparring and Elizabeth-clever,witty and ironic-finds herself intrigued by Darcy while being repelled by his apparent aloofness and seemingly arrogant demeanour.She also hears negative things of him from other people.Events conspire to keep the pair apart and a mix of social snobbery,self-will and just plain misunderstandings are other barriers that must be overcome if true love is to triumph over its enemies -pride and prejudice.I have concentrated above on the relationship between darcy and Elizabeth but while this is the key relationship in the book it also has some well drawn supporting figures such as Lady Catherine de Bourgh ,a monster of snobbery and self-satisfaction personifying the aristocaracy at its worst and Mr Collins ,the oleaginous and toadying clergyman whose true colours emerge in his cringe worthy proposal to Elizabeth.The book is popular as a romance and while recognising this dimension to it have to say that for me it works best as a social comedy and an acute dissection of manners and relationships.It is among the great literary comedies as well as romances and is very clear eyed and unsentimental about such matters as marriage and social convention .This is not just a museum piece and deserves its wide readership"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This was an assigned reading book in 7 grade.

I admit without pleasure that I am partial to romance novels from the same time period. I also admit that it was very refreshing to read a less formulaic and shallow, meaning more creative, intelligent and worthy book set in this time.My favorite character must be Mrs. Bennet. Can anybody be more delusional, obnoxious and wacko? I laughed and cringed each time I heard her voice which I really did hear as I listened to the book on my mp3 player. And then there is Elizabeth Bennet, the heroine. Right at the beginning of the book she meets Mr. Darcy and it's dislike at first sight on both sides.Since her sister and Darcy's best friend fall in love, Elizabeth has to encounter Mr. Darcy repeatedly. Other events force the two to meet again and again and Elizabeth almost laughs out loud when finally ... but I don't want to spoil your question of \`what will happen if anything between Elizabeth and Darcy?'.I really liked Elizabeth' character development. I admire her steadfastness and honesty."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"What a wonderful book. It was written in 1797 and is still a most incredibly romantic story, even for us modern women! Jane Austen's observations of people's characters and behaviors are excellent.I recommend this book to anyone who has seen the movie, and wants more!Or to any hopeless romantics. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Austen wrote PRIDE and PREJUDICE in the mid-1790's and it is definitely a reflection of it's times. She speaks of an era where 'true' gentlemen did not engage in 'trade' (a term encompassing what today would include professions) and doing so would definitely lower not only him but his extended family's social status. Women were considered educated if they could play the piano well, or sing, or draw or were skilled at decorative needlework. The only acceptable occupation for a gentlewoman was marriage, an enterprise that her extended family was commited to helping her achieve for the alternative was spinsterhood as a dependent to some family member.PRIDE AND PREJUDICE centers on the Bennet family, a quiet country gentleman of modest means who lives with his wife and five daughters in southern England. As the story begins his family is in an uproar over the news of an eligible gentleman moving to the neighborhood. To the delight of Mrs. Bennet it quickly becomes apparent that Jane, the eldest daughter, has caught his eye. This is of special importance, since at 22 Jane's prospects are beginning to fade. The romance is not without obstacles which are further complicated by the romance of her next younger sister, the outspoken Elizabeth and the outrageous behavior of Lydia, the youngest daughter. In the end though, love, or at least matrimony, conquers all.The story begins rather slowly but the descriptions of the characters alone make it worth pressing on to the finish. Austen manages to bring them to life to the extent that the reader will probably be able to describe each in detail. PRIDE AND PREJUDICE has been called the first comic romance, and, although subtle by today's standards, some of the comic scenes are hysterical.If this novel were written by a 21st century author it would probably be about a third shorter, not a better novel but a more accessible one to a modern reader. The 18th century style with it's long, complicated sentences filled with detail make for slow reading, frustrating for a reader who is anxious for some action. It is also a bit difficult for a modern day reader to comprehend the culture that Austen is describing, one where a young woman walking alone is considered improper, where having a lawyer in the family is an embarrassment, where a wealthy country family could select the local minister. For a reader unfamiliar with this time period, particularly for a younger reader, an annotated edition would probably be helpful."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is Jane Austen's most popular novel and it is remarkable that it has sustained such a high popularity 200 years after it was originally published. The primary plot of the story follows Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy in a highly contentious courtship that begins with mutual contempt but evolves quite unexpectedly for both into very different feelings. Subplots involve her sister Jane and Mr. Bingley in a courtship of their own as well as the romantic entanglements of various other sisters and friends. The story is a bit of a roller coaster ride with soaring hopes and crushing disappointment in store as events unfold. I won't reveal the ending for the handful of people who haven't read it but suffice to say that the novel concludes in a way that leaves the vast majority of readers well satisfied.Darcy and Elizabeth are complex and multi-layered characters who both grow and change somewhat as the book progresses. They are the heart and soul of the book and about as well fleshed out as any characters you are likely to see. The supporting characters, however, are considerably less deep and are more caricatures than anything else. Some are good and kind like Jane and Mr. Bingley, and others are ridiculous and vain like Mrs. Bennet but none are remotely as substantial as Darcy and Elizabeth. So, does this ruin the book? Hardly. These secondary characters offer a wealth of material for the author as she plays them off of Darcy and Elizabeth.This novel is almost certainly the one where Austen best displays her sharp-edged wit both through Elizabeth's dialogue and in the narrative voice describing some of these characters and their actions. If some of them were less ridiculous, the potential for the satire would be weakened considerably. And make no mistake, Pride and Prejudice is as much a satire of the time it was written, as it is a romantic drama. Even today, the prose is quite funny and enjoyable. The Enriched Classics edition is also nice because it includes footnotes explaining some of the language and/or references that were well known at the time but confusing today's readers.In summary, this is a great novel. Admittedly, there were times where I thought a character's behavior was a bit over-the-top but the overall story is so riveting and the book so compelling that I just can't find serious fault with it. Pride and Prejudice is deserving of its reputation and I highly recommend it to Austen fans and newcomers alike."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is probably my favorite classics.

While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of a halfway decent marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...Reading \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Lizzie and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Jane Austen about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).The only real problem: Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.But despite that formality, Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other. She also wrote some unbelievably sharp-edged dialogue with plenty of witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But Austen also weaves in startlingly romantic moments between them (\\"No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting\\").It's hard to imagine a better fictional couple than Lizzie and Darcy, despite their rocky start (a major-league snub at a dance). Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways, with quick minds and even quicker tongues. Darcy is a selfish, rather haughty man man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.It also has a solid supporting cast: the painfully practical Charlotte Lucas, slimy clerics, virtuous-looking rakes, sisters ranging from saintly to snobby, and the lovable Mr. Bingley and perpetually optimistic Jane. Lizzie's family also adds plenty of color to the story, including the screechy and hilariously mercurial Mrs. Bennett and the barb-tongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love. An absolute must-read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"By far one of Jane Austen's most celebrated novels, Pride and Prejudice exists as a groundbreaking novel that paved the way for entertainment today. Think of Pride and Prejudice as a 19th century daytime soap chock-full of deceit and motive. Without the novel, we would probably live in a world free from \\"Gossip Girl\\" and \\"The Hills\\". Well, I guess that wouldn't be such a tragedy. But overall, Pride and Prejudice displays Austen's precise use of the English language, coupled with intricate interpersonal relationships that are sure to keep readers amused.Pride and Prejudice centers on the Bennets, a middle class family living in 19th century rural England. The protagonist, Elizabeth Bennet, is witty and attractive while her older sister Jane is shy and sensible. Their younger sisters, Mary, Kitty, and Lydia exist as foils; as they are immature and ridiculous. Also in contrast, Mrs.Bennet is scatter-brained and judgmental, while Mr. Bennet is serious and dislikes any frivolity.The Bennets' world is turned upside down when a wealthy gentleman named Mr.Bingley arrives at his country home in a neighboring town. Accompanying Mr.Bingley are his snobby sisters and his impolite friend Mr.Darcy. It is when the Bennets, particularly Elizabeth and Jane, begin to intermix with their upper class arrivals that the drama is truly set in motion. The characters from both economic classes experience love, heartbreak, deceit, loss, and the side effects of pride and social standing.For those readers who seek an action packed, plot driven novel, Pride and Prejudice is not for you. The novel relies on character development and there are several chapters where the plot remains stagnated. Also, it is difficult at times to decipher some of the text, due to the fact that it is written in antiquated English. Again, this book is not for you if you do not wish to interpret phrases such as \\"she fancied herself nervous\\" (page 7) or \\"a mixture of quick parts\\" (page 7).Although it is more of a difficult read and is often stagnant, Pride and Prejudice has remained a classic for a reason. The novel's romanticism and elaborate depiction of characters has and will continue to make it a favorite among readers."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"These little classic editions are perfectly sized (small) and handsomely built.

While her older sister, Jane, has her own troubles with Mr. Darcy's friend, Mr. Bingley.This is a love stories for more than one, full of marriage do's and don'ts. It is also full of wonderful dialogue and a timeless plot.This is one of my very favorite books. I love how everything that could possibly go wrong does go wrong. My favorite part about it is that I can relate to the story although it obviously was not written in this time period.My favorite mix up is how Mr. Darcy is convinced that Jane does not love Mr. Bingley so he separates them, causing Elizabeth to refuse his offer of marriage. He then goes through a long process of tiny deeds with the hope of redeeming himself in Elizabeth's eyes.One of my favorite characters is Mrs. Bennett. Forever causing her daughters' grief with her thoughtless comments and impropriety, she contributes to much of her daughters' unhappiness; Although all she wants for them is to be well-married and happy.I recommend this book with a love for classics who do not get bored with a lot of dialogue (like my sisters do).E @ 3 Book BeesOriginally posted @ [...]Ima swagbucks superstar @ [...]"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It is beneficial at times to step away from our classics of literature, to take them down from their high pedestals and look at them without pretension. No novel, no matter how well-regarded, is universally esteemed - Twain, Emerson, and Charlotte Bronte all savaged Pride and Prejudice in print - so let us, for a few moments, stop treating it as holy writ and just look at it as a novel, at how it holds up to a modern casual reader.Pride and Prejudice (1813) is Jane Austen's novel of manners - it thoroughly explores the ins, outs and economics of nineteenth-century courtship. The novel's central character is Elizabeth Bennet, one of five daughters, whose family lives in a country village. Two wealthy, eligible bachelors move to town, and romance, confusion and animosity ensue.Austen populates her novel with all manner of flawed characters. Many of them are annoying - that is, they behave badly and are antagonistic toward the main characters - but they all show at least some depth. No one here is without flaw, but no one here is without virtue, either (except Mr. Collins, the most ludicrous of them all). And this is why the novel works: because Austen treats her characters and their social milieu gently, delicately (well, except Mr. Collins). If she had done otherwise, if she had been more cutting, she would have lost the sympathy in the reader that many of these characters engender.To the modern audience, Austen's plotting is rather sluggish, although it must be recalled that novels moved at a rather more leisurely pace then. At any rate it often seems that there is one too many side plots, or perhaps one too many visits to relatives, and there are patches that can be quite hard to get through. But you don't go to Austen for plot - you go to her for clever dialogue, for a delightful turn of phrase. That is what she thrives at, and that is what she is best remembered for. And in spite of the novel's overlength, Austen delivers a full and completely satisfying payoff. Rarely is a happy ending so fulfilling, and it may not be until the last few pages of the book that it becomes evident to the reader how masterfully Austen has set it up. And this is a large reason why the novel has such enduring appeal.Much of the nuance in Pride and Prejudice may be lost on casual modern readers. For example, the character of Mrs. Bennet is the object of great scorn from many readers, and this has only been exacerbated by the film adaptations of the novel. But while marrying for love is the norm today, then, it was not; Mrs. Bennet is the only one looking out for the Bennet family's financial future.Pride and Prejudice is, on the whole, a satisfactory and clever novel, and, at present, one whose merits are diminished mostly by readers too far removed to understand it in its fullness, or whose tastes have diverged too far."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I bought this book because my own copy was severely damaged after years of peruse. The picture of the cover was not available online at that time. I was sorely disappointed when the book arrived and I realised that this is not Jane Austen's original novel, but a severely butchered version, probably adequate for 8 year olds.So, should you be looking for a present for a child, this is probably an excellent choice. Should you be looking for a cheap copy of the master novel, search further."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I decided to go to the library and take out the book after seeing the movie a few weeks ago. The movie was good but the book is so much better. It was well written, funny and everything you can expect from a good novel. Definitely a must read even if it is not required for class."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"If you only read one Jane Austen book, this is the one to pick. But if like the rest of us, you find something so completely witty and enjoyable in Pride and Prejudice, you'll pick up the rest of her books and read them all."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Who could not get swept up in the thorny romance of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy? And what girl hasn't fallen in love at least a little bit with the prickly yet big-hearted Mr. Darcy? This book has been made into mutiple miniseries (the A&E one is hands-down my favorite) and movies, while many modern screenplays have borrowed (and downright stolen) from this classic, romantic comedy of errors--or prejudices if you will--and for good reason. Like a fine wine, this novel just seems to keep getting better with (my) age."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Reading this book is like taking a sailboat ride to the world's best locations: exciting, smooth, tumultuous, but all in all a fantatic ride. Austen delightfully teases you in your role as omnicient reader, leaving you tantalized by the characters in all of their plots and sub-plots. You want to reach into the book and tell the characters you know the solutions to all their problems. You cheer the characters on through their pleasures and foibles. The language is as smooth as silk and as alluring as diamonds."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is Jane Austen's finest novel and one must assume that the author identifies rather strongly with the female protagonist. The book is the perfect balance of story, prose, structure, and characters. It evokes many emotional responses in the reader. The novel is among the greatest novels of all time on par with for example Flaubert's \\"Madame Bovary\\" or Tolstoy's \\"Anna Karenina.\\"The present novel is about a young woman, Elizabeth Bennet, who comes from an upper middle class family living in rural England. She has four sisters plus an interesting mother and a wise but witty father. The novel follows the romances and complications of the Bennet girls, especially Elizabeth and her sister Jane. Beyond knowing those facts, you should not read any more about the plot until you read the novel, or you will risk spoiling the read. I will not give away the plot, but will only describe the writing style and structure.I read Austen's \\"Mansfield Park,\\" then read some analysis by Nabokov from his Cornell \\"Lectures on Literature\\" and the comments of Jane Stabler from the introduction of the Oxford version. After that I got a bit excited and read Austen's early writing \\"Sense and Sensibility,\\" along with the analysis by Margaret Doody in the Oxford version. Yes, I guess I am now an Austen fan, and it is a pity that she did not live longer. \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is my third Austen novel and so far the most fun to read..Based on the three novels written over two different time periods, it is clear that she developed a certain fixed writing style and a common structure. She uses the early pages to introduce the families, and other characters, and give start the story. She moves characters around from place to place in part for time shifting. She does a wrap up in the last few chapters.Those opening chapters are an obstacle for most readers. She uses her own vocabulary and has an unusual way of structuring her prose. That structure is a trademark of Austen's writing. Also, she manages to work in a lot of drama and social issues with some humour and irony.Based on what Nabokov and others are saying, she got her inspiration from Sheridan, Richardson, Henry Fielding, Sir Walter Scott, and the poetry of Cowper. She modulates the complexity of the prose to reflect the characters - such as making the sentences of Sir Thomas Bertram in \\"Mansfield Park\\" somewhat elaborate instead of describing how the character is dressed or a similar description to convey qualities and traits, i.e.: she uses the complexity of speech to convey character. Also, she uses lateral shifts and epigrammatic notations and similar literary techniques. These techniques are interesting for some readers but just confusing for others. It is all part of the price of admission to entering the world of Jane Austen, and it is part of the fun in reading her novels.Overall, once you get past reading and digesting 50 pages or so and have absorbed the Jane Austen vocabulary (words such as felicity, remonstrance, countenance, etc.) and understand the structure of her prose, the book becomes a compelling read. The second Austen novel seems much easier than the first.This was written by a mature Jane Austen and many think it is her best work and it is one of the most delightful and pleasant reads. One must conclude that the very intelligent and witty Elizabeth character is a reflection of the author herself."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have always loved P&P it is timeless both in its writing style and it's subject matter. Like Romeo and Juliet this book's story line have been shamelessly borrowed by novelists and film makers for years. I can think of at least a dozzen books and movies made within the past couple of decades which attempt to rehash this untopable novel. I love the social commentary Austen makes in the book through the interactions between the Bennett family and others in the book . I heartily recomend this work to the romantics in this world, and all others who just want a timeless storyin which love, honour and to some extent vulnerability trample the strictist rigitity of class, snobbery and aloofness."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Austen's finest work is, in my humble opinion, \\"Emma\\". This is, however, the finest work that the average man can actually read without being entirely baffled by the intrigue of the female mind. This, my second Austen, is perhaps the best to get anyone interested in Austen's style of writing. But be warned, \\"Pride and Prejudice can keep you rivetted for hours..."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is mainly focused on Elizabeth Bennet and her romance with Mr. Darcy, which comes about in a very interesting, if not humorous way. Elizabeth first judges Mr. Darcy to be arrogant and conceited, while Mr. Darcy finds himself falling in love with Elizabeth. Another main character is Elizabeth's sister, Jane, who has a troubled relationship with Mr. Bingley, Mr. Darcy's friend. Many exciting events take place involving the many sisters of the Bennet family in this great English story that will keep advanced readers interested.I have to admit, this was a very difficult book. I struggled through most of it, and I like this book much better now that I am finished with it. I guess that means that I like the story, but it took a while to get through reading it. One downside was that there was not much said describing Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy's romance. That might have been somewhat due to the time period in which this story was written. However, I really enjoyed the great detail, which allowed Austen to paint an amazing picture of society in that time period and middle-class expectations. I bought this book, which I am glad I did, because I plan to read it again. This definitely seems like it's one of those books that the reader will enjoy more the second time it is read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I was truly surprised by this tale. I was drawn from the very first page by Mrs. Bennets gossip. What was equally delightful was the sarcastic manner in which Mr. Bennet responded to her chatter, and she was none the wiser. And so begins a tale of wit that engages the minds.From the moment Darcy is mentioned, with his ill manners, we know that he will be key to the story and surely he is. The engaging repetoire between Elizabeth and Darcy is what makes the novel such an interesting read. From their haughty demeanor to falling in love, this tale is rich with engaging conversations.This novel gives an enlightening aspect to the 'higher' society of British life. There is a wicked vein that runs throughout the book, for the outlook on such a life seems quite vain if not ridiculous. Miss Austen does an excellent job of conveying that life to us, with enough wit and sarcasm.I enjoyed this book immensely and would recommend it to anyone wanting a witty read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This plot was definitely fit for me. I am into the suspensful love stories that pull you into the story and won't let you go. This book was like that for me. I felt I could relate to a lot of it in that the girls were fighting over a guy or gossiping about who they think is prettier, or who they admire the most; something i could see my friends and I doing a lot. I think a part of the book that portrays the similarity between my friends and the girls from &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is when the Bennet and theLucas women get together the morning after a ball and discuss all of the details. Mr. Bingley is the hot item in town and they are trying to decide who he likes the most. &quot;Oh!---you must mean Jane, I suppose---because he danced with her twice. To be sure that did seem as if he admired her--indeed I rather believe he did--I heard something about it---but I hardly know what---something about Mr. Robinson.&quot;&quot;Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did not I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies....and which he thought the prettiest? And his answering immediately to the last question---Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet beyond a doubt, there cannot be two opinions on that point.&quot; (pg. 20). I also love all of the characters in her novel. For each one of them i could tink of someone I knew who was exactly like them. I feel like I know Elizabeth, Jane, and Charlotte so well because they each have qualities almost identical to some of my friends. My favorite character throughout this book had to be Elizabeth. She is strong, witty, and extremely intelligent. She has a lot of the qualities that inspire me to be a stronger person that stands up for my beliefs. I love that she is able to battle with Darcy about what makes the &quot;perfect&quot; woman. Her intelligence makes Darcy drool over her. I think Elizabeth would be a good role model for a lot of girls who need to learn what the meaning of independence is, and how to use it. A quote in the book that shows Elizabeth's strength. &quot;My fingers, said Elizabeth, &quot;do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many women's do. They have not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault--because I would not take the trouble of practicing. It is not that I do not believe m fingers as capable as any other woman's of uperior execution.&quot; &quot;Darcy smiled and said, &quot;you are perfectly right.&quot;&quot;Another reason I love this book is because of Jane Austen's writing style. She uses such a large vocabulary that thouroughly illustrated everyone's feelings so well, that it made it hard to put the book down. Austen's wording just seemed so elegant and flowed together perfectly. I felt smart just reading her book. It was definitely challenging because of the old fashioned wording and advanced vocabulary, but it feels like such an accomplishment finishing such a great book. I reccomend this book to anyone who wants to enjoy a great story and get a sense for the social status of women and men during the 19th century. It's a great book, and I have nothing bad to say about it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is the original and most amazing novel of all of Jane Austen novels.The most wonderful chapter is chapter eight where Elizabeth Bennet shows off her witty and exhilarating character. She is very beautiful and has a shining personality.This novel has amazing, fantastic wording as well as chapters. The appropriate age for this novel to be read would most likely be from 16 years of age and up because younger readers aren't mature or they don't have the knowledge that has to be applied to read this novel.Jane Austen beautifully brings out irony of fate; everything is expected to go one way but ends up another. For example, when the Bennet family thought that Wickham took Lydia to London to elope. The family thought the worse. They kept in mind that Wickham could possibly try to bed Lydia and not consider that he would propose to her. They were scared for Lydia and Wickham. At last they were found and brought back to Longbourn estate and surprisingly they were safe and engaged.This has been the best novel I have ever read in my life. I have never indulged in a novel like Pride and Prejudice. I adored the truth and reality that it holds."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen is a book based in the 19th century in England. It was based on the era when money, pride, love, and marriage arrangements had to be the best and the most important thing. In this book the major conflict was their pride and prejudice of the main characters. The book's main characters were the Bennet Family, Bingley, and Darcy. The Bennet family consisted of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, their daughters Jane, Elizabeth, Mary, Kitty, and Lydia. As this story starts we meet all of them along with others minor characters. We find out that they are all concerned about social classes.The best chapter in this book is when Darcy and Elizabeth become engaged. To me it is the best chapter because that shows that they overcame their pride and prejudice. These two characters were deeply in love but couldn't show it to each other not only because of their own pride and prejudice, but also because their family and acquaintances had influenced them wrongly.The literary device I appreciate is comedy. A comedy, in general, is a story that ends happily. The hero or heroine of a comedy is usually an ordinary character who overcomes a series of obstacles that block what he or she wants. It's usually a plot where two young people meet and fall in love. The young lovers must face obstacles to their marriage. At the end of the story Elizabeth and Darcy overcome their conflicts to get together and be able to show their feelings towards each other.I like and recommend this book to anyone who likes to read love books with a little comedy. This book is age appropriate for teens and older people because it gives you a chance to appreciate the differences in lifestyles and beliefs in the 19th century from those of today. This book makes you think of how people believed women had only one futurein life, and that was getting married and raising a family."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It is unfortunate that most first time readers of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE see it merely as one more book to be endured in 11th grade English. However, most soon enough catch the magic of an author (Jane Austen) who can weave a spellbinding tale of love, romance, satire, and passion while all the while poking a not so gentle thrust at the social mores of the early 19th century. This book is no frilly ancestor of a Harlequin romance, even if it shares with the dim-witted heroines of Harlequin a time-honored plot of lovers who meet and find an instant dislike that later morphs into enduring love. PRIDE AND PREJUDICE starts off with that basic premise, but what sets it off as classic is what goes on behind the lovers, Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy. A careful reader usually notes the society in which Elizabeth and Darcy play out their little games of cross-purpose verbal repartee. The world of Austen's PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is a society ruled by conniving and single-minded women who see men only in terms of the size of their wallets. Whenever a new bachelor appears on the scene, the women of the novel (with the exception of Elizabeth, of course) immediately try to guess his income so that they can decide if one wishes to marry him. His age, his looks, his habits are much less significant than his income. A fat purse compensates for a fat head.Modern readers typically call such schemers 'golddiggers,' and according to modern values, perhaps they are, but these readers ought to judge the book's morality against the age in which it was written. Austen (1775 - 1817) lived in an England that prized manners and breeding over all else. It is no surprise, then, that since the reclusive author felt most comfortable only in the company of women, that she would limit her book only to the thoughts, feelings, emotions, and habits of women. In PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, men are never permitted to occupy center stage, nor are they shown interacting independently with other men. If a man is present in any scene, so must a woman to control and observe his actions. Men--even the eventually triumphant Darcy--are generally portrayed as vain, sycophantic, sarcastic, and totally aware that they they are prized only for their money.The world of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, especially if one has seen the fine film version starring Greer Garson, is one that seems to have been built for women to inhabit. All the women wear flouncy, bouncy dresses with huge flowered hats that Scarlet O'Hara might have worn in GONE WITH THE WIND. Even those ladies that complain of poverty never lack the funds to afford those outrageous outfits. Further, Miss Austen stages a ball in just about every third chapter that permits single women to size up eligible men. As these dandefied women and uniformed men speak to each other, the modern reader probably will be surprised at the excessive politeness and deference tossed unerringly about. This strict adherence to a surface morality ought not to fool the reader into assuming that the characters are as inwardly noble as they are outwardly polite. In fact, behind this massive wall of formal phrasing and good manners lies the same fears, jealousies, and general backstabbing that pervade a modern disco. What gives PRIDE AND PREJUDICE its perpetual charm is the biting irony that causes the reader to wonder: 'Did that character say what I think he (or she) just said?' The modern reader can best appreciate Austen's wit if she can read between the lines to sense the tone of the moment. If such a reader can see that this book is a polite if powerful indictment of a way of life that even Austen wished to poke fun of, then perhaps this reader can appreciate the charm of a book that grows with each successive reading."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Neither but I could not, I repeat could not read this book I fell asleep through the first chapter and could not seem to muster enough effort to read the second chapter. I do like Jane Austen movies, but I think in her books she tends to elaborate on things a bit much for my taste. I commend anyone who has read it through though. It is a wonderful classic with humour and romance this is a must read if you can get through it without dozing off."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"**** UPDATED September 30, 2012 (edited here. Extended comment at bottom) ********Pros: A great heroine and romantic story.Cons: The language can be a struggle in the beginning.The Bottom Line: The heroine of the story, Elizabeth Bennet, is one of my top 10 favorites.The story:A young woman, Elizabeth Bennet, is the second eldest of five girls (no boys as the heir). She is a very realistic woman who doesn't believe that beauty or wealth should hinder her from a happy life and marriage. While her sisters give their hearts out to people too quickly. The mother allows all five girls to be \\"out\\" (allowed to find suitors) due to her fears. She is worried that when her husband dies they will be destitute - which is true at the times lifestyle.Elizabeth takes her time in finding her ideal man. She is very proud of her family and prejudice toward the wealthy. Lydia and Kittie (two youngest sisters) are hilarious, and they believe in love at first site of a navy sailor. This doesn't go so well for one of them - i.e. a Mr. Wickham. Mary is the unfortunate middle child whom is neither gifted in \\"the arts\\" nor with words. Jane and Lizzie (Elizabeth), the older two sisters, are more reserved with their hearts. Mr. Darcy also is prejudice and proud, especially when he tries to ruin Jane and Mr. Bingley's relationship. His reasons is that he doesn't see Jane's love towards his friend. The connected relationships all fit perfectly together. Jane Austen shows a new ideal marriage when Mr. Bennet intends to marry off his daughters only if their mate was equal to them - meaning that the marriages should be equal.The language:It's a little difficult to read at first, and my only suggestion is that you should remember that it was written before our time. Most of the words are in the dictionary, but the grammar has definitely changed over the century. Jane Austen also enjoys excessively writing about one subject in the story, which can be difficult to sit through to read. But it still shows that Jane is a great author, especially during her time.My thoughts on the book besides the ones that I've already given is that the book is one of my favorite Austen books, because it has a strong heroine character that I can relate to. The family values are very modern, but yet it also gives a feminist-like style when the characters like Elizabeth are intelligent, and aren't too afraid to speak their mind. This book is a great classics book that I have read numerous times, and am still interested in reading in the future.cheersmichelle (2002)******UPDATE********So 10 years later and after an excessive amount of writing and reading classes, I feel this needs an update.Austen's writing is always a woman's point of view. It's beautifully written with rich characters so that you always feel like you're apart of the story. Austen's fan base is more popular with woman rather than the macho man because she expresses feelings. Her characters communicate to each other rather than shut their feelings away. In the case of 'Pride and Prejudice' these feelings spoken won't always help the character due to either their pride or prejudice.In my experience men are not keen to the idea of talking about how they feel. Austen not only shows this but she allowed woman of her era to have a voice - even if it wasn't etiquette. So men, you should just bear through all the woman talk. And when reading through their blabbering, think about their behavior. Are they childish (I.e. Lydia and Kitty)? Are they behaving with etiquette?The romance in this book is genuine. I can't help but wish for a Mr. Darcy for myself. Austen did a good job in \\"showing\\" us her characters love - rather than today's authors whom \\"tell.\\" This is the example of show your feelings rather than verbally giving them untill our heads are bashed in."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I read &#34;Pride and Prejudice&#34; when I was in college and thought it was an awful bore!

Like her earlier compelling novel, Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice is a romance story. Although there are many different printings of this work, T. Egerton, Whitehall first published it in January 28th 1813 with roughly 370 pages. While the original print did not have illustrations the first wonderful pictures were by Pickering & Greatbatch.Pride and Prejudice owes much of its popularity to its vivid portrayal of character. The story is set in early 19th-century England, a trying time for any unmarried maiden. Elizabeth, the second eldest of the Benett sister, was as open as a closed book shielding her true feelings. While Mr. Darcy would proudly separate himself from the common folk. Both characters are very likable despite their flaws.This pleasurable tale begins with the worries of a caring mother. Back then it was incredibly important for women to get married and none of her five daughters had. Thankfully a young bachelor by they name of Mr. Bingley came to town and was immediately attracted to the oldest Benett sister, Jane. Elizabeth on the other hand was somewhat fond of Mr. Darcy but he seemed to show no interest. Although Jane and Mr. Bingley had grown quite close, he left along with the rest of his party leaving a brokenhearted Jane behind. Elizabeth found out that Mr. Darcy was the one who convinced Mr. Bingley to go. While she was visiting at a friend's house she and Mr. Darcy crossed paths and he tried to propose to her. Still upset that he had broken up Mr. Bingley and her sister she declined the proposal.After a heated argument with Mr. Darcy, Elizabeth saw eye to eye with him and realized they had both been prejudice and maybe a little proud. Fortuitously, Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy both moved back to town were they showed up to the Benett's house and had a somewhat awkward conversation. Later Mr. Bingley, who arrived alone, asked if he could speak to Jane apart from the other. A proposal maybe? If that wasn't enough to fill the mind of Elizabeth, knowing she thinks of Mr. Darcy differently would.Interestingly Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy both recognized that they were prideful and prejudice. Which hints to why the title is call Pride and Prejudice. They're imperfect characters, and that's what people like about them! When I was reading this book I realized what made it different from other romance novels is that the love unfolded gradually. At some points in the book it seemed as if they didn't like each other at all. A lot of stories now a days quickly get to the point, forgetting that telling the story is the best part."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I wanted to read some of the classic novels that are available for Kindle, and now I am hooked! This book was so rich in characters, story and setting, that I felt I had taken a trip back in time, to another era. A wonderful story, that kept me reading into the night. A classic, English romance. Loved it!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Obviously Jane Austen was amazing and Pride and Prejudice is incredible. But WHY would they put this cover on it? Why take a classic and make it look trashy? It looks like Lauren Conrad wrote this book... I am disgusted with the publishers."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is a timeless classic that I recommend for every one to read at least once in their lifetime. Jame Austen is a great author and writer."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have read this book three times and just do not seem to tire of it. It's not only a great classic, but it's readable and often amusing with well-rounded characters and a delightful plot."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride & Prejudice is a classic. A must read for anyone who loves a good love story. Jane Austen was a master of plot and characters, the story is simply brilliant."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It seems almost pointless to write a simple review on this book, but I'm going to anyway. I had to read this for my Women in Literature and Visual Arts class, and it was enjoyable. The characters are well developed, and the plot is simple enough to understand. Overall the book was a bit dry for my personal taste, but it was still good. Jane Austen is a superb author, so it is certainly worth reading."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I loved this when I was 15. I still adore the book three decades later. Timeless romance with people we still fall in love with today, as well as characters who make us want to pull our hair out. The writing style may be a bit intense for those who have grown to short, one and two sentence paragraphs and action that rushes at you, but if you enjoy savouring words and characters and moments, it is magnificent."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is a classic that has touched generations for years. Once I picked it up I couldn't put it down, Austen immediately sucks you in with witty word play, dramatic irony, and catching plot points. The novel captures a wide audience, whether the reader is a hopeless romantic or more practical. It appeals to everyone; I can guarantee that future readers will not be disappointed. The main character, Elizabeth, is complex, stubborn, and full of wit. Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy both exude passion. Although there are multiple story lines the majority of the plot revolves around the love-hate relationship of Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet. Their relationship is full of twists and turns that are incredibly enticing to the audience. \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife,\\" this is the opening line of the novel, and it is perhaps one of the most know phrases in literature. It is incredibly ironic, and ties into the whole book.Pride and Prejudice is a spectacular book for the reason that it leaves readers wanting nothing. Some readers may say that it is an unrealistic ending, because many of the main characters had their fairy tale ending. In my opinion that is what makes this book a great read. There aren't enough happy endings in the world, but when reading about them it feels as if it's your own personal happy ending. Overall, it's a classic romance that I would highly recommend to anyone who enjoys a clever, well written, and whirlwind romance."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I read this for my English class, and I have to say that I loved it!

I'm reading the books now too (they're great, glad I've got them to read as I find time) but the design is truly beautiful. The hardcover book has a gorgeous aqueous / soft matte coating, and it's almost as if the letters/ cover text are screened on top. Really beautiful. One should note that the page edges are also painted to match the color of the cover, so this book's page edges are red. The book is wonderfully typeset so it's very easy to read. I'm so pleased with my purchase. I've purchased A-F (the only ones available at present, and will undoubtedly purchase the entire collection.

The book has way too much talk in it, hardly anything is described in any other way than by someone remarking upon it. But I liked the story overall, and I thought the authors view on pride was interesting. The characters are believable and somewhat relatable. Some parts were hard to understand because the language is outdated, and I wasn't always sure who was speaking. Only that someone always was. But because of the social nature of the novel, I guess that works."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"*This is not a good Kindle version. It doesn't load well and is difficult to read as parts are cut off or wrap oddly.Even though it's free, it's not worth it. It's too frustrating trying to navigate and read.I'd spend a bit of money and get a better version, or better yet, buy the actual book, or even better, buy both. This has got to be one of the most romantic stories of all time.If you're not a Jane Austin fan, you will be within a few moments of entering into her world.For those of you unfamiliar with the story ~ (Do people like that even exist?) ~ Here is a brief summaryThe story takes place in Victorian England. We meet the Bennett family, the mother's sole intent is to marry her daughters off to successful men, ensuring they will be cared for properly since only males can inherit property. The story focuses on Elizabeth Bennett, the second daughter, who is attractive, but not as attractive as her older sister ~ She is also witty, smart, well-read and confident. Now we meet the wonderful Mr. Darcy. He is handsome and rich, but quite prideful and arrogant and rude. He is intrigued by Miss Elizabeth Bennett although he can't really figure out why. She mocks and teases him, and doesn't seem at all impressed with him, like every other female who has crossed his path.Throw in some other characters that help carry the story and you now have in your hands the most wonderful and romantic story ever written.Hmmm ~ perhaps I'm a bit biased. Get it, buy it, borrow it. However you get your hands on this book, read it and fall in love."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I am happy to finally have read it. It is a lovely read that is worthy of being deemed a classic."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I don't know how it came about that - after avoiding it in high school and watching two movie versions of it - I found myself reading PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. I didn't think that the book would be able to much surprise me. But, my goodness, this book is one of the most delightful, compellingly readable pieces of fiction I have ever found. And, oddly enough, knowing the story through the movies made the surprises that the book has to offer all the more valuable.The language Austen uses is fantastic. The book is charming and very funny. The characters are all fully developed and funny, from the annoying Mrs. Bennet to the startling, judgmental Mr. Collins. And the romance is wonderful.Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy are great characters, and I'm glad to finally be acquainted with them in their original form."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I read the adapted version of this novel for children as a kid and I loved it. However, reading the original novel was difficult since I was used to the simple words for the children's one. I even avoided reading it for quite a while until I picked it up again a few days ago. Now I can't seem to put it down. I'm also planning to read Jane Austen's other novels as well."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I admit that when I first heard this story, I was confused by the fast pace. I watch the old movie before reading the book, so I knew what was going to happen. I heard it over again and enjoyed it a lot. Since then I've listened to it many many times. Though the reader is fast paced, I like her different voices for each character.This book is about a 20-year-old woman named Eliza. She lives with her 1 older sister and 3 younger sisters and mother and father in a small village. A new arrival comes to the town. A man named Bingley. He brings his friend Mr. Darcy and his sisters Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley. Eliza's older sister Jane admires Mr. Bingley. But Eliza finds Mr. Darcy a very proud and rude man. She meets another man who catches her fancy.I recommend not reading this book once or twice, but a lot. Then you can really get the feel for what Jane Austen was writing. For me it was a lot more interesting in a fast pace listening then a slow read of the book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's novels have a recurring theme of love and marriage and forever invoke the absurdly beautiful art of humour and irony to fabricate a mesh of interwoven ideas tied by that central idea. Detractors of this late 17th. century and early 18th. century novelist have repeatedly pointed at her unimaginative superficiality and her meek satisfaction to restrain her works on the fringes of the social chaos. Indeed austen never ventures deep into the society's demeanours but it's this contraint of her to resolve to poke fun at the society and the people who live in it by employing the canny and subtle instrument of satire sharpened by sly humour that makes Austen such a popular and hugely succesful novelist as she is. Nowhere is this attribute so vehemently explicit as in \\"Pride and Prejudice\\",regarded by many as the most accomplished work in English literature for its fairy-tale gratifications as well as for its replete involvement of humour.Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" revolves around,as the title itself sugests,the pride of a person and the prejudice of another,both so bizzarely related and paradoxically driving these two persons away from each other. But the \\"first impressions\\" that the general reader gets is only a figment of the authoress's array of ideas conjugated into a rare commodity of literature that both thrills and provokes broodings,and beyond it everything must remain a surprise. Elizabeth Bennet and Mr.Fitzwilliam Darcy are the principle characters of the novel and it's the pride of the latter that actually raiss the prejudice of the former that lents the story an excuse to stretch on as long as it does. \\"Pride and PRejudice\\" is the tale of the gradual stripping down of the prejudice simulataneous with the quiescent passing away of the pride in a quid pro quo style.The Bennets are a family of seven unique members living in the Hertfordshire village of Longbourn and from the very inception it's clear that the book is going to be a light read and a hilarious one at that. Mrs.Bennet,\\"a woman of mean understandind,little information,and uncertain temper\\" whose \\"buisness of life was to get her daughters married\\" is a constant source of laughter in the book,her husband Mr.Bennet,\\"so odd a mixture of quick parts,sarcastic humour,reserve,and caprice\\",is a man deliberately detached from the fetters of responsibility that marriage and fatherhood unfailingly brings and their five daughters are all so invariably different. The eldest,Jane,is a beautiful,placid,unassuming,innocent and believe-good-in-everything girl,Elizabeth is beautiful too and with a certain charm of intelligence and elegance of wit,Lydia and Catherine both are consumed in their false notions of love and marriage and Mary is a book-worm possessing the slightest touch of a philosopher. The story begins when a rich bachelor,a wanteed catch in the authoress's era,Mr.Charles Bingley rents a house near Longbourn. Mrs.bennet is despearate to get one of her daughters married to him and part of her wish does come true indeed when Jane and Mr.Bingley fall in love with each other. But the fairy-tale symphony stops abruptly here and under the influence of his sisters and friend Mr.Darcy---a man who likes to maintain an air of pride and aristrocracy about him and draws a line between him and others---Mr.Bingley returns to London. Of course there's the whisper of a tagedy in this sequence which is easily subdued in the vociferous humourous actions of Mr.Collins,to whom the Bennets's Longbourn estate is entailed. It's his arrival which brings forth the nature of most of the characters. Mrs.Bennet gets a scope to exhibit her want of intelligence,Mr.Bennet is openly satiric and mocking,Elizabeth is cynical though not without reason and Jane is at her inocent best. Mr.Collins proposes Elizabeth,gets rejected and goes on to marry Charlotte Lucas,doughter of the Bennets's neighbour Sir William Lucas. This is one marriage that occurs without even an iota of harmony or intelligence but has all elements of illusory marriage done in haste and without forbrooding.There's a furthur twist in the tale as Darcy conveys Elizabeth his love for her much against his \\"better judgement\\" and gets rejected. Inevitably. And from this conjuction onwards,the principle theme of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" gets its proper shape and dimension. One by one the pieces of rags of prejudice war off Elizabeth and she realises the true character of Wickham who elopes with Lydia and comprehends the man of noble character in Darcy undrneath the layer of abstract ego. Simulataneously Darcy rejects the scepticism his gentryclass has cursed him with and emerges from being \\"the most disagreeable man in the world\\" to a man with \\"no improper pride\\". The metamorphoses in both Elizabeth and Darcy are not sudden or abrupt but gradual yet stunning and reveal the genius of the script-writer to compose a novel of characters in an overtone of irony and delicate humour.In all there're four marriages accomplished in the book and all are vastly different. So a happy-ever-after ending? Yes,but at the same time not without patches of apprehension. In a fine symmetrical plot lacking a concrete stucture and a specific ambition with no specific slots of a 'hero' as such,Jane Austen has managed to portary a variety of characters segmented into different natures. The opening sentence of te novel(\\"It is a truth univerally acknowledge,that a single man in possession of a good fortune,must be in want of a wife\\".) is an ironical statement---perhaps the sharpest in the book---that has descended down the ages to be renowned as one of the better opening lines of any novel. This irony is come to realised in the first chapter itself as we discern that it's not the man who runs after the woman but just the opposite. \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is scattered wit several other ironies that provide food for the subsistence of the plot. Jane Austen also hints at the grotesque pride and egomania sustained by the gentry folk and at the same instant doesn't leave the intellectually deprived petty mentality and confined ambitions of the commonfolk out of her domain of satire. In a world of two differebt parts,Elizabeth and Darcy are the sole strings that hold them together. The regal coupling of narration and dialogue exalt the quality of the novel even higher,though being marked mainly from the perspective of Elizabeth in spite of invoking an omniscient narrator the storyline does lose some gloss. But even so,in a world of imperfection and preposterous false ideas and beliefs,Jane Austen's this remarkable work of literature hints at the chimera of a fairytale translating itself into reality,or be it a hollow reality. All the characters are superbly drawn and in them as wel as in the sequence of all those marvellous events,the reader would decipher his own self and actions from his own life and surroundings. And for that he must be grateful to a writer of excellent wit and humour."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"You will find Jane Austen in high school classrooms, as inspiration for contemporary movies and fiction (Clueless, Bridget Jones' Diary), and at a book club or two. Otherwise, she is not part of us: Her laser-eyes, scathing commentary about society, and merciless fun at the expense of over-the-top piety are missing. In our current Press-Release era, where ads blanket our cities, and celebrities alter their image every other week, Jane would have a field day-- her observations would have been invaluable, her sharp humor liberating.\\"Pride and Prejudice\\"-- the story of independent-minded Elizabeth Bennet's journey to a happy marriage and her rousing rebellion against the stultifying and stale social system of 19th-Century England-- is an adrenaline-rush of a book.As Elizabeth battles the defenders of society (her marriage-obsessed mother, a condescending suitor, and several members of the \\"upper-class\\" trying to stem her promising relationship with the affluent and handsome Mr. Darcy) we sample a world where family, money, and class dictate your friends and suitors.When Elizabeth and Darcy move to his stunning home, they leave the hostility of an uncaring society behind. Through rebellion and stubbornness, they have found Eden."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"For anyone who has ever thought, &quot;I really should read the classics,&quot; 'Pride and Prejudice' is a wonderful place to begin. Why? First, the work is very readable, even though it was written well over a hundred years ago. Second, it's not too long and the chapters are very short. (I hope I'm beginning to convince you...) Third, maybe you'll see yourself in the book or someone you know. Fourth, Austen takes a humorous, entertaining, and throught-provoking look at human nature, which has not changed and probably never will.Austen's heroine, Elizabeth Bennett, is a bright, intelligent young lady who is delighted to see her older sister Jane meet and fall for an English gentleman. At the same time that her sister meets someone, Elizabeth meets a brash, arrogant man named Darcy. Darcy's manner quickly irritates and disgusts Elizabeth beyond belief. There's no way this couple could ever get together, right? :)Austen does a masterful job of telling an intelligent story that works as social commentary, a study of human nature, class distinctions, and so much more. So many subtle shades of human pride, prejudice, arrogance, condescension, and forgiveness are present in the book as they are in real life."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is my favourite book in the world!! This is a story that is full of humour, class conflict, family expectations, dancing, irony and of course, romance.I have read &quot;Pride and Prejuduce&quot; several times and it is still thrilling, waiting to see proud Darcy snub and then fall for the prejudice Lizzy, who is far from willing to give him a chance. However, they both must realise that things are not always as they appear to be.Lizzy's father, Mr Bennett, is absolutely hilarious and is so full of sarcasm and irony that he is one of the funniest characters of Austen's books. Mrs Bennett is also very funny as a hypochondriac whose husband spends most of his time in his library to get away from her! Lizzy herself has a great sense of humour and sometimes uses it to tease Darcy. I have to agree with Jane Austen, as her favourite character of her books is Miss Elizabeth Bennett.This is a book that can be read time and time again. Once you get used to the language, it becomes easier to read and hard to put down. If you ever get a chance to watch the BBC TV series box set, allow yourself lots of time as you will not be able to stop watching it... and it's 6 hours long!!This is the best story that Jane Austen wrote in her lifetime and is still fantastic after 200 years."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Every once in a while, read something which you would normally not read. Pick up something in a genre you rarely explore. Sometimes, you will be absolutely delighted.Recently, I did just that. I picked up a copy of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; -- and thoroughly enjoyed it! (Far more than I thought that I would!) Until this point, my only real exposure to Jane Austen was with the movie &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;.While (as the reader could probably assume) this form of English literature does not represent a genre I typically frequent, I'm certainly not sorry I spent the time. Austen's writing is laced with dry and subtle humor, applied with the spirit of a very generous nature. She also had the gift of being able to very perceptively observe the people around her, and those with whom she came into contact.I highly recommend this tale of young love and happy endings to any and all who need a break from the stress and fuss of the 21st century."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Humphrey Bogart's line to his secretary in &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; could as easily have been addressed to Jane Austen. Long before the woman's movement of the 60s and women's studies courses of the 70s, perceptive and discriminating readers were in agreement about Jane Austen as the supreme master of her craft. In her characterizations, plotting, and language she is the model of exactness and efficiency. There simply is no gratuitous business, no room for sentiment, no place for self-indulgence or personal fantasy. Elizabeth's world is a microcosm of the complex society we habit, each of us making daily compromises, negotiations, and decisions that allow us the maximum degree of self-expression within the limitations of our social communities and of the human condition itself. The rewards of identifying with Austen's heroines are as accessible and satisfying to male as to female readers. Above all, Austens' novels are tributes to the power of language--to create plausible worlds, to capture the meanings of the heart, and to construct the rhetoric of the &quot;self.&quot; Where lesser writers require battles and orgies to get a rise out of readers, Austen can elicit profound emotions from the most stoic readers through the description of a raised eyebrow."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Being the literary classic that it is, you can purchase Pride &amp; Prejudice in a variety of shapes, sizes, and prices. No matter which one you chose it's still the perfect love story of Elizabeth Bennet (who every woman wants to be) and Mr. Darcy (easily the sexiest literary character of all time), witty and entertaining as well as significant in its portrayal of femininity and other issues of the period in which it was written. It may be just as good a story in the cheapest edition as in the most expensive, but shelling out a couple extra dollars may get you more for your money.If you're reading for a class or for independent study, you can't go wrong (for this book or any other) with the Norton Critical Edition. Includes not only the original text and info about the author, but critical articles studying the novel from several different perspectives. This edition could easily save you a trip to the library to find those secondary sources you'll need for your research paper.If you're just reading for pleasure or think the Norton Critical Edition is a little pricey, your best bet is Penguin Classics. It's a well-edited version that's appropriate for scholarly study, but it also offers those little extras that make pleasure reading all the more pleasurable: endnotes that will help you differentiate a post-chaise from a barouche and an well-written and interesting introduction that looks at both influences on Austen's writing and Pride and Prejudice as a classic romance (scholarly enough to get you thinking, but not so much that it's boring or difficult to understand). In my opinion the Penguin Classics edition is definitely the best bet for your money."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is a pandora's box of characters. Best friend, worst enemy, love of your life, and the one you love to hate, all found caught in a romantic tale that combines all the elements of human nature into a realistic struggle between true love and social status. The characters are phenominal. I don't think Jane Austen missed a single type of person, or disposition in her novel. As you learn of her characters and begin to relate to them you will run the emotional gamet. From anger to tears this book will take you into the perspective of multiple people. You will not only see through their eyes but feel what they feel. I don't think there is a single person who couldn't relate to someone in this book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"After reading BRIGID JONES: A DIARY and knowing it was a modern version/take on PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, I decided to read P&amp;P again. It is a beautifully written, carefully crafted story of an English family with five daughters, and they may be on the verge of losing their home and means of support. The main character Elizabeth is a very focused, honest, caring person. She says what needs to be said and does the things that need to be done. She is very observant of peoples personalities and what drives them, at least she believes she is until she meets Mr. Wickham and Mr. Darcy. That the daughters must marry due to their impending financial situation is never questioned, but who will the future husbands be? What makes Mr. Right, Mr. Right? How can one sister's Mr. Right be so wrong for everyone else but her? With all the social customs and duties is it possible that two people can actually find each other, fall in love and marry? There are characters you will love and characters you will love to hate. It is filled with humor,romance and drama, and enough twists and turns to create a wonderful and very enjoyable story."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is Jane Austen's best, except maybe Northanger Abbey. I wouldn't know, I haven't read it (yet). I couldn't like the characters in Emma, in Persuasion it was depressing, all that worrying it would have a sad end, in Mansfield Park, she was so meek(and no reason for him to fall in love), Sense and Sesibility was meatless, but P&amp;P sparkles. Likeable characters, romance, social commentary, everything."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I previously wrote when I was only Half-way through. I would like to update on what I read since then, now that I have finished the book. It is very well written, with a great plot. Plus, Jane Austen keeps you in suspense, but not TOO much suspense as many books are now. I hightly suggest that you read this book!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The two meet. They are completly wrong for each other, or so they think. Mr. Darcy has too much pride, he thinks he deserves the best of everything, including women. Elizabeth Bennet is prejudiced against him; she believes the gossip she hears about him. Who would ever think the two could ever get along, much less fall in love with each other! Meanwhile, Elizabeth's sisters try desperately to find the men of their dreams. I started reading this book a little timid. My mom told me that I just had to read it because it was a classic, but mainly because she read it and loved it when she was my age. So I had my doubts; my mom and I have different tastes in books, and I didn't trust her opinion much. I started reading it because I didn't have much time before I had to finish my book report. I found I loved the book more than I imagined I would. This story is romantic; it leads you in and out of the complicated minds of the Bennet family. Through the hearts of the many men the Bennet girls tend to take lightly. Then into the souls of two lovers destined to be together."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Although I am only half-way through this book, I am finding it very interesting. It IS a romance, this fact may turn people off, but (as far as I have gone anyway) there is much more to the story! So far, it is very enjoyable, and is teaching me a lot about that time period--what it was like for women in England then. I suggest you read it! Even if you feel that you are a little young. I am 15, I read a lot, and perhaps I'm not understanding everything, but it is enjoyable nontheless!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a story that graps you by the heart and does not ever let you go. If you have never read this book, YOU MUST!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is my favourite book of all time. Not only are the characters perfectly sculpted into lifelike images (both charming and deceitful), but the romance is original, heart warming and honest. Darcy is not only dashing, but mysterious and compelling. Elizabeth is simply charming and delightfully strong willed. The supporting characters are simply wonderful; the mother's sillyness to Wickham's deceitfullness, Miss Bingley's almost comical bitterness to the absurb notion that Darcy could ever marry Lady Catherine's pitiful daughter. It all comes together to make the most wonderful book of love, social commentary and humour. I read this in one weekend-I couldn't put it down. If you have never read a &quot;classic&quot; and love romance read this. It'll charm your socks off!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I cannot express in words how much I loved this novel! Austen's wry humor and perceptiveness shine through in all her characters. I know it sounds cheesy, but I still do get excited over whether Elizabeth and Darcy will ever see eye to eye. Elizabeth is one of the strongest and most admirable female characters in literature, the book is worth it just for her!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen is incredibly witty, which makes this book just a delight to read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's writing is superb without a doubt and can by no means get any better. This is a classic story of (stating the obvious) pride and prejudice. I was in agony over whether Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy were really going to get together and it's a story that cannot be told, but must be read to understand it thoroughly. I could read it a million times and I cannot stress it enough for you to buy this book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride And Prejudice, written by Jane Austen, is an amazing work on the nature of love. Austen uses beautiful language and intriguing characters to tell this story of courtship in a time when reputation was everything. The main character, Elizabeth Bennet, is a clever-witted woman who manages to gracefully glide through the lines set up by society. Although she does not always come off as lady-like, her charm and confidence demand the reader's respect. She is surrounded by a cast of diverse characters, creating a riveting plotline. Her mother is a rather quirky character who wants nothing more than to see her daughters wed. Her father, on the other hand, is a sarcastic and intelligent man who favors Elizabeth for her wit. These characters are brought together with the Bingley's when Elizabeth's older sister, Jane, falls for Mr. Bingley. Here, we are introduced to the stubborn and proud character of Mr. Darcy. He seems to be above everyone else and completely opposed to the idea of love.When Elizabeth Bennet catches Darcy's eye, however, a battle between the mind and the heart begins. These two chracters are faced with the obstacles set up by a strict, Victorian society. Their largest obstacle, however, will be to overcome their own pride and prejudice, and discover their love for one another. Is this a battle that the heart can win?"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Austen's novel Pride and Prejudice, is one of the most superb novels in English literature. This novel includes love, lies, and lively characters. Austen's style of writing is superb, her use of the English language is music with words. Austen is able to give the reader an all around view of each character, since it is written in third person omnipresent, but through the many letters, the reader is able to understand each character in a personal way.Austen's heroine, Elizabeth Bennett is an exception to the typical women of her era. Her lively wit and determination not to marry for money is a model for women of all time, these qualities allow her to transcend time. Elizabeth stands up for herself and in the end is rewarded for her steadfast constitution, by marrying the man she loves. Although this situation is not typical in everyday life, that same quality is what makes this novel loved by all. Pride and Prejudice feeds into the illusion of true and perfect love. The man comes to rescue of the woman he loves and in doing so saves her and her family. He goes against his family's and societies wishes to marry the woman he loves.The unique way Pride and Prejudice is written enhances the story. The reader is able to get an inside look into every character's personality. The reader is able to see the flippant way Lydia writes as she decides to run away with Mr. Wickham, how truly ridiculous Mr. Collins is, and how sincerely Mrs. Gardiner loves Elizabeth. Through the letters we learn about some of the most important event in the novel. Mr. Wickham's true character, Lydia's elopement, and even Darcy's involvement in fixing the scandal.It is every woman's dream to be Elizabeth Bennet. To marry the man she loves become rich and live happily ever after. This novel plays on everybody's want to find true love despite all the obstacles in life. I loved Pride and Prejudice because it transported me to another simpler more beautiful place, where love conquers all."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Being the first Jane Austen novel which I have ever read, I was very pleasantly surprised to find that Pride and Prejudice was nothing at all as I had expected. Full of wit and humor, as well as a romance both entirely innocent and mature (a virtue sadly lacking in much of this age's romances), Pride and Prejudice also conveys the polished skill with which Austen writes. I was most surprised to find that Austen, with her sophisticated style, was in her late teens/early twenties when she wrote this novel.I could easily go on about her style, vocabulary, and intricate sentences (I had a little trouble following her sometimes), but the main focus should always be given to the story itself. Insightful and often hilarious characterization gave texture to the story, as did the complex personalities of Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy. Mr. Bennet's off-hand remarks and Mary's deeply celebral, pompous observations on morality brightened up the scenery considerably. Jane Austen exercises expert storytelling to catch (and keep) interest until the very realistic, very satisfying, conclusion.Pride and Prejudice has earned its way onto my \\"feel-good\\" list of books, and I'm sure I'll be re-reading it for many years to come. Don't be discouraged by its old-fashioned front. Pride and Prejudice is one story that no one should be deprived of.Oh, and if you haven't seen the movie, go see it!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a great classic and should be read by anyone who enjoys Victorian Romance. The beautiful, intelligent, head strong Elizabeth Bennet has finally met her match in the arrogant, proud Mr. Darcy. Their tumultuous romance is extremely humorous and delightful to read.Although Jane Austen was a talented novelist, she was harshly criticized during her day for writing about marriage and the social life of well-bred, 19th century British women as opposed to more serious topics such as the French and American revolutionary wars. I however, believe that Ms. Austen was ahead of her time, exploring the world of gender politics with every witty heroine she created.Pride and Prejudice is a timeless tale that is just as enjoyable today as it was centuries ago. In fact, You may notice that this story is very influential in modern films and books, most recently in Bridget Jones's Diary. I recommend it highly!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"OK, maybe the title was a little much, but from what i have read...it is. Elizabeth Bennet is a young, satirical, young woman who is prejudiced against Mr. Darcy, a charming yet snobby man. The two argue throughout the entire book but when she realizes her misperception of him, they finally begin to love one another. This is perhaps one of the best parts of the novel, in my opinion.The characters are amazingly sketched out and Mrs. Bennt takes the cake! I had a lot of fun reading her comments as well as the sisters.Even though I am only thirteen, I believe that I fully grasped the novel. The words are a bit confusing, so keep a dictionary on you at all times.Jane Austen is one of my favorites, if not my most favorite, and I want everyone to read at least one of her novels!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"If you enjoy British 19th century literature, you are sure to like this book. I read it for a book group selection, and am so glad I was able to get a copy of it. The dialogue is so wonderfully witty, and full of meanings that are not immediately discernable to American readers that are less familiar with this more formal manner of speaking, as I was. I still enjoyed it, as the story is a romantic comedy that I feel has a little something for anyone that enjoys a good romance. It is definitely more subtle than the kinds of things one reads these days, but that seems to be a good thing. The BBC televised version with Colin Firth is also very good."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It's been awhile since I've read any literature involving flowery language and staunch manners but I'm so glad I came back to it!!! Pride and Prejudice is extremely well-written and the characterization is fabulous. Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy create delicious sparks with their constant head-butting and romantic tension. Elizabeth can probably best be described as someone who embodies the best manners, heart, and intentions without being sappy or spineless; she is incredibly intelligent and strong-willed. It's interesting to read this book and think of how women of the time had to play the love &quot;game&quot; and marry above their station to progress in society. It also sheds light on Jane Austen's own independent state of mind that her most darling character was a total fireball! This book will give you constant butterflies and provides a nice glimpse into the comedy and pettiness of the society of the time, all the while, weaving a charming tale not soon to be forgotten."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"i loved this book the moment i started reading it. each and every event in it beacame my very own; Jane austen definitely knows how to weave her stories into the hearts of the readers. elizabeth bennet, the heroine, is a vivacious spirited young woman who speaks from her mind and learns from her heart. mr. darcy is uniquely unfolded as a man of principles and convictions. he starts to make you think of what you truly stand for. this is a story full of warmth, tenderness and love from the heart. you'll enjoy every moment of this scintillating experience."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Well, I first readthis book last week and I think it's amazing. I saw the video of it last year and I think it is possibly one of the best dramatisations ever. I loved Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth in P&amp;P and this week I am hoping to buy Bridget Jones's Diary (being released here in England on Saturday). I find this book has a romanticism about it and when you read the book, you feel a longing to be back in the period where men where gallant and women were graceful. The sexual chemistry between Elizabeth and Mr Darcy was wonderful; you felt as if you were actually there.If you've already read it, read it again and if you've never read it... well, you've never lived!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is my favorite Jane Austen novel and I have read it many times. The main flaw in this reading is that it was too hurried. There was barely a pause between chapters and the quick speech did not do justice to all of the characters. I found the reader's voice to be as little high pitched and a little mannered, even for Austen. Flaws aside, I still got enjoyment from this reading. The speed became less distracting as I became used to it and there were some fine readings of exchanges between Elizabeth and Darcy. Bottom line: not up to the standard that Pride and Prejudice deserves."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I won't presume to review Austen, so this review covers the quality of the Penguin release. Many of us have discovered that the \\"free\\" ebooks on Gutenburg and other sites frequently have such poor formatting that they are irritating to read. One can either re-edit the book to fix the problems, or just live with them and have an inferior and annoying reading experience.Penguin's P&P; is the closest ebook equivalent to the joy of reading a quality physical book--the text is perfectly formatted for the Kindle, it's been proofed, and the supplemental material is almost overwhelming. Detailed intros, useful hyperlinking and a wealth of information on Austen's times, including fashion, furniture, and food and drink, are included. It's truly an immersive experience.I believe this book will be seen as a turning point for ebooks: the point at which editorial and publishing quality became a significant purchase criterion. Early ebook adopters (myself included) were willing to spend hours cleaning up Gutenburg editions and formatting them for the device du jour. No longer. The ebook is moving past the early adopter stage and is making inroads into a market that expects quality editing, publishing, and supplemental materials. I'll definitely pay a reasonable amount for an ebook that I can just start reading, instead of tinkering with, and that provides a comfortable feeling of having gotten one's money's worth.Penguin has set the bar for ebook quality with this release. I urge anyone with a Kindle to get a copy--*this* is the ebook experience we've been wanting."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This particular book is delightfully illustrated. I have three P&P books and this is the most treasured of all. Not only the novel itself is wonderful to read, but also the illustrations are beautiful to look at. It is a perfect gift for someone who owns a paperback version of P&P. A book is more than just a story. You will agree when you open this book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I first watched the movie, never took any eager interest in british literature or period movies before. This movie just inspired me and I just had to buy Pride and Prejudice in this cover because I fell in love with Matthew Macfadyen as Mr.Darcy and Keira Knightley as Miss Elizabeth Bennett. The book like any other publisher of Pride and Prejudice, they have the same contents although this book have some explanations at the back for words like \\"chaise and four\\" and etc. for people that never read books like this before. I love it so much so now I'm hunting for all Jane Austens' books and movies!!!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Okay, I admit it: I read Pride and Prejudice in high school and didn't like it. However, age and the wisdom that comes with it helped me to realize that my dislike of the book probably had more to do with my dislike of my then-teacher, who had the ability to make even the greatest literary masterpiece seem dry and dull. In recent years, I've read most of Jane Austen's other novels and have enjoyed them immensely, and so I have finally worked my way back to Pride and Prejudice.The story is familiar to most: it centers around the five young Bennett sisters, who range in age from their mid-teens to early twenties, making them quite ripe for marriage (at least according to their mother). And then there are the men, for as the novel's opening line notes: \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\\" Such a man, Mr. Bingley, buys a house close to the Bennett family, and initially, he seems fated to marry the oldest, loveliest Bennett girl, Jane. Bingley is accompanied by his haughty friend, Mr. Darcy, who, while possessing an even greater fortune, quickly earns the dislike of all those he meets, particularly Elizabeth, the strong-minded second Bennett daughter. And from the pride held by each of the four principle characters described above (but namely Darcy and Elizabeth), Austen derives her prejudice.In many ways, Pride and Prejudice reads like a modern-day romantic comedy, complete with misunderstandings and mishaps. Similarly, the embarrassment which Jane and Elizabeth suffer at the hands of their mother and younger sisters would make them perfect candidates for today's reality TV. But of course, Austen's writing contains a level of wit and subtlety rarely found in any contemporary form of entertainment, making this novel is a true classic-a rare gem that still shines brightly to this day."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is undoubtedly one of the most beloved classic novels in history -- it's had countless adaptations, sequels and homages lavished on it over the years.And Jane Austen's grand opus is still beloved for a good reason. While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of a halfway decent marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...Reading \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Lizzie and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Jane Austen about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).The only real problem: Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.But despite that formality, Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other. She also wrote some unbelievably sharp-edged dialogue with plenty of witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But Austen also weaves in startlingly romantic moments between them (\\"No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting\\").It's hard to imagine a better fictional couple than Lizzie and Darcy, despite their rocky start (a major-league snub at a dance). Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways, with quick minds and even quicker tongues. Darcy is a selfish, rather haughty man man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.It also has a solid supporting cast: the painfully practical Charlotte Lucas, slimy clerics, virtuous-looking rakes, sisters ranging from saintly to snobby, and the lovable Mr. Bingley and perpetually optimistic Jane. Lizzie's family also adds plenty of color to the story, including the screechy and hilariously mercurial Mrs. Bennett and the barb-tongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love. An absolute must-read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I had to read \\"Emma\\" for my high school sophomore English class and was pretty much the only one who enjoyed it at all. Recently, free this summer from required reading, I decided to try \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". The first few chapters are slow and a bit dry, but the action soon picks up pace (as action and Austen go). Austen's characters are brilliantly drawn and her observations in situations are astute. The reader has the advantage of being the most nearly omniscient observer and knows throughout the book what the ending will be but still agonizes over the process of it happening. Some readers like me may be slightly annoyed that (like \\"Emma\\") the happiness of the characters hinges on love and marriage and nothing else, but in the end you'll be so swept up in the story that nothing else matters but the happy ending."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Wow! What else do you say after you read such an incredible book? Jane Austen's timeless characters like Elizabeth Bennett, Mr. Darcy, Miss Bingley(oh, don't you just love to hate her), Jane, etc. all add to this intricately woven plot. Elizabeth Bennett is arguably one of the most complex characters ever written (well, Lucy Snowe of Villette wins the prize). This novel is an excellent example of Austen's literary power. Her heroines are to be admired for they all dared to marry for love and not for social status which so often happened to women in their predicament back then. You will laugh, you will cry, you will be angry, and above all, you will fall in love with Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. However, don't stop after Pride and Prejudice; read Sense and Sensibility, read Emma, read them all. (It won't take long; she only wrote six- I was disappointed that there weren't more) Jane Austen's work is incredible; the only fault I find is that she has so many characters, it is difficult to keep up with them all. Pride and Prejudice has to be read at least twice to catch everything and everybody. But it won't be a chore to read it again, more like opening a treasure chest."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"No need to review the book itself. What I want to address are the hyper linked notes and footnotes.One of the big criticisms of other books on the Kindle is that it was very hard to access notes and footnotes. It was so much trouble, that most people did not even bother.Penguin has figured it out! They have hyperlinked the notes and the footnotes, so that you can get right to them with your Kindle scroll wheel, and not lose your place in the book.More publishers need to do the same!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I feel sorry for the young person who thought this book was boring. What a shame that you can't relax and stop thinking about yourself long enough to take the time to revel in one of the greatest works in English literature.The plot is timeless, and I can guarantee that many of the characters will resemble people you know. Yes, the dialogue may be difficult to follow at first but, after a while, &quot;listening&quot; to it becomes almost second nature.I first read this book when I was 11 or 12, and have read it at least 10 or 15 times since, including at least twice for school. In fact, I chose to read it again just so I could write a paper on it.Buy this book, sit down and lose yourself in Jane Austen's world. Then try Persuasion, Emma or Sense &amp; Sensibility (I'm afraid I can't recommend Mansfield Park very highly). If you have any trace of imagination, you will be hooked.Please, do yourselves a favor and read the book before seeing any of the adaptations. Each has its advantages, but the recent BBC/A&amp;E version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle is a sight to behold. The Garvie/Rintoul version is also good, but not quite as beautiful to watch. It pains me to say this, but the Greer Garson/Laurence Olivier version is far and away the weakest."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is an excellent book, a true piece of classic literature.

The story is set in rural England of early 19th century and is centered around Elizabeth, second daughter of the Bennets, and her evolving relationship with 'proud' Mr Darcy. The author has done an excellent job keeping the pace of the story, while painting excellent character portraits.--A minor note:Some people observe that the name of the county where the military regiment is settled appears as \\"----shire\\" throughout the book. Strange as that may seem, it is not a typographical error; it is actually how it appears in the original (you can check the free online editions of the novel on Project Gutenberg or Google Books). According to an annotated version by David M. Shapard, that was done in purpose by the author to avoid naming a particular county, although the reason is not known for certain."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"outstanding prodcut free...can't beat that can you?? haven't finished to book but so far it's outstandinghope you enjoy it as much as i am.....what's up??"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I absolutely love this book!I rate this book as follows:Love interest: 5Subcharacters: 5Writing: 5Romantic Plot: 5Overall: 5"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"~3.5/5[Also available on my blog.]I think I'm going to try and keep this review short, just for the fact that I don't have as high, or much, of an opinion as most people do. But I might have more to say than I think.This is my first Jane Austen book, and, while I'd wanted to read it for a while, the main reason I finally got around to it, was because of The Lizzie Bennet Diaries. Which, if you aren't watching those, whether you've read the book or not, you should. It's... simply amazing. I love it.But I'm talking about the book, so let me get back to that.When I started the book, I was afraid it was going to be long and droning and boring, given the time period it was written, and it kind of was, in parts. There were a lot of dry parts in this book, a lot of slow points, and the language was rather boring at some points. There were long sentences, huge paragraphs, not nearly as much dialogue, and sometimes it was a bit hard for me to follow. There were, though, some scenes, some chapters or plots, that I really enjoyed, and those went by really fast, whereas other ones took way too long to get through.My main annoyance with the writing was how tell and not show it was. There were countless times that the reader would be told about something that had happened, some scene we didn't get to see, and sometimes even some kind of characteristic that a character had. And the one reason I'm even a little okay with those things is that, with the characters, it was made apparent in their attitude that what we were told was true, and with the scenes, if we were shown them, the book would have been longer, and I probably wouldn't have enjoyed that. It still annoyed me, though; is probably the thing I least liked about this book.Next, the characters. I liked Elizabeth enough, I suppose, but didn't really care too much about her either way. The same with most of the characters, actually. I liked Mr. Bennet. I liked the romantic relationships. I wasn't too big a fan of Bingley, most of the time, because he just seemed too prideful and full of himself (which I will talk about again in a minute). I didn't think I got to know Lydia very well. Jane seemed alright. I didn't like Caroline, because she was... not a nice person.I liked Darcy at first, but then later on was kind of iffy about him. I knew what was going to happen with him and Lizzy, but somewhere in the middle, his attitude bothered me. I think it just seemed like too big a jump, from him being standoffish to really nice to her. But, thinking back on it, it wasn't too bad, actually. I did like their relationship, so there's that.Now, the pride thing. After reading the book, I understand what the title means, and I'm kind of okay with it. I don't mind the prejudiced thing. But the pride part just annoyed me so much. All of the characters were prideful about one thing or another. Bingley was rather full of himself. As was Darcy. And I just... I guess I feel like some development should have been done there, instead of it just continuing to be that way. They aren't the only characters that were prideful, a lot of them were, but they just made the biggest impression on me.I think that's all I have to say, really. The book wasn't horrible, even if it was droning and boring at times, and had way too much telling. The rating is really so high because of the story line. The plot was good, what with what happened with Lydia, and Jane's change in attitude halfway through, and the ending, and even how some of the characters acted. There were some parts that I really enjoyed.I don't plan on reading any of Austen's other books, though. I do plan on watching some of the Pride and Prejudice movies, and am at the moment watching the miniseries, but that might take a while. They're just so long, and kind of boring to me. I know that most people love this book, though, so don't take my word on it all.I would suggest watching the web series The Lizzie Bennet Diaries, though, because it is amazing, and I honestly think it's better than the book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Loved this book, I have lost count of how many times I've read this book.

Just great writing as a whole like always with Austen."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Sometimes you have no choice but to flow with the story, because it won't let you go. I love reading a book into which I can get so deep, I forget my internal editor exists. I forget anyone who might be in the room with me, I ignore the ring of the phone.When this happens, I don't even realize until I've finished the book how blessed I've been to have become part of that excellent story, to live within the characters, feel their heartbreak, their joy, smell the proverbial roses around them. These stories are rare, but Pride and Prejudice is one of them. I'm sure I've read it dozens of times, and I hope to read it dozens more."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The story of Pride and Prejudice is beautifully narrated by Kate Redding.

On the inside cover it suggested not to miss \`Pride and Prejudice' and \`Romeo & Juilet'. So of course, I bought them as well!When I first started reading the book, being that it was written in 1813 and the language being slightly different then, I found the book a little hard to get into. Although, once I got to know the characters and the story began to unfold, I found myself unable to put the book down (literally). The romance, as well as the relationship, between Elizabeth Bennet & Mr. Darcy was highly intriguing and only added to the chemistry that makes this love story truly amazing! Now, I don't want to give away any of the juiciness that lies within the book so I won't say anymore. You'll really just have to read the book!NOTE: While browsing around, it appears that other authors have written books continuing the \`Pride and Prejudice' story regarding the lives and love of Mr. Darcy & Elizabeth Bennet. So that might be worth looking into for those who've already read and fell in love with, \`Pride and Prejudice'!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is a great novel and the public domain Kindle edition is flawlessly presented with no random symbols, mispellings, omitted words, or anything else.Just to make it clear, Public Domain books is the name of the publisher of this edition. This novel can be enjoyed by anyone, as long as they are not male sexists. Women can write great literature too. This has all right to be called an alltime classic."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is undoubtedly one of the most beloved classic novels in history -- it's had countless adaptations, sequels and homages lavished on it over the years.And Jane Austen's grand opus is still beloved for a good reason. While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of a halfway decent marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...Reading \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Lizzie and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Jane Austen about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).The only real problem: Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.But despite that formality, Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other. She also wrote some unbelievably sharp-edged dialogue with plenty of witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But Austen also weaves in startlingly romantic moments between them (\\"No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting\\").It's hard to imagine a better fictional couple than Lizzie and Darcy, despite their rocky start (a major-league snub at a dance). Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways, with quick minds and even quicker tongues. Darcy is a selfish, rather haughty man man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.It also has a solid supporting cast: the painfully practical Charlotte Lucas, slimy clerics, virtuous-looking rakes, sisters ranging from saintly to snobby, and the lovable Mr. Bingley and perpetually optimistic Jane. Lizzie's family also adds plenty of color to the story, including the screechy and hilariously mercurial Mrs. Bennett and the barb-tongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love. An absolute must-read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"i finnaly decided to read this classic because i have heard so much about it.

This book was an easy read because of how well it was written and how much the story grabs on to you. Ever since reading this book I have gone on to read all of Jane Austen's book and found that they were equally as good."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is an excellent novel that explores how love fits into a society consumed by an obsession with marriage. As expected from a nineteenth century British novel highlighting upper society, Jane Austen's writing uses a proper and sophisticated syntax. Working with the dignified tone, the syntax often coats the characters' bluntness and turns them into seemingly kinder remarks. These situations tend to be the most humorous, because the readers and the characters all know what is being said beneath all the comments. These dialogues also add important dimension to all of the characters. For example, Elizabeth is very witty and can uphold amusing and complex conversations with Mr. Darcy, but afterward her reflections show that she has insecurities despite her verbal strength. Without the depth of Elizabeth's character as well as the depth of the other characters, the novel would seem much longer and more dragged out than it can be at times. If the readers have the patience to get through some of the slower parts and can focus on the brilliant interactions between the characters, then they will be incredibly satisfied at the end of the beautiful novel."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I first read this book this past school year (11th grade), with a teacher who is an active JANSA Member (The Jane Austen Society of North America). The one thing I will always remember from him, was that in this book the characters are so real that you can see them in your everyday life. Along with my teacher we took a trip down to memory lane and saw all of Jane's characters in his High School (he wrote this as an essay he read at a JANSA congregation). And of course he ended by finding his Elizabeth, who's name is actually Jane (ironic isn't it?).I TRULY recommend this book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Meet the Bennet sisters: demure Jane, witty Elizabeth, bookish Mary, impressionable Kitty, and lusty Lydia. It's the usual story: they don't have much in the way of dowries but need to marry upstanding English gentlemen...Elizabeth Bennet quickly emerges as the heroine with her wry sense of humor and take-no-prisoners attitude to social life. She puts all twentieth century heroines to shame when she tells off Mr. Darcy (while maintaining perfect decorum). Unusual twists and turns spark up the &quot;marriage plot&quot; of the book. There are some great villains, too."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Let this serve as a warning that at least one of the reviews below details most of the plot developments of this most endearing of English novels. In the unlikely event that you haven't already read Pride and Prejudice, and you like to have some surprises the first time you read a novel, you explore farther at your own peril."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I had to read this for school and at first it was really hard to get into it. After awhile, though, it seemed to get better. Some of the words were really hard to understand and I needed a dictionary by me. It is actually a really good book. I was suprised because a lot of people said it was boring. It was boring at first, but if you stick to it and make yourself read it it will get better. I recommend this book to people who like to read romance. The characters are very well developed and the theme of the story is good."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"With pride and Prejudice Austen has at last created a heroine that does not go to pieces at the first sight of an eligible young man. elizabeth Bennett's mind rules her heart not the other way around. thus Mr. Darcy who is attracted to her must first prove his love and loyalty before Elizabeth will consider him. this novel is one of austne's finest and I found myself captured by the story. In those days marriage was essential to a woman's happiness and thus she strove to do all in her power to find a suitable match. it is a task that frankly has not totally died even today despite all the social change that has taken place since this book was written. One has to wonder what Austen would think if she was alive today. the main message of this novel is not to rush to judgement in regards to others. A notion wich still holds great importance. Though at times a little too lighthearted this book nevertheless is an enjoyable read or in my case a listen. Naxos did a great job in making Austen's novel come alive. the narrator read the text with the right amount of tone and intonation and the classical music breaks between scenes was a nice touch. When it comes to audio classics noe one does it better then Naxos. I will have to buy more of Austne's work done by them.this audiobook contains 3 CD's and is abridged; yet i do not think i have missed anything in regards to the overall story. I found listneing to the book very pleasing and will be a fine addition to my audio library."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is only the second Jane Austen book that I have read, but certainly not the last! Though the numerous characters and complex sentences provide the reader with a challenge and requires some concentration, the end result is definitely rewarding. Complicated characters and complicated relationships leave the reader constantly on their toes, and you never know what to expect next. What's so wonderful about this book is that the characters are so real. There are so many memorable characters in this story about Mrs. Bennet attempting to marry off her five daughters, and these characters aren't perfect, merely human, making them easy to relate to as well as laugh at. In reading this book, you see yourself in the same tough situations and awkward moments as them and realize that we sometimes forget that we don&iexcl;t have to be flawless. Everyone is proud and prejudiced at sometime or another; we aren't perfect, and it's okay!Though perhaps an easier read than Emma, Pride and Prejudice is similar in that it is also full of the same brilliant dialogue and subtle humor. This book is great for anyone who is interested in a romantic comedy that will that twirl you around with its genius and surprises."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It seems like a simple statement. Mr. Darcy, the hero of our novel, simply doesn't have time to write to his overbearing aunt to inform her of his engagement to be married. But, like most things in Jane Austen, it has more meanings than one.I will be the first to admit that the plot of the novel is transperent. Anyone who has read a romance can see from the outset that Darcy and Lizzy (a.k.a. Elizabeth Bennet) will end up with each other. The only question is how, why, when, and who will be affected. To find that out, you'll have to read the story. I don't believe I'm giving anything away by saying that the seemingly sub-human Fitzwilliam Darcy (he's got quite a name, has he not?) will thaw eventually, and that Lizzy will warm to his new, altered state. For, simply put, the point of the novel is not the story, but the beautiful prose and dialogue. The deliciously satisfying banter of the newly-engaged Darcy and Lizzy in Chapter 18 of Part Three (some versions are not divided into parts, but I trust you can find this chapter) leaves you tingling with glorious anticipation of their soon to be union.The reader will thrill when he calls her &quot;Elizabeth&quot; for the first time (as opposed to a cold &quot;Miss Bennet&quot;), and the effect is somewhat heightened by his adding a passtionate &quot;dearest, lovliest&quot; before the name. For Darcy, despite his reserves, is a deeply passionate man.Back to my original point. There is something deeper in Jane Austen's seemingly silly and pointless escapades. The novel is an examination of human foibles (sp?) and follies, a critical probing of the pitfalls of society. Austen's points are timeless, for some things never change. In any case, when Darcy says, in response to Lizzy's inquiry as to when he will find the courage to write to his aunt, the despised Lady Catherine DeBourgh, who greatly opposes his marriage to Lizzy, that he is more likely to want time than courage, it means more than it seems to. He is saying, subtly perhaps, but he's saying it all the same: he treasures his time with Lizzy, and he hates to darken it with a cloud of impending doom. Besides which, he loves to talk to his fiance, and wile away hours wandering the country lanes in a state of happiness beyond that which he has ever known. Why waste the precious minutes writing to that stupid Lady Catherine, anyway?As you can see, a philosopher like myself can find reams of meaning in a simple sentance of Austen. If that isn't reason enough to read her novel &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, I don't know what is.--Child of the Burning Heart"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The most striking feature of my experience with &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is the sense of overwhelming changes in society in the last 200 years. What was considered boorish and vulgar in 1800 would be considered conservative behavior today. The characters in Austen's work display such subtely of thought and self-restraint that it's hard to believe that humans once acted in such a way...."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I believe that this is an appropriate book for any age group. I recommend this book to whoever is interested in reading it. There is no violence, or any misconduct. The only thing mainly talked about was of love and the social class differences in the 19th century. One literary device that I appreciated is called allegory. Allegory is a story in which the characters, settings, and events stand for abstract and moral concepts. An example of this is the distinction people made in social classes. We can see this clearly in the way Mrs. Bennet desperately wanted her daugters to marry rich men, but Elizabeth wanted to marry for love. This moral concept shows readers that money, even though it has a great effect on many people, does not buy true love. I believe it has been one of the best books I have read so far. It was a beautiful, yet confusing love story. My favorite chapter was Chapter 18 from Volume 3. In this chapter Elizabeth and Darcy resolve the unanswered question of their relationship. Darcy had come with Bingley to Longbourn to see if he could make Elizabeth love him, and he knew from Lady De Bourgh's lecture to him about Elizabeth's evilness, that Elizabeth must have cared for him. Elizabeth insists that he only came to love her because she did not try to please him. She tells him &quot;You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking, and thinking for your approbation alone. I roused, and interested you, because I was so unlike them.&quot; She is still embarrassed by the way that she misjudged him from the beginning. He is just as embarrased of his first proposal to her and his behavior toward her until that proposal. Since both Jane and Elizabeth have been proposed to, the entire neighborhood hears of the engagements, and both Elizabeth and Jane recieve congratulations. This is my favorite chapter because this is where all the conflicts are resolved, and thus begins a happy ending."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"In pride and Prejudice my favorite chapter was seven because I thought it was hilarious how Mrs. Bennet wanted to send Jane to Mr. Bingley's house in order for her to get closer to him, even though it was raining and she had to go alone on the horse. I thought that was really hilarious because it determined that Mrs. Bennet just wanted her daughters to marry her no matter what.I think this book is appropriate for teenagers like me who could understand the meaning of the book, and in some situations be connected with the characters. It relates to me because just like Elizabeth didn't marry because of the money, I know that when I marry, I'm going to marry for true love not because of the wealth the man I marry has.A literary device that I appreciate was that Jane Austen used imagery. She helped her readers feel as if we were with the characters. For example when Jane was sick, Elizabeth went to visit her on foot trails and she arrived with soaked and dirty stockings to the house.I like this novel because it made me realize that you should not judge a person with out knowing them. I recommended this book to anyone who enjoys reading love and realistic characters."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I thought that this book was a great book. I liked the characters and also the plot. My favorite chapter was chapter ten of volume three. This chapter is about Mrs. Gardiner writing to Elizabeth and telling her about what Mr. Darcy did for his sister. This letter showed Elizabeth Darcy's true character and how much he really cared for her. I think that because of the letter Elizabeth was able to confirm the feelings she had towards Mr. Darcy.This book is appropriate for teenagers and up because Pride and Prejudice has characters with these ages. Elizabeth, Jane and also the Darcy's and the Bingley's were around their twenties. Elizabeth younger sisters were teenagers. The other characters were around their thirties, forty's, fifty's and maybe sixties. Their actions and some of the events that happened with them can be related to some of the things that sometimes happen to us.A literary device that it is used in the story is allegory. Allegory is a story in which the characters, settings and events stand for abstract or moral concepts. Allegorical references are made towards the moral issue of marriage when the Bennett family is disgraced because Lydia has run away with Wickham without the benefit of marriage.I really liked this book because I was able to picture in my mind everything that was going on in the story. Jane Austen is able to bring images and pictures to my mind because she was descriptive, and she also used long dialogues for the characters. I liked the romances and misunderstandings about the main characters because it made the story interesting and it made me wonder what was going to happen in the next chapter. I enjoyed reading the story and also learned about some problems which women confronted in the 19th century such as entailment, which was the main conflict of the story."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is by far one of the best books that I have read in high school. The meaning of the title, Pride and Prejudice, is present throughout the novel. The main characters portray the meaning of the title. It was a must that they, Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, marry, but their pride and prejudice were keeping these two characters apart temporarily. Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy are so different, yet so similar. Pride is one of the main barriers that creates an obstacle to Elizabeth and Darcy's marriage. Darcy's pride in his position in society keeps him from interacting with anyone outside his society, which includes Elizabeth. Elizabeth's initial prejudice against Darcy is rooted in pride of her own judgment of people. She was very proud in her ability to judge people by their first impression. But these characters were able to overcome their flaws and realize they were destined for each other.My favorite chapters are chapter 12 and 13 in volume II. I like these chapters because this is where Darcy reveals the truth to Elizabeth and Elizabeth begins to analyze Darcy's actions. Darcy explains the reasons why he prevented Bingley from marrying Jane and the reason why Darcy and Wickham dislike each other. Thereafter, Elizabeth realized the she judged Darcy completely wrong and that her vanity has been the cause of her prejudice. This is the chapter where both Elizabeth and Darcy realize their faults and it is also the turning point in the novel.This novel would be appropriate for people 15 years and older. It does not have a complex plot, and the reader is able to evaluate each character after carefully reviewing their role in Pride and Prejudice.One literary device that I appreciated was the way Jane Austen revealed the personality of each character. Jane Austen revealed the characters through letters, and revealing the character's effect on others. I liked the way Jane Austen used indirect characterization, which forced the reader to use his/her own judgment, thus putting clues together to figure out the personality of each character.I enjoyed this novel and I recommend it to others. Throughout this novel one is able to see the flaws of people regardless of social standings. People from all social levels are alike-they are all PROUD. Therefore, one is able to conclude that human happiness is found by living a life in accordance with human dignity, which is a life in accordance with virtue. Human dignity and virtues go hand in hand, happiness is found in human dignity which is found in virtue, and together anybody could over come it, like Darcy and Elizabeth did."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is by far one of the best books that I have read in high school.

The emotion and attachment set to the characters of such novels is fully upheld and boundaries of literature appreciation are exceeded with the reading of Pride and Prejudice. The essence of a classic novel that can stand the tests of time is displayed in this masterpiece of Jane Austen. Wit and one liners by the ever enjoyable Mr. Bennet reminds you of your favorite uncle, while the observant eye of Elizabeth Bennet reminds you of friend you always wished to have as she takes a stand on the dullness of humdrum society, constantly giving something to ponder and test the limits. This satire on nineteenth century Europe has a wonderful approach, allowing some periods of a curved brow that silently screams in agreement with our heroine, Elizabeth, all occuring between a chuckle of amusement that is often choked by a surprise twist of the storyline of the other well illustrated characters. This novel is recommended for the modern day romantics who would appreciate a played story of hard-to-get; for the everlastining realist who loves the power felt when a opinion and lifestlye is presented against the grain of normality; and finally, for the everyday classical reader who can ever remember a time where self-pride has made a place, only to be broken by the realization that prejudice is only what sets people apart. A classic situaion in our heterogeneous society where everyone carries a pride-filled opinion of our surroundings, forgetting that individually we make up the prejudiced society. Gradual and humble realization is to follow, as in the likewise case of Miss Bennet, while the timeless saga and appreciation of Pride and Prejudice continues..."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"While I had many high expectations for this novel, they were all far exceeded when I actually picked up the book and read it -- and then could not put it down. Jane Austen's wit and charm constantly present throughout this story make it quite possible to laugh out loud. At a time when marriages were to go not beyond political correctness and money, Austen writes about the Bennett family, whose 5 daughters are all meant to find these advantageous lifestyles. While Mrs. Bennett is on a hurried and frantic quest to marry off each of her daughters, the two eldest, Elizabeth and Jane, are each on a journey of finding their true loves, whether they first realize that at meeting them or not. The plot line keeps entertainment and holds captive attention, and the twists and turns of this novel keep the reader coming back for more. It has my highest recommendation -- so go out and read it today!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have to say that Pride and Prejudice is one of the best books I have ever read...and I have read a LOT! I think the first time I picked it up was back in 6th grade. I loved it then, but how much does a sixth grader really get out of it? Reading it again for my English class opened my eyes to some of the more subtle humor and details Austen includes in her witty satire of Regency England's society and customs, particularly those dealing with marriage. Perhaps one of the reasons I liked this novel so much was-it wasn't a \\"fluff\\" romance. I admit, I love romances, but this one surpasses them all, simply because it has sustenance. It has a fully-developed plot, well-thought-out characters, etc. It is thought-provoking and at the same time, a fun read.The heroine of the novel, Elizabeth Bennet, is intelligent, witty, and-of course-prejudiced. Mr. Darcy, the proud hero, epitomizes the saying, \\"Appearances can be deceiving.\\" Lizzie's journey to true love is fraught with obstacles-some of her own making and some due to her matchmaking mama; her indulgent, sarcastic, and perhaps at times insensitive father; her love-lorn older sister; and two boy-crazy younger sisters."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The reason I liked this book so much was the main character, Elizabeth Bennet. Her honesty and spunk are a wonderful combination. In a time where frankness was discouraged, hers grew. I also admire how she matures through the course of the novel. Her 'pride and prejudice' are put in their proper place. Her and her father also contribute much humor to the story. Their sarcastic wit made me laugh. Generally, I enjoyed Austen's sense of humor: there were many funny moments. I also found the story's end heartwarming... perhaps I am just a sap, but you should read it and find out!!! I think this would be one of my favorite books so far; I definately want to read more Jane Austen in the coming months!!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have never read another book that kept my attention as constantly as Pride and Prejudice. The novel involves such a vast array of diverse characters all involved in the search for love, whether willingly or unwillingly. Mrs. Bennet's incessant stress of finding a husband for her five daughters is quite a difficult feat. Not only does she want them to have a man for the rest of their lives, but he must be one with much opulence. The need for an attraction between the couple is quite peripheral in the eyes of Mrs. Bennet. However, Elizabeth Bennet, the second-oldest daughter, would rather renounce the popular tradition of marrying solely for wealth. She searches for true love and happiness, and wealth is an added bonus. A very unexpected set of circumstances causes Elizabeth to question Mr. Darcy's love. As their lives continue, Elizabeth reconsiders her initial judgements of Mr. Darcy and other characters. Jane Austen's satirical and ironic comments and situations give the reader great insight into the customs of the early nineteenth century. Austen presents a very tangled web of people and events. The transformation and reactions of the characters from beginning to end is very drastic and presents very sagacious lessons about life. This is a timeless classic that can be enjoyed at anytime. I cannot wait to read it a second time!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"If I were reviewing Pride and Prejudice alone, I would give this novel six stars. It is rightfully listed on every top 100 literature list. I am currently reading it for the sixth time and still finding wonderful new things in the story. For those who have only seen the movie versions, you are in for a treat... no movie can do this story justice.My complaint is that the Kindle version I purchased was advertised as illustrated, but there are very few illustrations and the quality is poor, and there is no way to zoom in to see the illustrations better (as you can do with text on the Kindle). This is a past-copyright book and it is available free from the Gutenberg Project, and used to be free on Kindle. I paid 99 cents to get the illustrated version, and it really wasn't worth it. Seriously."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I love this book and re-read it nearly every year. I just downloaded the free version to read on my new kindle. There are 4 paragraphs missing in chapter 1, at least one word in chapter 2... And that's as far as I have gotten. So the item loses a star for being incomplete"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book speaks to every romantic. It's written beautifully in the classic language that every man and woman speaks while in the throes of the mating game. I read this book at least yearly to remind myself of not only the gloriously beautiful fluent English language and wit of Miss Bennett, but the always refreshing humility, which this book's title fails to mention. It is truly a beautiful piece of romantic literature. The sensual / sexual tension between Miss Bennett and Mr. Darcy is something I never tire of."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Great text but the reader struggles with male voices. They sound \\"fake\\" and interfere with listening"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"this is a great book for anyone who has never been in love. it emphasizes the fact that first impressions are not always the correct ones or the best ones. you need to get to know someone before forming an opinion. plus jane austen is amusing and witty and insightful."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This Jane Austen novel is fantastic. The characters are very real and the period well represented. It is also funny. I could not put it down once I started and at the end, I just went back and re-read it!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I am reading this book all over again for the, hmm, I really have lost count - let's just say the umpteenth time. Reading it was supposed to be a \\"filler\\" until the time I could lay my hands on an as yet unread book. Needless to say, though I have other books in line now, I am completely drawn in and am not willing to give up reading Pride and Prejudice till I reach \\"The End\\" again.This is a book which keeps growing on you and you like it even more on each subsequent reading. The characterization is simply brilliant. The dialogues, though too convoluted and flowery by today's standards, are a treat to read. The characters are all mostly likeable. Though it is supposed to be a romance, there is a whole lot more to the book. Each reading brings out subtler shades and makes you nod your head delighted as the new facet presents itself!Pride and Prejudice has to be one of my most favorite books of all time. I can read it any time and love it all over again. You are missing out on a real treat if you have not read it yet - go get it :-)!Another note: I think because the protagonist is female, women tend to enjoy this book a whole lot more than men!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Of all of Austen's novels, and I've read them all, Pride and Prejudice stands out to me as the most dynamic. The characters are richly developed and the plot woven skillfully in and out of the quirks of society. This book can be boring and tedious to read if you let it, but with a little imagination and an enjoyment of the language it can take flight and transform. I have read the book five or six times and studied it in an English analysis class, and each time I find something new to discover and relish in Austen's witty commentary. Read it once for the plot, then read it again for the social critisism, and it will blow you away!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"If you are like I was before reading this wonderful book, you probably can't imagine what could be so wonderful about Pride and Prejudice. How can it be interesting, you're thinking, when it's written in such a stuffy time period? I'll stick with my science fiction/romance novels/westerns, thank you very much. And it's true, you can't find any lusty young rogues, aliens, or gun fights, but that doesn't keep it from being an extremely wonderful book to read. The characters are full of life, the plot well constructed, and the entire story full of charm and humour. Don't be put off by the language either. It takes some getting used to, but once you're going it's not only completely natural, but makes today's English seem completely dull and simple. I cannot stress enough how wonderful this book is. (By the way, in case you think I'm someone who thinks a 'good time' is a trip to the museum or a riveting game of chess, I'm not. I take sick pride in my love of the uncultured, but even I can't help but love this book.) Once more, with feeling: Don't avoid this book because of the time period it's written in."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"When I first started to read this book I thought that it would have alot of old time english that I couldn't understand and that there would be alot of slow spots and bore. But as I got into the book (which didn't take very long) I found a REALLY great novel.The plot is amazing, it's one of those books that make you think about it when your done.I have read alot of romance novels in my life and this is by far the best one.I also think this book gives an important message: You should get to know a person before you jugde them because for all you know they could be your true love.If you are looking for something a little more than just a silly romance. Look no further than Pride and Predjudice."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I finally read P and P when I assigned it to my sixteen year old daughter. She really appreciated the little notes in the DK illustrated classics edition. I have been reading older novels for so long I didn't really take too much note of the explanations since they were all familiar to me but my daughter said they really helped her understand some things that were very unclear to her and keep her momentem reading the novel, which we both really loved."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is a timeless and beloved classic. It's a beautiful story of class in Jane Austen's time that appeals to us today because it is so well-wrtitten. It's scrupulously clean morally, and I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates the time when love stories were wholesome and pure and touching. All the characters have an appeal that's makes you appreciate the way they fit into the story."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"As much as this book revolves around three of the four daughters of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, all of those characters revolve around Mr. Darcy - whose personality and character matures and unfolds before you.Neither poor nor rich, the Bennets cannot establish great wealth and comforts for their children - and Mrs. Bennet's hard opinionated character further deprives the lovely lasses of possibilities for advancement. But, through the character weakness(es) will come happiness in all levels - where some smile and others are more joyous and laugh. And, thee events happen quickly, all within one year's time.Darcy, who adores his 10-years-younger sister Georgiana, is the proper gentleman who has never raised his voice during his 28 years. Elizabeth, her father's favorite and mother's least, befriends Mr. Darcy and soon aggravates his senses and challenges him to make it to 29 without harsh verbal exchange or raised voice.After some embarrassingly wrong misconceptions of his character, and equally wrong characterizations about a person whose life has plagued Darcy's, Elizabeth watches the young man blossom as he singlehandedly controls her family's pitfalls, confronts those who attempt to deliver her family to near disasters and financially saves the family from other possible misfortunes. In such actions, Darcy has to befriend an enemy, deliver embezzled money, negotiate with creditors of his enemy, and more. And, all for love - and who ever said love would be easy?Pride is swallowed not only by Darcy, but by so many others in this novel. \\"Pride. . . is a very common failing. . . Human nature is quite proud of some quality or other, real or imaginary.\\" We learn, \\"Vanity and pride are different things.\\" \\"Pride rises from a good opinion of ourselves; vanity from what we would have others think of us.\\"We are wrongly told \\". . . almost all his [Darcy's] actions may be traced to pride, and pride has often been his best friend.\\" In the end, we learn Darcy \\". . . has no improper pride.\\"Interestingly, prejudice is not a word defined, used or explained like its title counterpart. But, prejudice is a concept belying each page, each acquaintance, each personal affront, and somehow is easily overcome by youthful passion. Prejudice helplessly loses amidst the betrothing of the three daughters full of young passion.In the end, a Cinderella-like conclusion befits the young hearts' defiance to prejudice through passion. And, in the persuasive methods of young Elizabeth, the originally perceived overbearing pride of Darcy evolves into what she describes to be proper pride.If there is one thing this reader enjoys in this Austen book it is the dialogue. Whether it be the hindered ire of Darcy in civilly responding to Elizabeth's overzealous impertinence, or Elizabeth's steadfast refusal to succumb to Lady Catherine's requests that she never wed her nobleman nephew, the calm and polite retorts are deliciously phrased and eloquently presented. Few plays can match such work."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It seriously does not get any better than this! This book unfolds slowly allowing you to fall in love with the characters and get a feel that world and time. An amazing love story, it leaves you wanting more!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I love Jane Austen all around, but most especially Pride & Prejudice. If I can't find anything else to read, I pick up P & P. Austen is so very clever, and the multifaceted storyline never gets old."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I enjoyed Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen, with the exception of two things.First, the version that I read has a nauseating, fan-boy introduction. I don't particularly care which version of this book you purchase; you should skip the introduction. Just in case. This is not the fault of the author, but of the editor, and I will not ding the author because of its presentation - especially hundreds of years after her death. It would be dirty pool.Second, there is a single passage in the novel which details Elizabeth's growth as a character, where she, introspectively, weighs in on how she feels she has developed. This was out of character for her. She spends much of the novel in angst about various things (such as Mr. Bingley's interactions with her sister Jane, Mr. Darcy's feelings for her, and vacillating between like and dislike for Mr. Darcy himself). The loss of this paragraph would have, in no way, mutilated the perception of Elizabeth as a cogent and erudite character with a mind of her own that was well-working. Nor would its absence have colored an intelligent reader's perception of her growth.Mr. Bennet, however, was hilarious. His steadfast perception of all of the women around him (excepting Elizabeth) as being irredeemably foolish was, I think, a major highlight of the book. Not because it was accurate (although it certainly was in the case of the youngest daughter, Lydia), but because it highlights and gently satirizes the perception of ladies at this time in England. This is made particularly clear in the case of his wife, who is the most grasping fictional woman since Becky Sharp. The juxtaposition of Mr. Bennet's foolish perceptions of women (as themselves being foolish), and the intelligence of two of his daughters (Jane and Elizabeth) faithfully, I believe, points out one of the main purposes of Ms. Austen's writing: To throw into stark contrast the difference between the commonly, culturally accepted perceptions of women (e.g., Mr. Bennet) and the reality of their perceptions and their intelligence (e.g., the two eldest Bennet sisters). This was, in my perception, one of the most important purposes of Ms. Austen's writing, and she performed it well.The interactions between Elizabeth and several of the other characters, especially Lady Catherine De Bourgh, are often times hilarious. Other times, such as her frequent misperceptions of Mr. Darcy and her excercise of her sometimes rapier wit at his expense, are less amusing than they are painful; not because of their inaccuracy or their sharpness, but more because an astute reader will realize the reality of Mr. Darcy's character much earlier than Elizabeth does. And once that point is reached, and even before, it is hard to take her chidings with equanimity. Even if he is a jerk, he is still a human being, and it seems malicious of Elizabeth to treat him this way. Unlike some, I will not excuse her behavior as common for the times, because Elizabeth seems...transcendent of her times in some ways, much like the author herself.This was, by and large, a very entertaining book. It is well worth reading, whether you are curious about the foundations of romantic comedy (which got their first big push in the public here), in the time period of the Napoleonic War (which doesn't figure in the novel, but the social interactions of the time are well detailed), a fan of novels of manners (such as this one, Sense and Sensibility, and Emma, by the same author, Thackeray's Vanity Fair, or Evelyn Waugh's A Handful of Dust), or just in the mood for a fun book. If I could, I would give it 4.5 stars.AHarkius"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"There are few things more comforting in this world that sitting down with \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" and a steaming mug of tea. My mother first introduced me to the world of Jane Austen when I was quite young and I will say that this novel is one of the most battered books on my shelf due to how many times I have read it - at least once per annum. For years, audiences have been charmed by the likes of Elizabeth Bennet, the story's sharp-witted heroine, and admired the well-born Mr. Darcy, her verbal sparring partner. There is evidence to suggest that this novel in particular held a special place in Austen's heart, though one could hardly fault her if this is the case.It is impossible for me to resist being drawn in by the Bennet family - the tale of five sisters and an estate entailed away to particularly ridiculous male relation. Though it may be \\"a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife,\\" the prospects of marriage for any of the girls are far from ideal. However, more than love and marriage, character takes the center stage of this novel and within its pages is material enough for endless study and enjoyment.I hesitate to say too much more than that this novel is simply a joy to read; it certainly deserves its place in the literary cannon, withstanding the tests of time. I wish that all young girls would read it so that we may have more Janes and Elizabeths and fewer Lydias. I would also freely recommend a viewing of the 6 hour A&E; film after you turn the final page, as it truly does justice to the story - not to mention Colin Firth makes a particularly dashing Darcy."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I was a little disappointed that this issue didn't have any illustrations in it, but the book is wonderful. It is the best love story ever. It truly teaches us that you cannot judge a book by it's cover. A definate must read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's classic, Pride and Prejudice, is perhaps my favorite book of all time. Miss Austen's trademark wit and whimsy style of writing is appealing to readers of all ages, even to a modern teen like me. I find something, many things, to relate to within the main character, Elizabeth Bennet, as I, like she, \\"[takes] delight in anything ridiculous.\\" Since the moment I read that infamous line: \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged......\\" I have considered myself to be a firm and loyal Janeite, joining the ranks of thousands of hopeless romantics and head-strong women whom only hope to one day find their Mr. Darcy.Between the playfulness of Miss Bennet and the comically formalness of Mr. Darcy lies a classic lesson to be learned. Originally, Jane Austen thought to name this tale \\"First Impressions\\", as the moral of the story lies within the importance of not relying on just that. Lizzie Bennet's fatal --- or perhaps only --- flaw is her characteristic quickness to judgement, which nearly cost her the love of her life. Although by the end of the story one is almost always in love with Darcy, his personality at the beginning of the story is purposefully icy and rigid, depicting him as the perfect example of an excess of pride. By the end of the tale, however, Darcy stands proud as perhaps the most romantic hero of all time.Prepare to be \\"bewitched body and soul\\" by the whit and wisdom and Miss Austen, perhaps the most perfect romantic author of all time. In addition, plan to be enchanted by the playfulness of Lizzie, charmed by the misadventure of Darcy, rendered speechless by the nerve and lack of tact within the Mrs. Bennet, charmed by the sweetness of Jane and Bingley, enraged by both Miss Bingley and Lady Catherine, and most of all, infuriated by the ridiculousness and insufferability of Lydia and Kitty. There is always something to take from a story so perfect and so classic as this. I make it a point to return to it's familar story at least once a month. This beautifully penned tale only stands to prove that Love, more often than not, will be not so easily defeated."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I recently finished reading Pride and Prejudice for the sixth time and can honestly say it was better than it ever has been before. The first reading, in high school, was a little rough. Since then, this book has grown on me each time (silly to say, since it is my FAVORITE book and the only one I have re-read as often). The humor is fantastic, the characters are both wonderful and suited so well to the time period, and Mr. Darcy is a classic \\"leading man\\". Who doesn't want to find the modern day version of Mr. Darcy?"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I recently had a chance to see the full Masterpiece Theater production of Pride and Prejudice (if you have never seen Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy, you haven't lived) and loved it as much as ever. Now that I have a Kindle and many of the classics are free I couldn't resist. I recalled that the dialogue in the series was almost verbatim from the book but I hadn't read the book in so many years that I couldn't recall how well the rest matched up. They are different because the book does a lot of narration that in the film had to be shown by activity, so it gives a different insight into your favorite characters. I was delighted to find so much in the book not in the series.The book is a perfect delight and it obvious why this treasure by Jane Austin ranks so high in the lists of English literature. Austin's skill at dialogue, character and plot development are unmatched. I had intended to just skim the book to pick up the pieces I wanted but I read every word and was delighted with the extra sections in the book not in the series. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I just finished reading the book about half an hour ago. I read it in almost two weeks, since the complexity of my life's schedule did not let me finish it in less time.

I enjoyed the reading so much in my Kindle that one day was reading at the University, waiting for some Registration assistance, and I began laughing on the occurrences of Lady de Bourgh at Longbourn.I gave this title a 4 star review since some formatting problems on the Kindle edition; including capital letters where there was no need, word and line spacing, and not coming with a list of the Chapters to be read.Although I found these errors sometimes annoying, I enjoyed quite much the experience of reading this ebook, since I never thought I would enjoy an 1800's title.Enjoy your reading!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I read this book because I have been trying to catch up on some classics of literature that I haven't read. I expected to find it to be boring and stuffy, but I vowed that I would read it. To my great fortune, my prejudice against the book turned out to be completely wrong. It is wonderful book and a great read. It is witty, funny, and perceptive, with great insights into human relationships and the structure of society during its era (late eighteenth century England)."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I've read this book so often, I can actually quote word for word. Within the first few pages you forget which century you're in, and really feel for Elizabeth and Jane as their sisters and mother embarrass them in society. You feel poor Darcy's bemusement at falling in love with someone from a (perceived) lower class, and you ache for Lizzie to unbend a little and cut the guy some slack. When they finally get it on, I breathe a huge sigh of relief that everything's turned out so wonderfully. Yes, even though I must have read it over a hundred times. And that's timeless fiction."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Please note that this review is on the hard cover edition offered here via Barns and Noble. Amazon, for reasons known only to themselves, have chosen to lump every review of the classic piece of literature together no matter the format. As I go through these reviews I find that hard cover editions, e-books, books on tape, unknown bindings, paperbacks and I don't know what all have all been thrown into the same bag.Let me be perfectly honest and tell you that as far as Austen's work itself, I would give it ten stars if that were possible. This is NOT a review of her work though, rather a review of this particular edition...as stated above. I recently went of a book buying spree for my wife to replace worn out, lost (she is a great loaner of books and many of those loaned books never find there way home), and simply misplaced books. She, like me, is a big Austen fan.Anyway, the Barns and Noble edition book described on this product page is a very fine book when you consider the cost. It is difficult to find a decent paperback book these days, much less a hardback version of anything that does not cost an arm and a leg if bought new.Now so with this printed hard back version. The book is well made. The paper, while not of fine are quality, is certainly nice enough. The binding appears quite good...I know about such things and for a mass produced books this is about as good as you are going to find anywhere. The cost is more than reasonable . (Hey...a supersized extra value meal will cost you more), and font used is extremely readable and easy on the eyes.If you order this book you must pay shipping charges; something to consider. I personally bought mine, along with a number of the \`classics' in this series directly at a B&N; store, (We drive to the big city at least every other month), thus saving the cost of S&H.;For a big bang for your buck, I can hardly see how you can go wrong with this one.As to the work itself; if you have not read this one, do so. You are in for a true reading treat. If you have read it before, then read it again! If you are one of those that simply do no like Austen's work...well, don't read it at all!Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I consider myself a moderately well read person, as I have read a few of the must read classics, yet I had not embarked on one of literature's most celebrated journey, the journey into the land of Longbourn and Pemberly as seen in Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. A few years ago I selected the book to attempt to read it, but I became immediately bored with the literature and tossed it aside, deciding against finishing it.I came across a book claiming to be a sequel of Pride and Prejudice (and a bad sequel I must say) and I decided to give the classic another try.I cannot ascertain why, but this time, something was changed. Before I finished the first chapter, I was completely entranced in the story of the Bennet's and later, Darcy and the Bingelys.At first, I was completely ignorant of the time period's lingo and I was flailing, reading slowly to completely understand the richness of the grand words. But by the middle of the book, I was fluent in the old English tongue and my native tongue, American English, was past.The plot and dialogue was like no other book I have had the pleasure of reading. The sheer brilliance of Austen's artfully crafted words and wonderful plot left me wishing the book would never reach its finish.But it did.I nearly cried when I bid farewell to my newly acquainted friends, Fitzwilliam Darcy, Elizabeth Bennet, Jane Bennet, Georgiana Darcy, Mr. Bingely, Charlotte Lucas, and the laughable Mr. Collins. An emptiness accompanied me, as I put the book the down, the aching, despairing emptiness that makes you wish that you were in the book, and lucky enough to know the characters.And this is why I encourage you to pick up Pride and Prejudice. You may be like me and either be intimidated by the vast use of vocabulary or have sampled the book before and found it not to your taste.I urge you to try again. All it took was another try and just like that, I was in love with the book forever.Look past the hard words or the moderate length and look directly into a charming book that is sure to captivateyou and draw you in as it did me.Pride and Prejudice is a timeless classic, full of eloquent words, beautiful romance, and a few twist and turns. Pride and Prejudice will always be my favorite book and will always have a hallowed spot on my bookshelf.Is anyone else in love with Mr. Darcy?"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I can't even begin to tell you all how much I loved this book (I loved it most ardently!). It was sweet, heartfelt and real! I felt connected to the characters in a way that I have never been connected with a character before, and that's saying a lot because I'm a very intense reader. I ususally grieve when I finish a book I love, and this was no exception. I think I'm still grieving a little, and It's been almost a week since I've read it!Jane Austen is one of the most if not THE most admirable writers of all time. You can't stay out of her stories. SHe grabs you and pulls you right in there with Elizabeth and Darcy and everyone else, making you fall in love with each and every character deeply."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have always loved reading a good book but I am a romantic at heart and when I started searching for Kindle freebies I came across many different categories of authors. (My mind likes to organise and categorize things). There are the Christian romance authors who explicitly introduce concepts of God and his love for us as they enfold and develop the love story between the main characters. There are the Sex-driven romance authors who give you great details on the physical attraction between the characters and then give you a front row seat (in your imagination of course) to all or some of the sexual experiences in the story. There are the sci-fi based romance authors whose love stories are mystical and many times quite unthinkable. And of course there are the action based romances where the hero is invariably going to end up in some situation (like a fight or car chase) where his machoism will be displayed to the full appreciation of the heroine. And then there are the Historical romance authors who may take any of the aforementioned slants but just given from a historical stand point. Their stories tend to have lot of substance since their work is more often than not well researched and offer detiails and facts of how society and life in general was in the past.Jane Austen's work in Pride and Prejudice falls into none of my categories. You see although she mentions that the characters went to church, she never quite gave us a sermon. Even the value of sex within marriage was the standard of the day and as she dealt with this topic it was in no way an attempt to be \\"preachy\\". It is not sex-driven for there are no sex scenes and quite frankly many physical details on the characters are missing and instead an overview of the person's features are simply stated as \\"Mr. Darcy was tall and handsome\\". There was no mysticism or any element of science fiction and the greatest action any of the characters indulged in was taking a walk. The men did not even work hard but rather spent a lot of time reading in their libraries or playing indoor games (like cards). And while we read of carriages and horses and an England of long ago, the truth of the matter is that this is neither the work of a historical romance author because Ms. Austen wrote about her own time and the dependence of women on marriage for economic security and as a means to escape social ridicule and shame. And yet it is a wonderful and probably the best romance story I have ever read (even though I hace not yet categorized it) and not because of its quite ancient philosophies of women but because it is so frank and honest when told through the eyes of the female protagonist, Elizabeth Bennet.It is a pure work of art and Ms. Austen not only transported me to a different time but to a different place and I was amazed at how enthralled I was at this very \\"wordy\\" books. Yes I love words too but there is a definite art in the way she strung words together with witticism and/or sarcasm for the various dialogue scenes.When held up next to this masterpiece, many modern day romance stories look so immature and hurried. Their creators would do well to read literature such as this! This book has stood the test of time!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is undoubtedly one of the most beloved classic novels in history -- it's had countless adaptations, sequels and homages lavished on it over the years.And Jane Austen's grand opus is still beloved for a good reason. While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of a halfway decent marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...Reading \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Lizzie and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Jane Austen about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).The only real problem: Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.But despite that formality, Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other. She also wrote some unbelievably sharp-edged dialogue with plenty of witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But Austen also weaves in startlingly romantic moments between them (\\"No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting\\").It's hard to imagine a better fictional couple than Lizzie and Darcy, despite their rocky start (a major-league snub at a dance). Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways, with quick minds and even quicker tongues. Darcy is a selfish, rather haughty man man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.It also has a solid supporting cast: the painfully practical Charlotte Lucas, slimy clerics, virtuous-looking rakes, sisters ranging from saintly to snobby, and the lovable Mr. Bingley and perpetually optimistic Jane. Lizzie's family also adds plenty of color to the story, including the screechy and hilariously mercurial Mrs. Bennett and the barb-tongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love.

I then thought it would be fun to read the original novel on my new Kindle. Even though it took me three days to read it I was not dissapointed. I had the movie running in my mind the entire time I was reading so I was able to compare the movie with the novel. I must say it enhanced the experience. I so loved each time Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy communicated in any way. Just reading their conversations was such a delight. The book really filled in all the conversations that didn't make it into the movie.This story reveals how it is possible to go from hating someone to loving them completely. The journey Elizabeth must go through to love Mr. Darcy is fascinating and complex. There are many letters exchanged and gossip Elizabeth must sort through to find the truth. The reader really feels the hatred she feels and then feels the warming of the heart as each page goes by. Truly this is one of the best romance novels ever written.

No novel, no matter how well-regarded, is universally esteemed - Twain, Emerson, and Charlotte Bronte all savaged Pride and Prejudice in print - so let us, for a few moments, stop treating it as holy writ and just look at it as a novel, at how it holds up to a modern casual reader.Pride and Prejudice (1813) is Jane Austen's novel of manners - it thoroughly explores the ins, outs and economics of nineteenth-century courtship. The novel's central character is Elizabeth Bennet, one of five daughters, whose family lives in a country village. Two wealthy, eligible bachelors move to town, and romance, confusion and animosity ensue.Austen populates her novel with all manner of flawed characters. Many of them are annoying - that is, they behave badly and are antagonistic toward the main characters - but they all show at least some depth. No one here is without flaw, but no one here is without virtue, either (except Mr. Collins, the most ludicrous of them all). And this is why the novel works: because Austen treats her characters and their social milieu gently, delicately (well, except Mr. Collins). If she had done otherwise, if she had been more cutting, she would have lost the sympathy in the reader that many of these characters engender.To the modern audience, Austen's plotting is rather sluggish, although it must be recalled that novels moved at a rather more leisurely pace then. At any rate it often seems that there is one too many side plots, or perhaps one too many visits to relatives, and there are patches that can be quite hard to get through. But you don't go to Austen for plot - you go to her for clever dialogue, for a delightful turn of phrase. That is what she thrives at, and that is what she is best remembered for. And in spite of the novel's overlength, Austen delivers a full and completely satisfying payoff. Rarely is a happy ending so fulfilling, and it may not be until the last few pages of the book that it becomes evident to the reader how masterfully Austen has set it up. And this is a large reason why the novel has such enduring appeal.Much of the nuance in Pride and Prejudice may be lost on casual modern readers. For example, the character of Mrs. Bennet is the object of great scorn from many readers, and this has only been exacerbated by the film adaptations of the novel. But while marrying for love is the norm today, then, it was not; Mrs. Bennet is the only one looking out for the Bennet family's financial future.Pride and Prejudice is, on the whole, a satisfactory and clever novel, and, at present, one whose merits are diminished mostly by readers too far removed to understand it in its fullness, or whose tastes have diverged too far."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It is beneficial at times to step away from our classics of literature, to take them down from their high pedestals and look at them without pretension.

Even if most people could not necessarily recount the plot and characters, the countless editions of the book, combined with movies and literary spinoffs stand in testimony to it as a cultural icon. There are not many who would not recognize the book by name and have some sense of its position and impact.This review then cannot do much more than to echo these commonly known facts and direct attention specifically to the Kindle edition of the book which was downloaded as a free public domain book and which I confess, my first time reading the entire book as originally written. The strength of the book and timeless qualities of it can be affirmed by the attention that it elicited from me. I was able to enter into the plot and see both the masterful writing as well as the true insight into human nature that this book represents. Apart from a few typos and the chapters not being very well differentiated, I had little difficulty wanting to return to my Kindle to continue the read and glad for the experience.This is one of the most appealing elements of the Kindle in my estimation. There are so many books in the public domain that provides an opportunity for the reader who has heard of and knows the place and importance of a particular book who can then download the book and take the opportunities during the day (and for me of a long commute) and fill the gaps in one's reading by pulling books that have stood the test of time as well as the convenience of the newer books that are available at a considerable discount over the new Hardback price.What a pleasure to read and more yet to come in the days ahead.5 Stars for the novel AND the medium!Bart Breen"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I've been reading Pride and Prejudice on my iPhone through my Kindle for iPhone app...I purchased the book as well but found it easier to read in small increments that the Kindle provides.

That's the main point of all the character's in Pride &amp; Prejudice. Pride &amp; Prejudice is about the Bennet's 5 daughters who need to be married off. Unfortunately all of the Bennet women are poor judges of how to act towards men and how the men feel about them. (Both cause many problems in the book.) One person understands, Mr.Bennet, but he seems to kind of humor them and leaves the job of matchmaking to his wife to deal with that. Mr. Bennet did seem to pass on some of his knowledge to the so-called heroine of the book, Elizabeth, a character who seems to be the light at the end of the tunnel for Mr. Bennet. Sadly, at times her wisdom fades and she shows her true colors as a Bennet woman. The main reason that all of the girls (with the exception of Elizabeth) are so silly (as it was put in the book is mostly due to they're mother, Mrs.Bennet. I assure you that Mrs.Bennet will irritate you. Even though she always tries to do the right motherly things or what she things is best for her daugters she causes many problems you may not realize until you finish the book. You can see her ingorance in her first statements which she bases on the fact,&quot;That a single man in possien of good fortune must be in need of a wife.&quot; All in all, I really find the book and the statement above shallow. All though I understand that British society at that time diplayed courting as the top of the list for females, but this book makes women appear as empty-headed, man-hungry, child-like people that bow down to man's and society's every wish. I have found that a lot of British and other classics diplay courting as a high priority, but in other books, like The Inheritance and Little Women there was more on thier mind than finding a husband. I also find this book unrealistic for many reasons, mostly because the complete personality of the charcters change in the blink of an eye.

You can bang on the \\"unhelpful\\" button if you like, but I'm only telling the obvious truth.The story is basically about a mother trying to marry her five daughters off to wealthy men, so that she may \\"rest assured\\" on profits.

Well.All the daughters are quite empty-headed and foolish except Elizabeth Bennet, who actually has clever \\"ideas\\" and is quick-witted with her tongue.They flirt around, using clever, humorous, or not-so-clever speeches that establishes each personality of the characters. Kind of like one of those old-fashioned playsI can just imagine Austen while she is writing, it goes something like this: \\"oh those pitful arrogant wealthy people, how I loath them! But it would be very nice to marry to one.\\" The truth is, she wanted to be a feminist, thus the Elizabeth character, but ended up a conservative anyways- women are better off marrying rich guy; rich guys are not only noble as birth, but noble in soul as well; high class people are in general, better than low class people. etc.So how did it end? well, I'm sure you can figure it out. All the girls married to rich-guys, or rich-guy-to-bes, with her main character married to the richest of all- and surprise! The best guy of all. And they all live quite happy.Some people said that they are enchanted by the \\"clever things\\" Elizabeth says. Yeah, they are pretty clever, but honestly, it's pretty much only because of the period difference. I think some pop TV shows' characters' speeches are pretty clever too with their usage of pop culture, I bet Austen can't think of those. WHY? BECAUSE SHE LIVES IN A DIFFERENT PERIOD OF TIME!!! So why would people hold Elizabeth's speeches higher? Well, you figure it out.Sound like a dumb silly-old love story? well, you got that quite right.

Someone on here wrote something to the effect of \\"as Blake saw the world in a grain of sand, so did Austen see the world in a drawing room\\". To this, I'd say that there is a vast difference in seeing the world in a drawing room, and thinking that the world IS a drawing room.Basically, it felt way too narrow for me. I will admit that I dislike British culture, as a whole, and have yet to make it through a third Dickens novel (have tried four). Still, I am a huge fan of Fielding, Defoe, Chaucer, Shakespeare, Wordsworth, and like a few other English authors."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride... and prejudice... just like it says... Allows us to spy on a world and in a time we'll never know, where pride rules at the expense of others, and prejudice is at its best...

However, most of her works sound quite applicable and reasonable today as well, so many years onwards, i.e. after her. Nonetheless, her literary talent and skill are still unsurpassed. This story in particular is told in a very intuitive and psychological way, being very personal and touching, at the same time. The author is constantly flowing in the realms of human mentality, feelings and emotions; whereas keeping very sound and practical judgments on the wide social world surrounding the protagonist. Overall, it is a lovely story involving a whole spectrum of human moods, feelings and conditions, such as: love, romance, grief, happiness, longing, desire, rivalry, remorse, achievement etc."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Admittedly a challenge in verse from today's language... once beyond that, one is easily transported back in time and entranced by Austen's story-telling!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Of course you know why this rating is a five.

The notes in the margins provide historical context, insights into Jane Austen's own life, and chatty asides from the editor that make you feel like you're reading the book along with an intelligent friend or book club. It is a fun introduction to Jane Austen's books for those new to Austen, and it's just another way to enjoy this classic book and really feel a connection to and a part of the kinds of conversations of \\"Janeites\\" JASNA meetings and book groups. It is an accessible edition of the book - less academic than the Norton Critical Edition, without compromising the experience of just reading Austen's books for fun."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have always been a romantic. I\`m that sucker who is always looking for a great romance novel or movie to captivate me and make me fall into the wonders of love overcoming all obstacles. So, yes, you could say I have seen and read my fair share of love stories, but this is the best.I first read this book when I was 12 after hearing incessesantly about how it was such a classic and a must-read (and of course I heard it was a romance, so that little fact right there solidified any scruples that I may have had at the time). I was mesmerized.Yes, of course it was rather difficult to understand the language at first and I did expect that. Instantly, though, I read it a second time and I locked in with Austen\`s flow of words and the sensations that I went through while reading her novel were incredible.Elizebeth Bennet is such a fantastic and relatable character and I believe any woman can relate to her. She\`s dignified and witty, but at the same time she\`s shy and believable. She\`s never ridiculous or over the top. Mr. Darcy....where do I begin? The changes in him and Elizabeth are just incredible and no matter how many times I read this book I can\`t help but fall in love with them all over again. Mrs. Bennet is truly ridiculous, but she means well. Mr. Bennet is a man who always settles and never really has determination to go ahead. He keeps to himself, sometimes it seems like he even avoids the truth of things unless it becomes dreadfully grave. Nonetheless, a great character. Mr. Collins; What a man! He will keep you laughing at how absolutely ridiculous he is. And Elizabeth\`s younger sisters are truly precious. Jane and Bingley are sweet and endearing. Miss Bingley is the perfect &#34;mean girl&#34;. Mr. Wickham is delightfully decieving and really supports the phrase, &#34;Looks are decieving.&#34; And lastly, the Gardiners are easily my favorite characters after Elizabeth and Darcy.The whole plot is wonderfully paced, and I will confess that first time reading it that it may seem slow and boring. But, when you really take the time to delve into Jane Austen\`s world and understand the truths that she expresses with such precision that still resonate in todays society, you really become intranced. You really feel like you know the characters and maybe even recognize the truth in them and recognize people you know. Austen was insightful and really understood people and characters and the morals of her time. She was brillant and I really wonder what it would be like to have met her if she was alive today. Pride ad Prejudice is my favorite novel and I really hope this review has done is justice. This is the best of the best and it will forever remain my favorite novel.Thank you Jane Austen for sharing with the world your characters and your truths."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"love this classic!!! only, what's with the incomplete names/titles? eg: ----shire ?

Yes there are no big car chase scenes, no unusually attractive female that makes everyone go \\"gaga\\", or large scale destruction. If you can get away from this and look at the story with a open mind and conscience, you will get a story that is moving and just right for just about anyone. I loved it and I think that it never gets old. Slow is the way and steady is the hand that created this masterpiece."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"a true classic. i have always wanted to read this book, and i was not disappointed.Although set in the 1800s it continues to teach life lessons and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I adore Elizabeth and the fact that she is headstrong and opinionated in this time when that was beyond frowned upon. I like Jane and her shyness. I LOVED Bingley and his charismatic charm. I also really love Mr Bennet and his sense of humor. Mrs Bennet & Lydia Bennet on the other hand were those characters you alway wanted to smack in the face for being so stupid...like so:And then there is Darcy.... At first, like everyone else, I wasn't very into him. He was standoffish and he insulted Elizabeth behind her back mere moments after meeting her! Seriously, what is wrong with you dude? I was fuming as much as Elizabeth...but then you realize that he is shy and awkward when conversing with people he doesn't know and he does all this amazing stuff just to help Elizabeth. I followed Elizabeth right down the rabbit whole when she started to fall for Darcy.My only real complaint, oddly enough, was the prose. I truly did not expect the way it was written to bug me. I am an historical romance novel fanatic so you would assume that this would be right up my alley, no?But it really wasn't. Apparently I only like to listen to them speak this way, not read it. When I hear them speak, it's like aw! He is paying her an extreme compliment and using all these pretty words. When I read it, the dialogue I can handle, but the entire page of description that basically amounts to \\"they lived in a large house called Longbourne that had many rooms and a lot of land with woods\\"....well I wasn't so into that. And when Mr Collins spoke, I had the biggest urge to just yell at him to spit it out already! Seriously dude, pull your head out of Lady Catherine's ass and speak for yourself! Stop paying Lady Catherine compliments every other word! Trust me, we understand that you think she is the awesome.Wow...this is probably the crappiest review I have ever written, but seriously there are tons of reviews out there that really explain what this book is about as well as several films, so if my review has left you confused, please go consult one of them (or just google it) and they will answers your numerous questions."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have read this book and I think it is absolutely Wonderful.

Everyone in the novel wants to find love, and marry someone. Mrs. Bennet desperately wants her five daughters to find husbands and she makes it \\"The business of her life\\" (Austen, pg 5) to get her daughters married. Throughout the novel the characters must cope with the issues of pride and wealth in their community and in turn deal with the pressures of marrying into a good family.Mr. Bingley, who is a wealthy man, is very attracted to Jane, the eldest daughter. They dance at the ball and she believes that he is the right man for her. Mr. Darcy, Mr. Bingley's friend, does not want to dance with Elizabeth, Jane's sister, because she isn't part of the same social class as Mr. Darcy. This makes him seem very arrogant. However, as the novel progresses Mr. Darcy sets aside his prejudice, and actually starts to fall for Elizabeth. Elizabeth starts to realize that she actually has feelings for Mr. Darcy. She understands that she isn't as rich as Mr. Darcy, and that she does not come from the same world as him. Elizabeth looks past the arrogance she once saw in Mr. Darcy, and learns to love him regardless.Elizabeth's younger sister elopes with Officer Wickham, and the family is ashamed. Elizabeth fears that their pride may be ruined. Even though the two are happy together the family acts callously towards the couple because they do not think that Wickham is good enough for her, and she would be better off with someone from a high social class.Jane and Mr. Bingley get engaged and everyone is happy again. Lady Catherine tells Elizabeth about Mr. Darcy's intentions on marrying her, and that she should say no. Lady Catherine does not think that Elizabeth is worthy of her nephew because he is so wealthy, and she is just average. Elizabeth says that she isn't going to throw away her happiness, and accepts when Mr. Darcy proposes.The book was very well written but the plot was a little boring and goes back and forth too much. I felt that all anyone really cared about was whether or not they were going to get married. I thought that the way the characters spoke, and how the actual words were written were very eloquent, and made a simple phrase sound beautiful. I feel like what the author was saying could have been said in fewer words, and she could have condensed it into a shorter novel.I also liked how Elizabeth didn't give into Mr. Darcy right away and she stood her ground, yet Mr. Darcy did not give up on Elizabeth. She thought that he was very arrogant but then once she got to know him she actually appreciated him.Because the book focuses mainly on the subject of marriage, and love, only certain people may find enjoyment and entertainment in it. I don't believe that this novel was written for one specific age group, and could be read by many different ages. I think that young adults might enjoy the novel the best, because it deals with finding love. Again, the book was very well written, but a little too repetitive."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Miss Elisabeth Bennet is a very witty, ironically and independent woman. She is the opposite of Mr. Darcy. He embodies the modern, educated and pride person of the upper class. She is full of prejudices against his behaviour. It is a story of resentment and misunderstanding. The first impression of a person is a constant picture which you carry along with you. It takes time to get rid of it and so does Elisabeth. Jane Austen takes this picture to develop her story. The reader follows the view of Elisabeth in the whole story to the rear end. During the elopement of Elisabeth younger sister Lydia she realises that Mr. Darcy is not the kind of person she always thought of. Her change of mind takes place in the off. The reader is not familiar with it because Elisabeth rejects the love of Mr. Darcy every time. You feel astonished in the end when you hear what she reveals to Jane.The novel is characterised as a battle of words. There is no much description of the setting or the social class in the nineteenth century. It concentrates on the feelings and situations of the characters. Chatting all over, I think it is the typical pastime of every girl. The book is full of these situations. It is about love, envy, parties and what is hot in town."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I wanted so badly to love one the classic romances of all time, but couldn't. I found the story incredibly dated. I was able to get past the archaic use of vocabulary, but not the lack of plot. Most of this lengthy novel is about idle English gentry socializing at each others homes. I had nearly decided to give up on finishing the book, when it picked up a little in the final third. I read the free Kindle edition. While the formatting is not as good as with paid editions, it is perfectly adequate. I can't see any reason to get one of the paid versions, unless you are an Austen fan who wants the collected works organized with an active T.O.C."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is a classic and a must read for everyone. Its a perfect book for students in school to read. I love the love/hate relationship between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I couldn't let my piont of view opinionate this classic story, as I only saw the theater production. But as a body of the human race I'll say this, fall in love with it, become obsessed with it, just don't believe it. We would all wish to be the Elizabeth, but her character had no realism to one of us the real characters of this world.And so dream for your Darcy, Hope for your marrage but never contemplate life to be a script, you only get one rehersal in this life time."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I love this audio version of Pride and Prejudice but the Cd's would not play.

It just continous with the same things before for another 100 pages. Although you expect an end you aren't really interested in it. When you finishes the book you just have fogotten what you've read at the beginning of the story."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The common comment on this book, seems to be people's love for the ... &quot;love&quot; story. Mr Darcy, and Elizabeth, how great it is to see them together. Howevor Jane Austin is not a Romantic novelist. Her intent was to criticize her generation. She was in a way, poking fun at people's prejudice. This book is actual considered an &quot;ironic comedy.&quot; The comedy I can not see, but the irony is definately blinding. The part of this book that bothers me, is not so much within the book itself, but the point of the book. If someone was truly in hatred of their society, noticing the flaws relentlessly, why spend 62 chapters of their life, writing about it? I personally felt that this book, could be summed up in less than four pages, with the same amount of content being delivered, the same lessons being learned."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"jane austen is the most manly woman i've never met. her books are full of the kind of intricate analyses that i've only ever found in men, like myself, and have never observed in women, even women supposedly very smart, with all the benefits of formal education, indeed, even phd's from such places as harvard and berkeley. women, however smart they may be, always fall back on intuition when confronted with perplexing problems. even when their intuitions are completely impotent. i've had women tell me that they \\"thought\\" the economy was on the edge of deep recession because their \\"intuitions\\" told them so. or who said they \\"thought\\" a new business venture was destined to fail because they had an \\"intuition\\" about it. yet, when pressed for further \\"reasons\\", they were able to elaborate no further.so it is against such a background that i approached ms austen. and having read p&p; and mansfield park i am truly astonished that a woman wrote these books. certainly, the subject matter betrays a woman's concerns. yet, she must have been a rare woman who could patiently analyze and untangle the thoughts and actions of so many confused characters, who could resist the feminine temptation to jump to easy intuitive conclusions. i am amazed. would that there were just a few jane austens in this world. or lizzie bennetts, even. but alas, the world positively teems with lydia and kitty bennetts - and mrs bennetts! sigh."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Such a book with themes such as reputation and class horribly expressed. The main conflict was worthless to begin with. Perhaps its just my tastes, seeing that every other reviewer gave this book 5 stars, I might as well, for the book's sake, give this book 2 stars.One word for you: Redundant!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I recently read Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen, for a project in my AP English Class. I enjoyed the novel, and thought it fairly funny. The novel begins with Mrs. Bennet, who is earnestly searching husbands for her two eldest daughters, Jane and Elizabeth. The arrival of Charles Bingley, a wealthy bachelor, is an exciting prospect. She thus proceeds to set her daughter Jane up with him, and in the course of events, her other daughter, Elizabeth, falls in love with Mr. Bingley's friend, Fitzwilliam Darcy. The novel seems to lack; however, a more serious plot. The main themes are love, public status, and class, all of which seem to me rather less important in the scheme of things. All throughout the novel, the reader's main motivation to finish the novel is the unveiling of the fate of Elizabeth and Darcy. While the characters are very interesting and well structured, I feel the novel lacks a serious plot line. I believe the novel to be more of a gossip based story rather than a classic. I would not recommend this novel to others."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have to agree -- Pride and Prejudice is a wee bit, well -- BORING.I don't know what it is. Maybe I just didn't get it -- but that's not like me at all. I don't find classic in general very hard to understand. I've read plenty of classics and both loved and understood them.No, it's not that I didn't understand, it's just that the story takes so long to kick off. It begins with our shero Elizabeth and her pathetic clan of sisters who struggle to appease society by appearing either beautiful, accomplished, well-connected or all three.As most main characters do, Elizabeth stands out from her sisters. She doesn't attempt to be pretty or accomplished and could care less about impressing any man. Her main concerns are caring for her family and remaining witty, independent, and free. She further scandalizes the neighborhood with this rebellious nature by -- gasp! -- walking a few miles in the rain and mud to care for her sick sister! The nerve!And meanwhile, the famous Mr. Darcy seems if anything cold, distant, and rude. He has a slight interest in Elizabeth, but that seems to be all. For this reason I was slightly shocked when I saw the commercials for the movie version of this book -- why, Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth were kissing!I must have read more than half the novel and they didn't so much as shake hands! I finally gave up and moved on to more interesting works of fiction -- but, hey, if you like and understand this novel, then good for you! Meanwhile, the rest of us would like to get back to the more admirable Miss Jane Eyre."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have read this book a number of times, and tried to like it; but; the characters lack depth. Lizzy, and to an extent Charlotte are the only two who are 3D. Jane Austen\`s ideas of poverty are laughable, large house complete with servants is not poor. Mr.Darcy great on video but passionless in the text."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I love this book. It's such a good read. You will absolutely love the characters, I guarantee it. Elizabeth is such a refreshing heroine, not simpery or weak or stupid but smart and funny and all that stuff. The book itself is hilarious. The funniest scene is the one where Mr. Collins proposes to Elizabeth. It's priceless. Anyway, if you've read Emma and hated it, DO NOT let that keep you from reading this, because they are totally different and this one is worlds better. I highly highly reccommend it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I had a lot of fun reading Pride and Prejudice.

I've read the book 7 times and cant get enough of it.The BBC adaptation of the book was brilliant Jennifer Ehle was the perfect Elizabeth and Colin Firth was the perfect Mr Darcy, both were exactly how I'd imagined the characters to be like.

In the BBC version of the novel, the adorable Colin Firth plays Darct to a tee. He was exactly the way I imagined him to be.

Whenever I am at a loss to find anything decent to read in the modern literature I find this a real comfort. A great read!!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is undoubtedly one of the most beloved classic novels in history -- it's had countless adaptations, sequels and homages lavished on it over the years.And Jane Austen's grand opus is still beloved for a good reason. While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of a halfway decent marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...Reading \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Lizzie and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Jane Austen about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).The only real problem: Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.But despite that formality, Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other. She also wrote some unbelievably sharp-edged dialogue with plenty of witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But Austen also weaves in startlingly romantic moments between them (\\"No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting\\").It's hard to imagine a better fictional couple than Lizzie and Darcy, despite their rocky start (a major-league snub at a dance). Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways, with quick minds and even quicker tongues. Darcy is a selfish, rather haughty man man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.It also has a solid supporting cast: the painfully practical Charlotte Lucas, slimy clerics, virtuous-looking rakes, sisters ranging from saintly to snobby, and the lovable Mr. Bingley and perpetually optimistic Jane. Lizzie's family also adds plenty of color to the story, including the screechy and hilariously mercurial Mrs. Bennett and the barb-tongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love. An absolute must-read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It is beneficial at times to step away from our classics of literature, to take them down from their high pedestals and look at them without pretension. No novel, no matter how well-regarded, is universally esteemed - Twain, Emerson, and Charlotte Bronte all savaged Pride and Prejudice in print - so let us, for a few moments, stop treating it as holy writ and just look at it as a novel, at how it holds up to a modern casual reader.Pride and Prejudice (1813) is Jane Austen's novel of manners - it thoroughly explores the ins, outs and economics of nineteenth-century courtship. The novel's central character is Elizabeth Bennet, one of five daughters, whose family lives in a country village. Two wealthy, eligible bachelors move to town, and romance, confusion and animosity ensue.Austen populates her novel with all manner of flawed characters. Many of them are annoying - that is, they behave badly and are antagonistic toward the main characters - but they all show at least some depth. No one here is without flaw, but no one here is without virtue, either (except Mr. Collins, the most ludicrous of them all). And this is why the novel works: because Austen treats her characters and their social milieu gently, delicately (well, except Mr. Collins). If she had done otherwise, if she had been more cutting, she would have lost the sympathy in the reader that many of these characters engender.To the modern audience, Austen's plotting is rather sluggish, although it must be recalled that novels moved at a rather more leisurely pace then. At any rate it often seems that there is one too many side plots, or perhaps one too many visits to relatives, and there are patches that can be quite hard to get through. But you don't go to Austen for plot - you go to her for clever dialogue, for a delightful turn of phrase. That is what she thrives at, and that is what she is best remembered for. And in spite of the novel's overlength, Austen delivers a full and completely satisfying payoff. Rarely is a happy ending so fulfilling, and it may not be until the last few pages of the book that it becomes evident to the reader how masterfully Austen has set it up. And this is a large reason why the novel has such enduring appeal.Much of the nuance in Pride and Prejudice may be lost on casual modern readers. For example, the character of Mrs. Bennet is the object of great scorn from many readers, and this has only been exacerbated by the film adaptations of the novel. But while marrying for love is the norm today, then, it was not; Mrs. Bennet is the only one looking out for the Bennet family's financial future.Pride and Prejudice is, on the whole, a satisfactory and clever novel, and, at present, one whose merits are diminished mostly by readers too far removed to understand it in its fullness, or whose tastes have diverged too far."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"MY DEAR READERI cannot but be rendered in the highest of spirits upon completing this volume yet again, as I have always preferred extensive reading to trivial pleasures.Dwelling on particular passages and turns of phrase, I am reminded of how ardently I admire and love the prose that issued forth when Miss Austen put ink to paper many a fortnight ago.Neither common, nor dull, nor threadbare, each chapter engrosses completely with accounts of gentlemen of handsome countenance and ladies both sensible and silly.And though its conclusion is known most intimately to my own heart, anxiously I turn each page to venture ever farther away from the misconstrued encounters and lamentable conduct of Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy.When finally all is concluded and the mistress of Pemberley assured, only then can I chuse another distraction to engage my solitary hours.

While it's easy to see why this was a popular story from the 19th century up to the 1950s, reading it now is like listening to cat negotiating its way out of a tangled quilt cover, amusing yes, but ultimately awful and frustrating.The motivations of the two central characters are purely woeful. I won't spoil anything but you don't want anyone to get the outcomes that they desire, not the protagonists, not the antagonists, no one.I can't say don't read it as it is so very ingrained in the pop culture of today, however I can say you should read the book trying to identify any part of it that wouldn't be made better by the introduction of zombies."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"One of my all-time favorite classics and a book I have read endlessly and will read many times more, so am delighted to have this on my Kindle as well as having several print copies around.

It's about 7 1/2 hours each way (because I actually go the speed limit!!!) and I wanted to try something new while driving. So, I decided to try an audio recording.I found one from my local library of Pride and Prejudice. : Why not go with a classic book for the drive home?So, I listened to Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen.Pride and Prejudice is the story of the Bennet sisters, Elizabeth and Jane. Both are of marriageable age but do not come from the wealthiest of families. However, they live in a time when marriage to someone with wealth is of utmost importance.Since they have no brothers, when their father dies his estate will go to another male relative, as they are unable to inherit.One summer a new family comes to live nearby, and Mrs. Bennet, their mother insists that Mr. Bennet make an acquaintance with Mr. Bingley, the new bachelor who is very wealthy. At a ball one evening he is immediately taken with Jane Bennet who is admittedly beautiful, of a sweet nature, but perhaps below the standard of wealth into which he is expected to marry.But the problem really is his friend, Mr. Darcy. A haughtier more proud man has never existed, and though that same night at the ball many women did not have partners as men were few, Mr. Darcy makes it clear that he thinks pretty negatively of Elizabeth Bennet. He is cold, unfriendly, and seemingly unkind . . .Mrs. Bennet is determined to see her daughters married and encourages Jane and Mr. Bingley, but is desperate to make a match for Elizabeth, including pushing her to accept the proposal of marriage from her most insipid cousin.We follow the story of the Bennet family as others do everything they can to keep Jane and Mr. Bingley apart, and Elizabeth is forced into close proximity with the awful Mr. Darcy repeatedly.Will Jane and Elizabeth ever find true love that others will accept? Or will their less wealthy state be their destruction?Read Pride and Prejudice to find out!This is a total and complete classic. There are over 2 million copies sold worldwide, hundreds of editions, and quite a few different audio recordings, not to mention TV and movie versions of this story.If you haven't actually read Pride and Prejudice you simply must! It's a beautiful, wonderful story full of lively characters with personality oozing from them. Mrs. Bennet is incredibly silly, a trait which seems to have rubbed off thoroughly on several of her daughters. But Jane and Elizabeth took far more after their father with much more sense. It's the story of how pride and prejudice can keep you from truly seeing another's character, and how opinions can change when someone is given a true chance.I highly recommend this book to everyone!5 out of 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"In all seriousness, this is a classic piece of English literature. Austen has amazing characters and a wonderful insight into the era. Every English speaker should read this book at some point in their lives."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This was my third or fourth reading of P&P--every; five or six years I have to go back to it to become reacquainted with Darcy, Lizzie, Lady Catherine and of course Mr. Collins and Mrs. Bennett. They all hold up beautifully: gloriously pompous, spectacularly arrogant, continually conniving and of course proud and prejudiced. There is so much to enjoy: language, wit, style and plot all converge to create, to my way of thinking, the best novel of the 19th century.Academicians all seem to prefer Emma, some folks like Sense and Sensibility more. But for me, P&P; is a cut above. Call it what you will--a comic novel, a novel of manners--there is such energy and joy in Austen's humor and wit. Never censorious, even the most pompous and disagreeable have a reason for being--not really harmful, they just move the plot along to its terrific denouement.If it has been awhile since you have read it, give it another read. Not only will you not be disappointed--I think you will be continually amazed that two hundred years later, Pride and Prejudice still works its magic."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I absolutely loved this book!! Personally I am very picky about books. And in order to get on my favorites list it has to be exeptional. And trust me this book definatly was!! The story is told from the point of Elizabeth, who is the second oldest daughter of the Bennet family. She shows awsome analytical skills, but as the story continues you realize that there has been a prejudice made in the story. And you also realize how you, yourself got outsmarted &amp; realize you made a huge prejudice too. This story is happening in a setting of old England. Whith balls, &amp; horse drawn carriges &amp; the ladies only wear dresses. It is a wonderful story of romance &amp; life in general. But always very entertaining. I recommend this book to everyone!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The story line is good but the writing style takes a little getting used to.

Mr. Darcy is sure to win the hearts of every girl who reads about him.

Here's why:-The WAE versions of Jane Austen's books are hardcover and physically comfortable in that they are printed on smooth white paper rather than typical beige rough paper and the typeface is solid roman type that is easy on the eyes.-The size is approximately 5X8. The corners of the pages are rounded giving it a soft look. The covers of all WAE, are completely black, except for the title and author and also have rounded corners. Attached to the back cover is an elastic band that goes around the height of the book and you can use this as a book mark or as a way to keep your book closed.-Each WAE novel has colorful inside covers depicting a scene from the novel and there are nice color drawings included in the introduction.-Each novel has at least three sets of notes written by Austen scholars. Most of the notes are the same in all the novels, but each novel has one additional note section peculiar to that novel. The notes that all editions have are a timeline in color of Jane Austen's world and a color map of Austen's England. In P&P; the additional notes is the illustrated Army in Austen's time.I bought used copies of WAE novels because even used, they are sturdy and comfortable. I am very hard on books by intention. I read while I eat, before I sleep, while waiting on lines, etc. But mainly, I like to embellish my books with beads, ribbons and lace, and even some rubber stamping on the white spaces in the text itself. I wouldn't have the heart to do that to an expensive hardcover.If you like the &#34;feel&#34; of books, I highly recommend the Winchester Austen Edition of any of Austen's novels. Let me know what you think."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Great book I read it in a week loved this classic book Lizzy and Darcy is a true love story"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This classic novel follows the Bennet sisters as they search for marriage. The joy of this book is relating it to modern day romance and marriage. Many parts of the conversations and desires are familiar to today, while many other parts are foreign. Austen also has a great sense of humor, although many times I wondered whether it was intended as funny or whether it only appeared comical from a modern point of view."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is by far my favorite novel. I read it for the first time in 10th grade and have read it 4 times since. Every time I get something new out of it and the story never loses its charm!Austen is an undeniably talented author and Pride and Prejudice is arguably her best work. All of the characters are wonderfully developed and full of life. The plot seems to have a mind of its own, twisting here and there. Unlike some books were the plot doesn't seem to fit together in the end, Austen has worked out every detail.I also think this book is wonderful for the social commentary that it provides. Again, some novels I have read do not do so well with balancing social commentary and plot/character development. This is not so with Pride and Prejudice. This book is a true gem. Witty, fun, shocking, scandalous, romantic, and entertaining!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Almost everything that can be said about this book has been said. It has appeared in countless other books and media. I love this book for it's wit, it's humor, it's unconventional love story and because it is almost the singly best early example of individuals rebelling against conformity. This book is amazing, and I recommended it to anyone."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is a superb book. Each character has a unique personality. For example, Mr. Darcy is arrogant at the start of Pride and Prejudice. While Darcy is arrogant, Elizabeth Bennett is smart, beautiful, and independent. Elizabeth is the protagonist and is the liveliest character. I rooted for her from the start to the end of the story. Miss Bennett seems to somehow always find herself in difficult situations. The plot kept me entertained. There were several times when I couldn't put the book down until I found out what happened next.Pride and Prejudice is sometimes a little wordy. And because it was written in the 19th century, the English isn\`t contemporary.Overall, this book is excellent. In fact, it is considered one of the best novels in English ever written. It is therefore a classic. I recommend it to readers who want to read an engrossing book with a lot of dialogue."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is one of the best i have read in years.

I appreciate the positive reviews as they motivated me to start a classic which I may not have begun without some encouragement."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"My favorite chapter was chapter eleven in volume two because I found it amusing that Elizabeth turned down Mr. Darcy's proposal. I think that Elizabeth's own prejudice against Darcy didn't allow her to see his affections for her. Darcy accuses Elizabeth of having too much pride, and she accuses him of prejudice, when in both cases they both show pride and prejudice.I think this book is appropriate for students in high school because it is not complicated to read and therefore they should be able to read it. I like the fact that the author uses a lot of dialogue to reveal ideas and personalities of different characters. In my opinion dialogue is very important because sometimes it helps me understand what the characters are like, or it can reveal a character's look, and that helps me develop a picture of that one character.I like this book because it wasn't as hard to read as I thought it was going to be. One thing that I learned was that you should carefully read the story because sometimes you might miss the important parts."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"STORY LINE:Being not very wealthy, Elizabeth (Lizzie) Bennet and her four sisters find it hard to find good marriages in society thirst for position and good fortunes.

Elizabeth is married to Darcy and Jane is married to Mr. Bingley. Mrs. Bennet is happy because three of her daughters are married.Pride and Prejudice is appropriate for people 15 years and older because it is interesting and romantic. I would really recommend them to read the novel because they would really like the novel.One literary device that I appreciate was how Jane Austen uses the letters in the novel to advance the plot in the story. For example the letter from Darcy to Elizabeth told the reader that they might get married because now Elizabeth would know that Wickham was a liar. The way that she did that was when Darcy wrote to Elizabeth to tell her that Wickham was not saying the truth about him and that Wickham was a liar . Another example would be when Jane wrote to Elizabeth to tell her that Lydia had run away with Wickham. Lydia has to marry Wichham so that it wouldn't be a disgrace for the family.I like the novel because it makes us think about pride and prejudice against others, and about knowing people before we judge them. This novel is also very romantic for people who like romantic novels. I would recommend everyone to read it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"\\"It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possesion of a good fortune must be in want of a wife,\\" or so begins PRIDE AND PREJUDICE by Jane Austen. PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is one of the most highly regarded classical novels of English literature. More than likely, throughout high school and college, you will read this book. PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is relatively short for a classic, only around 350 pages. It is a medium-difficulty reading though, as the dialouge is a bit hard to keep up with and the language can be a bit \\"sophisticated.\\"PRIDE AND PREJUDICE tells a tale of a tangled love story. The book centers around Elizabeth Bennent, the second oldest daughter of the Bennent family. Her eldest sister Jane falls for Bingley, a rich and polite gentlemen. Elizabeth meets Bingley's friend, Darcy, who is even richer but has horrible manners. When Bingley departs suddenly, Elizabeth finds out it was Darcy's doing. Elizabeth finds herself falling in love and hating Darcy at the same time. The novel concludes the love tales in a brilliant conclusion that makes everyone satisfied.PRIDE AND PREJUDICE isn't the most exciting novel, and it might be questioned why it is better than today's novels made by King, Grisham, or Sparks. It is because it is a classic, and that there is a multitude of messages in the novel. PRIDE AND PREJUDICE criticizes the social class system, as Austen also criticizes the marriage process which can be a non consensual process. The book is an excellent example of a satire. The book has lively characters, and about 70 percent of the book is the well thought dialouge.The book falls short of other classics though, i.e. A TALE OF TWO CITIES, OLIVER TWIST, CALL OF THE WILD, and a few others, but altogether a brilliant work."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It is one of the greatest classics I have ever read.

It encompasses Austen's fabulous use of irony, wonderful examples of females subverting the economic conditions that control them through their wit, and a wonderful contrast in descripitions of landscapes that are prevelent in all of Austen's books. However, this book stands out as one of the best of the nineteenth century for many reasons. The first is that Austen's use of irony in this book is readily apparent, especially in the dialogue and actions of the characters. The wit that Lizzie exudes, especially in her conversations between Mr. Darcy, her unexpected love interest, and the Lady Catherine de Burgh provide endless entertainment for the reader. The reader develops a line of sympathy for Lizzie as she struggles to make the best of her unfortunate financial situation. Another reason to love the book not only includes the wit of Lizzie Bennet, but of her father and Mr. Darcy, which provide wonderful view into the superior workings of Austen's mind in terms of her characters' personalities. The landscapes would provide a wonderful escape for someone stranded on a deserted island because they provide many Romantic countrysides with transcendental descriptions along with wonderful descriptions of London that make the reader feel as if they really are staying with Mrs. Gardner with Jane. The description of Pemberley alone provides a wonderful example of the grandeur of nineteenth-century estates in England. Since I am supposedly stranded on this island on Valentine's Day, the love story contained within Austen's indirect ocmmentary on the hardships of economics on women in the nineteenth century, provides a hope that each person will meet not only the perfect person, but that person will also recognize them as their destined mate. This book incorporates the Romantic notions of Byron and Wordsworth into Lizzie, while allowing her to retain pieces of realism that makes her supreme to all of the other female characters. Austen also provides a wonderful sexual tension between Mr. Darcy and Lizzie that has never been equalled in any book that I have ever read, and being an English major, there have been many. I have read this book many times and still find motifs, themes, images and nuances in the plot that provide me continually with enjoyment. For this reason alone would I be content with having this book as my sole company on a deserted island. The villains in this novel are also so much fun to hate because they prove to be the very foces that try to keep Lizzie and Darcy apart. The two characters, however, persevere, which would be a very important theme for a person stranded on a desert island. Perseverence would be the only way one would survive the lonliness, aside from an excellent book, of course. Austen was truly ahead of her time as critic after critic will tell you, but only after you have read one of her greatest works will you understand why it has crossed the time and custom boundries and to this day remains a wonderful piece of literature that will continue to provide enjoyment to each new reader that endeavors to read it.

Elizabeth's younger sisters are silly young girls who favor their senseless mother. Her father loves her dearly. He adds humor to the novel with his near-sarcastic views of his family. The other characters in the novel range from her completely silly and senseless cousin Collins, to the conniving Miss Bingley, to the indescribable Mr. Darcy, Elizabeth's beau. Austen uses the perfect combination of humor, romance, and suspense in this unforgettable story. I was unable to put this book down, but I regretted it not being any longer"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"As always, Austen ridicules the conventions of the time, but acknowledges that they must be accepted. Women must find men (hopefully rich) to marry them; any feelings of love or respect in marriage are wonderful, but not always necessary or relevant. The characters are far from perfect --- pompous, superficial and greedy. Even the heroine of the novel, Elizabeth, is prone to prejudice. She is a willing participant in the titillating conversations with the proud Darcy and the envious Bingley sisters which serve to amuse and entertain the reader"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"the English countryside during the 1800's.Imagine this: you are the second eldest of five sisters, you have a flighty mother who is fixated on marrying you all off, and you have a father whose indolence and disillusionment with life have led to the faulty upbringing of your three younger sisters. What would you do when an attractive, rich man moved in next door and fell in love with your older sister (who is the most beautiful and eligible woman in the surrounding countryside)? You would be happy for her and you would do everything you could to help her marry the man she loves...and you'd be pretty upset if his best friend stepped in and talked him into not being in love with your sister and thus removed your sister's chance at happiness and an improved situation in life. Then what if your socially inept, silly, pedantic cousin asked you to marry him after you had only known him three days? Oh--then what would you do if he proposed to your best friend the day after you refused him, and she accepted?! To top it off, what if the same person who took away the love of your sister's life fell in love with you and asked you to marry him?!Well, that is Miss Elizabeth Bennett's position at the outset of this hilarious and endearing novel which details a year in the life of a genteel English family and their neighbors. During the course of the novel, three proposals of marriage are made to Miss Elizabeth; one proposal is made to Jane (the eldest Miss Bennett); and their youngest sister (who is only sixteen) elopes with an English Army officer who has a worse reputation with the ladies than Wilt Chamberlin. Jane Austen is a masterful storyteller who is able to sketch characters through a plot that is never quite what the reader expects. This is a tale of life, and much can be learned from the proud and/or prejudicial acts of its participants which is applicable even today."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Like most of Austen's novels, P&amp;P immerses you in early 19th Century England with its peculiar (to us) practices, traditions and attitudes. It's richly drawn characters, totally credible and intensely likeable or hateable, are the anchor point of this wondrous story which leads the reader on a journey of discovery, mystery and uproarious humour (yes honestly). One can learn a great deal about oneself by reading this book as it examines the complexities of human relationships and emotions still valid today, almost 200 years after it was written. Other priceless titles by Austen that rate a '10' are Emma and Mansfield Park. Don't miss them, you'll kick yourself if you do"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice isn't Jane Austen's most popular novel for nothing. The story, which is set in pre-Victorian rural England, is full of elegant wit and humor fit for all ages. Though its romantic themes are directed more towards women, men too can enjoy this tale of first impressions and first loves. Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is a classic love story that will hold you in its grip from the first page to the last.The story begins when a handsome bachelor named Charles Bingley and his friends move into the neighborhood where the main character, Elizabeth Bennet, lives with her four sisters. Elizabeth's older sister, Jane, and Mr. Bingley fall in love at first sight. What makes this novel so captivating is that Jane and Mr. Bingley are persuaded by others to bury their feelings for each other. Throughout the novel, the reader is kept guessing as to whether or not they will end up together.Elizabeth, meanwhile, attracts the attentions of Mr. Bingley's best friend, Mr. Darcy. However, her first impression of his arrogant demeanor forms a prejudice within her that prevents her from returning his admiration. Likewise, Mr. Darcy's pride makes it hard for him to reveal his feelings to her. As Amazon.com's editorial review on Pride and Prejudice claims, \\"The point is, you spend the whole book absolutely fixated on the critical question: will Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy hook up?\\" Although the plot is built to answer that question, it contains more than just 18th century romance to keep you interested.Conversation keeps the pages of this novel flying by. Whether you're listening to Mrs. Bennet grind on her daughters, or you're in the room at Netherfield hearing Caroline Bingley talk trash about Elizabeth, you will beg for more. You'll be somewhat satisfied to witness Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy duke it out, but you will not be able to stop until you find out what happens next.Pride and Prejudice is an essential classic for teen and adult readers alike. It explores the world of love, the dangers of preconceived notions, and the negative affects that self-gratification can have on relationships. Tyler C. Powell, who posted his review on Amazon.com, stated that through Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen \\"has lived up to the hype surrounding her name.\\" I concur completely, and recommend reading this novel and others by the same author."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Overall, the writing and the plot were terrific although, at first, the haughtiness of certain characters like Lady Catherine really bothered me. (People like that deserve to be thrown into boot camps.) I was engrossed with the relationship between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy and how it played out from beginning to end. The conclusion of the story was satisfying and appropriate. All in all, this book is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is Austen's best novel yet, and I am eager to see what she comes up with next. This was my second-favorite book this year, after &quot;The South Beach Diet.&quot;"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"ITS THE MOST WONDERFUL BOOK I'VE EVER READ. WHAT I LIKE BEST ABOUT IT IS THE WAY JANE AUSTEN DEPICTED EACH CHARACTER. ITS A BOOK WHICH CAN BE READ AND RE READ WITH PLEASURE EACH OF THE TIMES. A BOOK THAT CAN BE CHERISHED....."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I liked the book because it shows how love can turn sour sometimes and how feelings can change. But there are so many names in the book that you have to keep checking who is who. Sometimes difficult words are used so I had to look them up in a dictionary. After reading I thing the book represents true facts mixed with fantasy.Andrea Dreier E8/I"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book was OK, but not nearly the great classic that it is supposed to be, in my opinion. My biggest impression is relief that I did not live in that era, when the most a woman could hope for was to be good at needlepoint and marry well. I understand that is how it was, but I still felt nauseous reading about all the silly, manipulative man hunting tactics of the women. The dialoge was sometimes very witty, but other times rather difficult to follow because of the older style English.I also could not stand Darcy; any man who has the audacity to say within earshot of a woman that she is too ugly to tempt him or to dance with him is a jerk, period. I would tell him to take a hike if he came around. I don't understand how women find men like Darcy, Heathcliff, and Rochester to be attractive; cold indifferent, sarcastic, and cruel men don't interest me in the slightest and I can't for the life of me understand how they get to be such great romantic interests in these type of novels.The main character, Elizabeth, is different from the others and is very likeable; she redeems the book from being a 1 star. I admire her intelligence and refusal to go along the societies norms. I don't understand how she begins to like Darcy, but I guess that is just me. Elizabeth's ability to spar with Darcy and hold her own was the best part of the book.This book is is not as good as \\"Jane Eyre\\" but is better than \\"Wuthering Heights\\" in my opinion. A decent read, but not a rave."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I am an avid reader of English classics so naturally, I came across P&amp;P fairly soon after I discovered my love of literature. I had heard so many glorious things about this novel (that it forms young women world wide, that the characters are incredibly convincing and realistic, etc.), that perhaps I was expecting a little bit more. Sure, Austen claimed she wrote about the &quot;things she knew about.&quot; Unfortunately, there were many other authors, female artists to be most specific, who were her contemporaries and wrote far more incredibly mind blowing novels (Mary Shelly comes to my mind).I will begin by saying that this book was wonderful to read. It was witty and the story line was intriguing enough that I had no trouble completing it a few days after beginning it (I will confess, I even gave up a few nights of slee to find out if Elizabeth's character flaws would resolve). The characters were convincing, the book well developed and not extremely predictable. Unfortunately, these assets did not redeem the novel in my eyes, because shortly after finishing it, I simply could not believe I had wasted a few days of valuable reading time to devote to a relatively 'numb' piece of literature. Simply put, I felt it lacked depth, and although it was witty and enjoyable to read, I do not exactly understand why it has lasted as a classic depiction of human existance. The plot was unrealistic, the ending contrived, and besides the obvious message that 'pride and prejudice are evil and indulging in either of these flaws will cause misery' I did not receive any further enlightenment by reading it. It is an excellent documentation of courting rituals during Austen's time, as well as what I imagine to be a realistic depiction of the concerns of upper-middle-class English society, but to be perfectly honest, who cares? If these subjects interest you, I'm sure you will be enthralled by Austen's work. I appreciate her and respect her because of the history she represents, and for this reason, you should NOT AVOID READING THIS BOOK, but I do not think I will ever be able to say her work moves me. Of course, I could be missing something. I'm only sixteen, so my distaste for P&amp;P could be the result of youth and foolishness. If any of you have read this novel were sincerely moved by it, I'd love to hear from you. There's nothing I hate more than simply 'not getting' a book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I really didn't like this book because it was in the old times and I didn't understand it so yea :)"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Amazon.com is amazing, so I'm not giving it one star because I hate Amazon.com because I don't.

An incorrectly formatted book of this nature should not be on the Amazon store at all!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I was a little nervous when I first decided to put this on my summer reading list. The book was 367 pages of text, close together, justified and not written in easy language (i.e. modern English). I was optimistically hoping to finish it within a month.But I really liked the movie with Keira Knightley and wanted to see how closely it compared and if it was as good as the movie.Two weeks later, I am done, and I am pleased with the ride.Plot:Mr. Bingley, an eligible, wealthy bachelor, moves nearby the Bennett family, who have five unmarried daughters. The Bennett family must secure good marriages for their daughters since they will inherit nothing when their father dies. Romance is in the air between Jane Bennett and Mr. Bingley, while the first sparks of love appear between the proud, wealthy Mr. Darcy and the exuberant, Elizabeth Bennett.Good:There are so many good parts to this book! I don't quite know where to begin!The characters are believable and real. Elizabeth is a well rounded character. She starts out proud and prejudiced against Mr. Darcy but as she learns of his true quality is not afraid of changing her mind. Mr. Darcy was sweet, opinionated, and equally prejudiced against Elizabeth's \\"poor connections\\".The plot was wonderful and well paced. It kept me on the edge of my seat (although it was not an action book); I couldn't wait to see what would happen on each page.I enjoyed the arguments between Elizabeth (and her fiesty personality) and Mr. Darcy (stiff and proud). The quips they came up with! The chemistry between the two was perfect!Lastly, I enjoyed how the author emphasized (via Mr. Bennett) to marry for love and not for money or connections or the like. This is something very much beyond her time (as many marriages in the late 18th century were arranged).Bad:Well, this is being exceedingly petty, but the language of this book makes it difficult for a modern reader to fully understand the nuances of what Jane Austen is trying to say (the notes at the appendix help with this, however).Dialogue/Sexual Situations/ViolenceNone. Talk is made of how Lydia and an officer run off to live with each other without marrying. None.Overall:Sweet. There is no better word for the free-spirited, witty romance between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth. I would have to say this is the best, purest romance story I have ever read (besides, maybe The Princess Bride). The movie does a fabulous job with the book, but the book is even more enjoyable than the movie (if you can imagine). You will not be displeased with this one.Brought to you by:*C.S. Light*"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane is prejudiced and Mr. Darcy is prideful, or is it Jane is prideful and Mr. Darcy prejudiced, or do they both have a bit of pride and prejudice, which lends itself to a delightful novel filled with social boundaries, romance, disappointment, and comedy.The movie inspired me to read this novel for the first time. However, do as I did and read the novel before seeing the movie. You will not be disappointed. The first section of the novel introduces you to the character, setting, and social rules, as well as acclimates you to Austen's style. Once you have moved into the remaining sections, the book takes so many twists and turns that you cannot put it down. Even after my third reading, I still love the suspense of what will become of each Bennet sister."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"What do books do for me that nothing else does? The most important encounter that I have with books is that I identify myself with all the characters in the book. I see all the nuances of those characters as present in me. I experience all those experiences and I am not the same after that. I cannot remain unscathed. I have evolved into a greater human being. I have climbed another rung in the ladder of spiritual evolution. One book that I enjoy every time I read it is Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". The book is the baby of a literary genius. The most compelling feature of the book is its non-violence. At no point is there any harshness. Of course, we must consider the period in which it was written. English was most poetic even in prose. Given that credit, the novel refuses to show anyone in bad light at the end of it. All of human frailties are shown as natural and well, human! Neither Mr. Darcy is the villain nor is Mr. Wickham. Each person is a consequence of the experiences he has had in his life. Jane Austen treats every character with gentleness. There is an understanding that every human being functions only within the level of awareness he/she has. That is the appeal of the novel. This is the kind of work Walt Whitman would have been proud of."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"If you can help it, read this book before seeing any of the visual versions of the story.

Was I ever wrong!While the language is more proper and formal than what we are used to today, and certainly the customs and arrangements are very different, P&P; is in many ways a simply timeless love story about two people who seemingly dislike each other at first sight, but who are truly so right for one another. A century or two will not diminish this romance!At the heart of the story is the Bennet family, a family that has been \\"cursed\\" with five daughters and no sons to inherit the family's home and estate - - lovely, softspoken oldest daughter Jane, spunky and spirited Elizabeth, bookish, serious, almost dour Mary, silly, giggly Kitty and flirty, precocious and spoiled Lydia. Mrs. Bennet's sole consideration and worry in life seems to be finding appropriate husbands for her daughters, mostly so that once Mr. Bennet dies, she shouldn't be kicked out of her home with nowhere to go. It will quickly become apparent to the reader that Mrs. Bennet's favorite child is Lydia, mostly because Lydia seems the closest reflection to Mrs. Bennet's character herself.Into this story comes the Bingley and Darcy families - - sweet, good natured Charles, who quickly falls in love with Jane, his critical, judgmental sister Caroline, who secretly yearns for marriage to Charles' best friend, Mr. Darcy, who seems uninterested in the entire endeavor.As with most romance stories, the road to true love is a bumpy one. Mr. Darcy, although obviously finding Elizabeth attractive, feels that her station in life is beneath his. Elizabeth finds his pride and aloofness infuriating. Jane and Mr. Bingley, although in love, are torn apart by his sister, who believes that a marriage to one of the Bennet girls would be most unfortunate for her family. Add the arrival of Mr. Bennet's cousin, Mr. Collins, who as the next male of kin will inherit the Bennet home - - and his frantic search for a bride and Mrs. Bennet's efforts to assist him; Elizabeth's dear friend Charlotte, a spinster of twenty-seven who accepts what life has offered her and makes some difficult choices of her own, in order that she might be merely content with her arrangements; Mr. Darcy's haughty aunt, and Mr. Collins' benefactress, Lady Catherine De Burgh, who has serious aspirations of her own to make Mr. Darcy her daughter's husband; the seductive Wickham, who shares a secret past with the Darcy family and catches the impressive Lydia's eye, nearly bringing downfall to the Bennet family.All in all, this was an incredibly satisfying story on all fronts - - a rich character study, an earnest romance, and comedy. The ending seemed almost rushed and an afterthought - - but perhaps because I had fallen in love with the stories and characters, I simply did not want P&P; to end.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is timeless and never grows old.

My favorite character would be Elizabeth Bennet, or Lizzy as she is frequently reffered. She is willing to let love walk out the door because another woman is interested. Lizzy definately dislikes competition. She does make her presence known. Not rudely, but can get very defensive and in that quite comical. Lizzy presents herself very well. Like they say &quot;A first impression is a lasting impression&quot;. I picture her as tall, very beautiful, and soft spoken. Unlike others she has a beautiful smell and good taste in clothing. Lizzy reminds me a lot of Emma Woodhouse in Emma and Elinor Dashwood in Sense and Sensability. Coincidently, both of these novels were also written by Jane Austen. The reason I believe these three characters are alike is because they each either search for love for other people and over-look their own need, in the case of Emma, or they simply allow other women to appear to fill in the role in the cases of Elinor and Lizzy. Another thing that relates Lizzy, Emma and Elinor is the fact that they are all very dependent and become so in the coarse of the novels. Their love interest are not a priority and they do not depend on their parents support emotionally. Lizzy grows as and individual when she spends two weeks at their friends house with her sister Jane. This seperation allows her to grow away from her parents to take care of Jane and make some of her own decisions. While there, she does not allow herself to show many emotions toward other people and over looks emotions displayed toward her by others. Mr. Woodhouse, Emma's father, dislikes going out past their fence and that forces Emma to go out to social events on her own. In a way she becomes too dependent and doesn't realize what she may be missing out on with other characters of the book. Elinor appears to be unconcerned. Her love interest pops in and out of the novel and her true feelings are not completely revealed until the end of the novel. Her independence comes from helping her moher raise two of her sisters, Margarette and Marianne. I would reccomend this novel to someone who is enterested in branching out their reading experiences to old English romance. I enjoyed reading this book because of its interesting characters. There was always a mdest joke or disagreement, I was never bored. I also enjoyed picturing the events in my head. Some of the scenes were so beautiful. Taking place in lovely gardens you see only in your dreams, and extremely elegant mansions. Reminding me of the time I went to Mount Vernon, the home of George Washington, and Montecello, the home of Thomas Jefferson. Back then people were so polite. Rudeness was severly frowned upon especially when directed at or in the presence of a lady. Very different from today's society. It is interesting to see what it was like back then for entertainment without a television or radio. I enjoyed this novel very much as well as some of Jane Austen's other works which have been made into major motion pictures that are also very enjoyable."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I though is was a wonderful and Romantic Book.

The genre is British Romance/ Realistic Fiction. This story is about a girl Lizzy ,(or Elizabeth), who had a \\"poorer\\" family who was very prejudice against Mr.Darcy who was very wealthy.The five Bennet sisters - Lizzie,Jane,Lydia,Mary and Kitty - have been raised well aware of their mother's fixation on finding them husbands and securing set futures...and keeping the family name \\"strong.\\"However, the spirited and intelligent Elizabeth strives to live her life with a broader perspective, as encouraged by her father.Mr. Darcy ,on the other hand, lived a life of luxury with his little sister,(age 15). Mr.Darcy and his friend Mr. Bingly's sister were very prideful of themselves.Mr. Bingly fell in love with Lizzy's oldest sister,Jane, and Mr.Bingly's sister fell in love with Mr. Darcy. And Mr.Darcy fell in love with Lizzy but he was to prideful to admit it.When the good-natured Mr Bingley abruptly departs for London, devastating Jane, Lizzie holds Mr Darcy culpable for contributing to the heartbreak. But a crisis involving youngest sister Lydia soon opens Lizzie's eyes to the true nature of her relationship with Mr Darcy.It is a book about British \\"classes\\" (or ranks) in government and also society : (people were treated differently because of their \\"class\\". Many people who were poor could not even skeak or even stay in the same room with the \\"rich and famous\\" in the 1800's. It is a great peice of English literature.Each family was very close..most of the time. Lizzy's family for example, was all about marrage to a wealthy man or the family name. Mr.Darcy's \\"family\\" was more of just him and his sister who were very close. Lizzy acted the same toward everyone and \\"full of life!\\" but Mr.Darcy was only truely happy with his little sister and later, Elizabeth. Otherwise he would not dance at balls (unless he danced with Lizzy) and he hardly even laughed.In the end,(without giving it away), Mr.Darcy AND Lizzy had a differnet perspective of life and family. And, each family gets a benefit.--Jane Austen is an excellent author. She has written may books before but \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" would have to be my favorite!--"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Excellent classic novel. I loved how there are a variety of story lines going at once. It takes a few chapters to get past some of the old English language, but once you get a few chapters into it you can't put it down. It's a good novel about relationships - from family to romantic - in a setting of the early 1800's in England."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"pride and prejudice seems boring if you merely scan it, but if you read every detail then you'll find that it is a very witty, interesting, funny book. many things happen in this novel and you'll learn.this book may be confusing if you don't understand these old english expressions. i luckily knew some of them and learned the rest.pride and prejudice takes you into the world of the aristocracy in Enlgland in the early nineteenth century. You'll learn about matchmaking schemes and what was most important for a woman (marriage, of course) and how people treated their own family. I'm not talking cruelty or anything, but about pride. For ex. Mr. Darcy likes Elizabeth, but doesn't want to, since she's below his class. When Elizabeth's siter Lydia runs off with a guy their father almost disowns her in his anger. It may seem like a cruel and heartless thing to do, but when you read it, it almost seems like a perfectly sensible thing to do. women married for money and position, rarely for love. daughters were expected to obey their parents' wishes. Pride and Prejudice shows you all of this.this story takes place in England in around the early nineteenth century. here, in the upper-middle/lower first class is Mr. Bennet, a sarcastic, quiet man, his rather foolish wife, and their five daughters. Jane, the eldest, is the most kindest and prettiest. She's a goody-goody but you like her anyway, since she's also sensible. Elizabeth is the second eldest; the main character and also the wittiest and cleverest of her sisters. Mary is the quietest and most accomplished; she spends her time studying and you hear least of her in this story except when she's making some clever observation on pride or virtues from her studies.. Catherine, also called Kitty, is next, and then Lydia. They're both foolish, flirtatious, empty-headed girls who spend most of their time going to town so they can flirt with officers in the militia.enter Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy. They're best friends, both rich young men, both really handsome, both bachelors. only difference is that people hate Mr. darcy, as he's a proud, indifferent man who hates to dance and critizizes things. Mr. Bingley on the other hand is charming and amiable, loves to dance and admires Jane a lot. of course Mrs. Bennet starts scheming. She hates Mr. Darcy though, since at the beginning of the book, Mr. Darcy is heard telling Mr. Bingley at a ball that Elizabeth is not handsome enough for him to go off and dance with. Elizabeth is actually very pretty, as Jane Austen puts it, but nevertheless Mr. Darcy is a picky person. Elizabeth doesn't like Mr. Darcy's personality too much herself. they seem to be destined to scorn and be critical of each other only unfortunately for Elizabeth Mr. Darcy starts to fall head over heels for her after being stunned by Elizabeth's playfully bold, unique personality.of course they don't get married at once, otherwise this would be a very short novel. neither do jane and mr. bingley. The happy endings are delayed as a result from pride and prejudice. After all, Mrs. bennet isn't the only one who schemes. everybody does, from Mr. Darcy to Elizabeth's best friend Charlotte to Mr. Bingley's sister.this was a fabulous book and i definitely reccomend it. it depends on the reader's reading level, though."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I've been listening to several of the classics on audio book this past year and finally grabbed a copy of Pride and Prejudice. I have never read this novel before, but have seen a couple of movie versions of it and really liked the story. This version had decent reviews, so I gave it a try. I was not disappointed.The reader was Kate Reading who did an excellent job capturing the characters and what I imagined the accents for that time and place would be. I found myself drawn into this novel and was always anxious to listen once again. I normally just listen while I'm driving but found myself listening at home for a few hours.Jane Austen's writing style and characters are very captivating. I found myself recognizing some of the characteristics of the characters in people I know and liked how she showed strengths and weaknesses in the major players. I especially liked the father's subtle sense of humor. I will definitely read more of her books.I strongly recommend this audio book for anyone wishing to enjoy literature at its best. Men as well as women should like this type of romance."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I enjoyed this audiobook overall, but found the reader's voice a bit annoying. I often found it difficult to focus on what it was that she was saying. The other thing that I did not like was how many tracts were on a CD. Each CD is divided into 100 tracks. Great if your listening to it on the CD, but a nightmare if you want to put it on your favorite MP3 player."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", first published in 1813, is considered her best novel. It continues to be a fertile source of material for television and film adaptations. First marketed as a romance, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" might today be labeled a romantic comedy. Its enduring appeal lies partly in Austen's biting and still relevant social commentary on the rituals leading to marriage as practiced in Regency-era England.\\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a good wife.\\" So begins the story, as the five eligible young Bennet daughters and their scheming mother learn of the arrival in their small English village of a wealthy young man and his wealthy friends. A village dance provides the opportunity to meet the newcomers. The wealthy young man, Mr. Bingley, quickly becomes attracted to Miss Jane Bennet, the pretty, even-tempered, but reserved oldest sister. Elizabeth Bennet, the spirited and headstrong second sister, meets but immediately dislikes his seemingly haughty friend Mr. Darcy. Elizabeth is more interested in the charming young Army officer Mr. Wickham, who feeds her derogatory stories about Mr. Darcy that she is all too prepared to hear. As the relationship between Mr. Bingley and Jane deepens, Elizabeth is ardently courted by her cousin Mr Collins, an obnoxious and clueless clergyman. Elizabeth, to the despair of her mother, will not have Mr. Collins, who instead marries her spinster friend Charlotte. When Mr. Bingley suddenly departs the village without proposing to Jane, Elizabeth soon suspects the proud Mr. Darcy of curtailing the relationship based on Jane's lesser social status. While visiting Charlotte, Elizabeth is astonished to receive a proposal of marriage from Mr. Darcy, which she refuses in the most scathing terms.This failed proposal is the dramatic crux of the story. Mr. Darcy, mortified by Elizabeth's refusal and by her accusations with respect to his pride and his actions toward Jane and Mr. Wickham, writes a long letter to her. The letter, if not exactly an apology, makes clear that Wickham's accusations were false, and that Mr. Darcy's actions in separating Mr. Bingley and Jane were based on the perception that Jane was less enthusiastic about marriage than her intended partner. Elizabeth begins to realize that she has been guilty of prejudice as well, a feeling reinforced by a chance meeting with Mr. Darcy and his adoring sister at his home of Pemberly in Darbyshire. When Elizabeth's flirtatious younger sister Lydia elopes with Mr. Wickham, Mr. Darcy will have the opportunity to prove his character and his love to Elizabeth.Austen's novel contains a huge cast of well-developed characters and a series of cascading social mishaps, yet the story remains tightly focused on the relationship between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. They are attracted to each other fairly early in the story, yet are unable to appreciate each other's qualities for pride and prejudice.Underlying the humor in the social mishaps is a grim economic reality of Regency England, that failure to make a good marriage could doom middle class women like Jane and Elizabeth to a life of poverty. For Elizabeth's friend Charlotte, still single at 27, a loveless marriage to Mr Collins brings the saving grace of financial security. Lydia's elopement with Mr. Wickham not only disgraced her family but threatened to make her sisters ineligible for marriage as well. The Bennet family's lack of social standing and manners was a serious barrier to the making of good marriages, a fact less obvious to today's readers.Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" features a engaging plot, lots of excellent dialogue and two classic romantic characters in Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, a combination that holds up astonishingly well nearly two hundred years on. It is very highly recommended to fans of the various Jane Austen film productions as the entertaining source of the story."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Classic, timeless, beautiful fiction. Perfect for young and old (I've read it a dozen times, but it was also a great gift for my niece to introduce her to classic literature)."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is Jane Austen's most popular novel and it is remarkable that it has sustained such a high popularity 200 years after it was originally published. The primary plot of the story follows Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy in a highly contentious courtship that neither wants in the beginning but both can scarcely resist by the end. Other subplots involve her sister Jane and Mr. Bingley in a courtship of their own and the various doings of family and friends. This novel is almost certainly the one where Austen best displays her sharp-edged wit both through Elizabeth's dialogue and in the narrative voice describing some of the characters and their actions.The two main characters are probably as well fleshed out as any you are likely to see. They are certainly complex and multi-layered and they both grow and change somewhat as the book progresses. The supporting characters are considerably less deep and are almost uniformly caricatures more than anything else. Some are good and kind like Jane and Mr. Bingley, and others are ridiculous and vain like Mrs. Bennet but none are remotely as substantial as Darcy and Elizabeth. So, does this ruin the book? Hardly. Pride and Prejudice is as much a satire of the time it was written as it is a romantic drama and these secondary characters are all part of the tapestry that allowed Miss Austen to skewer her contemporaries so effectively. There are a few times where I thought a character's behavior was over-the-top but the overall story is so riveting and the book so compelling that I just can't find any serious fault with it. Pride and Prejudice is deserving of its reputation and I highly recommend it to Austen fans and newcomers alike."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I really enjoyed the sense of humour and the plot. The action is developing very slow so if you are not fond of this kind of a plot you might not like it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I know that my daughter will always remember getting this lovely book on her 18th birthday. A beautifully bound and illustrated edition of a classic story."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It took me a while to read it, about 2 months, because it's definitely not fast paced. I was glad I had seen the movie first because it made the whole thing easier to understand.Mr. Darcy is \\"pride\\" and Elizabeth Bennett is \\"prejudice\\". These two are made for each other, unbeknown to themselves. This is essentially the story of how they fall in love, with lots of twists and turns.I really like Mr. Darcy. He is the perfect gentleman. He is readily willing to admit his own faults, when they are brought to his knowledge. He also doesn't retaliate when rejected by Elizabeth and accused of things he didn't do or that are misunderstood.Elizabeth is also wonderful. She is doubtful about people and quite cynical. I really like that about her. It makes for some great banter between Darcy and herself.My favorite part of the book is when Elizabeth see Darcy at Pemberly. This is where I think she begins to fall in love with him. Pemberly is where he is at home- where is is truly himself. I would probably be charmed by him too!This book took a little commitment to get through, but once I got into it, I couldn't wait to see what happened next, even though I already knew the story. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys Regency England."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I can't believe it took me until my mid-thirties to read this book. What is equally astonishing is the elequence Miss Austin was able to write this book at the young age of 21. Let me first speak to the well-done character development. The author does a great job of creating likeable, interesting characters. You have to love Elizabeth Bennet and her boldness. You must also love: Mr. Bennet's wonderful sense of humor, Mr. Collins' silly behavoir and what a haughty b*tch Mrs. de Bourgh is. Secondly, the author is very crafty in unfolding a plot in which the reader fully understands how their could have been lots of misunderstandings between Miss Bennet and Mr. Darcy. Very well-written and entertaining. Don't wait as long as I did. Read this book!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Arguably Jane Austen's best work, Pride and Prejudice encompasses all the notable themes of her time- class, family, marriage, love and of course, pride. And Prejudice.The story has been dissected, narrated, adapted and recycled about a thousand times. Yet, for a plotline that is relatively simple and quite predictable, this book remains eternal. Jane Austen's vivid and witty prose makes you wish the book could be longer and that Elizabeth and Darcy's courtship would stretch out fifty (or hundred with Austen's descriptive style) more pages!This is one of the best novels ever written. A classic that is invaluable and timeless!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice was one of the best novels that I have ever read. It was not only a touching love story, but also an accurate reflection of the Victorian society in that era. The story evolved heavily on the complications among different classes. The pride within each character and prejudice between them further enriched the novel. Some characters, such as Darcy and Lizzie, found themselves fighting among their pride, prejudice and their affections for each other revealed an idea that true love outweighs anything and everything. Each character in the novel contrasted significantly in terms of their characteristics. We can recall these contrasts among the five Bennet sisters, Mr. and Mrs. Bennets, and Darcy and Bingley. Another interesting point revealed by Jane Austen is that characters with similar characteristic attracts. We can see this through the two loving couples, Jane and Bingley, Lizzie and Darcy.These complications and challenges that each character had to struggle within themselves made the novel Pride and Prejudice a great masterpiece."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"In comparison to Tess of the d'Urbervilles, Pride and Prejudice is a refreshing romance comedy which brings to life the humor of 18th century society. Jane Austen's style is so stellar. She leaves nothing unsettled or unhappy. They way each character is tied in with the plot is amazing, from Mr. Collins and charlotte's marriage, which brings Elizabeth to lady Catherine and Darcy, to the Gardeners transaction with Darcy during the chase for Lydia, proving Darcy's love for Elizabeth. Jane is a sweet character and Bingly is her perfect match. Darcy and Elizabeth as well are the epitome of romance. Elizabeth cannot marry anyone she cannot love, and to her, love is someone who she can connect with on all levels. When she and Darcy fight, it should only be taken as a sign of their compatibility because she is not afraid to answer him and he enjoys it. Lydia and Mrs. Bennet are incredibly irritating, however they do add to the satirical style of the novel, as Mrs. bennet's sole desire in life has to do with marriage, her own and her daughters. She and Mr Bennet do not share a true love because he married her for her beauty, and now must learn to live with her stupidity. Lydia as well makes a mistake in who she marries. She is too naive to understand that Wickham had no desire to marry her in the first place. She considers the whole ordeal a game, not realizing the gravity of the situation she has put her family in, ruin and disgrace. Bingly's sisters take on the &quot;wicked step sister&quot; act in trying to keep Bingly from Jane and Elizabeth from Darcy. Charlotte Lucas is an extraordinary character simply because her theories on love are profound and true for the time period. Good book, I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"After reading many excellent, yet somewhat depressing novels, Austen&#8217;s Pride and Prejudice, came as refreshing and uplifting treat. More of a powerful weapon than the extraordinary novel that it is, Austen uses the book to fiercely criticize nineteenth century society and the essence of human nature while still managing to create an extraordinary and captivating plot.Beginning at the novel&#8217;s outset, the reader becomes a puppet at the mercy of Austen&#8217;s ability to evoke any emotions she desires within her readers.By creating a diction and syntax unique to each character Austen holds the reader within her grasp. All of the characters are very different from each other in many aspects; this creates grounds for conflict and essentially propels the plot.Also, each of the characters is somewhat of an extremity of a certain characteristic that most people possess. Mrs. Bennet is the spoiled side of our personalities, Mr. Darcy the proud side, Lydia the irresponsible side, Jane the quiet side, Mary the feminist side, and so on.The novel encompasses main elements from many different genres of books such as romance, humor, adventure, suspense, and tragedy, which make for a very entertaining read. Read it when you are feeling down or worn out, you&#8217;ll find yourself believing that fairytales do come true."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"After reading many excellent, yet somewhat depressing novels, Austen's Pride and Prejudice, came as refreshing and uplifting treat.

Read it when you are feeling down or worn out, you'll find yourself believing that fairytales do come true."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen masterfully weaves an endearing love story, with cosmic irony, and a keen awareness for social distinctions, which took us through a colorful journey of mind, body, and soul. Her humor shines through the biting sarcasm of Mr. Bennet's expected, yet amusing remarks about Mrs. Bennet's &quot;nerves,&quot; and his daughter's suitors, namely Mr. Collins. This unctuous character also provided us with a few laughs by quietly portraying the absurdity of society's emphasis on &quot;connections&quot; with the upper class.Another part of the novel, which we greatly enjoyed, was the blooming romance between Darcy and Elizabeth. Though their union was much anticipated, we were kept on our toes by the many twist and turns it took throughout the novel. At one point, we were greatly disappointed with Darcy's overbearing arrogance when he made it explicitly clear to Elizabeth that it was against his own will to love her. But then we were heart warmed by his kindness to her and the Gardiners at the Pemberley estate, exemplifying his true character.Aside from its humor and romance, this novel also prides itself in its vivid illustrations of class structures of early 19th century England. Austen clearly depicts the importance and influence of the social classes on every aspect of life, predominantly marriage, wealth, education, and values. One scene, which we believed to be a great example of Austen's comprehensive knowledge of the social classes, is when Lady Catherine rudely confronts Elizabeth on Darcy's proposal to marry her, all the while mocking her estate, her family, and her life. Yet, Elizabeth once again proves her superior attitude and strength as an independent woman, and takes Lady Catherine's comments with wisdom and maturity.Truly a classic, Pride and Prejudice exemplifies a sincere love that breaks social boundaries. Throughout its 150 years of publication Pride and Prejudice has remained a cornerstone of the literary world, and we recommend it to everyone. And beware; this book ends with a bang, in more ways than one."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"i absolutely adore this book. i have read it 4 times and i would recommend it to anyone. it has interesting characters, a very complex and engaging plot, and you learn alot about english society during austin's time. jane austin is a very gifted writer. i have also read sense and sensibility and presuasion, both very good books, but pride and prejudice will always be my favorite."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"When i read this book for the first time, i just thought that it was just same as the other love story.But after i read twice and three times, i found that it's obviously different from any other romantic books.It's the only one book for reflect of women's life in society.and i really want to be a character like lizzy:)I think that it's the only book to express feminism."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I loved the book! Jane Austen is truly a genius. I really don't know how she makes the book so interesting! I mean, the characters aren't throwing themselves at each other, and there aren't any viciuos fights or anything like that. In those times, everybody had to be calm and acceptible. But still the book is so captivating! You're just dying for Elizabeth (main character) to fall in love with Mr. Darcy! You really get into the book.Now I've started to use words like handsome and agreeable in daily speech!!But seriously, it's worth it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice was a good book, I really like it. Pride and Prejudice basically was about marriages. In old England, a man who has good fortune must need a good manner and charming wife, and a grown girl who has good education, high manner, a litter beauty must in want of a husband. That is why the whole story happen. In the author Miss Austen's book, she used very decent and nice words, and she described the emotion of the characters truely and let people feel the characters really existed."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a classic, no doubt about it, but why should anyone read it now? Austen's humor and satire are a bit understated in today's world, but for the reader who pays attention to the details and to whitty dialog, should get a kick out of numerous scenes throughout the novel. Another gift that Austen has is being able to portray intense emotions without having to spell those emotions out. I first read this book as a freshman in high school and I didn't finish it until the second attempt. After that I forgot most of what I read and then had to reread it about four years later and now read it every year just to remind myself what a classic book is really like."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I note with interest that every one-star review posted here comes either from a male or an unidentified &quot;reader&quot; . . . I'm not especially surprised, and to the males, don't blame yourselves if you can't penetrate Jane Austen (it is undoubtedly more appealing to the female mind), although I must vouch for P&amp;P and pity those who pass over this excellent novel. The whole charm of the story lies in the high vocabulary which Elizabeth, Jane, Darcy and the rest employ, and the wonderful language creates a rapid succession of wit, romance, and observation on human absurdity, in style. ~~~~ It's hard to understand how people can find this book dull, for the very first chapter rolls out a lively discussion between Mr. and Mrs. Bennet. In my opinion, Pride and Prejudice only gets better as you go on; I admit to once finishing the novel and promptly rereading it one day later. Also to smiling for one week straight, for Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. ~~~~ Please don't come to Jane Austen only to criticize her subject matter-- every author has a style and a realm of experience which make their books unique. If you think the young ladies' endless pursuits of wealthy marriages to be old-fashioned and petty, they are! But Jane Austen crafts the novel with a skill and wit that lets the novel at once both expose how ludicrous that English society was and yet create lively and very human characters you have to love; and therein lies its charm. Pride and Prejudice is a lovely combination of sly humor, exasperation, and romance that make it one of my favorites. I hope it will be one of yours too-- don't give up on Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy before you even know them! And understand Jane Austen for the talented authoress she is, whether you think her settings and period portrayals deplorably dull, pathetically petty, or (I hope!) cleverly charming. ~~~~ I think that most people, when they read P&amp;P, either love it or hate it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is an excellent book!

I found myself in complete suspense to find out if darcy and elizabeth got together. Jane Austen combines 19th century wit with romance to create a book that you just can't put down. Elizabeth Bennet is a heroine that cannot be forgotten; her wit and sense are apparent throughout the whole story. Darcy is a mysteriously romantic character who, despite his cutting remarks, remains irrestistable. The reading itself can be a little uneventful sometimes, but Jane Austen saves it with a sarcastic comment from Mr. Bennet, or a witty remark from Elizabeth. This is my favorite book ever and i recommend it to anybody who can appreciate the 1800s style of writing."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This was the first Jane Austen book I read and after reading some of her other works, it is still my favorite Austen of all time.

You can feel Mr. Darcy's anguish as he watches Lizzie from afar, and you squirm in your chair knowing that Lizzie despises Darcy because she thinks that he abhors her. Mr. and Mrs. Bennet make you laugh, and you can just feel the embarrassment that the younger sisters bring to the older ones. This is the most amazing story, and I do not feel that it is in the least an ordinary one. It is a hold-your-breath romance with comedy, intrigue, a little suspense, and coincidence.

At first the book runs slowly, sometimes getting off the point and losing interest, but in a whole, when you finish reading the last page, you know you've read something great. The book truly tells a tale of pride and prejudice. Along with the many other stories involving other characters, the main interset is about two people- Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. Elizabeth along with her sister Jane and others are all finding their way into marriage, when two men Mr. Darcy and Mr. Bingley come along. Mr. Darcy at first appearence is a crude proud man who does not involve himself in social confrantation, while Mr. Bingley comes to be a charming well wittted man. The story continues on with marriage proposals, refusals, and devious scandals. In Pride and Prejudice, many characters develop. Jane Austin creates their stories very well but sometimes as I was reading, I felt that there were too many people and I found it hard to keep up and get involved with it. But in a way, that was also the beauty of the story.So if you are intersted in this book, you have to be willing to be patient. But it will be worth it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"My favorite chapter in the novel Pride and Prejudice is chapter 16 of volume III (or chapter 58) because Elizabeth finally accepts Darcy?s marriage proposal. It amazed me how she was still able to say yes after she was insulted in every way possible especially after disliking him so much in the beginning of the novel.This book is appropriate for anyone who is able to appreciate well-written literature. Anyone would enjoy reading this book, from teenagers to adults.One literary device I appreciated was epigram, which is a brief, clever, and usually memorable statement. An example of this would be ?It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in wants of a wife? which is found on the first page of the novel. The entire novel was based on this quote. Mrs. Bennet wanted to get all five of her daughters married before her husband died.I liked the novel. I found Elizabeth?s romance with Darcy intriguing. It was interesting how in the beginning she rejected his proposal and disliked him, and at the end she marries him."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"You will find Jane Austen in high school classrooms, as inspiration for contemporary movies and fiction (Clueless, Bridget Jones' Diary), and at a book club or two. Otherwise, she is not part of us: Her laser-eyes, scathing commentary about society, and merciless fun at the expense of over-the-top piety are missing. In our current Press-Release era, where ads blanket our cities, and celebrities alter their image every other week, Jane would have a field day-- her observations would have been invaluable, her sharp humor liberating.\\"Pride and Prejudice\\"-- the story of independent-minded Elizabeth Bennet's journey to a happy marriage and her rousing rebellion against the stultifying and stale social system of 19th-Century England-- is an adrenaline-rush of a book.As Elizabeth battles the defenders of society (her marriage-obsessed mother, a condescending suitor, and several members of the \\"upper-class\\" trying to stem her promising relationship with the affluent and handsome Mr. Darcy) we sample a world where family, money, and class dictate your friends and suitors.When Elizabeth and Darcy move to his stunning home, they leave the hostility of an uncaring society behind. Through rebellion and stubbornness, they have found Eden."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice centers around the Bennett family, mainly Elizabeth Bennett, the second eldest of five sisters. Throughout the novel, family relations, economical issues, humiliation of making a mistake, and falling in love are thoroughly described amongst all of the characters. Three of the five sisters marry in the book while encountering pride and prejudice of position or status. The eldest daughter of the Bennetts, Jane, falls in love and marries a man named Charles Bingley. She is the second of the three daughters that marry during the story because of a delay caused by Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy who had initially made Bingley think Jane does not love him because of her poor economical status and family relations. However, it is also Darcy who later convinces Bingley to finally marry Jane out of his own love for Janeas younger sister Elizabeth. After both Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth overcome their pride and prejudice against each other, they are also married. Elizabeth is the third daughter to marry. The first daughter to marry is Lydia, who foolishly elopes with the untrustworthy George Wickham whose primary intention was not to marry her, but who eventually agrees to the marriage on terms agreed to by Darcy and Bingley. The novel describes the pride and prejudice that all of the characters manage to overcome in order to live contentedly.Although the language used in Pride and Prejudice was difficult for a fourteen year-old, as I kept reading it became clearer and easier to understand the 19th century speech. The womenaes rights that Austen presented were beyond her time and I developed great respect for her. The message about overcoming pride and prejudice and marrying not for money but for love was very powerful and I felt that it was appropriate to be read for a humanities class because it was closely related to the topics we have been going over in class. Overall, I thought that Pride and Prejudice was a very well written and entertaining novel."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Originally entitled First Impression, Jane Austen's novel, Pride and Prejudice is a sophisticated love story, elegantly portrayed during the 18th century. Satirizing the Victorian woman's quest for an ideal husband, Austen's witty humor provides much amusement for the reader. The complex plot and the dramatic lives of the Bennet family enable the reader to become engrossed within Austen's masterpiece.The points of view of the novel are shown through Austen's usage of the limited omniscient as well as first person accounts, which are shown through personal letters of the characters. Her unique literary style enables the reader to better understand the mood and dramatic emotions of the characters. The letters intertwined throughout the book, advance the plot and greatly invoke the interest of the reader.Although all the characters contribute to the entertaining quality of the novel, the most auspicious were indeed Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy. With Elizabeth's out-spoken manners and Darcy's arrogant yet shy persona, both characters were quick to judge the other based upon their first impressions. As the novel progressed, Elizabeth's humor and charm, not only won over the reader but Darcy as well. We also enjoyed Darcy's evolution from a shy and rather self righteous aristocrat, into a kind, endearing, as well as understanding man. His interactions with Lizzy provided conflict and laughter. Mrs. Bennet's \\"nerves\\" also served as our source of amusement.This intellectual novel entails deception, love, comedy, and above all, a glimpse into 18th century society. We enjoyed the conclusion, in which Austen meets our satisfaction by tying all the loose ends together. Despite it's title, the characters of the novel overcome prejudice, but never lost their pride."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have wanted to read the classics of English literature since I did not do so during college. Because I am not in college, I do not have any need to have an edition with critical essays and copious notes about different versions of the book. A simple book with the story in front of me was all that was necessary. Wordsworth Classics filled the need quite satisfactorily.This edition has the complete text and not much else. The introduction has some historical information about the author and about the publishing of the book. There are only two pages of this. The margins are small, so taking notes within the text will prove difficult. It is easy to carry around and seems to put up with a moderate amount of abuse.The particular story starts with the famous/infamous line \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\\" Given this, and given Jane Austen, you know that you are in for a tour of marriage in old England. Austen's sketches of her characters are so well done that you can't help but hear the dialogue in your head in the voice's of people you are familiar with. Jane Austen understands how people work and is a very astute observer of human nature.In these pages you will follow the trials and tribulations of Jane and Elizabeth Bennett, Mr. Bingley, Mr. Darcy, and the rest of their families and acquaintances. The read is well worth it. The reading is engaging and will keep you turning pages. I would heartily recommend this book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is Jane Austen at her best. It is witty, well-written, and captivating. I would recommend this book to anyone, even those who tend to dislike literature from this period."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I had always meant to read this book, but never got around to it until I saw the movie &quot;You've Got Mail.&quot; It was fun to see the how the movie plot follows the theme of the book Meg Ryan's character loved so much. I am a fan of the British classics and found Jane Austen much easier to read than the Brontes, but not quite as passionate. There is plenty of humor as well."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"For some reason I had never read this book. It was on our high school reading list but I made another choice. Once you get past the language and immerse yourself in the story I t was hard to put down."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It as a truth universally acknowledged that Jane Austen, in possession of a good novel must be in want of a reader.Undeniably one of the greatest authors in classic literature, Austen begins her classic masterpiece, Pride and Prejudice, with her renown truth. Ironic, amusing and romantic, Pride and Prejudice still offers many delights for the modern reader. Whether it's flighty Lydia, brooding Darcy or the imperial Lady Catherine, you can fall in love again and again with her diverse cast of characters.Pride and Prejudice is essentially seen through the eyes of Elizabeth Bennett, second in a line of five daughters, gifted with a dry wit and clever conversation. The novel primarily follows her and her sisters movement though the social sphere of the 19th century, though social climbing, manners, and the strict regulation of \\"proper behavior\\". When Jane Bennett falls for Mr. Bingley, the fur starts to fly and Lizzy and Jane are forced to fight for each other and for the men they love.While Austen's text captivates and seduces, this edition constantly diverts the reader with it's countless footnotes. While these could be beneficial to a reader unfamiliar with British Society, the definition of \\"Militia\\" and its explanation of the significance of Gretna Green bordered on insulting. Though the quotes and opinions on the text in the back of the book were interesting and refreshing, the sheer magnitude of footnotes (generally explaining something well-known or easily inferred) distract greatly from Austen's stunning success.While Pride and Prejudice in itself is a work deserving far more than five stars, this Barnes & Noble edition cannot qualify such a rating."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I was looking for a hard back book and was happy to have found one, when it came I was very disappointed that it was a bed book. I had never heard of the bed books before and I can't get used to the sideways printing. Amazon should make it clearer that you are buying a bed book and not a normal book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"In my opinion, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is Jane Austen's best work. I think it is one of the best books ever written, and one of the very few perfectly told stories I have ever had the pleasure of reading.\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" focuses on the Bennett family --- Jane, a quiet and demure woman whose angelic countenance matches her sweet and giving personality; Elizabeth, a level-headed lady with slightly more temper than her older sister, and a level of good judgment that sets her apart from other women of her set; Mary, a bookish girl with little talent to speak of; Kitty, a weak-minded creature who allows her flighty youngest sister to rule her life; Lydia, a hopeless flirt with no thought for anything other than fun and men; Mr. Bennett, who likes to retreat into his library and bury his nose in books; and Mrs. Bennett, a foolish woman whose primary goal in life is to get all her daughters married off to rich and handsome men. A simple family living in the country whose lives are turned upside down by the arrival of a wealthy young man into their neighborhood.Mr. Bingley, their new neighbor, instantly takes a liking to Jane, the oldest sister, while his best friend, the proud Mr. Darcy, spends his time trying NOT to like Elizabeth. As Mr. Bingley gently pursues Jane, he finds he gets little or no help from his friend Mr. Darcy or his own sisters, Louisa and Caroline --- who schemes for Mr. Darcy's hand herself.Set against a vivid backdrop in various locations around the country, Austen covers all kinds of English society. Her colorful, lively characters take this story all over the place, having their own adventures and learning about themselves and about life. Jane learns that not EVERYONE is sweet and charming. Elizabeth learns that first impressions can be misleading. And Lydia experiences a dangerous kind of life that should never have been embarked upon, and which lands her in a very sticky situation.Jane Austen has a keen sense of the ridiculous and loves to poke fun at her characters. \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" has one of the most delightful array of interesting characters ever to grace the pages of a novel --- the oh-so-charming Mr. Wickham, whose past is a mystery; the Gardiners, Elizabeth's aunt and uncle, who see much more than they let on, and understand its significance; Charlotte Lucas, Elizabeth's friend; Mr. Collins, the Bennetts' cousin, an oily clergyman who marries Miss Lucas after Elizabeth categorically refuses him; Lady Catherine de Bourgh, aunt of Mr. Darcy, a proud and unpleasant woman who likes to rule over and frighten others.Austen tells her story with the best mix of drama, wit, charm, humor, intrigue, and romance I have ever seen. The story is writted seamlessly, unfolds brilliantly and ends perfectly. The entire novel is beautifully written, with an elegant, charming style as only Austen can write. It's the perfect addition to any library!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austin is a very interesting novel. It not only tells but also, shows what young women went though in the 18th century. Elizabeth Bennett faces many expirences that women go through today. From getting maried to dealing with friends, family, and men from a day to day basis. Elizabeth has seven sisters who are also going through the same expirences. She is closest to her oldest sister Jane. They seem to understand each other the best. The mother is the most interesting charatcter out of the whole novel because she wants the best for her daughters and tries to live their lives for all seven of them. Elizabeth does not let her mother do this and in the end her mother disowns her. This novel teaches what is worth in life and what is not.You should only do what is right for your self and on one else.This novel gives you hope that in any life you can become your own self and not be criticized for your own actions or how you think. This is a great novel and if you read it I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I love Pride & Prejudice. It's one of my all time favorite books. Therefore, and because it was free, it was the first book I downloaded for my Kindle. I have to say I found some typos in the edition. I'm not sure who's uploading these things but I don't like not being able to trust the content."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I love my Kindle, but was hopeing to read a famous classic without any editing, meaning reduction, of the text. This edition is so poorly edited as to be confusing at some points, when, for instance, suddenly we are reading about a previously unintroduced Miss King, who is mentioned and then forgotten. There are no descriptions of clothing, very little of scenery, none really of homes/estates. The book consists of conversations, which are terrific due to the author's skill, and the bridges that get us to those. How can I get an unedited, unabridged copy of the book? That should be made clear when we order these \\"free\\" books: they are vastly edited. If that's not what you want, don't get these."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"P&P is a book I come back to every couple of years. I first met Mr. Darcy and Miss Elizabeth Bennet when I was a young teen. I never tire of this book. For anyone who has only seen the movie, I urge you to read the book as well. Nobody writes like Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is considered a \\"classic\\" for many reasons. For one thing, it deals with themes that are still very relevant in our society today. The ideas of pride and family relationships are both important factors in every day life today, and help bring the book to life. Also, the characters in the novel have many character traits that are exhibited almost 175 years after the book was originally published. Aloof, rich people, flirtations, young women, and social, eligible bachelors are common types of people even today. By incorporating characters such as Mr. Darcy, Lydia, and Mr. Bingley into her story, Jane Austen has kept the book popular for hundreds of years. The plot is very interesting and keeps the reader engaged from start to finish. A family living in the British countryside that is almost continuously worried about marriage may not sound like an intriguing plot to many people, but in fact the plot is fascinating.Somebody who read the book might be a little bit disappointed by the fact that it was written 175 years ago. This affects many aspect of the novel and radically changes how the book is written. Although most of the vocabulary and style is easy to understand, every now and then there is a small section that is hard to understand. In terms of themes, the obsession of young people with marriage is not as apparent in today's society as much as it used to be. Finally, various decisions in grammar and punctuation may make the book more difficult for some people to read. At some points in the novel, such as letters or other dialogues, the whole page may be filled without any paragraph breaks. This makes for a more intimidating reading experience and may serve as a deterrent to people who are considering reading the book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I loved this book, everyone had kept telling me to read it and I kept putting it off, then I saw the film and I read the book and I loved it. The language was a bit difficult to begin with, but I soon got used to it and it was well worth the effort. The book's very funny and the story's excellent, all in all a must read.If you want more, there's a book out called Darcy's Diary by Amanda Grange and it tells the story from Darcy's side, so you see the things you don't see in Pride and Prejudice, like Darcy going to London to track Wickham down, and it also goes on after the wedding, so all in all another good read. But make sure you read Pride and Prejudice whatever you do!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is and will always remain to be an all time favorite romantic comedy in the history of American literature. The story never fails to emphasize on the ethical manners played out in the 19th Century English society, an existence in which wealth, social status, and love prevailed lucidly in pithy marriages. It also differentiates with our human behavior in the modern world, how much we have changed in a sense.The emotions and intentions of the characters in this book are beautifully written and brought to life as they are living life to the rules of respect and manners. I highly recommend this book to all ages interested in reading romantic classics."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I adore this book.

That means that not only is it telling an entertaining tale, it is also calling to something deep in the readers' souls. Examination of available books shows that at least a dozen sequels to it have been written; I have reviewed one and will soon review another, but I am not going to buy and read all of them. Therefore I might be missing something I would enjoy.But what I am not missing is this: Jane Austen believed in sense and sobriety. She believed that the happiest marriage was one between a man and woman who were intellectually and spiritually in tune with one another.To the readers, I say: Go thou and do likewise. Read the book. Then do what Elizabeth and Jane wold approve, and you will find yourself happier in the long run than those who ignore the principles Pride and Prejudice is meant to exhibit."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I've been a fan of Austen for 20 years and this is one of my favorites.

Jane Austin gives details of the characters' thoughts that make the story, especially the development of the two main characters, convincing. The other characters are amusing and vivid. The dialogue is delicious with treats like, \\"Is not general incivility the very essence of love?\\"In my Kindle version random line breaks occur.

I actually don't mind the rest of the techs as long as I didn't have to flip through pages on the subway."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is Austen's second,most well know,and my favorite novel.The story starts when a rich young man named Mr. Bingley rents a house in the neighborhood.

I have studied it. I have checked all the definitions that I didn't know. She has used rich vocabulary that adds so much. If you don't check the meaning, you will lose on the context of it. You need to think constantly and be alert while reading. Words put weight on the meaning that when you're tired, you might not understand fully what the author has meant. Understanding its meaning gives you so much pleasure.The author states the situation the character is in by finding the perfect word to describe it. The words chosen were so perfectly used in given situations.Some dialogues may seem unnatural of the words spoken. Did people really talk this way? But after getting deeper into her work, you just get used to it like to the commodity in everyday life.I loved in Jane's work the development of the characters. It is extraordinary and so complex. The author has captured in most not an ordinary way of life back then making it in every sense very realistic.The feelings of being modest, shy, and lacking self-confidence when in love were perfectly presented. Readers who look for romance won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I sent my niece this book as a primer for the Jane Austen world.

The look and feel of the book is beautiful. It's an extremely gratifying read, a delight for the senses, and the appendix is a wonderful essay by Tony Tanner, the original Penguin Classics edition's introduction. While it is lengthy, it actually doesn't get tedious at all and is highly informative and insightful. The new introduction, while I haven't read it fully yet, I believe will prove to be equally revealing. The notes are well-balanced, neither vague nor overwhelming- I've looked at annotated versions of Pride and Prejudice that sucked all the joy out of the story with notes that covered half of each page! Anyway, this edition is absolutely delightful, and I can't wait to purchase Wuthering Heights and Sense and Sensibility in the same edition, and possibly more."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I loved this book! Once I started reading, I could not stop.It has a similar plot line to Sense & Sensibility, but S&S; moves very sloooooww. P&P; was much more enjoyable & interesting.

But overall it was understandable.As some people have stated, I did notice a lot of typos in the free Kindle version. It was annoying to have such a thing, but it was free & didnt make me love the story any less."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is undoubtedly one of the most beloved classic novels in history -- it's had countless adaptations, sequels and homages lavished on it over the years.And Jane Austen's grand opus is still beloved for a good reason. While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of a halfway decent marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...Reading \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Lizzie and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Jane Austen about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).The only real problem: Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.But despite that formality, Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other. She also wrote some unbelievably sharp-edged dialogue with plenty of witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But Austen also weaves in startlingly romantic moments between them (\\"No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting\\").It's hard to imagine a better fictional couple than Lizzie and Darcy, despite their rocky start (a major-league snub at a dance). Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways, with quick minds and even quicker tongues. Darcy is a selfish, rather haughty man man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.It also has a solid supporting cast: the painfully practical Charlotte Lucas, slimy clerics, virtuous-looking rakes, sisters ranging from saintly to snobby, and the lovable Mr. Bingley and perpetually optimistic Jane. Lizzie's family also adds plenty of color to the story, including the screechy and hilariously mercurial Mrs. Bennett and the barb-tongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love. An absolute must-read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"One of my favorite Authors of all time if your looking for a classical romance this is a must read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"So...what to say about this. Well, it surely is a girly book since the majority of the story is about romance. There are also themes of family, marriage, society, class, etc. The story was pretty good but boring in some parts. However, the ending really left me wanting a sequel. It made me want to know about *spoiler* the life after Elizabeth and Darcy's marriage. I also wanted to know how Darcy's sister will turn out and if she will also find her fated one. Mr. and Mrs. Bennet's situation in life is also greatly altered. It would have been interesting to see how they will get along and if there would be any rekindling of past fires or not. The two unmarried sisters can also be a topic of exploration, especially Kitty seeing as to how civil and improved she's becoming. I will miss Elizabeth and Darcy's witty conversations and I would have been delighted to read about a jealous Darcy. A sequel would have been perfect. Seriously, it would have been fun to read about their life after marriage and if they were going to have any kids or not. Then maybe there would be someone new in town who would intimidate Darcy and fight for Elizabeth's affection, which of course, can only belong to Darcy. Ohh! The possibilities are endless! How I wish for a sequel. Before anyone else writes one though, I will have to be satisfied with my imagination. I am aware of the fanfiction sequels out there, but there will never be a true sequel to this book. I'm also curious as to whether Elizabeth would conform to the upper class or not. Wonders if she improves her piano and other skills like the arts. And their kids.....would they be more like Elizabeth or Darcy? Hmm...."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I had borrowed this CD set from my local library, and the narration by Nadia May is so wonderful, I had to buy a copy for myself.

Humorous, witty and entertaining, it is well worth your time!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It is said that a good work of fiction represents the ways and manners of the people during the period when it was written. Being the case, I have a number of observations:1. The conversations feel that the parties involved are having an oratorical debate. It was an art in itself. Obviously, nobody speaks this way anymore. The language was so lyrical, very personally addressed, either face to face or through a proper letter.2. It was a time when ladies were expected (as dictated by good manners, decorum and propriety) to have knowledge of the arts and music. In contrast to the present time, parents and elders lovingly cultivate/develop the natural talents of their children. For those with no natural inclination, it is openly accepted as such, and never forced. At least this is what I have observed in general.3. It is a good thing that women of the present time share an equal footing with men (at least in many parts of the world), that they are not just relegated to marriage when they become of age. Imagine being set for marriage the moment a girl turns 16, with the mother almost in panic if her daughter is not engaged by the time she's twenty!4. What a closed and judgmental society it was during that time. The elopement of one daughter to an \\"undeserving\\" man ruined not only her reputation but that of her whole family as well, in the process making her other sisters almost unfit for marriage.5. Fifty miles of good road equals half a day's journey by carriage! Thank God for the automobile!I enjoyed this novel a lot, though it took some time for me to read because of the lyrical prose, which I am not so used to, and also the typos. Just the same, lyrical prose and all, it brought about the same excited feelings as when I read modern chick-lit fiction. I would have rated this a complete 5-star if not for the many typos in the Kindle edition."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I'm reviewing the Penguin Classics edition rather than the content of the novel itself (which is wonderful). The cover is beautifully decorated, nicely textured, and sturdy, the introduction and notes are interesting but not obtrusive, the paper is high quality, the print is very readable (the font is not too small like some other editions of classic literature), and the colored ribbon adds a touch of refinement as well as utility. I've bought the other Austen novels in this Penguin series. They're among the most handsome books on my library shelf. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a novel to be read time and again to descipher new innuendos and witty remarks. The characters are beautifully crafted and the relationships they form complex. The novel remains an important social and historical commentary. It is an easy and charming book to read for young adults and rich and complex for those who want to re-read it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride & Prejudice by Jane Austen has been made into several movies, and remained apart of High School reading lists for decades. It is a heart warming book that discusses family dynamics, true love, money, social order, first impressions and reputation.The story is told primarily in dialogue. This is perhaps why it has been able to be adapted into several movies. It is the story of the Bennet family and their romantic entanglements. Jane Bennet and her relationship with Mr. Bingley, as well as Eizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy. The interactions between Miss Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy are simply priceless. The famous proposal scene, and the line, \\"You are the last man in the world I could ever marry!\\" make this book an absolute gem.The only flaw with this book is the under developed characters. Only Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy go through changes. Even though the characters are under developed they are unforgettable. From Lady Catherine to Mr. Collins they are all very different. Read this book you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is one of those novels which most people know the plot and the characters even if they haven't read the book. For myself, I had not read it in a long time, and I had also not seen any of the movies made using its plot, with the exception of the musical \\"Bride and Prejudice\\" a few years ago. I finally made time for it, and it was better than I had remembered. This was the second of Austen's novels to be published (published on January 28th, 1813), though the original novel (titled \\"First Impressions\\") was written between 1796 and 1797. There is no way to determine how much of the original novel remains and how much was rewritten, but clearly the two dealt on a larger scale with the some of the same themes.The main character of the story is Elizabeth Bennet who lives with her parents and her four sisters in the fictional town of Meryton. Elizabeth is the second eldest of the sisters after Jane. Outside of the Bennets, there is a large cast of characters including the three Bingley's, brother and two sisters, Mr. Collins, The Darcy's, Lady Catherine and her daughter, Colonel Fitzwilliam, the Lucases, Mr. Wickham, and the Gardiner's who are Elizabeth's aunt and uncle. The novel is told in three volumes, the first covers the period at Meryton where most of the key characters meet for the first time, the second covers the period after Bingley leaves Meryton unexpectedly along with those who came with him, and covers the period up to Elizabeth's visit to Mr. Darcy's home know as Pemberley, and the last covers the visit to Pemberley right through to the marriages and beyond.There are several plots running through the volumes. There is the relationship between Bingley and Jane, which Mr. Darcy tries to put an end to, along with the help of Mr. Bingley's sisters. There is Mr. Collins attempts to marry either Jane or Elizabeth, but ending up with Charlotte Lucas. There is the relationship between Mr. Wickham and Mr. Darcy as well as between their families. There is Lydia's scandalous running off in volume three. But by far the mail story line is the relationship between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy.In volume one, Mr. Darcy arrives as the guest of Mr. Bingley. Mr. Darcy's prideful manner results in a negative first impression with Elizabeth whose pride is hurt by his attitude and she develops her own prejudice against Mr. Darcy as a result. Mr. Darcy becomes intrigued with Elizabeth, but her own negative impression of him is reinforced by stories told by Mr. Wickham and Mr. Darcy's silent attitude towards her which she takes as his looking down on her. Thus, first impressions play a big role in the story, though to be sure other first impressions, such as the first impression of Mr. Collins which is shared by nearly everyone are fairly accurate.In volume two, their relationship develops. Mr. Darcy cannot ignore the feelings he has developed for Elizabeth and this results in three key events in this volume. One is Mr. Darcy's declaration of feelings to Elizabeth. The second is Elizabeth's stern rebuke of Mr. Darcy's feelings followed by an attack on his behavior towards the relationship between Jane and Mr. Bingley as well as Mr. Darcy's treatment of Mr. Wickham. This leads to the third key event, which is Mr. Darcy's letter to Elizabeth where he sets the matter straight about his actions. The second event results in Mr. Darcy writing the letter and changing his behavior, though we don't witness the latter until volume three. The third event is important as the reader is privy to Elizabeth's change in attitude resulting from what Mr. Darcy has told her.In volume three, their relationship completes its change, as Elizabeth gets to know Mr. Darcy from where he lives, and by those who work for him, and she also learns about his character from actions he takes on behalf of her family, which he never means her to learn about. We also witness the change in Mr. Darcy's behavior, not only towards Jane, but towards her entire family. Of course, it is obvious that the two will end up together, but knowing the end does not spoil the journey.There is good reason why this book is a classic and why it is still read and enjoyed today. The characters are believable and well rounded for the most part. There is humor, societal and family challenges, and moral lessons weaved together throughout the book. I can also recommend the Penguin Classics edition of this book, as it contains an introduction and notes by Vivien Jones, as well as an introduction written by Tony Tanner for an earlier edition of the book. The introductions are both interesting reading, and the notes are useful as well."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The Book:Dover Publications does it again. This has to be the ultimate reasonably-priced edition of Pride and Prejudice you could ever get your hands on. Don't be fooled by the image of the stuffy dust cover; underneath the beige paper is a red cloth-bound, gold-printed cover which would enhance the finest library. The endpapers are embossed with a floral design, which is a lovely touch.This is a republication of an 1894 edition, in which the typography is perfect - that is, there are fewer words to a page making it easy on the eyes, while your progress through the book goes rapidly through its 476 pages. The paper is high-quality yet lightweight, which is great for a large hardcover like this. But the best features this edition has are the original Victorian-era illustrations by Hugh Thomson. Just...beautiful!The Story:Reviewing a classic like this almost feels silly, so I will do so briefly. The story moves slowly from \\"interesting\\" to \\"greatness.\\" For the first third or so it seemed like a funny, lightweight girly-gossip novel, and I kept thinking, \\"This book has got nothing on Jane Eyre!\\" Then it took a twist, and another, and got complicated, and the characters were developed, and the story darkened and I got totally sucked in until I could not put it down. Yep. Classic. Loved it!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I feel fully unqualified to pass judgment on Jane Austen, it is true. But I thought I'd add my voice to the chorus of acclamation that has attended it for decades. Pride and Prejudice is my favorite book--a masterpiece because of its writing (difficult and archaic, but beautiful), its plot (excellently woven and fully believable), and its characters (in whom Austen has perfectly captured the tendencies and caprice of human nature). It is lovable, enthralling, candid, and resonating.I don't like writing reviews that make the product sound flawless... except in this case, where I really believe it to be so."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice has long been my favorite book. But I must say, this edition is my favorite. The side notes are helpful in clearing up details that of the era which we don't understand. I would definately recommend this edition of Pride and Prejudice."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is Jane Austen's most popular novel and it is remarkable that it has sustained such a high popularity 200 years after it was originally published. The primary plot of the story follows Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy in a highly contentious courtship that begins with mutual contempt but evolves quite unexpectedly for both into very different feelings. Subplots involve her sister Jane and Mr. Bingley in a courtship of their own as well as the romantic entanglements of various other sisters and friends. The story is a bit of a roller coaster ride with soaring hopes and crushing disappointment in store as events unfold. I won't reveal the ending for the handful of people who haven't read it but suffice to say that the novel concludes in a way that leaves the vast majority of readers well satisfied.Darcy and Elizabeth are complex and multi-layered characters who both grow and change somewhat as the book progresses. They are the heart and soul of the book and about as well fleshed out as any characters you are likely to see. The supporting characters, however, are considerably less deep and are more caricatures than anything else. Some are good and kind like Jane and Mr. Bingley, and others are ridiculous and vain like Mrs. Bennet but none are remotely as substantial as Darcy and Elizabeth. So, does this ruin the book? Hardly. These secondary characters offer a wealth of material for the author as she plays them off of Darcy and Elizabeth.This novel is almost certainly the one where Austen best displays her sharp-edged wit both through Elizabeth's dialogue and in the narrative voice describing some of these characters and their actions. If some of them were less ridiculous, the potential for the satire would be weakened considerably. And make no mistake, Pride and Prejudice is as much a satire of the time it was written, as it is a romantic drama. Even today, the prose is quite funny and enjoyable.In summary, this is a great novel. Admittedly, there were a few times where I thought a character's behavior was a bit over-the-top but the overall story is so riveting and the book so compelling that I just can't find any serious fault with it. Pride and Prejudice is deserving of its reputation and I highly recommend it to Austen fans and newcomers alike."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This novel begins with one of the most recognizable lines in literary history: \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.\\" With that begins, perhaps, the most copied plot-line in human history. Sisters Elizabeth and Jane Bennett are of a marrying age. When a handsome and wealthy young man comes to stay in their neighborhood, the Bennetts waste little time making his acquaintance. It turns out the handsome newcomer, Charles Bingley, is a fine and friendly gentleman and he has a liking for Jane.Mr. Bingley's cohort, Fitzwilliam Darcy, is, however, not nearly so friendly. Cold and formal, he quickly incurs the dislike of Elizabeth. Mr. Darcy, though, appears somewhat taken by Elizabeth and makes some half-hearted advances. Despite his great wealth, Elizabeth distaste grows the more she learns of Mr. Darcy's past.Just as the relationship between Jane and Mr. Bingley appears set for matrimony, Mr. Bingley suddenly leaves the neighborhood. Certainly, it seems, this is the doing of Mr. Darcy. Jane's hopes dashed and Elizabeth finding only comically unsuitable suitors, the Bennett sisters are headed for old-maidom. That is, unless the terrible events are due to improper pride and/or prejudice.Though I am not a great Jane Austen admirer and find much of her writing overly ornamental and preoccupied with unimportant subject matter, there is no disputing the greatness of this novel. The language usage is clearly Austenesque, but this book is nevertheless genuinely a page turner. Moreover, the tone is pitch perfect - touching the emotions, but maintaining an appealing comic feel. I found myself delighted to be in the company of Jane Austen who, though her writing is over two centuries old and her experiences obviously much different from ours, has a surprisingly modern voice.Even more importantly, this book is an invaluable cultural gift. Though perhaps not in the same league as the Bible or some of Shakespeare's works, the influence of Pride and Prejudice on our culture is simply vast. Familiarizing yourself with Pride and Prejudice will make literally hundreds of cultural products more comprehensible (or reveal them to be unoriginal). The plot-line alone has spawned countless imitations, slight modifications and commentaries. The characters, especially Elizabeth and Darcy, have become veritable archetypes. This is one of those stories that you are already familiar with through its imitators. None, however, has done the material so well and so thoughtfully as Ms. Austen.Even if you don't have the stomach for Ms. Austen's other material, this novel is worth reading. It's both good for you and an enjoyable read - often a tough mix to find."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Never fear this is not a novelization.

Had wanted to read this for a long, long time. Moderate amount of 'flowery' writing, but I thoroughly enjoyed it and highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This timeless classic by Jane Austin is probably the best illustration of why we should not let ourselves be guided by first impressions. Most previous reviewers have considered only prejudice itself to be the theme of this book, but I am convinced that this was not all of Miss Austin's theme (though it was a major part of it), but rather she was also showing the folly of judging people by our first impressions of them. Elizabeth (the main character), judged Mr. Darcy by her first impression of him (which was bad). She let her opinion of him be decided by this first impression, thus she was prejudiced against him. I think most people tend to focus on the prejudice and pass over the step that leads to it. Also, the same thing happens with Mr. Wickham. She lets her first impression of him (which was good) guide her opinion of him, which later turned out to be completely wrong, just as she had been about Mr. Darcy.Now, do not mistake me, prejudice is a major part of this book, but I think it is important to note that Miss Austin is not just showing us the effects and foolishness of prejudice, but even deeper, she is showing the precursor to prejudice, which is (in many cases) judging by first impressions.As for the form of this book, I thought it was very well written. There was no action whatsoever, unless you include going for a walk in your definition of action. I found it incredible that Miss Austin was able to write in such a way as to keep one's attention for hundreds of pages while including (almost) nothing but dialogue and very minor events.I also loved the believableness of her characters. Almost every character strongly reminded me of someone I knew, they were so like real people, which is very rare in novels, especially in Miss Austin's era. I think that Mr. Bennet quickly became one of my favorite fictional characters with his wit and dry humor, and Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy were very good characters as well. Mrs. Bennet was, as I suppose was Miss Austin's intention, very annoying and frustrating, even to the reader. Somehow the characters in this book were just more \\"real\\" than they are in most books."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I must admit Pride and Prejudice is one of those many books I \\"spark noted\\" in high school rather than reading. It wasn't that I wasn't an avid reader, just at the time I more enjoyed silly sci fi books. Looking back I'm very happy that it isn't until now that I've read this book, because now I think I am more able to fully appreciate it. The characters are very well developed. Be them witty, silly, meddling, proud or prejudicial, they are all a pleasure to get to know and explore. The story as a whole, and the way it is presented to the reader is wonderfull. This is, to date, one of the best books I've ever had the pleasure of reading. (And any one who disagrees should be immediatley taken out back and shot, or at the very least pitied for their simple-mindedness.)"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a wonderful book. Don't let anyone tell you it's not. A review in here got me thinking though. They said there is no such thing as books that are better than others because it's all subjective. This person is wrong, simple as that. Certain books are not literary towers because people have said &quot;wow! amazing!&quot; people say that about Harry Potter! I mean really! What distinguishes a book and makes it &quot;better&quot; than others, is if it's around in fifty, one hundred years. Pride and Prejudice has done this. It is &quot;better&quot; than other books."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I admired Darcy the first time I read this book at the age of 12 and yet now again at the age of 31 after having reread this book, I find myself surprised to experience the same feeling.Yes, he is pretty disagreeable in the beginning, but then I find people who don't intend to impress everyone to be more honest in the long run. Darcy's character grows on one as one goes forward in the story.As for Elisabeth, she matures remarkably, in general I find the book very realistic , we are all full of pride and prejudice when we meet people and they prevent us from seeing many of their more valuable qualities."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I can still remember the act of reading this book, during a rather blase summer vaction in the middle of my college years.

This is my favorite book, however I only give it four stars because it didn't pose a challenge or have me ready to change the world, however I enjoyed this enduring love story."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"\\"I\\"It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.\\" This is the opening that initiated the whole story with a click, that not only addressed the theme of this book, but also of a \\"universally acknowledged\\" truth.In my long search for a literary classic that I could both enjoy reading as well as get something out of, I finally ended up with \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", by Jane Austen. Upon reading the first sentence of this book, I was immediately captured by the story liveliness and soon found myself hooked. In addition to the lively, vivid tone of the book, what enchanted me the most was the seamless way in which each character behaviors and interactions were so carefully woven together in an intricate plot.Some characters that appear in the book are:- Mr. Bennet, a brilliant, sarcastic man who likes to ridicule the silliness of his wife- Mrs. Bennet, a middle aged woman who is eager to marry her daughters off to rich and prosperous families when they come of age- Their five daughters:- Jane, who, being the eldest, believes in human good and righteousness in all human beings,- Mary, their third child, who is always absorbed in books thinking about this and that- The shy Catherine, also known as Kitty, who always followed her flirtatious younger sister, Lydia around in flirting with officers.However, all the characters and indeed the whole story revolves around Miss. Elizabeth Bennet the second oldest sister, a witty, headstrong girl, and Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy, a very queer, shy man. At first sight, Elizabeth's assumption and observation towards Mr. Darcy pride made her prejudiced against him. Yet in the end an unexpected twist ends this book in a very satisfactory manner.Although many readers especially teenagers might be \\"prejudiced\\" against reading the old \\"classics\\", I found this book to be quite interesting. This book gave me an insight on the thoughts of the people during that time period, and some hints how they were suppress or discriminated by the class system."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Like others, I came to this novel after years of it being pushed upon me like a drug. \\"Read it, you'll love it!\\" It took several starts and a snowy winter far from home to finally render the book's period drama understandable. As a student and fan of women's history, I was initially drawn in not by the plot of the story (though it is what soon carries you through to the delicious conclusion) but by the fascination of viewing family life in another time. As with any period piece, geographical, political, and mannerly allusions are lost without some historical understanding of the time. Not every \\"great book\\" is for every person. Also, PandP is very much a romance; you must be willing to romanticize to truly appreciate Eliza Bennett's struggle and change of heart. So don't feel you must read it just because others tell you to. But if you find yourself in a wistful mood, ready to be immersed in another world, give this one a try. Chances are, it will lead you to a minor obsession with Jane Austen.Extensions of the original: If the recent movie starring Kiera Knightley was enjoyable, the book will be more so, with richer details and more drama. Also recommended as a companion is the fullest dramatization of the book, the BBC's version starring Colin Firth. And for a chick lit homage, read the Bridget Jones books."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"this is definitely an amazing piece of literature. i love it now, and will with no doubt still love it in the years to come. i believe it to be flawless, and Jane Austen deserves all the credit in the world for this book. the fact that it has endured the test of time, and has been enjoyed by generation after generation speaks volumes. i believe that the subtleties and simplicity of the story is what makes it the masterpiece it is. Jane Austen's ability to turn a simple love story, into something greater, while completely engrossing us without the fluff of a typical romance are what make her a literary genuis in her own right. her novels are literary dessert. they aren't filled with the complexities and deep themes of dickens', hardy's, or eliot's works, they are light-hearted and this very fact is what makes pride and prejudice an amazng piece of art. Elizabeth and Darcy come to life, and simply jump out of the text. The characters, their lives, the struggles they face, the decisions (and indecisions), and most importanty their eventual happiness are what make the book. no praise i can offer will completely do this masterpiece justice, so i urge you to read it for yourself."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have, to this point in my life, successfully avoided reading any Jane Austen books, supposing them to be superfluous and archaic. I really only read this book because I wanted the foundation and familiarity with the story prior to reading the adaptation entitled ''Pride and Prejudice and Zombies'' by Seth Grahame-Smith. Because who can pass up a good zombie book, after all?I started this book begrudgingly but was soon intrigued by the language. I amused myself by reading aloud a paragraph of flowery language to my husband and then paraphrasing it in a sentence. I proclaimed and bemoaned the inefficiency of the writing style but persevered and slogged on. About halfway through the book, I surprised myself by really wanting to know what happened next. And here I sit, 1am in the morning, having to finish the book tonight with the absolute stubbornness of having to know Elizabeth's disposition!Hands down, I loved this book. Shame on me and my ignorance for Ms. Austen's talent. I hope to read many more of her books.

If you enjoy a smart romance, sharp wit, and the humor of peering into the character flaws of those about you, you won't be disappointed. Austen wrote my favorite heroine of all time within the pages of this novel. Elizabeth Bennet absolutely steals the show!The Bennet sisters, under the hand of an often dramatic and obnoxiously silly mother and a father, who abounds with dry humor but mostly abdicates his role, face life, society, and courtship in the English countryside. This is no easy task, for the young women have no considerable wealth or lofty position to aid them in a time when that was quite important.Pride And Prejudice chronicles the romantic fiascoes of the Bennet girls. Jane, the eldest sister, wins the love of the young and well-to-do Mr. Bingley, although certainly not without trial and tribulation. But jealousy and interference leave her happiness in serious doubt. Lydia, the middle child, selfish and flighty, refuses to comply with propriety, and her actions threaten the chances of all the sisters. The two youngest, Mary and Kitty, while affected by the goings-on, don't figure as prominently in the story. This leaves Elizabeth, the novel's main female character, to entertain with her bold wit and keen observations during her own adventures in life and love.When Elizabeth Bennet first encounters Mr. Darcy, she at once understands him to be prideful and ill-mannered, founding her long lasting prejudice. Adding to her less than friendly impressions are the accusations against Mr. Darcy by the family's newest acquaintance, Mr. Wickham. Circumstances, however, continue to throw the two together, and the time spent coming to know Elizabeth begins to alter Mr. Darcy's opinions. His change in behavior leaves much to be desired, and it isn't until after Elizabeth's scathing face-to-face assessment of Mr. Darcy's character flaws that he confronts his pride whole-heartedly, and Elizabeth faces her prejudice.Strength of character, probing dialogue, and honest reflection turn their opinions of one another into something altogether different as Elizabeth and Darcy, each in their own way, dare to break with convention and hope in love.After reading Austen's original again, I am more than eager to dive into the first sequel on my list! Reading the varied takes on what the Darcy's love affair may have looked like once they married intrigues me to no end.~Moira"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I'm slightly embarrassed to say that it took me this long to get around to reading Pride & Prejudice. I don't like romance novels and I'm generally wary of anything that is too popular. And yet here I am, giving P&P one of the few 5-star ratings I've ever bestowed. Jane Austen is, without a doubt, among the wittiest, cleverest, most talented authors I've ever read. I laughed out loud repeatedly, thoroughly enjoyed many of the characters (the protagonists were refreshingly frank and the stupid ones were delightfully annoying), and don't you tell anyone but I had tears in my eyes when Darcy and Elizabeth finally sorted things out. I'll be thinking about this book for a long time, and I imagine that I'll be delving into Austen's other books in short order."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is an amazing classic. Those who have seen the movie...READ THE BOOK! Austen does a wonderful job in her character development and capturing the emotions and making them tangible.

It is brilliantly written plot-wise and character-wise, set in the time of propriety and manners in Regency England (early 1800s). Jane Austen at her bestSynopsis: (WARNING POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT!!!)The novel opens with the arrival of a wealthy young gentleman, Mr. Charles Bingley, at Netherfield Park, accompanied by his rather haughty sisters and friend, Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy. Seeing the wealthy newcomers, the Bennet family of the nearby village of Longbourn, is in great excitement. The silly and impractical Mrs. Bennet thereupon aims to marry off at least one of her five daughters: Jane (the eldest and the kindest), Elizabeth (the most sensible), Mary (the most studious), Kitty (the simple-minded), and Lydia (the silliest). Almost immediately, the amiable Mr. Bingley is well-liked by the community, while his friend, Mr. Darcy, appears just the opposite. From the start, since he rejected her at a ball, Elizabeth's first impression of Mr. Darcy is to be arrogant, proud, and conceited. Her dislike of him is only heightened when she hears an account of Mr. Darcy, as ruthless and cold-hearted, from a handsome and sociable young officer, Mr. George Wickham. Meanwhile, despite Mrs. Bennet's embarrassing meddling, Mr. Bingley and Jane Bennet begin to develop an attachment, and though unawares, Elizabeth's liveliness and intelligence grows on Mr. Darcy, who unconsciously falls for her - despite all his objections to her inferior birth status and her ridiculous mother and younger sisters. As Elizabeth, the main protagonist, eventually discovers, one of her two admirers - Mr. Wickham and Mr. Darcy - has all the appearance of goodness, while the other has all the genuine goodness."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The content of this book receives five stars with ease. This version gets two at best. There are countless errors in spelling and grammar, which annoys me greatly. Despite this, I found this novel to be a delightful read. I haven't enjoyed a book like this in ages."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have the story mostly memorized from reading the book and watching the movies, and the narrator does a good job of changing up the voices and carrying the emotion of the story.

The descriptive language brings to mind romance, fancy balls and gallantry no longer found in this modern age."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is obviously a classic and easy to read. However, the amount of characters is too much to follow and also the author sometimes doesn't let the reader know when a different character is speaking.

Their emotions were held back through the whole book, so when Darcy and Elizabeth finally get together it is not as exciting and heart wrenching as it should be."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Great read.

She is sharp to the point and remains a Lady."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I enjoyed this e-book very much because I have seen versions of the film and TV presentations and reading the book gives a more indepth study of the writing style of Jane Austen. The film and TV presentations couldn't include everything in the book such as a study of each main character. You must read the book slowly to enjoy her usage of words or you will miss the message because there are so many words to describe an event, person, scene, experience, etc. This book is very similar to a Harry Potter book - you need to read it more than once to capture the little things lead to something bigger.

The book is about a twenty-one year old girl struggling with three stupid sisters and an arrogant mother, with only her father and elder sister as her true friends.

So true is the title.."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is a great novel. The version published by Public Domain Books (ASIN: B000JMLFLW) as an ebook is a formatting mess, however. Line breaks follow pretty much every occurrence of \\"Mr.,\\" for example."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Any reader of the novel Pride and Prejudice, be it novice or veteran, has certain expectations and apprehensions based on its incredible popularity and renown. The same can be said for the media, whose recent over-use of its famous opening line, \`It is a truth universally acknowledged...' can be found repeated in the opening of many a news, magazine or blog article announcing some creditable or dubious connection to Jane Austen's characters or plot. Interestingly, it has become the meme of the day passed along and re-used by those who want to appear in the know, but are sadly missing the point. It is debatable if Pride and Prejudice's profound truths can be reduced to just universally acknowledged one-liners. If the novel was that easy to figure out we would not care two figs about it, and after nearly two hundred years, it would have been lost to obscurity! What one can expect though is so much more; an engaging plot that keeps you thinking and re-evaluating characters every step along the way, witty, sharp and humorous dialogue that others wish to emulate but never quite achieve, and a love story which just might reign supreme for all eternity. With all of these expectations before us, who could not be a little intimidated?The Oxford World's Classics new edition of Pride and Prejudice might just meet your need to read and explore Jane Austen's classic novel. This edition presents the reader with a wide variety of supplementary material to help you along in your discovery of the universal truths in Pride ad Prejudice. Like many editions, it supplies us with an unabridged text that has been carefully edited by prominent scholars since it was first published in 1813. \`Carefully' is the operative word here, since the debate is on about what has been changed or removed from the text. I will again defer to my learned co-reviewer Prof. Moody to delve into that arena. In addition to the brief biography of Jane Austen, select bibliography, chronology of her life, and two appendixes on dancing and social status that are repeated in each of the six editions in this series, (and previously mentioned in our first review), this volume includes a twenty-six page introduction by Fiona Stafford, notes on the text including a publishing history, textural notes and explanatory notes unique to this edition filled with insights and facts neatly organized and easy to find.Writing an introduction to one of the most beloved and highly scrutinized novels in English literature is a daunting task indeed. My sympathies went out to Fiona Stafford even before I had read one word. Pride and Prejudice is so many things to different people, and not everyone's pet project could be addressed within the limit of space. I just hoped that she might enlighten me in some small way about a truth or insight that I had previously missed. She did not. But like one of the main themes in Pride and Prejudice, accounts by different people of the same events can have different truths. We all judge by our own unique agenda, so what I saw as lacking, another reader might find diverting. She did however, hit upon some interesting points; how the strength of our convictions can cloud our belief and disbeliefs, the divergence and attraction of different personalities, and how truth or the misconception of it can alter our judgment and future happiness.The truth may be uncertain in Pride and Prejudice, but on this fact I am convinced. I had difficultly writing about this introduction even after taking copious notes. This can be a telling sign to its clarity and content. I did however find one point of amusement when the author mentioned that characters can be distinguished by their speech patterns and gave examples; \\"Lydia's use of \`Oh Lord', Miss Bingley's \`Abominable', Mr. Collins' \`Lady Catherine de Bourgh', and Mary Bennet's lengthy, but largely content-free sentences distinguish her from her vivacious sisters.\\" This is definitely true of Austen's unique characterizations, but this introductions \`content-free sentences' certainly distinguished it from any other vivacious introduction that this writer has the pleasure to read.Besides my disappointment in the introduction, the remainder of the supplemental material including the very helpful explanatory notes and the extensive chronology were a delight. For the new student the additional material is a must to understand the full context of the novel; - and for those Janeites who are ready to start your annual re-reading of Pride and Prejudice, pick up this edition. It is a perfect size to stash in your handbag or brief case, and whip out when the next debate ensues about whether Mr. Darcy was too proud, or just shy."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"...This book is a romance, and I liked it.My only excuse is, it's a CLASSIC romance!I loved it, in fact. It's on my Top Ten Favorite Books list. It wasn't gross, it wasn't weird, it wasn't annoyingly romantic. I loved it. (I might say that a few more times.)I loved Elizabeth, Jane, Mr. Bennet's relations with Mrs. Bennet, Mr. Darcy, Mr. Bingly, Mr. Collins (my cousin cannot say his name without falling over herself laughing from what she saw in the movie.)I can't even find words to describe how much I loved this book. I read it this summer, and I'm still at a loss for words!All I can say is, I'll definitely be picking up more classics. And my book of Jane Austen's works will soon be veeeery well-worn.Rating: Very Good"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I read this book about once a year. It has the wonderful dialogue and character development. AND it's funny! A must read for any self-respecting bookworm!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"When I went to a bookshop, this book 'Pride and Prejudice' charmed me with pretty book cover and familier title.When I started reading this book, I could not stop, i had to finish it. This book is very classical love story, even though it is written in a difficult english style. I was able to fall into this book very easily.Firstly, it was interesting how Jane portrayed the fluttering mind of village people like how all the villege people tried to contact with new villeger Bingley.Also it was interesting that how Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy's first impresstion is bed. That shows the first impression is not everyting, it's changeable by knowing the person in depth.Combine with that period of time, the love story continues. I was queit impressed how their only hope is to get married. For example, wickham's case. Elizabeth's sister get crush on him, and just fall into him and gets marry with him.I also knew that in that period of time, there was big gap between rich and poor same as today. This story is more meaningful because the story overcomes the richness. Also the way Mr. Darcy acts out, how he helps Elizabeth without letting her know and how he tries to protext him was really romantic.One another thing is that these days, most of the love stories reverse the story at the end that might give readers a thrill. But this very classic book just kept on going to one direction the way that i predicted. That is the reason that i chose this book to write a review on.Lastly, as I read this book I learnt that the appearance is not everything, the thing that charms person is one's scent. What kind of personality and chracteristic the one has. I think everyone wants to be pretty and be nice like a flower infront of a person the he or she loves. But important thing is that should be not determinded by a appearance but by inner personality."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Although this is my first Jane Austen novel (I started Emma but returned it to the library after a boring few pages), it suprisingly was a fun read. I admit I read this because of the movie and the BBC miniseries, but even watching both does not give the full story behind Pride and Prejudice. The book can be boring at a few scenes, namely, Mr. Collins, but whenever we read Elizabeth's and Darcy's banter, it makes it all more worthwhile. Definitely recommend the book if you enjoy the movie/BBC series."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's books are fabulous. Her writing is superb and captivates the reader.

I would call myself a well-versed reader in popular books. I would also call Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen quite possibly the most well-written book in the past 300 years.As soon as you pick up this book, your mind is forming hypothoses about the rest of the book. The weird thing is that ABSOLUTLY NONE of them happen. Yet, at the end, you are not only as happy with the conclusion as you would have been with your own ideas, but happier. That kind of literary psycological euphoria cannot be and has not been acheived by any other author that I have ever read.This book leaves you with a feeling of absolute feclicity. I cried with joy the first time I read it, and had to reread the ending twice. In other words, it has a very happy ending! That has certainly been attempted by every tale from Cinderella to the Harry Potter books, yet Austen's ending is unique as her ending is perfectly real. It not only seems realistic, but, in hindsight, any other resolution to her book seems ludicrous.Her characters are vivid. They are complex yet you see them as if they could be you own mother, sister, father, brother, friend, foe, or aquaintance. You not only warm to her heroes and heroines, but Austen leads you to feel a fiery hatred of her vilains and vilainesses.Her writing is intricate. You are left feeling not only perfectly satisfied with this book, but want more. She is not only an excalent writer but a perfect one. Thius book is her masterpiece. It has comedy, tradjedy, richness, irony, love, and loss. It many complex facets gleam like diamonds. I am in awe of this book. I beseach you: READ PRIDE AND PREJUDICE AT ALL COSTS!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"In college, Iw as supposed to read this book. But I never did because I just assumed it would be boring. Three years later, I tried it again... and I kicked myself for not having tried it sooner.I think my vision of reading Jane Austen always has me curled up in a chair while it's snowing outside, but in truth, the real memory of reading this book was sitting in the waiting room of a car mechanic while my car was being worked on. That day stands out because as usual, the mechanics only had the usual things to read: &quot;Guns and Ammo&quot; and &quot;Field and Stream&quot;. Add the requisite gumball machine in the corner with stale gumballs and you have the idea. I brought the book with me to read, but didn't really think I would get all that much reading of it done. True, I was reading it for fun, but it was Jane Austen after all, and I wasn't sure if I could really concentrate on her. Well, 200 pages later, bringing that novel with me was the best decision I ever made. 4 years later, I still rememebr how into this book I got. (I even had to take a walk around the block before I read the last chapter just to prolong finishing the story.) Once the story did end, I felt like I was saying goodbye to my friends.This book is riveting, it's fun, it's hysterical (wait for the rewarding confrontation between Lady Catherine deBourgh and Elizabeth...it's not only a battle of tongues, but a great clash of the &quot;refined&quot; yet uneducated upper classes, and the middle classes of Regentry England. This is by far my favorite Austen novel of the bunch (with Emma coming in a close second). So, this winter, wait for a snowy day (heck, choose any day, you can't have a bad Austen day) and get ready to be taken away. And no.. this book is not solely the domain of high school etachers and academians.. you'll be surprised how much you may enjoy it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"&quot;~Though only sixteen, I consider myself to be moderately well-read. I love reading, and, when I am between books, my life feels desolate and empty. One day, while in the most barren pit of ennui, I picked up Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice at my mother's recommendation.

I can offer no suggestions to the male reader, however, because generally this book, in every essence, is a female novel. I am not saying that men would definetly not enjoy it; I'm simply saying that I have yet to meet any male who has not addressed this book in a very vehement manner. and I know it won't be too long before I pick it up again. Jane Austen surely knew what she was doing when she wrote this one! Her Pride and Prejudice will always have an honored spot on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and prejudice is a beautifully written love story, full of humor and life-like imagery. The characters Elizabeth and Mr Darcy are both carved out nicely, with Austen's acute sense about how both men and women think and perceive beauty, love, society. The novel is a compelling read, and for diehard romantics like me, it is irresistable to the end. While Sense and Sensibility moves more slowly, and likewise also dwells on stories of two sisters, there the love stories are presented with maze of other matter. Here the hero must overcome his pride, the heroine must fight a battle with her prejudices, and both then discover not only love in each other but their real selves. Additional stories and people appear perfectly developed in their own roles of lovers, parents, friends, envious relations, grumpy grandmothers, lively teenagers, etc. The drama of a great movie or a soap opera is all here, with Austen's simple and elegant story telling.Many sequences and sentences are purely delightful or extermely hilarious, making the novel one of those reads where you are caught laughing aloud or smiling with twinkle your eyes alone, as you are relishing the new turn of events. While the story is set in Victorian era, the characters, emotions and humor is timeless. The novel is an easy read, fit for travel reading as well as for fun, and trust me, the romantic in you will be raving about it for a long time! In fact, two movies compelled me to reread the novel recently: Gurinder Chadda's Bride and Prejudice that reinvents the classic in a Bollywood flavor and Tom Hanks- Meg Ryan Starrer You've got mail. In You've Got Mail there are repeated references to the novel, and to the extent the opposites attract, and essential elements of novel are concerned, the movie is like a reincarnated version of the novel.Citation from You've Got MailConfession: I have read Pride and Prejudice about 200 times. I get lost in the language-words like thither, mischance, felicity. I'm always in agony over whether Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy are really going to get together. Read it - I know you'll love it.Meg Ryan's character, to her anonymous email friend, Tom Hanks in You've Got Mail.(the reference to the movie is for those who have seen and like the movie, else the novel is intrinsically enjoyable, and even for those who have seen this movie or the movie based on the novel, worth spending a fun-filled reading time with.)"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen, follows society's elite through the trials and tribulations of love, pride, money, and marriage negotiations. This novel takes place in 19th century England and revolves around the slow development of love found between two characters. The first of these characters is Elizabeth Bennet, a clever, beautiful, and spirited young woman. Pride and Prejudice begins, when Mrs. Bennet asks Mr. Bennet to call on their new neighbor, Mr. Bingley. Mr. Bingley has an income of 5 thousand pounds a year and is not married, so Mrs. Bennet hopes to marry one of her 5 daughters to him. Jane, the eldest daughter, and Mr. Bingley begin to like each other during a ball. Elizabeth, the second oldest, meets Mr. Darcy at the same ball. Darcy initially does not care for Elizabeth, and refuses to even dance with her.However, as Elizabeth grows to dislike Darcy, Darcy starts to become very fond of her. She and Darcy meet again when she stays with Mr. Bingley, because her sister, Jane, has taken ill at their house. Ms. Bingley, the sister of Mr. Bingley, herself hopes to wed Darcy, and seeks to make Elizabeth less appealing to Darcy. After Jane's recovery she and Elizabeth return home. There they welcomed to their home by their cousin Mr. Collins, who, because of the inheritance customs of the times (the Bennet girls had no brothers), was the heir to the Bennet family home. Together, Elizabeth and her family travel to town, where they met Mr. Wickham. Mr. Wickham notices Elizabeth, who he found charming, and describes to her a terrible deed he alleges Darcy had committed against him. Wickham claimed that Darcy owed him money and had denied him of a promised avocation. This new information causes Elizabeth to despise Darcy even more.Soon Mr. Collins, the rather odd clergyman, proposes to Elizabeth. To her mother's dismay, she refuses him. Instead, her friend Charlotte Lucas marries Mr. Collins, and Elizabeth goes to visit them and their neighbor the great Lady Catherine De Bourgh. During her stay Elizabeth sees Darcy again, and he proposes. Elizabeth refuses, reciting all the terrible things he had done, including the mistreatment of Wickham. In response, Darcy writes Elizabeth explaining how Wickham had tried to elope with his sister because of her money. Elizabeth is forced to rethink, her opinions relating to Darcy and Wickham.That summer Elizabeth traveled to Pemberly on holiday with her aunt and uncle, and while there her aunt and uncle wanted to see the beautiful Darcy estate. While visiting, Darcy showed up. Darcy and his sister heartily welcomed Elizabeth and her aunt and uncle, and invited them to dinner. Elizabeth began to grow fonder of Darcy. Dreadful news arrived during Elizabeth's stay at Pemberly. Her frivolous younger sister Lydia had run off with Wickham. Upon learning of the circumstances, Darcy sought out and found Wickham and Lydia, forcing them to marry. Elizabeth and her aunt and uncle returned to the Bennet home.Bingley and Darcy together visited the Bennet household to call upon Jane and Elizbeth. Jane became engaged to Bingley, and when Darcy proposed to Elizabeth, her heart had changed, so she said yes. Elizabeth had fallen in love Darcy. They had both seen past their pride and past the prejudices that they had learned from society. Elizabeth and Darcy were happy in marriage, and remained forever grateful to Elisabeth's aunt and uncle for uniting them.I would recommend the book Pride and Prejudice. It forces each of us to think about our roles in life. The novel also makes us think about our own pride and our own prejudices against others, and the need for us to learn more about people before we judge them. This book is also one of the greatest Romances of all time, bringing to life the love that a man and a woman held for each other from another era. It provides meaningful messages that all of us should learn. The characters are also interesting. This book is good for people who understand the use of language in the 19th century. Pride and Prejudice is a classic novel that I love, and believe everyone would enjoy."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I bought the set of audiotapes with no particular expectations, and I am pleasantly surprised. Ms Sharon Williams's reading is amazingly smooth, natural, and she depicts the personalities of each character with the intonations of her voice so perfectly that it always sound like there's more than one person reading, even though she doesn't alter her voice. I am particularly amazed by her rendition of Mrs Bennet. I can almost see the woman when I hear the talk!As an American, I am not fond of British accents, and I am happy to hear that Ms Williams read with some British influence, but it is overall pleasant and easy for me to understand. (In contrast, I dislike the accents on the Harry Potter movies.)I highly recommend this product.(If you haven't read Pride and Prejudice yet and is wondering if you should, the answer is yes! The classics are usually a drag to read, but not Pride and Prejudice. It moves fast, it is witty, insightful, and the language is easy to understand. I think it is the best book among the classics.)"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is viewed as one of the finest novels ever written, and rightfully so. Despite being only 22 years old when the original manuscript was finished, Austen displays an astonishing mastery of the English language that has rarely been equalled. The prose is so expertly constructed that the book maintains a brisk pace throughout and never becomes dull. Being so heavily dialogue-based, it's critical that the conversations in this book keep the reader interested. Fortunately, the snappy dialogue is what makes this book really shine. The characterization is nothing short of brilliant, from the silly Mrs. Bennett to the intolerable Mr. Collins. Despite the fact that nothing truly exciting ever happens, you'll find yourself desperate to turn the next page. I could not possibly recommend this book more."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This classic Jane Austen novel is one of my all-time favorites and I loved the novel on my Kindle as well.

I would recommend this book to anyone who likes the classic version."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I use an audio copy of P&P when teaching it in class - we read through important passages together without the loss of my voice. I previously owned a tape version - horrible because you had to FF to whatever parts you wanted. In fact my player ended up eating 2 of the tapes. This CD version is much better and I would highly recommend it, except... Normal audio CDs have tracks that correspond with the chapters. Not this one. The tracks were in random places (in the middle of a paragraph, even in the middle of sentences!) so trying to find the right chapter to start on required some detective work. If you're just planning to listen from start to finish, however, this is an excellent version- the reader is splendid."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I downloaded this as my first book on my new Kindle.

That's how my favourite book of all time begins, and it just keeps getting better.This novel deals with the pride and prejudices of the main characters Miss Elizabeth Bennett, and Mr. Darcy, as they try to find true love in pre-Victorian England. Elizabeth is a gentleman's daughter and Mr. Darcy is a gentleman, but Elizabeth, along with the rest of her sisters, are not good catches because, their inheritance is being entailed away to their cousin Mr. Collins, leaving them with very miserable looking dowries. Along with poor family connections, they stand little chance of marrying well or at all; they only have their charms to help them.That is until Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood along with his sisters, and accompanying them his close friend Mr. Darcy. Mr. Bingley becomes captivated with Jane Bennett, Elizabeth's eldest sister, and Mr. Darcy has an eye for Elizabeth herself, but can he see past her poor conditions, and can she see past his pride in order for them to get together? That's the question that keeps the audience captivated right up to the end.I try and find time to read this book at least once a year, and I've been doing that for a few years, and yet, it's always fresh when a get around to reading it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I was 12 years old and had the rare privilege of going shopping alone with my Mum. (With 2 sisters and a brother, this event was EXTREMELY rare.) I asked if we could browse in the book store. Half an hour later, we emerged. I was carrying a paperbag in which was enclosed my first copy of 'Pride and Prejudice'. As soon as we got in the car I started reading. I finished the book that night and I started it again the next morning. Even at 12 years old, I knew I was experiencing a masterpiece. In the 15 years since that day I have revisited the story of Elizabeth and Darcy numerous times. It just keeps getting better and better. Elizabeth was my idol. Darcy replaced Prince Philip, (from Disney's 'Sleeping Beauty'), as the man of my dreams. Mrs Bennett's nerves began to irk me as much as they did the long-suffering Mr Bennett. I love this book and I can't even begin to praise it, and the wonderful Jane Austen, enough. If you haven't read it - WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? If you have read it, I think its time to get it off your shelf, or get down to the library and relive the magic of 'Pride and Prejudice' all over again."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed Pride &amp; Prejudice. Although it has to be called a romance, I personally feel that the fascination is much more about the rules of behavior and courtship in Victorian society. The same story set in the modern day would not be nearly so interesting because you no longer have the rules to navigate that are present in the time in which it is set. It is the compliance with these rules and the reaction when they are not followed properly that makes the social structure of the time (as it is presented here) more like a chess game than a simple romance story. This given with characters and settings that have a feel to them that reminds me of Little Women made this book a great deal of fun to read. It was fast paced with plenty of intrigues.The back of my book puts the entire plot into one short paragraph. I was at first concerned that this would take the fun out of the reading since who marries who in the end was spelled out right there. However, in reading it I realized that it is not WHAT happens in this book as much as it is HOW it happens and in this Austen is a true master. Essentially the story is of the five daughters of the Bennett family. The addle-brained mother has no other concern than to marry her daughters off and the detached father generally just makes fun of the whole situation. Jane and Elizabeth are the two eldest daughters and Jane forms an attachment early on to Bingley, a gentleman who has leased a house/estate nearby. When a pompous Mr. Darcy interferes in Jane's attachment to Bingley, Elizabeth is turned vehemently against him - a sentiment further deepened by aspersions made by Mr. Wickham, Mr. Darcy's father's godchild. As fate would have it, Mr. Darcy develops an attachment to Elizabeth and has to redeem himself in her eyes, despite his feelings of social superiority and her many resentments.I don't know if the title is to reflect the pride of Mr. Darcy and the prejudice of Elizabeth against him. At one point she says the following: \\" Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.\\" I see her really exploring this in the character of Mr. Darcy and his relations and feel that the title may have more to do with the exploration of this sentiment than in any of the individual characters."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"For the typical male, the only thing worse than reading a romance novel is reading a two-hundred-year-old romance novel. So why'd I bother? Because I'm a firm believer that serious readers should occasionally expand their horizons and sample books from other genres, especially those they'd normally pooh-pooh. Because that's when we get pleasantly surprised.Pride and Prejudice fell into this category for me. I wanted a break from the mystery/suspense genre and had heard good things about Jane Austen. As I dug in, my expectations were met early on: plodding, expository chunks of Old English describing landscapes and feelings. Ugh. But then she got me.Like peeling an onion, Austen uncovers characters and a story that are simply genius. Like Shakespeare, she proves again that time and technology have no impact on basic human impulses and the complexities of love. This book will be just as popular in another two hundred years. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"My 13 year old daughter and I just finished reading this book and LOVED it! As we read the book, we kept noticing that many of the characters remind us of people we know! It was funny, and really says a lot for Jane Austen's insight on human nature. Her characters are very realistic in my opinion.We learned from the book that in Jane Austen's time in England, it was very important to say and do the right things and to be excruciatingly polite. P&amp;P can be tedious to read until you get used to the way they talk, but once you do it really makes it even more amusing to read.I tried to read P&amp;P once before a few years ago, but I only got about a third of the way through the book. I just couldn't understand it well enough. I would recommend to anyone who was put off by the book to give it another chance. See one of the excellent videos first if you don't understand it, and then come back and literally FEAST on the book, which is so much better! I know that reading it has expanded my ability to appreciate good literature, and I know I will read all of Jane Austen's novels now."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"In case you are wondering, the novel it tied with is Dostoevsky's THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV.I have read this three times in three sittings. In case that is not clear, I mean to say that I have sat down to read PRIDE AND PREJUDICE on three separate occasions, and did not get up until I had finished it. I once stayed up all night long to finish it.Actually, I read it a fourth time, aloud to my then 8-year-old daughter Elizabeth (who was delighted to find an Elizabeth in the book). She liked it so much that she in turn read it twice. Just one of the great, irrestible book in the English language."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is one of the most-beloved novels by Jane Austen. Words cannot do it justice, but I'll try anyway, since I love it so much. The story of Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy is absolutely timeless. From the opening line, which is my all-time favorite opening line- \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a large portion must be in want of a wife,\\" we are drawn into this superb love affair, one which it is difficult to pull ourselves away from. I've read this book numerous times now and I always wonder what's going to happen.Here Jane Austen uses a sufficient amount of wit to satirize the social graces and foibles of the middle and upper classes in Regency England. From the modest Bennet family, with its five daughters, to Caroline Bingley and Mrs. Hurst, to whom social class is everything, we are given a superb picture of life as Austen saw it.There's also an undercurrent theme in which not everything is what it seems to be. Darcy is not the proud, cold gentleman he seems, nor is Elizabeth as feisty as she appears to others. And, while Elizabeth certainly understands the intents of others, she does not necessarily understand the workings of her own heart."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Not bad overall, but missing punctuation and some half sentences serve to pull the reader out of the story. Unfortunate, as this is one story in which the reader hopes to get perfectly lost."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The first time I read this book was at the age of 13. My mother had an old, worn, 1950s copy of the book on our bookshelf, and one day I just decided to give it a try. I think the first 50 pages were a bit of a mystery to me. I remember struggling with the language at the beginning, and having to look up several words in the dictionary. After 100 pages, I had finally \\"learnt the language,\\" and managed to at last translate it into my native tongue. I enjoyed it, and over the years I returned to it again and again. Now, at the age of 35, I practically have numerous passages memorized, and reading the book is no longer a culture shock. Every word of this novel is an old friend, and I wouldn't remove a single one from the text. This is the book I turn to when I'm in the mood to read, but not in the mood to read something new.Every time I read it, I am struck by its relevance. I don't mean the morals or the need to marry well in order to win approval from society (although I think we still see a little of that to this day). I refer to the characters. Their personalities and basic code of principals are timeless. I can identify with every single character in this novel. When Lizzy and Mr. Darcy fell in love, their courtship could have taken place anywhere and at any point in time. That is why her novels are so well adapted into modern films.You cannot possibly do wrong by reading this novel."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Let me tell you about my first impression of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. At the age of thirteen, it was one of the most amazing love stories I had ever read. Five years later, it became one of the most wittily crafted stories I had ever read. By the time I was twenty-one, it was the finest work of literature I had ever experienced.Elizabeth Bennet is a byproduct of genteel poverty. The second daughter of five, she possesses the most sense, tact, poise, and sound judgement of the family in general. On the other hand, she is also irreverent, daring, and judgemental. She stretches the envelope of what might be construed as &quot;polite&quot; society. She also acknowledges the limitations of her gender even as she subtly tries to defy them.As a part of the landed gentry, Mr. Darcy is the embodiment of all that is dignified and honored. He is a gentleman who was born to privilege and money. His kind make up the &quot;polite society&quot; Elizabeth dares to flout. His pride, his disdain, and his arrogance make him unappealing to the people of Longbourn, as well as the community surrounding it. It is his interference with the relationship between his friend and her beloved sister, however, which is a personal affront to Elizabeth.It is fortuitous that Austen retitled her book because First Impressions does not begin to touch upon the complexities that Pride and Prejudice, as a title, connotes. In Darcy and Elizabeth, Austen has drawn two very complex characters who, on the one hand, seem simply drawn and characterized, but on the other, are so much more than they seem. It would be easy to say that Darcy is arrogant and Elizabeth is willful. The truth is, looking beyond my own first impression, as a reader, Austen has deceptively crafted two characters whose thoughts and actions make it clear that they aptly straddle both of the title characteristics."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is one of my all time favorite reads!

They were the two best characters in the book. Mr. Bennet is funny too at the begging when he sayd he is not going to go talk to Mr. Bingley and he does.

Austen has spun an very romantic love story with this one, but it is much more than that. Her social commentary is biting and true, even for today's standards.

She didn't want to read it, so I did. As I dug right into it, I realized that my daughter, being only ten years old, was probably still a little young for it anyway. In fact, it was tough enough for me...Well, at least I can admit it.It amazes me that some books, such as this one written almost 200 years ago, are filled with such style and prose. It seems that in our modern day world, with our stereos, TV's, computers and toys, that many of us unfortunately, don't seem to have the time to broaden our vocabulary, and grammatical abilities as well as some did 200 years ago. I guess,.. in some ways, we have certainly regressed in the natural progression of our intellects. Interesting ... It does make you want to read more books that were written long ago,..and broaden your mind a tad.This was an interesting book, although a little slow at times; probably because of the huge gap in our cultural differences. I can see why it could possibly be considered a bit out of sync with the world of today. The book displayed what now would be considered an imbedded chauvinistic society's way of thinking; young women sitting around all day with the most important thing on their minds being, &quot;Who's going to come courting me today?&quot; But, I don't think that was any of Jane Austen's fault.All in all, it was a very well organized and written story of life and mannerisms of old British Regency."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I was assigned this book for my AP Literature class and the grunts and groans running through the room were audible. A comedy of manners at first seemed like it would be no comedy at all. From what others had told me, Jane Austen had always been lumped with that group of 19th century authors to avoid at all costs.I couldn't have been more wrong. Jane Austen is delightfully humorous and the sarcastic humor that underlies the characters of Elizabeth, Mr. Darcy and Mr. Bennett rounds out the book and the characters themselves. The protagonist, Elizabeth Bennett is an intelligent young woman stuck in the early 19th century. And while she is resigned to fitting the role of young women at the time, she is also able to see the silliness by which other girls govern their lives, and though she does nothing to warrant it, the reader automatically places her above the others. She contains all the elements of a charming protagonist as she is honest, intelligent and witty all at the same time.I loved Mr. Darcy, as well, on his first appearance. Admittedly he was haughty and conceited but from first sight Elizabth begins to chip away at his pride, though she frequently refuses to give him so much as a word. Reading the back cover I thought this was going to be a typical romance story, but it wasn't that either. Despite many other 'romances', the one the reader really wants to see is held off time and time again, and by the last few pages it feels like it may never come about.This is definitely worth reading and is above the ruin that college discussions will often cause."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It was with wonderful anticipation that I sat down with Jane Austen's seminal work, Pride and Prejudice. I had previous knowledge of Jane Austen only as a giant of Western literature, but I resolved to read her work after seeing the delightful Emma Thompson movie Sense and Sensibility. I briefly entertained the notion of reading the novel Sense and Sensibility, but decided instead upon Pride and Prejudice. Mainly because Pride and Prejudice is widely considered to be the better book, but also because I wanted to read one of Austen's works that I had no previous familiarity with the characters and plot. I can happily say that this book has awakened within me a voracious beast of a reader who has every intent of devouring every Austen novel he can get his hands on. It is a testament to Austen's incredible prowess as a writer that she is able to breathe life into a historical period that 21st century readers are far removed from, and by the end of the book you have come to look upon Elizabeth Bennet and Mr.Darcy, not as the heroine and hero of a book 200 years old, but as completely fleshed out characters who could exist in any time, in any novel. The reader comes to understand their joys, their pain, their defeats, and their ultimate triumph, as if these emotions were his own. The hallmark of all great literature is an ability to awaken in the reader a true sense of understanding for what the characters are thinking and feeling, and that is certainly the case in this wonderful book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I read this book recently as an SSR book for my Honors World Lit class. I'm a sophmore in high school. I found this book very interesting, although it was a bit hard to translate at times. I would recommend the book for any teens who want to read a challenging classic. :)"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I know, I know. How could I have let 19 years of my life pass by without reading this classic and constantly-alluded to novel? Yes, I delayed reading it for far too long, but it did not disappoint my anticipated expectations.In the opening chapters of the novel I was *gasp* - bored with the plot and characters. I was blasphemously thinking, &quot;Why has everyone made such a hype about this book for the past century or so? It's just a bunch of prissy girls wasting their lives away by waiting around on parties, dates, and personal Prince Charmings to whisk them away&quot;.However, as the novel went on, Austen's prowess at prose whisked me away, and I was totally intrigued. The Victorian world was opened up to me, and I tossed all former feminist theories momentarily aside as I became immersed in this setting, yearning for that time and place, where icould have lived like a princess and been loved by all, simply for being born female.I loved Austen's depiction of the relationship between Elizabeth and Jane, and I saw the closeness of my own relationship with my sister reflected in it. I was amused by Mary's disgust in boys and her blatant disregard for most people. Lucy and Kitty's attempts to capture the eyes and hearts of possible suitors were timeless characterizations of so many girls, at that time period and today. Most of all, I loved Mr. Bennett's sense of humor, and his remarks (especially those directed toward Mrs. Bennet) made me laugh out loud throughout the book.Count me in: I am the newest Jane Austen fan, and the one who deserves to receive the Procrastinator of the Century award for waiting so long to read her. For any of you who are putting off reading her like I did, there words of advice: do it, now. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Mrs. Bennet was a simple woman, with but one goal in life: to get her daughters married. She went about this task in a dedicated manner, pouncing on every man that comes by, from nobles to officers. Marriage was the only option for a respectable girl and the husband had to be chosen with care. We usually automatically make the assumption that the love and marriage go hand in hand. But at one time a marriage was thought of as a business transaction. Wealth and social standing were thought of first and foremost, love and happiness could come afterward. Any wealthy bachelor was \\"considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.\\" Elizabeth Bennet thought she knew better, for a happily ever after there had to be love and understanding. We follow her misadventures in search of happiness with a range of comical characters from her assertive, matchmaking mother to her arrogantly, meek cousin. Marriage, it seems, is more than both an economic decision and an emotional rush. We are given examples of each of these extremes through Elizabeth's sisters. Through this and Austen's humor and wit, we are given a delightful satire of the British matrimonial arrangements."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"it is a nice book for all age group."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I read this back when I was in Jr. High and fell head over heels in love with Jane Austen, with her sparkling wit and lively characters. Now, I am a college English major and after reading hunderds of books, I can safley say that this is still among my favorites. It is a classic story and an easy read in my mind, at least. The charcters of Lizzy and Darcy are among my favorite in all of literature.But after reading all the reviews on this site, I have became convinced that this is a book that does not belong in American High Schools. I had some of my friends read it in High School and they all loved it. I can only assume that we went to a batter HS or something, as every other bad review on this site (in fact, almost all the classic book reviews) it from some poor High School student who has never read a book over 200 pages in their life, doesn't know anything about literature ( I was laughing out loud at the \\"facts\\" presented in some of the 1 star reviews) and is just upset that they have to take time away from being spoon-fed things to pick up a book and think. It distresses me that we have become such a culture that we chide cultured books like this for not having sex and then turn around and call it a \\"soap opera\\" (anyone who has ever seen a soap opera and then read this book knows that there is no comparison between the two--for one, no soap opera writer has Austen's wit, her intellegence, her perception of the human condition).So, to potential buyers--it is a light, comic work that you shouldn't have to think about (don't believe the negative reviews--there is nothing deep in this) and I'm sure you will enjoy it, if you have a respect for art and a bit of intellegence. It is one of the best ove stories ever told. And if you are going to write a negative review, try not to make yourself look like an idiot in the process."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is one of my favorite books of all time! Although it was written about 2 centuries ago, it doesn't matter because it tells a timeless and believable story. All 5 Bennet daughters need to find husbands, preferably rich ones. How they go about it and how Elizabeth learns to love Mr. Darcy is absolutely fascinating, not only because of the way it is told, but because it shows people as they really are when something important is at stake. Fabulous!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I'm not sure what can be helpfully added to the 487 prior reviews of P&amp;P but I enjoyed this one so much that I must try. This is a fantastic work and should be the textbook for aspiring novelists' Storytelling 101 class. Austin's ability to create compelling characters that leap off the page and to maneuver them through an intelligent, gripping narrative is amazing. Despite the passage of 200 years, her characters resonate with their timeless flaws and virtues. I particularly enjoyed the snippets of intelligent, wry humor from both Elizabeth Bennett and, most notably, from her father Mr. Bennett. I finished the book on an airplane and struggled to stifle laughs.As an aside, the BBC/A&amp;E 5-6 hour version of P&amp;P is the best film adaptation of a classic book that I have ever seen and is well worth the time investment."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The plot is intriguing: an assembly of eligible men take short-term residence in a town full of unmarried women. As a result, several couples pair off and a few marry. The novel is concerned primarily with one couple: Eliza and Darcy.Obstacles prevent these two from seeing each other's worth. Darcy at first thinks Eliza possesses no great share of beauty. He is prejudiced and only sees her as a product of her class. But by gazing through the windows to her soul - her dark eyes - he slowly becomes fascinated by this enthralling beauty.Eliza, proud herself, will not accept the advances of a haughty, cold man like Darcy. Instead, she offers her affections to a bright-colored soldier, who possesses pleasing manners to match her own. But experience teaches her that a cool temper can hide love, and pleasing manners can mask cruelty.Appearances are deceiving, and lessons are hard learned in Pride and Prejudice, a light romance, occasionally skirting the depths of human psychology."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Being a 20 something male, I was not sure what to think when I picked up this novel. I knew that girls had always loved this book, so I set myself up for a girlie novel. Elizabeth, the protaganist, is anything but a simple girlie character though. This book attacks the social structure of Austen's days. The characters are deep and well written. Some are characatures for comic relief, but you still come away with the feeling that you have known someone like that in the past. This book is a classic for a reason. I recommend this book to anyone, not just love sick teenage girls."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I want to recommend you this novel,\\"Pride and Prejudice\\". Have you ever heard \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" and \\"Jane Austen\\"? I read it two times, last year and early this year. It's very interesting for me to read this book.Jane Austen lived small village so her view about world is limited and her works mainly deal with marriage. A model example is 'Pride and Prejudice'.There are many character in the novel. Many man character and woman character enter the story. At first, each person misunderstand each other but they remove misunderstanding and finally many man and woman character fall in love each other. The story is happy ending.Many character point the other man's mistake but they don't know their mistake. They realize that they made a misunderstanding, they begin to know themselves mistake. I think many people make a mistake like the character's mistake. I also the same so I read this novel and realized many things. I presume that maybe the novel teach you many things.The novel show character of realism. Generally realism literary work explain everything in details. 'Pride and Prejudice' is the same. Writer explain everything very detailed so people said that realism literary work is limited people's imagination. I don't agree with that because I think that the more detailed writer describe, the more detailed we image. For example, if the writer describe like that \\"There are a table and chair and a flower vase and so on.\\", I can image like that \\"maybe the table color is black and chair color is same, and.. maybe the flower are rose and forget-me-not. So I think realism literary works can make us more imaginative, just my opinion.I recommend 'Pride and Prejudice'. I'm sure that you'll be intersted in this novel and Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Is she proud and he prejudice? Maybe it is he who is proud and she who is prejudice? Despite the arguments that could be made both ways, Jane Austen does indeed do an excellent job in bringing together two people of such different moral standing and ensnare them in a delightful and romantic story.The heroine, Elizabeth Bennett, is a witty, presumptuous young lady with an uncontrollable urge to speak her mind. Her antagonist is the very wealthy and very blatant Mr. Darcy, who has his own ideas about how certain people should act and behave. So how can two people so wrong for each other and so different ever be brought together?Elizabeth finds herself alone with Mr. Darcy on many awkward occasions and always manages to say something to hurt his precious ego. I think it is absolutely amazing how he can fall in love with a woman who has nothing but utter disdain for him and everything he stands for. She is, however, an amazing woman.Elizabeth is caring and considerate and very much eager to be in love, although she sometimes hides it well. She has the utmost affection for her family, and especially for her older sister, whose heart she would gladly do anything to keep from breaking.In Mr. Darcy&#65533;s defense, he is a very well rounded gentleman. He has the highest and most prestigious upbringing. However, he lets his social status and wealth dictate his heart and cause him to spiral into a soul searching debate over love verses social standing.The entire story leaves the reader captivated and in agony, ready to flip to the end to see if Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth truly find love."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"\\"It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.\\" Thus begins the novel \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" by Jane Austen. Written nearly two centuries ago, the novel still seems fresh and new owing to its radiance of wit and uncanny sense of candor. The characters are quirky, at times satirical. However, their actions and concerns mirror those of our own. Should we value property, position and esteem over virtue and principle? Should we forgo all romantic notions of love and marriage and instead be practical and settle for material wealth and security? These are questions the characters in this novel ask themselves and each other. It is a comedy of manners, but also, a story about young people trying to make rational and intelligent choices, pulled this way and that by their morals, their conscience, and often, their mothers.At the center of the story are Elizabeth Bennet, an intelligent and opinionated young woman, and Mr. Darcy, a proud, haughty gentleman. They meet and almost immediately, dislike each other - Elizabeth because she finds Mr. Darcy incredibly proud and completely lacking in humor; Mr Darcy because he thinks Elizabeth and her family are beneath his station in life. But one cannot help who one loves, and Mr. Darcy eventually feels great admiration for her. Elizabeth, on the other hand, realizes that she has been too quick to judge, and begins to look upon Mr. Darcy with some measure of interest. What follows is a delicate waltz of flirtation and witty repartee. We the readers, 21st century get-up-and-go, can't-stop-for-a-minute workaholics, then have the bucolic pleasure of bearing witness as to which will melt away first in the warmth of true affection - Mr. Darcy's pride, or Ms. Bennet's prejudice."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen, in her novel Pride and Prejudice, contrasts characters through a battle of social conflict. Elizabeth Bennet, a young woman of lively character, strives against an equal adversary, Fitzwilliam Darcy, a man well endowed by fortune. As the two haughtily battle wits, Mr. Darcy falls in love with Elizabeth, further complicating the story's intricate plot; while Elizabeth's sister, Jane, falls for Mr. Bingley, Mr. Darcy's best friend. Mr. Darcy's pride against Elizabeth's social standings and Elizabeth's unfounded prejudice against Mr. Darcy's seemingly snobbish habits form a classic tale of romance and humor.The intricate twists of fate intertwine the lovers in their conquests, defeats, and humbling of character. Mix-ups in the tale create a humorous love story with a relish for varied characters undoubtedly human in their emotions and actions. Austen vividly illustrates contrast in social class during the Regency era while exposing human flaws. Characters such as Mrs. Bennet, Lydia and Mr. Wickham warn the reader of the mishaps caused by characters unscrupulous in their wayward actions. Yet as the story unfolds, one cannot help but fall in love with this tale of a man and a woman beset by emotions they fall victim to."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This classic detailed description of the problems faced in olden day England regarding women, enchanted my mind immediately from the books first sentence. Jane Austen's brillaince shines through on every page.Having been my first Jane Austen novel, I am most delighted to have read such fine quality of the English Language.Not only was this book captivating , but it also has relevant issues present in todays modern society! This has definitely been the best book I've ever read and the movie brings to life Jane Austen's best ever 'Pride and Prejudice'"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Enjoyed this more thoroughly than expected. This is a story about the potential damage or fortune derived from preconceived societal notions. This is a story about standing up to social conventions in an age where such a concept was unthinkable, not to mention before its time. Taken slowly, poetically and whimsically, the human drama in this book is deeply touching, and can be appreciated by every culture on the globe.There are 5thousand reviews here, so I won't go into further detail, but rest assured, it's a CLASSIC and it's worth a read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I was a little intimidated at first when I began this book, afraid I wouldn't be able to understand the old English language and terms.

Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen was PAINFUL to read.PAINFUL!!!!!The book is filled with rich people being super proper. Oh my goodness it was bad.Although a little more than halfway through the book, I did start to enjoy it. Mainly because they stopped being so stuffy and started being a little more real.There were a bunch of funny, underhanded proper comments, similar to something like \\"Why, doesn't she look pretty today?\\" but really meaning that she's super ugly and happens to have made herself look good for this moment.The overall story line: Daughters find people to become their husbands.Done.I just couldn't handle it.But it's a classic and I already know some of you are going to agree with me while others are like shouting at the screen in frustration at my review.So tell me your thoughts on Pride and Prejudice!Thanks for reading,Rebecca @ Love at First Book"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Brilliant writing. What a use of the English language. So rich and complex. It takes a while to get into her writing stylewhich is so sophisticated and witty.Besides her use of the language which makes &#34;american English&#34; so much more pitiful, it is incredible how she weavesa fascinating tale, page after page, on the basis of a very simple story: i.e. boy meets girl.One is constantly in suspense and the level of eroticism is so high without even a hint of touch between the twoprotagonists for more than half the book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"All I had hoped for and then some!!!

I had lost all aileron control and the self-sealing fuel tanks, well, were no longer self-sealing. I had to eject fast or I would auger in from 10,000 feet. I fought my way out of the pilot seat against the compiling G-forces and scrambled with a sob in my throat through the open hatchway.Tumbling in free fall. Feeling of helplessness. Cold air rushing past my ears.

While there may be no accounting for taste or I'm just missing something, I'm not sure how anyone can enjoy reading this. It ultimately boils down to some sisters trying to marry (up, for the most part) in the world. I guess, if I try real hard, I can see some people imagining themselves in the scenes and enjoying the idea of living in the same town, wearing the same clothes, going to the same events, etc., but nothing really ever happens. It just goes on and on and on, only to lead this sister ending up with that guy, this sister ending up with that guy, etc."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I am so disappointed. Being a fan of classic literature I was looking forward to reading Pride & Prejudice. But what I got was moderately-well written chick lit. Think of Pride and Prejudice as the Bridgit Jones of the 18th Century.The story-line is predictable - you know how the whole novel is going to play out after the first couple of pages. The only thing that kept me going was the hope that there would be some little twist. Maybe Jane would end up with Darcy, or something a little more interesting. Unfortunately not.I honestly think Austen was writing a parody of women. The only concern of every female character in the book is to get married to a rich, well-to-do gentleman. Of course, some will argue that Elizabeth is different, but as she states herself, her interest in Darcy is only aroused when she sees what a wonderful estate he owns and considers that she may be the lady of it. Each of the female characters are shallow, self-centred (Jane excepted) and vacuous.On the positive side, some of the characters are interesting - Mr. Bennet is amusing, and Darcy started out being intriguing before turning into a school girl-like idiot.Perhaps, if you're a fan of straight-down-the-line, predictable romantic (semi comedic at times) novels then you might enjoy this. But don't expect to find a masterful tale, expertly told. Unfortunately that is what I was expecting (it being a \\"classic\\" and all) and I was totally disappointed. I really think this is one of the worst books I have ever read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have read Pride and Prejudice 17 times and the wonder is that I fallen in love with it.The cheerful nature of Elizabeth,the admiration of Mr.Darcy,the family's joys, sorrows,hopes,fears have been so well described by the writer Jane Austen,that anyone can like it. The story depicts the charactes of the beautiful Jane,witty Elizabeth,their mother and father,the handsome Mr.Darcy, the Bingleys and the Lucases.Jane Austen's spirited Elizabeth,charms her way into the proud and cold heart of Mr.Darcy. And this love story is certainly CHARMING."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is by far, in my opinion, the best of Jane Austen's works. I can't really say what makes it that fabulous, but once you started reading, you can't stop. Jane Austen had fully developed the characteristics of Elizabeth, and made her very human. The feelings stitched into the story has made an impact on the readers' mind, enabling to feel for the characters themselves. This, I think, is a very important point why I consider this book one of her best."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"WONDERFUL!!!! That is the best description of this wonderful love story. I fell in love with the book from start to finish. It was magnificently written and the charecters were wonderfully portrayed. It is a glorious love story which has much below the surface.

Lizzy Bennett is the most delightful heroine of all time, and Darcy will spoil women for real men for all time.

Everybody gets what they deserve in the end, and there is not a loose end to be found.

This is an enjoyable and even slightly challenging book that I reccomend to EVERYONE! I love it! Rebekah Robblee"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book was a required reading for university. I was not quite certain what to think.....that is until I started to get into the book. This novel is a delightful and intriguing romantic comedy. The pride of Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett's prejudice against him are overcome as they learn that love can and does conquer. Elizabeth was a character I could relate to. She was not afraid to stand up for herself and overcame conventions, like walking through mud to see her sick sister, Jane!Perhaps I am not the most qualified to write a review of Jane Austen's work, but I know what I like. This book had me laughing from beginning to end. With Mr. Collins' &quot;speeches&quot; and Mrs. Bennett desperately trying to marry off all her daughter's, who can help themselves?

There is so much conversations and it can get really confusing sometimes."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice, what a long book!!! Pride and Prejudice consists of 3 books. In those days, authors were forced to write extremely long novels, if not, chances are, the novel would have not been printed. With sitting by a fire, and reading the favorite means of entertainment, novels had to be long , to take up time. Basically, thats all Pride and Prejudice did for me, take up time. If the novel would have been condensed into one book, it would have been much better, and probably would have received 5 stars from me. Elizabeth, the star character is very likeable and we all seem to look up to her.

The story is hard to follow, too detailed about mundane things. The story line is so slow I just gave up. I enjoy historical romances and I figured a classic, right? Should be good. Nope, it was a waste of my time."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I did not have a favorite chapter but the chapter that I found most interesting is chapter eight because in that chapter Elizabeth and Darcy meet again at the Bingley's house and Darcy feels dumb because Elizabeth had rejected him, and they had not seen each other since that had happened.I feel that this book is for the age group of 20-40 and I think that it's more for girls then guys. I'm not trying to sound sexist, but I don't think that guys would find the story interesting.One literary device that I appreciate is the conflict between Elizabeth and Darcy. Elizabeth does not like Darcy at first, and she rejects him when he proposed. But then she falls in love with him.I found the book all right; it was not that boring. However it was really long and I did not have enough time to read it and understand it well. I would not read this book again because it's not my type of book.

I was pretty much forced to read this book for a summer reading assignment. I found it to be utterly boring. The real question here is why do I really care if the mother has all of her daughters married off to wealthy parnters, or any partner if it must come down to it? Maybe it was a big deal back in the time, but nobody cares nowadays. Maybe it is a 'literary masterpiece', but then why the heck is it so boring? We need to move on from the old 'classics'. They mean nothing to readers (are there many left?) of the modern society."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and prejudice, is a novel on the love and hate of a man and a woman who are perfect for each other from the beginning but do not realize it until the end. It is about how a great love overcomes the prejudices that two of the main characters have for each other. This novel, in my opinion was everlasting and boring. One would be able to predict the outcome of the novel from the beginning, but must spend endless hours of reading to finally see the plot unwind. Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy have a great hate for each other in the beginning, but slowly, thorough out the novel, begin to bid farewell to their prejudices of each other and find a love for each other they never knew they could have. I did not enjoy reading this novel due to the fact that romance is not my favorite topic, especially when it is \\"old school\\" love. I did not appreciate this book in anyway and wish that I never chose to read it. I would not recommend this book to anyone who hates reading as much as I do and is disturbed at the fact that one would enjoy reading about love when they can just look out the window and see it happening right in front of them. Pride and Prejudice is a novel that did not interest me, but may interest those old grannies that jump and express their happiness when everlasting romance novels end in happiness."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I hated this book. It was difficult to read, because Austen never seemed to get to the point, and everything seemed to happen so slowly. The characters seemed so pompous, it was ridiculous.

Thus, it doesn't make any sense to think that a novel like this one is really any better than say, Michael Crichton or Stephen King. Aesthetic standards can't be grounded.Thus, don't listen to anyone who tries to distinguish between &quot;serious&quot; works of literature like this one and allegedly &quot;lesser&quot; novels. The distinction is entirely illusory, because no novels are &quot;better&quot; than any others, and the concept of a &quot;great novel&quot; is an intellectual hoax."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Please, this was an utterly unconvincing and boring novel. If it wa written today it would be internationally acclaimed for being a dummed down soap opera. Unfortunately, having been composed in, what, the 1830s, it has become a period drama style romance novel, where instead of foreplay, they have to bow and curtsy and everything. Althought this may appeal to worthless romantics, it will not perform well to the MTV generation. The movie starred Hugh Grant. Please........."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" by Jane Austen, is a book about the life of a girl, Elizabeth Bennet. She has five sisters and lives with her mother and father in 18th century England. The story tells of her sisters' loves and marriages. Elizabeth's youngest sister gets married to a man of questionable character, who happens to be the friend of the man that Elizabeth herself loves, Mr. Darcy. Of course Elizabeth's love isn't that simple, since she first has to hate Mr. Darcy and then blames him for everything that her sister is going through. Jane, Elizabeth's oldest sister, falls in love with another of Darcy's friends. All the trouble that any of Elizabeth's not-quite-normal family has is blamed on Mr. Darcy.Basically, the whole book is about an 18th century girl whining about her upper middle class life. Of course, at the end, she gets exactly what she wants and everyone lives happily ever after. There is credit to be given to Jane Austen, since she wrote the book in an American household in the early 1800s, with no support from any of her family. She had to hide her writing under knitting or sewing whenever someone approached. She then had a friend publish the books she wrote, without telling her husband. Considering all that, the story really isn't that bad, but in general, if you were looking for a book by Jane Austen, Emma would be a better read. If you want a predictable love story, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a good book for you."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is the best book I have ever rea"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen is so wonderful. She Writes so well, it is no wonder she is one of the best known authors of all time. Pride and Prejudice has got to be the best book I have ever read. I love Elizabeth Bennet, even more because I am also an Elizabeth myself and I feel I can relate very well to her in many ways. I just adore this book, I could hardly put it down, I finally had to stop reading when my butt started falling asleep. I is so exciting to find out who will marry who, and to see Mr. Darcy change his manners and Elizabeth change her mind. The elegance of the novel truly added to the characters and the setting. I loved Mr. Bennet, and how he and Mrs. Bennet argued so casually. This book makes me want to get married and find a Mr. Darcy of my own. Read this book and enjoy!!! It is truly marvelous!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is just plain fun!

I love reading, but this book just seemed a bit boring. Well, once I began reading it, my opinion drastically changed. It is so well-written. The characters are so real- granted, some are a bit exaggerated, but that seems to be Austen's point...exaggerating the faults of society. The tension between Elizabeth and Darcy, and the subplots with the other characters draw together a fine novel. I also completely enjoyed the fact that there was not a lot of description in the book; it let you form your own opinion of how the settings and characters looked.

There's something about opening the book and reading the lines those lines which are so familiar to me that gives me a comforting feeling,. It's the same feeling as coming home after a long time.

The main character struggles to find her place in the world while dealing with social pressures and expectations. She falls in love with a man that is from a different rank, so the commentary on society ends up being wrapped in a love story. If you like British literature from that time period, you will love this story. I think it is a good book, but it's not really my particular genre."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I do not often find myself reading female authors, but when I do, it is always in the classics. Jane Austen is deserved known as one of the best. \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is witty and memorable. I need not say more. I cannot see how this brilliant work could do anything but polarise opinion, there is no middle ground."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I always feel unworthy to review anything classical, or that even written a long time ago, for the simple fact it is not my place to critise the masters of the written work, or to even begin to understand what it was like to live in that era. Therefore, I am left without an option but to base a review on the level of my enjoyment, which is no reflection of how great the novel is written or what a classical piece of artistry it may be. I cannot give this novel 5 stars because I truely found my attentiion wavering, and I felt thankful that the book, which seemed drawn out to me, was closing to end. It is undoubtably a classic storyline, the 'prejudice' of Mr Darcy, the love developing between the unlikely, but I had seen the movie, and generally knew the storyline, but felt to fully apperciate this story, I must have read it. Maybe that contributed to the sense of boredom that came with this novel to a degree, particularly whilst it was winter (in the novel) and Mr Darcy and Jane's friend were out of town. I got sick of the letters in the book, and began to think about other things while reading them, increasing the time it took me to read it. Sadly, I think with a increased patience, I could have really liked this novel, but I just was thankful I had finished it. I am sorry to burst any 'Pride and Prejudice loving' bubbles, just telling it how I saw it. Then again, I don't really know that much about the classics."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I liked this book, because it describes a situation that isn't weird. It could really have happened. I was surprised that I liked this book, because classic books are mainly boring, because of the fact that things happen very slowly. In Pride and Prejudice things didn't happened quickly but the book kept your attention.Melissa Nuis"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"There seems to be a tendency to interpret the works of Jane Austen in political terms (Jane Austen and the State, Jane Austen and the French Revolution) which overlooks the question of gender and class conventions in Austen's novels, which go to establish the comic tone they bear so well. The critical introductions for Pride and Prejudice in both World's Oxford Classics and Penguin, by Isobel Armstrong and Vivien Jones respectively, do follow this trend and tend to overlook the rigours of feminist criticism, as appeared in Marilyn Butler's Jane Austen and the War of Ideas. As a post-revolutionary romance, Pride and Prejudice provides a reflection of political events, but this theme is only secondary to the critique of class and gender conventions, and which is only indirectly related to political conditions.The use of silence, or the withholding of information, as a narrative strategie to produce the complications in the plot that go to make up the story, follows from this indirect association. Another important theme in the novel is the difference between public and private space. The exchanges of information (gossip, if you may) between the characters, particularly between Elizabeth and her relatives and friends, reveal a society in which individual worth and reputation is decided by rumour. When rumour is too strong, this is, shared by many, it may not be worth one's while to attempt to change it even if it is found to be false. It is for this reason that Wickham is allowed to fulfil his mania for elopement and achieve a suitable marriage.It is no surprise that a society so concerned with opinion should be given to prejudice, this is, the conversion of uninformed unfavourable opinion into a general judgement. Prejudice is by no means to be seen as a privilege of the aristocratic class. The community at Longbourn are seen to be equally capable of misjudging and misrepresenting character, in particular Mr Darcy's.Elizabeth's one aristocratic feature in her character is her general dissatisfaction with everything she sees. Her critical gaze links her to the aristocratic crew that she meets and alienates her from her surroundings. But if she wants to become one with Darcy's \\"family party\\" it is precisely this quality that she is to tame. By looking at Pemberley's grounds, she learns to express her own (sensuous) satisfaction with things as they are.Elizabeth's sensual gaze has been educated through the novel in a process of humiliation and denial. It is when she accepts the humbling experience of Charlotte's wedding and goes to visit the Collins' that she learns to appreciate the stately fixity of Rosings and starts to give the appropriate steps to becoming Darcy's consort.In the words of Isobel Armstrong in the Oxford World's Classics \\"Introduction\\": \\"it is through the uncomfortable limits of sexual signals that the novel indirectly explores a deep political question: when is it right to conceal or to reveal information; when isit right to speak out?\\" Nevertheless, this question is in the novel less political than gender and class- based.\\"Female elegance\\", according to Mr Collins, consists in \\"rejecting a man on the first application\\". Affectation is taken for granted among women, which poses a problem for women who, like Elizabeth, wish to decline a proposal in spite of their economic need. Twenty years had scarcely passed after the publication of Mary Wollstonecraft's Vindication of the Rights of Women, and it is characteristic of the peculiar genius of Jane Austen that she had already produced the first post-feminist heroine, a woman capable of turning the issue of marriage into an unselfish and pleasurable conquest - unselfish, because by marrying Darcy Elizabeth establishes her family socially, and pleasurable, because in accepting the stately home of Pemberley she fully reconciles herself to the sensuousness of life -."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Sorry, I don't want to step on any toes, but I found Pride & Prejudice to be slow and plodding. In fact, I finished it only for the sake of doing so. Since it was written by a woman and is told primarily from a woman's perspective, given its considerable popularity I can only assume that it is enjoyed more by women than by men. If it wasn't a classic I might even have given it two stars (and I enjoy many of the classics very much)."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Why is this still being published?

Jane Austen uses impeccable, meticulous language full of long descriptions and explanations to give the reader insight into the minds of all the characters. The character development indicates the author's striking understanding of human nature and acute observation of human tendencies. The story provides an intricate plot involving the intertwining lives and feelings of a few characters and is based more on character development than on actual events. Although the book is complex and somewhat wordy, it is interesting and not all that difficult to read. The story shows how individual tendencies and personalities can get in the way of love and happiness. It also adeptly portrays inter-family relationships and the profound impact they can have. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in classic fiction, or who enjoys stories about people and their relationships with one another."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I love this book so much!

Jane Austen's characters like Elizabeth Bennett, Mr. Darcy, and the bad lady Miss Bingley Jane all add to this complicated plot. Elizabeth Bennett is very well shown character, maybe the best ever written This novel is an excellent example of Austen's literary power. Her ladies are to be admired for they marry for love not the social reasons. There is a lot of pressure in society to marry in your social class but love should be the main reason. Maybe the reason it seems a bit long is there are many characters, it is difficult to keep up with them all. Pride and Prejudice has to be read at least twice to catch everything and everybody. But it is an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Remembered reading this in high school and not fully understanding a lot of the complex issues raised in this book. It's nice to have another read at an older age to appreciate the author's words, and have a better understanding of what makes this such a classic book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I decided to reread this classic because I wanted to read PD James' new novel which continues the story of Darcy and Elizabeth after their marriage when there is a murder. I wondered if I would enjoy this book after reading it some decades ago and seeing at least one movie version of it. To my delight, I found the rereading fun. The statement that a classic is a classic because people enjoy reading it is true. The book is filled with humor and witty social comments. Jane Austen pocks fun at the generally uneducated women of her age, their silliness, their interest in looking beautiful, men, marriage, and family, the strong difference between them and the men in their lives, and how some very intelligent women, such as Elizabeth Bennet, stand out despite not being as beautiful as her sisters, and accomplishing more than them. This was a time when a woman walking three miles was unusual and women reading non-fiction was extraordinary.The story focuses on Elizabeth and on Darcy's pride. He is very good looking, rich, more intelligent than most of the people he encounters, and sees their foolish behavior and thoughts as a waste of time and absurd. His first impression of Elizabeth is negative. Looking only at her surface, he sees a young woman who is not as beautiful as others at a party. As a result, he makes a remark that Elizabeth overhears, that disparages her. Later, he sees the beauty of her character and intelligence. But Elizabeth has become blind to his worth because of the prejudice created by his remark, and she avoids him. The story becomes even more interesting when other characters are introduced and we read about the five Bennet girls and their parents' reactions to them. Some seem good or bad at first, but are they, and why do they seem like they do?"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I finally read P&P; at the insistence of a very good friend...we disagreed on the merits of the recent Keira Knightley P&P; film (I liked it; she didn't)...she challenged me to read the book so that i would understand, and now I do!The goal of all the great novels, the experts tell us, is to arrive at some fundamental TRUTH.The genius of Jane Austen was that she told us the truth from the get go: \\"that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\\" and the MORE important truth: \\"However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.\\"And by declaring the truth from the get go, she brilliantly illuminates it throughout.This is a book for EVERYONE:For fathers (like me!), who love all their children, but recognize each for their faults and good parts...delights in the marriage of their daughters if they will be happy (like I am going through now)...the most touching part for me was how much Mr. Bennet loved Elizabeth and Jane and missed Elizabeth so much when she was gone.For children, especially, teens who are MORTIFIED at the behaviour of their parents in front of their friends. I mean, could Mrs. Bennet BE more embarrassing?!For brothers and sisters, to see the beauty and challenge of being siblings, especially in a large family!But, especially, for people who are - as Jane Austen put it - *violently* in love. She expressed it so well in the almost manic internal ponderings of Elizabeth and even Darcy, and and all at once: I hate him/her, I love him/her, I hope he/she will see me, I hope he/she doesn't come, how could he be so uncivil, how could he/she be so kind, I think he/she loves me, he/she could never love me...and also the joy of being friends before being lovers.I loved how she portrayed Mr Collins only in terms of his ridiculous language and habits; the filmmakers \\"cheated\\" by making Collins short to be ridiculous and then piled on; Austen saw the comedy not in his stature but in his silliness.I also loved the emphasis on letter writing to pour out ones fears and feelings...it is a lost art and we are the worse for it.The only thing I didn't like, and will likely never appreciate, is a culture where people don't have to show up at work everyday...I just don't get it...I guess that's why I enjoy historical fiction of common folks of the 18th and 19th century (by Matthew Pearl, Louis Bayard, David Liss, and others), where even the elite have to actually *do* something.I thanks my friend and Miss Austen for helping me appreciate a true classic!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"\\"I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which laid the foundation. It is too long age. I was in the middle before I knew that I had begun.\\"This sentence is from the novel Pride and Prejudice, the most famous book written by Jane Austen. The author set the background as conservative and traditional British countryside life which still pay attention to the reputation and have their own social circle. It contrasts with the people who are upper- class. They are selfish and prideful. Through five middle class girls how to choose love shows the values of marriage in that time, in that society. But among them there still exists people like Mr. Darcy and Mr. Bingley who finally choose their true love. And the sentence expresses the true love in a class structure society is really cherished between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth. It fully shows Mr. Darcy's love to Elizabeth.For a long time, because of Mr. Darcy's pride, he hides his love to Elizabeth. It leads to Elizabeth has a misunderstanding to Mr. Darcy since the first time they meet. As the most important themes in this novel, love plays a special role in this book. The whole story develops around the different barriers in the true love and how people to respond these difficulties. And all of these difficulties come from one reason that is the social force. The social structure makes Mr. Darcy's pride that he feels like he should be proud of himself. Because he is richer than others and live in the upper- class. At the same time, it also the social structure makes Elizabeth's prejudice. She knows she and her family is just in a middle- class. So she is more sensitive than others and she does not want others such as Mr. Darcy looks down upon her. But just because of her sensitive, it makes her different from other girls. Elizabeth is the most intelligent girl in her family. She is clever and high- hearted. When she first meets Mr. Darcy, she has a really poor impression about him. Mr. Darcy is a wealthy and intelligent gentleman, so faces Elizabeth's prejudice; he chooses to be silent and does not explain anything. When he proposes to Elizabeth, Elizabeth determined rejects him and mentions Wickham's deceit. But Mr. Darcy still says nothing about it, the only thing he says is \\"I don't want to talk about it at all.\\" This is just one obstacle between them. Before they realize their sincerely love to each other, they have faced the different troubles and numerous stumbling blocks- Miss Bingley's snobbery, Lady Catherine's attempt to control her nephew, Mrs. Bennet's idiocy and Wickham's lies. All of these obstacles make a big difficulty exist in their love. Especially, the class- structure and reputation is more serious. The class- structure is really significant in that society. There are so many differences between them. They have the totally different life style since they were born. So from the origin of their mind is different. In the beginning, Mr. Darcy's pride to the people who live in the countryside hurts Elizabeth a lot. He thinks as girl as Elizabeth should be happy that he loves. Therefore, in the first time he says courtship to Elizabethj, he thinks she would love to say \\"yes.\\" But he gets an unexpected answer. And finally he knows Elizabeth in the only woman who loves him, not his money. So he helps Elizabeth's sister Lydia and Wickham, who is a fortune- hunting officer. And he explains all things through the letter from Elizabeth's aunt. He earned his love back. That proves love is a force that can be separated from social structure and facts and it shows love can conquer anything even the hardest thing- people's mind.Reputation is another theme in the novel; it helps to strengthen the difficulty between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth. For Elizabeth, reputation is not that important for middle class girl. She prefers to live with her family than cares about the reputation. So when she knows her sister Jane is ill, she walks to Netherfiled alone. She arrives with muddy skirt, to the shock of reputation- conscious Mass Bingley and her friends. She does not care how people judge her. In Miss Bingley's eyes, her behavior is absolute not acceptable in the upper- class. From Miss Bingley's reaction, it expresses Elizabeth's unique and her natural personality. But when sister elopes with Wickham and lives with him out of wedlock, the reputation- conscious happened again. Bennet family is not invited to the ball anymore, and even they walk as they run. Whatever Elizabeth does not care her reputation, but her family cannot avoid it. The social force still exists in her life. She cannot escape from it. But in her most difficult time, Elizabeth finds Mr. Darcy is the only person that wants to help her to find her sister back, give her sister money and solved all problems for them. She suddenly realizes she is wrong about her prejudice. So she decides to accept Mr. Darcy's courtship. They break the social structure and rules and finally get married.This novel reflects how people treat marriage in that society. People only pursue wealth and reputation. Girls can marry with a guy such as Mr. Collins, only for his money. Parents pay attention to the man who their daughter will marry is rich, not whether their daughter really loves him. They pursue social position instead of love. But just because of that, it shows the true love between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth is special and cherished. The author in this novel also tries to tell people, in this world we need to change, change can solve anything."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"One friend asked me why the book, Pride and Prejudice, became one of the most famous classics of all time. She knew it exemplified a great English writing style, but after reading the book, it only gave her the impression of an early 19th century \\"chick-flick\\", targeted for fans of romance novels. The book, however, offered me not only a witty, romantic comedy but also educational and historical values through the realistic depictions of an early 19th century English society.Throughout the whole book, the main characters constantly reminded me of the famous maxim: Don't judge a book by its cover. When the heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, meets the male character, Darcy, she finds him handsome, young and rich; the type of men that any women during her time period would consider to be the perfect husband. But his proud arrogance and aloofness prick her pride, causing her to stubbornly decide to dislike Darcy. This fire of hatred is further fueled along when Wickham, a handsome soldier, wins Liz's heart through his seemingly agreeable personality. Providing her with spiteful lies about Darcy, Wickham helps Liz's prejudice to grow. When the truth is reveled, however, Liz realizes that she had made the wrong impressions about both Darcy and Wickham based upon their exterior behaviors and appearances. In fact, Wickham turns out to be a scandalous liar whose addiction for gambling has broke him poor and Darcy turns out to be a truly noble person who knows how to care for and love those dear to him.In the end, Liz learns to correct her mistake of making misimpression and eventually marries Darcy who loves her for who she really is. This unrealistically happy ending, however, caused me to be aware of the real matrimony system in the early 19th century. The main characters ended happily; a girl from a poor family married the perfect man from a wealthy background due to their true, inseparable love. But other characters showed otherwise. For example, Liz's friend, Charlotte Lucas, agreed to marry Mr. Collins despite the fact that her friend had rejected him a few days ago. No love existed in this marriage obviously, but Charlotte could not have been happier as the marriage had much benefit for her: it saved her from her poor financial status and even from the shame of remaining unmarried at her old age. Just like Charlotte, many lower class women settled to be content with marriages, if they brought them or their families a little benefit.On the other hand, Ms. Bingley and Lady Catherine show how the upper class of the early 19th century married. Ignoring love mostly, both compared Darcy's social class, financial status, and family background to judge if marrying herself (Ms. Bingley's case) or her daughter (Lady Catherine's case) would be the most advantageous combination. In both cases, the source of wealth and power could be traced as the men, whom the women had to depend on and negotiate with to marry as best as they could. Both classes considered greatly the effects on the future and the family that the marriage would bring and the way how these female character perceived marriages proved how the real women during the early 19th century actually married.In conclusion, Pride and Prejudice should not be only read for observing Jane Austen's talent in writing or for mere enjoyment of romantic comedy, but also for development in mature perception and the cultural history that the book offered. Pride and Prejudice is an educational novel that clearly depicts the difficulty in forming perspective about other people and the dangers that could arise when our impressions or senses are trusted too much. It does not only offer an insight into how women of the early 19th century really lived but shows their lifestyle, way of thinking and the harsh reality of the matrimony system."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I've read this book a million times. That is, I've read the library's book as well as an old 80's edition that had pages ripped out and taped back together. I ordered this copy as a special gift to me to celebrate my favorite author. This edition is beautiful and well worth the buy. While being a new edition, it has the feel of an older one."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I took me years to read this book! It started when I was 12 years old, a friend of my moms gave me the A&E; version on VHS tape, you know, the one with Colin Firth!!! After watching all 6 hours of that for day's in a row, i found it hard to sit down and read the book?But then I got my Kindle, and this was one of the first book I read! It was great to have the details filled in that the movie left out, and also to have the image of Colin Firth in my head as Mr. Darcy! I love this book and the A&E; version of it! : I am now 26 years old, so it took me about 14 years for me to finally read the book, but it was well worth it.

I was struck by the clear, realistic writing and I finished it in two days. I hated having to put it down every few chapters to write in my journal about it. This book has a great message in it--for a clue, look at the title. P&amp;P is all that it's said to be...a classic novel with a heart-warming lesson within it's pages. The romance between Eliza and Darcy is thrilling. The characters of Eliza's parents are hilarious. I loved the style of the writing-not flowery or rambling.

This is from a 18 year girl. so a must read for all."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"With a perusal of this book one will find the snobbery of the time yet Austen reveals this in an amusing way. I found when reading this book i am quite fluttered about the story because of the richness of the characters and the plot. With reading this book another time one finds a new detail not seen the first time around. This is truly an inspiration of a book that shows politeness still remains locked in books and in forgotten parts of time."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"&quot;P+P&quot; is one of those rare and delightful reads which tugs the heartstrings even more each time you pick it up. This story combines razor-sharp wit and genuine feeling to produce a thoroughly pleasing result. Elizabeth and Darcy are vibrant characters with whom you can genuinely sympathize. One doesn't feel detached from the plot and conflicts despite the myriad differences between Regency England and late 20th century America. In short, &quot;Pride &amp; Prejudice&quot; remains my all-time favorite book, bar none. To the high-school student of &quot;Brit Lit&quot; who cannot bear another &quot;thee&quot; or &quot;thou&quot;, take a chance on this book. Austen is a refreshing change, and will most likely prove a pleasant surprise."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is the type of book that you never want to end. Jane Austen has an incredible way of connecting her characters to one another and makes the reader anxiously anticipate the story's final love scene. Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy are two of the most unforgettable characters in literature. The transformations of their characters is lovely to experience, over and over again!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is one of the best books I've read. The characters are realistic, yet all are classic 'types'. Elizabeth and Darcy play well off each other, with quazi-ralistic dialoge and beautiful settings. The book lets the modern reader into a time and place not seen any more. The fashions, people, and places are all interesting. Austen tells a wonderful story with side plots and interesting characters. You'll laugh at Mr. Collins' speeches and Mr. Bennet's way of looking at the world, get angry at Lady Catherine and her high handed ways, and dispair over Lydia's and Mrs. Bennet's silliness. A great book to curl up with."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is so great that if I didn't have school the next day I would read the book within a day. It's so amazing when I finished the book and I reread parts of the book when I finished. Boys might even be interested in this book.

And Darcy is surely one of the most appealing male characters in English literature. What a pity we aren't all Elizabeths..."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I loved this book when I read it in junior high, and over the years it has become, as much as I can say this about any book, my favorite. If I could write well enough to do the book justice, I wouldn't be a programmer, but I can say that it satisfies my craving for &quot;romantic slop&quot; without being in the least sloppy, and it entertains with both low comedy and keen perception. But my favorite feature of the book is what I've heard described as the &quot;comic precision&quot; of the speech of the characters. It would take a week of polishing to utter a single such phrase, and the idea of a group of people bantering effortlessly in this manner fills me with delight. And to the high school kid that said it wasn't &quot;profound&quot; enough: I might have said the same thing 25 years ago, but now the books that I thought profound then seem obvious, tedious, and/or pompous. I imagine that 25 years from now you will appreciate Austen more than you do today..."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The first time I read Pride and Prejudice I was in seventh grade and I found it difficult to read and of little interest; so when I picked it up again as a senior in high school and discovered its brilliance it came as quite a surprise. I should not have been surprised, however, for any work authored by Jane Austen is bound to be genius. With her witty dialogue that had me laughing out loud and the heartachingly poignant love fiascos that left me in tears of frustration, she successfully turned me into another Darcy fanatic.The characters are timeless-Elizabeth with her candor and brilliance, Darcy with his romantic soul waiting to explode, and Mr. Bennet with his stoic attitude towards the Mrs.-and the plot will never grow old. Even if the book were as long as War and Peace I would not be deterred if I knew I was to be rewarded with the defining moment when Elizabeth returns Darcy's declaration of love. What makes this book what is though is not just the tryst between Elizabeth and Darcy, but the social commentaries Austen makes about the period and all of the outcomes that are swayed by the civilities of society. Clearly a classic that remains just as magical as the day it was written, Pride and Prejudice should be required reading for everyone, boys and girls alike (hey you boys out there might just learn something from Darcy's quiet love approach)."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Even though Jane Austen might sound stuffy and old fashioned, her enthralling novel Pride and Prejudice is as pleasing today as it was in the 1800's when it was written. The story is all about two girls-Jane and Elizabeth Bennet- and their trials and tribulations in middle-class, snobby English society. Austen uses sophisticated word choices and witty remarks to portray what life was really like, and how everything wasn't always as it seemed. The main character, Elizabeth Bennet, finds herself caught up in an elaborate love triangle--involving her sister, Jane, a wealthy, intelligent gentleman named Mr. Charles Bingley, and a plot to tear the two lovers apart. As the story goes on, more and more is revealed about who is responsible for breaking up the budding romance between her sister and Bingley. In the middle of all of this, Elizabeth finds that she has fallen in love with the man that ruined sister's relationship. With a tangled web of lies and deceit, the tale takes a sharp turn from entertaining anecdote to a gripping suspense story. Will she tell her sister who is responsible for the breakup? Will she continue her romance with the man that has made her sister so unbelievably miserable? All in all, the story is a riveting piece of art that shouldn't be taken for granted just because it sounds boring."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen obviously chose the titles to her novels with care, for this book truly is about pride and prejudice, explored through the eyes of the book's main character: Elizabeth Bennett, as well as the rest of the Bennett family, Elizabeth's best friend Charlotte and the upper crust families with which they rub shoulders.Set in the England of King George III, \\"Pride\\" details Elizabeth's coming of age and her exploration of her own romantic nature. As the second eldest of five daughters, and most beloved of her father, Elizabeth is used to being the quickest wit around, and fancies herself an expert of human nature. When Elizabeth finds herself sought after by several men, consecutively, she finds perhaps she isn't quite the expert she'd believed herself to be.Austen is a master of character study, and \\"Pride\\" is certainly no exception, being the finest example of her work. While a romance novel in earnest, Austen never hesitates to ruffles feathers with her quick wit.Characters such as Lady Catherine de Bourgh, Mr. Collins, and Lucas family and, of course, all the Bingleys, provide an excellent assortment of personalities and conflict that Elizabeth must navigate in order to remain true to her nature and find her position in English society of the time.Herself the daughter of a clergyman, Austen was no stranger to the lifestyle of which she wrote, and \\"Pride\\" provides excellent insight into her time."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Oh! Can I even say enough about this delightfully wonderful book? I won't give any of the plot away. But, I will say that the tension and the passion between the characters is so strong that it comes through the pages, transcends time and you can relate to it precisely today as readers could a hundred or so years ago. The humor and wit is British, of course, and most of the sentencing isn't used any more; therefore it might be a difficult read for some. I admit I had some hard times getting through it. But it was well worth the effort! And now I read it once a year just so I can relive the pleasure. A good read for anyone. And much advised by me."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I loved this book because it really grabbed my attention from the beginning. It also kept me away from the fridge for a good while so I skipped out on a lot of fatty snacks. I lost five pounds reading this book. Never mind &quot;The South Beach Diet&quot;. Read &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen is one of the best books I've ever read. The intricate style Jane Austen used to write this love story made it so the reader was sucked into it in every turn of the page. The way all the characters interact and the vivid picture the book gives on every person helps the reader understand the contents of the story and the reason the main characters act in the manner that they do. Apart from love, this book also has mystery and suspense. The novel never takes the reader to a dead end, but instead takes him/her to a sort of maze where anything can happen. This book is full of twists and turns that keep the reader on his toes and because of its contents dealing with society and its morals on being prejudiced, it is appropriate and a must read for any age group. In &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; the chapter that interested me the most was chapter 8. In this chapter Elizabeth is taking care of her ill sister when she joins Miss Bingley, Darcy, and Mrs. Hurst and the topic of an acomplished woman arose. In this little dispute of the upper class, a vivid description of an accomplished woman is given where a woman is accomplished when she has mastered all of the fine arts and has read many books. This was my favorite chapter because it gives an insight into the prejudiced mind of the upper class. To them an accomplished woman is one who has mastered the fine arts, but the only people in the 19th century that could afford the classes that helped a woman master anything were the upper class families. In laymens terms the only way for a woman to be considered accomplished was if she was rich and famous. The fine arts that were considered refined were the ones that could not be studied by just anyone and those were the art the upper class studied to feel superior. What made this my favorite chapter was the way Elizabeth reacted during the dispute. Even though she was being put down, she did not say a word to fight back. All she did was listen and let the birds chirp. Her pride was too great to let anyone tell her differently and that's exactly what I liked. Even though she was lower class, she had more respect and pride than the ones that were believed to be high and mighty. This book is appropriate for people of all ages. As long as the person reading understands the meaning of big words, this is a great book for them. This is so because of the morals of the story, and the connection you can make with the present time. This book shows you how and why some people feel superior to others and how in the end, the people they looked down upon ended up being the greatest people they've ever met. As you read this book, you come to realize that what you are learning is priceless and meaningful. &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; gives you an insight into a problem facing every average person and, if read right, the solution to being prejudiced. If you haven't read this book, read it, and if you have already read it and understood it, read it to some one who hasn't, or give your book to someone you like or appreciate."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Let me begin by saying that, although I have been an Anglophile since the age of eight (for some strange reason!) not every novel from or about England captures my fancy like &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; has, through the years...I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book (and was able to read it in England the second time, which really gave its words and sentiments added significance). What makes it special for me each time I read it is its historical content and reference. For example, the fact that some of the English people of the times spoke so concisely and brilliantly has always been, for me, a mental pleasure. The customs of the day have also appealed to me compared to some of the casual ways exhibited in today's world. (To say I am Victorian at heart would not be wrong...)Although &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; mirrors universal truths and concepts, it is the aura of propriety (sometimes abused and falsely applied, such as in the case of the Reverend Mr. Collins, the pompous Lady Catherine de Burgh, and the haughty Miss Bingley) which I like. Despite their ability to de-nobilize the demeanor of their time, I still enjoy their antics. They serve as a meaningful counterpoint to the serious business of living which drives Elizabeth and her sister Jane to seek more high-minded and worthwhile pursuits. I like &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; because it illustrates, once more, that &quot;there's always one in every crowd,&quot; that there exist among the civil gentry those who would thwart and turn back and simply congeal to impress (Mr. Collins, again!)In this same vein, Mrs. Bennett serves as the original &quot;stage mother,&quot; constantly pushing her daughters to the forefront of dances and other situations, wanting them to marry well. Yet she consistently annoys and insults those about her so her daughters' chances to &quot;marry well&quot; are minimized almost in direct correlation to her pandering.Mr. Bennett is one of my favorite characters, although he is not as clearly-drawn as most of the others. In him, I see a man of his times, saddled with a silly wife whom he married for looks and not for her intellect, and trying to make the best out of her urgent desires for her daughters' future wealth. In that regard, he is not so much depressed as resigned, a quiet man who keeps to himself but who also acquiesces to his wife because (alas) he still does love her. He is caught by son-less fate to have to cede the home over his family's heads to the Reverend Mr. Collins, a cousin. This causes Mr. Bennett grief but serves the reader as a historical footnote, a sign of the times that, fortunately, has come and gone.Since I have only limited space, I will describe only one more character, Miss Elizabeth Bennett. Amongst these pages, she has such courage, such intelligence, such a command of the English language, and an acute sense of responsibility in all areas of her life. (She is fictional, of course, but I find myself hoping I can someday identify with her - not only that, but she gained the affection of the equally-noble Mr. Darcy!) Elizabeth is the embodiment of cool reserve and ready wit, but she is also quick to comfort. As she stood out among the other characters in this book, so would a real person like her, during those times. The historical perspective of Elizabeth's life is informative, pleasing, and remarkable - a worthy history lesson as well as an entertaining novel."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is the work of a scholar. Granted, it is expensive. But compared to other editions of Pride and Prejudice that imply scholarly expertise, this edition is a scholarly work. And Rogers credits his sources, too! Kudos to Professor Rogers!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"When I walk into a bookstore, you'd rarely see me pick up a classic. I typically head straight to the Young Adult Fiction section, home to my favorite first-class, high-quality novels such as Gossip Girl, the A-List, and The Clique. However, this time I opted for a change, wanting to read, for once, a really good book. With the movie coming out, I decided to give Pride and Prejudice a try. I fully expected to put the book down forever after the first page or so--- it seems to me that most authors writing before the 21st century hadn't quite caught on to the method of captivating the reader in the first few sentences, or even chapters--- but I was surprised. From the start, Pride and Prejudice was interesting, humorous and engrossing. I read on. Taking my clean hardcover copy with me everywhere I went for the next couple weeks, I read whenever I had a spare moment. I loved the language, of both the chatty and funny narration and the dialogue of the interesting, loveable characters. Some phrases and words were unfamiliar, but instead of making it hard to understand, I caught on quickly... for example, a teenage female's 'coming out'. And another thing I loved about this book--- it wasn't just a typical love story. There were all sorts of twists and turns, most noteably with the crabby, snobby Mr. Darcy-- who, by the end, had captured the hearts of the readers as well as the characters. All in all, I'm so glad to have overcame my fears of boring, difficult-to-read 'classic' novels--- this book is really one that nobody should miss."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is an old time classic for me and one of my favorites.I have went through it about 5 or 6 times already, listened to it on audio cd and watched different versions of the movie countless times.Splendid conclusion!!!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I always resisted reading this book.

She has a way of verbalizing positive demoralization, which makes others walk away with their tails between their legs!We also loved many of the other characters, such as Lydia, and the idiot Bennets.Now to why we only gave 4 stars.

If I hadn't been trying to fill my new Kindle with free books, I don't know if I ever would have read it. There were too many movie adaptations that held zero interest for me and too many rip-offs from authors unable to imagine their own characters and wanting to pick up where Austen had left off. I didn't think that this book would have anything for me. I was too cool for Jane Austen.I was wrong. Austen is amazingly witty and the romance of Elizabeth and Darcy is one of the sweetest and realistically character-driven I've ever read. Despite the setting, the two of them are so well-imagined as to achieve a kind of timelessness. I highly recommend this book, especially if you've never read Austen before.As far as Kindle editions go, this isn't one of the best. There are some weird line breaks. The typos and repeated words mentioned in earlier reviews seem to be fixed, but any word with emphasis in the original is all caps in this edition -- it's a bit like reading an over-heated chat room discussion at first, but I got used to it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is one of the greatest novels in English literature and is truly deserving of being called a classic. First published in 1813, it is set at the turn of the 19th century in a fictional town near London. Mr. and Mrs. Bennet are blessed with five daughters, ranging in age from 15 to 22. The novel opens with Mrs. Bennet anxiously thinking about how to marry her daughters off, as that was the primary way for women to achieve financial security during those times. The story is told in third person from the point of view of the second eldest daughter Elizabeth Bennet.Of the four Jane Austen novels that I've read, Pride and Prejudice is my favorite. This is not because I didn't enjoy the others, I most certainly did, but rather because Pride and Prejudice affected me on so many different levels. It touched my heart and swept me away, as I absolutely fell in love with Mr. Darcy. It also provoked my mind, as I reflected upon the many issues that Austen explores in this novel. It is a subtle book, as all Jane Austen novels are, and that is its beauty. All of the issues that Jane Austen raises in this book slowly simmer in your mind.One of the reasons I love Pride and Prejudice is that it is a romance for those with a bit of a feminist streak. Elizabeth Bennet is a strong character who isn't afraid to speak her mind. She is no weak wallflower. Many romantic plots feature a damsel in distress who is saved by her knight in shining armor. That is most definitely not the case here. The love story in Pride and Prejudice shows that you can have chivalrous man and grand romantic gestures without a weak heroine.I also love Pride and Prejudice for Austen's excellent treatment of the characters. Both of the main characters, Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, grow, develop, and change throughout the novel. Their character developments are deep, thorough, and convincing. In contrast, the supporting characters do not change much. Their constancy provides a nice point of comparison to the growth of the main characters.The novel is a full-fledged social commentary on marriage, love, money, wealth, social class, propriety, as well as pride and prejudice. It is fascinating to learn how different those times were from today, especially in the lack of opportunity for women; and yet, it is even more fascinating to think about how relevant the issues are to today. The more things change, the more they seem to stay the same.If you only read one Jane Austen novel, let it be Pride and Prejudice. Be patient with the old English language. It is not an easy read, but it is worth your while."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Beautiful clothbound edition. It is well made and will last a long time. I believe the typeface is Times New Roman, with standard margins. There is a ribbon bookmark in the binding. I plan to get some more of the Penguin clothbound editions in this set."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"You may believe from the title of this review that the reviewer is prejudiced. What took you so long to figure that out? Age and other afflictions of the eyes have robbed my ability to read to some degree but this edition is very kind to us ancients. Oxford has a good reputation and this publication will not dretract from it. The editorial material is even somewhat amusing: e.g. one note in the chronology \\"the United States declare war on Britain.\\" There is nothing amusing about the War of 1812, the use of the word \\"declare\\" where we Americans would more likely use \\"declares\\" is symbolic of the British conception of our republic. But we digress.Austen has been a favorite since I first encountered her in college. It was much later I realized one reason for the fine prose in Hiram Grant's Memoirs. He spent many hours at West Point reading Jane Austen novels. There he was given his more familiar name Ulyses S.(stands for nothing)Grant, hero of the Civil War and Republican president of the U. S. Had he spent his time reading the French tacticians as his classmates did the war may have been prolonged to allow McClellan to beat Lincoln in 1864.I apologize for wasting the readers time on things that really spread no knowledge of the book reviewed. I'll not spend words telling you the story, describing the characters or the time, offering opinions on the social state of Britain at the time of the novel. There are other reviews that attempt this. Jane Austen is much better at these tasks than I.The reviewer is an anglophobe. If it is given five stars here it should tell you a great deal about the value of this novel. For one who protects what is left of vision to read this book three times should say even more. It is strongly suggested reader that you uit wasting time on reviews and read the book.Thank you for your patience."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Does the world need another P&P; review? No. Will anyone read this? Probably not, but I made a resolution to write a review of every book I read - and I read this for the umpteenth time while recovering from surgery.What is it about this novel? On the surface it is an ever-so-polite romance featuring the Bennett sisters, whose biggest concerns are their ball gowns and gossipy letters. However, what makes it ageless is the fully developed characters and the deep insights into the human condition. I never tire of it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Since I was a business major in college, I wasn't made to read a lot of the standard classics that most people have already read. I'm finally starting to make up for lost time.I loved this book. I have always loved 19th century literature, mostly because I love the societal rules and manners. (The House of Mirth is one of my all-time favorite books.) However, I was a bit surprised that I could be drawn in so much to a romance where no one even kisses. (Especially because some of the paranormal romances I read are practically pornography.) But I couldn't put this book down and I am now in love with Mr. Darcy like so many other women before me."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"These clothbound Penguin classics are even more beautiful in person!
