Thank you Dorothy for such an enjoyable, personal book."},{"Title":"You Caught Me Kissing: A Love Story","review":"After looking at some old Sea Hunt episodes on TV.com, I started to reminisce about the first time I saw these shows (at age 13). In one of the episodes \\"The Lost Ones\\", Mr. Bridges' wife and son, Jeff, starred along with him. So I started googling Mr. Bridges' life and found that Dorothy Bridges (his wife) was a poet. And so, I purchased \\"You Caught Me Kissing: A Love Story. This book is one of the most passionate and real love stories I've read. They met in the 1930's, fell deeply in love, and it all started with an unsigned Valentine card from Lloyd \\"Bud\\" to his Dorothy. She knew who sent it, and from that day forward, she wrote a Valentine to him every year until her death in 2009. Each poem tells a story about their life and love, through the years, and it's never ending strength that would not break under any circumstance. As you read her poems, you get caught up in their strength as love remains but changes over the years. Their foundation was so strong, it carried them through. Anyone who has been married for a long time, in a relationship, or in love will identify with this beautiful book. I cried by the end of the book because it brought out what lives in my heart, and keep it at my bedside to read now and then. The photos of their life and children are very special. Some of the poems are still in old type form or hand written. What a special family. What a special woman. You won't be dissappointed in this book."},{"Title":"You Caught Me Kissing: A Love Story","review":"To Dorothy, finding a balance for love wasn't easy. She and Lloyd Bridges, with whom she was together for 60 years, had to find space for themselves, with Lloyd's acting career and her determination to be a good mother and housewife, even if it meant having to tamp down her natural creative inclinations. But she had time for her poetry, and every year from the 1930s till the 1990s (and even today) she wrote out a valentine poem for her husband. (There are some touching little valentines on display from Lloyd to Dorothy, but the bulk of the book is her collection of her annual poems from then to now.)Even after he died she found herself continuing the tradition, and some of the best poems in the book demonstrate her helplessness and the indignity of loss. They are heartbreaking. Heartbreaking too were some of the losses which she frankly describes in this memoir.Such as the way HUAC came down hard on Lloyd Bridges, forcing him into a graylist until SEA HUNT came about and the whole US public got behind it, effectively telling Senator McCarthy, we don't care about your anti-Communist crusade! Sad too, indescribably so, was the crib death of another of Dorothy's little boys. And she mentions in passing that in fact Lloyd wasn't a perfect husband and that there were occasional affair-ettes on the side (on his part not hers). But all in all it was a reasonable successful alliance by any standard, and many of the valentines attest that one way of measuring success is that the children of the marriage feel loved.All the surviving children seem very content and very aware that they grew up in a very loving family."},{"Title":"You Caught Me Kissing: A Love Story","review":"I bought, \\"You Caught Me Kissing: A Love Story\\"by Dorothy Bridges, for my wife as a Christmas present...

She was the star in my eyes, I feel honored to know this awesome mother and wife...she raised stars, literally! Dorothy if you ever read this, hello from Jude from Applewood Market! I now live in Oregon on the coast and it was a pleasure reading your book!:)"},{"Title":"You Caught Me Kissing: A Love Story","review":"This gem of a book is such an inspiration. It contains many lessons - that true love is worth waiting for and that everlasting love is the best kind. Too many negative influences today make people quick to judge, quick to give up, and always striving to out-do.That is why this book is so wonderful. It is like a candle in the darkness - taking the concept of love and of Valentines Day then showing the progress made by true love. Whether times were up or down, their love endured.I challenge anyone to read the very first poem \\"Moon Signs\\" and to not have a tear. Even if a first love did not work out (like it happens for most everybody), this poem brings back those memories of when one first feels the pull of love.Even though for most lovers, heartache comes first, then the true love (\\"the one\\") come along, these story-poems are worth reading because it makes one realize that the true love can be the one that lasts - and that it is worth it.This book is wonderful.

It began with the Big Business reaction towards the gains made by the American labor movement in the 30s with the FLSA. That reaction was embodied in the most anti-labor law passed in the history of America, the 1947 Taft/Hartley Law. This is a must read for all labor activists out there. The book goes into the strategies and propaganda used then to sway the American people against organized labor. Many of the strategies of the past are still used today by American Business and this book will help you recognize them, answer them and effectively rebut them."},{"Title":"Selling Free Enterprise: The Business Assault on Labor and Liberalism, 1945-60 (History of Communication)","review":"This book was recently strongly endorsed by Noam Chomsky and for good reason. There is an extreme scarcity of books that address the mechanics of propaganda in the US. For people interested in the details of how the US became the most propagandized society on earth, this book is an invaluable resource."},{"Title":"Selling Free Enterprise: The Business Assault on Labor and Liberalism, 1945-60 (History of Communication)","review":"I agree with reviewer Wood that the writing is rather dense, but this is an indispensible take on mid 20th-century capitalist culture clawing its way back to post-war prominence. That Ronald Reagan played his role as spokesman for the Restoration, and became its symbol of victory, underscores the continuity of this long, bitter class struggle.We see here the true reasons for McCarthyism: just as Stalin's blood purges used fascism as excuse, so did the US business world misuse Communism in their muted civil war to reclaim Washington and city hall, the universities and mass media. Ms. Fones-Wolf raises an important point that \\"business humanism\\" - as well as name-calling and repression - was instrumental in rivaling unions for worker loyalty, and neutralizing community attitudes. Yet I see another equally vital reason for the decline of unionism at this time: the rise of the suburb, sundering the urban working class community that made mass strike action viable. The suburban worker, rising to fight his way through rush hour traffic, surrounded by neighbors with totally different occupations and life histories, became an atomized cipher in the postwar world and thus powerless to meaningfully affect it. (Hence the rise of \\"postal rage\\" as ersatz outlet.) The anomie of the modern citizen of the \\"Western democracies\\" seems to have been consciously created by elites, to beat back their all-too-brief scare between the Depression and WW II.This led to the alienation between liberalism and labor. Fones-Wolf touches on the origins of this split: its working class base eroding, liberalism turned to the civil rights movement; \\"culture issues\\" became the linchpin of intellectual progressivism. Workers left behind, in old factory towns or new developments, were lulled by a postwar boom economy into alliance with former enemies like Richard Nixon. The betrayal of \\"conservative labor\\" by its new \\"friends\\" has been the coup de grace of the struggle. Never again will labor - and possibly liberalism - enjoy such solid social power, and that defeat began in the desperate years outlined in depth here."},{"Title":"Selling Free Enterprise: The Business Assault on Labor and Liberalism, 1945-60 (History of Communication)","review":"This is a great book. The Business Class in America will stop at nothing when it comes to the war on America's workers. Turn on the radio today and you can hear the same BS right wing propaganda from 50 years ago. Americans need to wake up."},{"Title":"Selling Free Enterprise: The Business Assault on Labor and Liberalism, 1945-60 (History of Communication)","review":"Elizabeth Fones-Wolf 1996 publication \\"Selling Free Enterprise\\" is a comprehensive look at the efforts of the business community, between 1945 and 1960, to marginalise organised labour and retard any further development of the progressive politics that gained ground during the period from the 1930's Depression through to the end of the war.The result is a dense well sourced book that details the conflict, primarily between organised labour and the business associations, over the United States political-economic development. Other protaganists include religious organisations and the media who were to varying degrees subverted by the business community as part of their efforts to turn their \\"free enterprise\\" credo into the common wisdom that constrains debate and decisions about political-economic life in the United States. Organised Labour and others efforts to defend and extend the gains of the New Deal era are examined closely, and the author doesn't shy away from identifying those defeats that were far from inevitable, despite the cards stacked against them.On the downside some may find Fones-Wolf's prose more than a little dry, certainly it is not a racy read, but she is nothing if not thorough end-notes to each chapter testify. On the context within which the events examined occurred, such as the first third of the Cold War and the period of political repression known as McCarthyism, Fones-Wolf is perhaps not as thorough as she might have been. Certainly the phenomena of McCarthyism during her period, and its role in creating a congenial environment for the advancing of businesses agenda, deserves a chapter in itself.Despite these shortcomings the book is an interesting look at how the Business community fought to re-engineer the outlook of America in its own interests, and the efforts of Unions and others to block this development. Readers interested in McCarthyism can find a short and readable introduction in Ellen SchreckersThe Age of McCarthyism."},{"Title":"Selling Free Enterprise: The Business Assault on Labor and Liberalism, 1945-60 (History of Communication)","review":"This book attempts to prove what everyone already knows.

The trustee of this book title albeit a trained mechanic has just that kind of a garage at home. I have always admired Mr. Shute's prose - it is acutely to the point, without being abrupt. And that is the second magical thing about this book, for our Trustee is not only an adept mechanic but a naturally moral manMr. Shute does not have to point to it and more wondrously, a ten year old boy like me could sense it. What is the story? Well, if you insist on incidentals, it is the travels of a man of meagre means who travels far to bring back a young girl her inheritance. Or, something like that. It's been 30 years since I last read it.Read Nevil Shute when the idiosyncracies of other writers, or the world at large, begin to chafe.&lt;P"},{"Title":"Trustee from the Toolroom","review":"Having read Shute's most famous novel, On the Beach, I could see that he had a gift for characterization and wrote with a focus on human affairs; essentially, man versus himself or against the odds. On the Beach had this recipe for greatness (4/5 stars) and so does Trustee of the Toolroom (5/5 stars).A humble man quits his nine-to-five job in favor of pursuing his hobby of miniature mechanisms, of which is an author for one magazine entitled \`Miniature Mechanic' but only receives a paltry salary for his work and dedication. Though he is the recipient of scores of letter from followers across the globe, writing in questions about the models he has written about and designed and photographed, Keith, the humble man he is, takes the time to write back to all the inquiries. The breadwinner in the family is his childless wife and both live in a mortgaged house, where in the basement Keith goes about his tinkering.Keith is made trustee to his niece's inheritance after his sister and brother-in-law perish at sea after running aground on some Pacific coral reef. In that boat lays the inheritance in the form of ninety-seven carets of diamond. It is Keith's duty to secretly retrieve the diamonds under the guise of simply setting up gravestones and saving the onboard motor. With his meager wealth, Keith find the trans-global journey to be harrowing as he has never stepped foot outside of England and knows very little of the world beyond the border. Nave, yet humble, Keith decided it's in his niece's best interest that he retrieve her diamonds to secure her future.On this fateful he requires assistance from all walks of life: a commercial airline company, a freighter representative, an illiterate fisherman, a captain of a private yacht, a timber magnate, a medieval literature professor, a hydraulics owner, a Jewish secretary, etc. The walks of life Keith is exposed to and the help given to this man is heart-warming after he tries so hard to visit the isolated atoll.I got to say that I'm a fan of detail, however drab or dull or lacking in importance; some examples would be American Psycho, Rule of Four or a space opera like Iain M. Banks' Matter. Shute adds a lot of detail about sailing (lines, rigs, sails with terminology and all) and about engineering (lathes, presses, gauges, etc). I think it provides a good insight into what Keith knows - engineering - and what he doesn't understand - sailing. He's a thoroughly competent engineer and he knows his stuff but when it comes to sailing we can see Keith wince and gasp in awe at the complexity.What it's all about is seeing the respect a man deserves come full circle through odd yet loyal characters and to see him succeed with the support of well-earned admiration and trust."},{"Title":"Trustee from the Toolroom","review":"Nevil Shute's main characters resemble John Steinbeck's main characters - simple, straight forward folk with the desire to do what's right not in a heroic way but in a quiet way. But unlike Steinbeck's characters who struggle in the midst of chaos and injustice, Shute's characters struggle through small problems we all might face. The terrain is not epic but quiet and thoughtful. He writes a novel here that would never be a bestseller today. There are no large, out-sized egos to fight. There are no worldwide plots of conspiracy. Instead there is a death and a little girl to honor. I recommend it for the quiet, life affirming moments we all need but too often rush by."},{"Title":"Trustee from the Toolroom","review":"In a literary novel we have the protagonist, but for the Nevil Shute's Trustee from the Toolroom, I prefer to call Keith Stewart an unlikely hero. An overweight freelance writer for, what one would think, an obscure miniature machine magazine, Stewart designs and builds working models in his basement for near hand-to-mouth earnings. Stewart has never left his patch of England; while he and his wife, having no children, live a quiet life, happily going along, when one day he helps his brother-in-law prepare a safe in the bottom of a small sailing ship.The brother-in-law, a well off individual, with a landed gentry background, and Stewart's sister are off on a cruise to America on their own, while Stewart and his wife take care of their niece, Janice. Life goes wrong when the sister and her husband are killed in a storm at sea near Tahiti.Stewart and his wife learn that the child, which is now permanently in their care, has no inheritance. The suspicion is that the inheritance, now in the form of diamonds, is in the safe on a ruin sailing ship, the remains of which are sitting on a reef in the South Pacific.Here the story really gets underway. Stewart, the man that's gone nowhere, is faced with the daunting task of leaving his insular world of miniature models and journeying to a reef in the middle of the pacific. This is when we and Steward learns how insignificant he is not. This is the key to the story, and I don't what to divulge much more, because the depth of Stewart's own life is revealed to him and amazes him as much as it will please any reader.If you've read Shute before, you know his writing is straight forward and is laced with technical explains, which his characters always delve into, because Shute himself was an incredibly talented man.Why the four stars and not five? Well, there are moments when the continued repetition of Steward's motives for his journey clutters up the narrative, and if they could've been pared down just a little, the story would've been tightened up. The ending was not bad, matter of fact, it was happy, that's reasonable, because that's the way life can be, but the true resolution, the retrieval of the Janice's inheritance, did not work out well in the way the story was constructed. At over three hundred pages, I think Shute was pushed to finish by the length of the story already. But don't get me wrong, as the reader I was continually moving with Stewart and pulling for him.Read it. You'll enjoy the time spent."},{"Title":"Trustee from the Toolroom","review":"This is not only my favorite book, it is but also my favorite NevilShute book. I have both read it and listened to it, and this version read by the late and great Frank Muller is really fast moving and really touching. I think if you listen to the first sentence you will be mesmerized into listening to the whole thing. I lent it to a friend and they listened in the car while driving across Texas, and ran out of gas!! The story embodies many of the virtues of the 30 or so Shute novels, all of which I have read:trust, excellence, devotion to what is right, willingness to go to extremes to do what is promised and it is told in a sometimes hilarious way through the characters. There is something for everyone, sailing ships, mechanics, family life, diamonds, Tahiti.

Although some of the plot developments are hard to believe, the story emphasizes that good deeds and good people are rewarded in unexpected ways. The story is probably best suited for the young adult reader with its' upbeat and positive message. The leading character is a hero in the best sense although he would contest the designation. He enjoys his career as a writer and designer for a magazine that caters to an audience of miniature modelers which include working mechanics and enthusiastic hobbyists, some of whom are wealthy. Although he could earn vastly more in industry, he is devoted to his magazine. Fame, however, does not escape him, as he discovers throughout the course of the novel."},{"Title":"Trustee from the Toolroom","review":"This is my favorite audio book out of several hundred that I have listened to.

His sister, her husband, and their child want to immigrate to Canada. They are well-to-do but are not allowed to take enough money out of the country. So they ask Keith to build a secret box on their boat. He does and his sister and brother-in-law sail off, leaving their daughter behind until they get settled. They don't arrive, they shipwrecked and are confirmed dead. Then Keith finds out that the estate is broke. He realizes that any assets were probably stored in that secret box.

There were too many improbabilities, beginning with the fact that so many people knew of the main character's writings. I think he was a charming man and someone I would want as a friend, but I doubt that so many others had heard of him. If only a few characters had, it would have been not only more realistic, but more unexpected and satisfying The story is wonderful and affirming; however, the only character which I took away a real sense of was the independent sailor he travelled with at first. The rest of the characters were likable, bland white males who could have been interchanged with each other. (Except for the woman, who was, of course, \\"dangerous\\" because of her sexual appetite). I have nothing against decent behavior -- in fact, it is refreshing to have book filled with it -- so it is not that I covet deceit and dishonor. It's just that a few more interesting quirks could have flushed out the characters. I appreciate technical knowledge and, in fact, read books for that trait, but here I think that unless you are an avid sailor or mechanical engineer, the details were too overdone. However, that is precisely why some people read the book. The last sentence is indeed the best."},{"Title":"Trustee from the Toolroom","review":"I have re-read this book so many times I can almost quote it, but I still find myself reading it again about once a year!

His evolution, though, was compelling-- a person whose personal integrity forces him to sail to the South Seas--with the resources of only sixty pounds sterling, his reputation as writer for _The Miniature Mechanic_, and his personal qualities of intelligence, and untapped courage. That little engine he made and carried in his pocket helped, too: a four stroke 7-cc running on petrol with a little carburetor, a tiny magneto and miniature sparking plug. &quot;The whole lot mounted on a little baseplate was about four inches long, two inches wide and two and a half inches high.&quot;"},{"Title":"Trustee from the Toolroom","review":"I don't recall my age exactly but I was tired of the HardyBoys, I guess.

Before I left London & it has always been my favorite Nevil Shute story.In this age of in-your-face language & novels saturated with every evil event a human's mind can plausibly conjure up, this master storyteller's quiet & lean prose about real, ordinary people & their choices, entices you into one man's little life of miniature models, hardworking wives & honoring one's vows.From an unpeturbed basement workshop to the paradise of the broad Pacific ocean, a middle-aged man, more comfotable at his workbench than jetting across the world, takes on a mission to retrieve a treasure he himself hid in the ballast of his sister & brother-in-law's wrecked sail boat.For the sake of his niece, he leaves the safety of his suburban routine to travel far & wide to bring her inheritance back.A deeply satisfying & redemptive read, of a time long ago, when things were a lot more simple & simple honor was a lot more evident.Warms your heart, soothes your soul & tells a good story as well!"},{"Title":"Trustee from the Toolroom","review":"The last line of this novel tells it all about the protagonist, Keith Stewart: &quot;He was ...supremely happy&quot;. Keith was happy because he forsook more renumerative possibilities to do what he wanted to do most; design and write in the arcane field of &quot;miniature mechanics&quot; or model engineering, working out of a machine shop in his basement. In addition he is also a very moral and responsible human being.In typical Nevil Shute fashion, the book's plot consists of a wonderful, almost believable adventure during which Keith travels to the South Pacific and Washington State to save an inheritance, but it is really a portrait of Keith and how the goodness of ordinary people, personified by the warmly drawn out characters, will conquer all adversity without resorting to too much guile. Besides Keith there is his wife Katie, their niece Janice, errant boat bum Jim Donnelly as well as a kind-hearted lumber magnate, Sol Hirzhorn, and his family. All are good people and the story ends well.If all this sounds trite, I suppose it is in these cynical times, but that does not prevent &quot;Trustee&quot; from being a marvelous read. I have re-read it many times and, perhaps more importantly, have learned that model engineers like Keith and the magazine he wrote for really exist. Largely as a result of reading this book, I have taken up the hobby myself, including my very own basement workshop, and work on projects taken from magazines similar to the fictitious one Keith wrote for. Reason enough to love a work of fiction."},{"Title":"Trustee from the Toolroom","review":"Keith Stewart lives quietly in suburban London, working free-lance for a model mechanic magazine. His sister and brother in law have him hide a jewel box aboard their sailboat just before they emigrate to Vancouver. But when the ship goes down in the South Pacific with them both, Keith must not only raise their young daughter, but must seek to retrieve the jewel box from the wreck.Keith has never before left Britain, and is very much a fish out of water. But there's not that much suspense to this story, as he finds that many people who have read of his work are delighted to help him along.All the same, it isn't an easy trip for Keith, but it is a far easier one for the reader, with a fine read and memorable characters."},{"Title":"Trustee from the Toolroom","review":"This was Neville Shute's final novel, and perhaps derives much of its mood due to this. Best known for the depressing nuclear holocaust story On the Beach, Shute wrote this as a celebration of the simple pleasures in life. The protagonist Keith is an unassuming, married, but childless, middle-aged man living in suburban London (Ealing) with his working wife. He has forsaken a more lucrative engineering career in order to pursue his love of miniature modeling and a very meager income as a columnist for &quot;Miniature Mechanic&quot; magazine. When his sister and brother-in-law die in a shipwreck near Tahiti, he becomes the guardian and trustee for his 10-year-old niece. Next thing you know, Keith, who has never left the country, has to find a way to make his way to a remote Pacific island to recover a box of diamonds that was on the wreck. Shute writes convincingly of the things nautical and engineering Keith encounters on his adventure. Along the way he is aided by a somewhat improbable number of people who know him from his reputation in he world of miniature mechanics. It teeters on being trite and corny, but ultimately works as a celebration of karma. Keith has been a good, selfless man, and so other good, selfless men are willing to help him--and he ends up doing what he loves. At the end of his life, Shute returned to this basic message on how to live and love life, and it works."},{"Title":"Trustee from the Toolroom","review":"This is a wonderful book. A simple story about an unassuming man who has turned his avocation of fabricating small machines into a modest occupation that makes his everyday existence a pleasure for himself and his equally unassuming and good-hearted wife. He decides to embark upon a quest to reclaim his niece's lost inheritance--a treasure chest of diamonds hidden by himself and her father on the wrecked ship in which both her wealthy upper-class parents were killed. He does not want the diamonds for himself but the education and future of his niece which he will not be otherwise able to supply on his own rather meager income. So the hero starts out on a trip half way around the world with not enough money and no legitimate assurance that he will even make it back alive, much less win the prize. He knows it is a long shot. But, with the encouragement of his wife who will hold down the fort at home, he embarks upon this high-seas, dangerous journey simply because he thinks it's the right thing to do. He wouldn't feel right if he didn't try. That he might fail is not the important thing. This very rational, prudent man who has lived what many would consider a rather dull life of habit and order will now put all his trust in the enexpected and taste a life of risk and adventure. Very inspiring."},{"Title":"Trustee from the Toolroom","review":"This is a terrific book--one of my top favorites. It is the story of Keith Stewart--a working class hobbyist and writer for &quot;Miniature Mechanic&quot; magazine--who circumnavigates the world to fulfill his role as trustee for his niece's inheritance. Stewart discovers that, through his magazine articles, he has a world-wide following of readers eager to assist him with his task: to recover a box of diamonds which sank with his brother's sailboat in the South Pacific. I first read this book when I was a teenager and have re-read it a number of times since (once--cover to cover--on a flight between Boston and Los Angeles). Nevil Shute's prose are straightforward and compelling. The plot moves quickly; you will not want to put this book down. Upon finishing &quot;Trustee from the Toolroom,&quot; you will not only admire Keith Stewart, you will want to emulate him"},{"Title":"Trustee from the Toolroom","review":"If you are a model engineer or into building small engines, this will probably become your favorite book as it is mine. I bought this copy just so I could loan it to others to read. It has no sex, no violence--just a good, inspiring story line about how the efforts of one man working in obscurity turn out to have influenced many more people than he thought. The hero builds small engines and writes articles on them for an English model engineering magazine. As trustee for his late brother's daughter, he sets out to recover her inheritence, which was lost at sea in the Pacific. Travelling on virtually no budget he meets some interesting characters along the way with the common bond that they are impressed with his tiny engines or know of him through his articles and admire him greatly. The author is actually a real-life engineer who is best known for his rather dark book of post-nuclear disaster, \\"On the Beach,\\" but this is a much more uplifting tale that is equally well written."},{"Title":"Trustee from the Toolroom","review":"Whenever someone says, &quot;Get a life,&quot; I want to say right back, &quot;Can you define what 'a life' is?&quot; What is a fulfilling life, after all? Sometimes we Americans rush around so senselessly, and we are so rootless in our pursuit of whatever it is we think &quot;life&quot; is, that we forget to live it. Well, here is a book about a fellow who has a life, and it's a beaut. This is one guy who won't be lying on his deathbed wondering if he did all he could during his brief span of years. Read this book, and you'll obtain some important clues about how to proceed yourself. A couple of minor notes about the novel: It is Mr. Shute's final book, and it is very much valedictory in character, like Shakespeare's &quot;Tempest.&quot; Shute has chosen to go out on an optimistic note (not at all like the same author's &quot;On the Beach&quot;). The account of a small yacht trying to weather a storm in the South Pacific, which is in the first third of the book, is about as good a sample of fine fictional writing as you're ever likely to find. The only reason I can't give this book a flat-out &quot;10&quot; is because the plot comes off a little too pat for my taste. Nice guys can finish first once in a while, I suppose, but this protagonist seems to glide through life with very little friction. This emanates, I'm sure, from the valedictory nature of the book, but I don't have to like it. Still, I'm very glad I took the time to read this memorable novel. I'll be thinking about it for a long time. A note on the recorded version: The reader is Frank Muller, one of the best readers out there. He gets all the different accents right and sweeps you away with the power of his delivery. This is a great way to get to know this book, and it's absolutely unabridged!"},{"Title":"Trustee from the Toolroom","review":"If you like to have people you admire as central characters in a novel, and if you like to see them overcome their difficulties you will like this account of a modest but very gifted man who has good things happen to help him overcome the hurdles before him. This is a book which will leave you feeling good about the world and the book. I enoyed it greatly, and think it is a winner, tho there is nothing abstruse about it, except the knowledge which Keith Stewart, and various people he meets up with, have and use to have things come out as you will very much want them to."},{"Title":"Trustee from the Toolroom","review":"The fascination of Nevil Shute's stories have always been difficult to explain. His hero is everything that we already are. No piece of him is especially surprising, yet he keeps us reading. Every revelation of character makes us turn a say, \\"Yeah...I know somebody like that.\\" or \\"I feel that way too.\\"In _Trustee from the Toolroom_, the simple actions of Keith Stewart to fulfill his promise to family reveal more about our experience as ordinary humans than most other fiction thrust on us today. Keith does what we envy in others or take pride in ourselves: he remains honest. Yes, it is slow and utterly normal. But isn't it refreshing to read something that makes waking up every ordinary day and living honestly a hero's journey? After all else is scraped away, we are just like Keith Stewart.While maintaining this normality in character, Nevil Shute captivates us with the heroic in this, his last novel."},{"Title":"Trustee from the Toolroom","review":"Story of an Englishman who designs and makes miniature models in his own workshop.

He is of Scottish working class background, married for about 15 years and without children. He was a skilled machinist before becoming an author; he writes articles about miniature machines, which he makes in his basement shop, for the magazine Miniature Mechanic. His wife, Katie, works in a shop. Keith's sister, Joanna, after working as an actress in music halls, had married up in the world to John Dermott, a retired naval officer from an aristocratic family in Northern Ireland. They have one child, their 10 year-old daughter Janice.John and Joanna are off on a sailboat trip from England which is intended to ultimately end in Vancouver, but first with a trip to Tahiti. They will crew the small boat themselves. Keith and Katie have agreed to take care of Janice until they arrive in Vancouver. John has asked Keith to secure a box containing some of Joanna's jewelry into the concrete mass that supports the bottom end of the boat's mast.John and Joanna are killed when a typhoon drives their boat onto a coral island near Tahiti. It turns out that \\"Joanna's jewelry\\" was gem- grade jewelry which it turns out are Janice's sole inheritance. Keith is the trustee of the estate, and Janice has been left in Katie's and Keith's custody. Taking the gems out of Britain was a violation of the currency-exchange controls in force at the time. Keith and Katie have enough money to raise Janice as a working-class woman, but could not forgive themselves if they did not try to recover the diamonds. The main difficulty is that they have no money for trips abroad; they can just pay the mortgage now. A second difficulty is that they are working-class people, with no experience of foreign travel and not much knowledge of the wider world. The third difficulty is that the primary purpose of such a trip cannot be openly stated.Keith may not have money, but it turns out that he had a devoted network, larger than he knows, of hobbyist-readers prepared to help him out. One gets him a flight to Honolulu on a plane carrying replacement equipment to a cargo ship stuck in Oahu until it arrives. The ship's crew includes more devoted hobbyists, who, against their better judgment but recognizing Keith's determination, put him touch with Jack, a nearly-illiterate American sailor who just arrived in Oahu despite his inability to navigate in the conventional sense.About half -way through the novel, events become more fanciful. The amount help Keith gets through his network remarkable, and includes the services of a large, crewed yacht. The motivation for some of the assistance is not really to help Keith but rather is an attempt by one character to encourage another character (who actually follows Keith's articles) to enter into a large business deal with him. Suffice it to say that Keith recovers the diamonds and also earns an unexpected consulting fee, related to the deal, that pays off the mortgage.The most questionable aspect of the book is the racial/ethnic references that pop up. They are not frequent, but they are noticeable. There are a couple places were reference is made to one of the female characters as being \\"Jewish-looking,\\" the use of the phrase \\"half-caste\\" to describe persons of mixed Polynesian/white background, and one use of the N-word in dialogue. I don't know if these references simply accurately reflect the way white people saw the world in the 1950s, the views of the author, or both.I liked reading a novel whose plot which involves a non-horrible dilemma and whose main characters are ordinary people who have to figure out how to achieve their goals on a budget. I thought that the help Keith got from his readers was sweet. I liked the references to and techno-babble about machinery, so much more tactile than the electronics and biotechnology that is the focus of our times.I enjoyed reading about a world so different from our own but so recent in time, in which plane travel is still novel (it made me remember how amazing it is), where divorce was still deplorable, communications less than instant, and smoking common.I posted a nearly identical review at goodreads.com"},{"Title":"Trustee from the Toolroom","review":"I first read this book over a half-century ago as an elementary school student. It was recommended by my teacher and was my introduction to Nevil Shute. On first reading it was a great story of a man of simple means who became trustee of his niece and nephew as a result of the death of the children's parents in the sinking of thier sailboat and financial assets in the South Pacific. These events lead him to undertake a journey from his small, modest world to the other side of the globe. A great adventure. On subsequent readings as an adult, I of course enjoyed the more human elments. This man that wrote a magazine colummn about the model engines he designed and fashioned in his basement shop, we find, has a worldwide following of machinists and mechanics who greatly admire his work and happily assist him in the course of his trip. His able and practical nature eventually allow him to succede in his new role of assuring the future of the children.I later re-discovered Shute after reading the widely appreciated &#34;On the Beach&#34; that was made into a cold war era movie starring Grregory Peck and Ava Gardner, I believe. I then read most of Shute's other novels, especially enjoying &#34;Round the Bend&#34;. &#34;Trustee from the Toolroom&#34;, like &#34;On the Beach&#34;, are somewhat out of the ordinary for Shute in that they do not have the early days of aviation as a theme"},{"Title":"Trustee from the Toolroom","review":"True that Nevil Shute's style is rather dated, but it is an interesting and detailed story. I enjoyed the engineering background, and the way it linked people around Keith's challenge. He met some most fascinating people, who seemed to bend over backwards to help him.

The book demonstrates that violence, sex, four letter words and hunks or Amazons are not necessary to produce a good book. The unlikely hero, Keith Stewart, stands tall today despite the book being published posthumously in 1960, the year of Nevil Shute's death. The book is easy to read and suitable for any age. As I live in Tanzania where the education level is sub-standard and the average Tanzanian's ability to speak and read English is limited, this is an ideal book to help improve language skills."},{"Title":"Trustee from the Toolroom","review":"I had read the book several years ago and had loved it.

Though it doesn't answer all the questions, \\"Footprints at the Window\\" gives a note of finality to this trilogy.It's been a stressful summer for Dan: He's found that Huntington's Disease runs in his family and may strike him down when he's in his forties, his father is being tested, and he is haunted by magpies and visions of the Faws, gypsies, whom he encountered in York -- even to the point of being drawn back into the waning days of the Roman Empire. Now a family of gypsies has come to the land near where his grandmother lives, and it's making Dan nervous.What he finds is seemingly another Faw family, a few years down the line and with radically different names. And while trying to help the girl Oriole -- who bears a striking resemblance to Orlenda -- Dan is drawn back in time. Now it's the Middle-Ages, during the time of the Black Death, and he is the only person to recover from the disease. He encounters another incarnation of the Faw family, and for the second time tries to help the beautiful Orlenda escape to safety. What will happen will change Dan's life forever...Perhaps the only flaw of this trilogy is that in the third book, some of the threads are left dangling. For example, I was never entirely sure why it is that Joe, Dan, and the Faws are repeatedly featured in the past; the implication seems to be that they were reincarnated, especially since Blossom refers to her grandfather being the exact image of Ambrose Faw.Naylor hasn't lost her talent for atmosphere, either between the characters or in a given place. Dan shows a plausible growth in character, and a new philosophical bent that he did not have in the first book. This new maturity is reflected in his actions in the Middle-Ages and his increased acceptance of \\"what will come will come.\\"As the story progresses, we also see that it is less a story about gypsies, past lives or incarnations, or time travel, but rather a story about Dan and the inner struggles that are brought into focus and greater clarity by the events of the trilogy. Gratifyingly, there is also a note both of finality and of \\"starting again\\" in this book, a wistful acceptance, and a very real sense that sometimes a thing like Huntington's Disease can't be predicted.A good conclusion to an extremely good trilogy, \\"Footprints\\" is definitely worth checking out."},{"Title":"Footprints at the Window","review":"If you enjoy a bit of fantasy, a courageous youngster, and fine characters you'll love these books as much as my grand-children and I do."},{"Title":"Footprints at the Window","review":"The York Trilogy, of which this is the third and final book, is probably for slightly older readers than the 9 years set out in the description. That's not because of language or violence, (or scariness), but because the plot involves a fair amount of time travel and multiple characters who appear and reappear in slightly different guises during the course of the travel. It's not simple time travel, where the hero touches something or goes through a doorway and clearly ends up somewhere else. Rather, time periods and locations overlap, so that our hero may be in the here and now, but ghostly roman legions march by him, while the girl from then in her form as the girl from now is talking to him. You get the idea.That said, if your reader is good at reading carefully, this is a very rewarding trilogy. The hero kid is neither ridiculously heroic nor annoyingly lame, but solid, average and identifiable. The trilogy is not about magic, in the witch and wizard sense, but about something more subtle and ambiguous - there is much more of a mythical feel to the story, which is sustained by the solid, suggestive and not overdone writing.If there is a weakness to the trilogy, it is a weakness found in almost all time shifting stories that try to incorporate old Welsh and English myth themes and tales, (I'm thinking of Nimmo's \\"Magician Trilogy\\", or Alan Garner's \\"The Owl Service\\", or Elizabeth Kimmel's \\"In the Stone Circle\\"). The problem is that almost all of those tales are not linear, do not have neat resolutions, and are sometimes internally inconsistent. As a consequence, it is very hard to incorporate them into modern tales, where we have been sort of trained to expect a beginning, a middle and a tidy end. There is always some element, at the end, of \\"what exactly just happened here?\\". So, if your reader is not tolerant of a certain degree of ambiguity in a story, this series might be a little frustrating.Also, while it's not essential, it is a lot easier to follow the trilogy if the books are read in the right order, since each book is sort of a standalone, but themes, characters and plot points are developed over the course of the three books, and for the conclusion to be really satisfying I think you'd have to be familiar with the earlier books."},{"Title":"Lucifer Destronado (Spanish Edition)","review":"This is a excellent book, for mature christian that want to know more about the spiritual world and how the enemy works"},{"Title":"Lucifer Destronado (Spanish Edition)","review":"Esperaba por mucho tiempo que el precio de este libro bajara y finalmente encontr&eacute; a este provedor que fue justo y pronto en enviarlo a mi destino.

In fact, in the beginning of the book he challenges the reader to research his involvement with any of the sects, something I haven't seen another author addressing this subject address the reader with.There was no bashing of any of the religions he was involved with, simply accounts of his life and actions.

Free and strong, Malcolm is not afraid of those who hold higher social status in the culture of servitude nor does he think himself above the poorest resident. The story takes frequent turns and takes the reader, with Malcolm, through tragedy and glory. I now understand why C.S.

That's all I can say. 11 words is so unnecessary when there isn't much to say."},{"Title":"Multicultural Spanish Dictionary (Spanish Edition)","review":"The Multicultural Spanish Dictionary is a wonderful idea gone badly awry. It purports to be a guide to how Spanish differs from country to country. For example, the cover shows the word &quot;grocery&quot; and allegedly tells how this is said in Spanish in Mexico, Cuba, Spain, Venezuela, etc. The author apparently compiled the book by submitting a list of English terms to one speaker of Spanish from each Spanish-speaking country except Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, and Paraguay. Although it is questionable whether a lexicographer should rely on a single native speaker from each country and omit four countries that have unique terminology of their own, if these problems in methodology were the only problems with the book, it would still be enormously useful. Unfortunately, however, the manner in which is was compiled is simply where this book's problems begin. In the first place, the author appears to have overlooked the fact that if you ask two native speakers, each from a different country, how to say something in Spanish, their answers may vary simply because the answers are synonyms, not regionalisms. This is precisely what happened on many occasions in this book. For example, when asked how to say &quot;wrong,&quot; most of the informants said &quot;equivocado,&quot; but the person from Colombia said &quot;err&oacute;neo,&quot; and the informants from Puerto Rico and Spain said &quot;incorrecto.&quot; The book implies that &quot;incorrecto&quot; is a Puerto Ricanism for the standard &quot;equivocado,&quot; but in fact, all three of these words are used throughout the Spanish-speaking world. They are simply synonyms. &quot;Delicious&quot; is another example. The dictionary suggests that Argentines and Puerto Ricans say &quot;rico,&quot; Peruvians say &quot;exquisito,&quot; and everyone else says &quot;delicioso.&quot; Again, this is nonsense. All three terms-rico, exquisito, and delicioso-are synonymous and are used in all Spanish-speaking countries. &quot;Tasty&quot; is given as &quot;rico&quot; in Argentina, Colombia, and Spain and as &quot;sabroso&quot; everywhere else-but in reality everyone uses both terms. The list could go on and on. This failure to distinguish regionalisms from synonyms makes the book practically useless to a nonnative speaker of Spanish, who will not always know whether terms are synonymous or regionalisms in Spanish (which is precisely why he needs a reliable &quot;multicultural Spanish dictionary&quot;).However, the errors do not stop there. The next problem is that the author failed to ensure that all informants understood the English term in the same way. Take the word &quot;vest,&quot; for example. All of the informants but one understood &quot;vest&quot; to mean &quot;an article of clothing that men wear in a three-piece suit,&quot; which is what it means in American English, and translated it as &quot;chaleco.&quot; The Argentine informant, on the other hand, understood it to mean &quot;undershirt,&quot; which is what it means in British English, where our &quot;vest&quot; is called a &quot;waistcoat.&quot; Accordingly, she translated it as &quot;camiseta, musculosa.&quot; The Multicultural Spanish Dictionary implies that &quot;vest&quot; in the American sense is &quot;chaleco&quot; everywhere but in Argentina. Another example is the word &quot;iris,&quot; which the book suggests is &quot;lirio&quot; everywhere but Venezuela, where it is &quot;iris.&quot; In fact, however, the flower &quot;iris&quot; is called &quot;lirio&quot; throughout the Spanish-speaking world, whereas the part of the eye that is called the &quot;iris&quot; is &quot;iris&quot; throughout the Spanish-speaking world. This is not a case of regionalisms, but of the informants understanding the English word in two different ways. Yet another example is &quot;jacket,&quot; which some informants took to mean &quot;a garment you wear when it's cold&quot; (chaqueta), while others took it to mean what we also call a &quot;sports jacket&quot; (saco). The dictionary implies that chaqueta and saco mean the same thing, but they do not. As far as I know, there are no speakers of Spanish who refer to a jacket in the sense of the garment for cold weather as &quot;saco,&quot; which always means the jacket that is part of a suit.The next problem with the book is very poor editing. Here are some examples of the spelling errors found: &quot;hechado a perder&quot; (should be &quot;echado a perder&quot;); &quot;clauadista&quot; (should be &quot;clavadista&quot;-apparently someone's handwriting was hard to read); &quot;enag&uuml;a&quot; (should be &quot;enagua&quot;); &quot;crecimeinto&quot; (should be &quot;crecimiento&quot;); &quot;beterraga&quot; (should be &quot;betarraga&quot;). What is worse, sometimes the book implies that a Spanish word is spelled one way in one country and another way in another, when in fact, one of the informants simply made a spelling error. For example, &quot;spine&quot; is given as &quot;espinazo&quot; in Colombia and &quot;espinaso&quot; in Spain (the correct spelling is &quot;espinazo&quot;). &quot;Armpit&quot; is given as &quot;zobaco&quot; in the Dominican Republic and &quot;sobaco&quot; in Panama (the correct spelling is &quot;sobaco&quot;). &quot;Yellow jacket&quot; is given as &quot;avispa&quot; everywhere but Cuba and Panama, where it is supposedly &quot;abispa&quot; (in fact, however, the correct spelling is &quot;avispa&quot;).Then there are some flat-out translation errors. &quot;Carjack&quot; (spelled &quot;car jack&quot; in the dictionary, which makes it look like the tool used to lift a car when a tire goes flat, rather than the crime where a car stolen while the owner is in it-which is what the author means) is translated as &quot;asaltar con violencia&quot; (Mexico) and &quot;raptar&quot; (Bolivia), neither of which conveys the real meaning of &quot;to carjack.&quot; &quot;Stuntman&quot; is awkwardly translated as &quot;aquel que realiza los trucos.&quot; Among the translations of &quot;to encrypt&quot; in the computer sense is &quot;ocultar,&quot; which is certainly a suspicious translation of that word (normally &quot;cifrar&quot; or &quot;codificar&quot;).Finally, the book omits many terms that do vary widely from country to country (such as the words for &quot;drinking straw&quot; or &quot;cheat sheet&quot;), while including others that do not (such as the adjectives discussed above). It also fails to alert a native speaker to the sexual overtones that a perfectly innocent word in his country can have elsewhere. In short, this book is far too shoddily compiled to be of much use to anyone."},{"Title":"Multicultural Spanish Dictionary (Spanish Edition)","review":"This book goes a fair way toward fulfilling the crying need for a dictionary of Spanish dialects. It contains much useful information. I have not been able to detect any outrageously inaccurate information, which is quite an accomplishment in a field noted hitherto for the abysmal quality of its production.Nonetheless, this dictionary leaves much to be desired, since it contains many gaps and inconsistencies. In the first place, in the English-to-Spanish section, the Spanish equivalents are given only for some countries, not for all. To make up for this, the authors introduce the concept of &quot;principal term&quot;, which they leave undefined, but which presumably is the term used in the countries whose Spanish equivalents are not listed individually. However, the &quot;principal term&quot; they list is often incorrect for some countries."},{"Title":"Multicultural Spanish Dictionary (Spanish Edition)","review":"Spanish is one of the languages I work with. On the face of it Spanish is a rather simple language, but when it comes to common everyday words there are many ambiguities and varieties. On a recent visit to Puerto Rico I saw three foodstores on the same intersection, and each referred to itself by a different name. Later, while visiting the rain forest, I came upon a waterfall with signs on both sides of the road. One sign referred to it as &quot;caida de agua,&quot; and the other called it &quot;cascada.&quot; It was the same waterfall.When I translate or edit documents from English into Spanish, I keep running into the problem of words such as grapefruit or strawberry which have different names in countries like Mexico or Chile. For years, I was hoping someone would come up with a dictionary of this nature. Now finally someone did. I realize this dictionary does not take the place of the regular English-Spanish dictionaries, but it is a great auxiliary tool. I further realize that its definitions are not always cast in stone, since the usage of everyday Spanish words often defy defintion. Nevertheless, this is so far the only dictionary of its kind, and as such it is enormously useful. One can only hope it will be revised and expanded soon, as the need for it is beyond dispute."},{"Title":"Multicultural Spanish Dictionary (Spanish Edition)","review":"I used this book to help me with various clients throughout Latin America.

Each time we translate something from English into Spanish, we run up against the problem of the thousands of words which are different in each country of the Spanish-speaking world. No one Spanish speaker or translator knows all the variations of everyday Spanish words in countries like Mexico, Peru, Chile, etc. As soon as we started using this dictionary, which, we realized right away, was far from exhaustive, we did a huge translation job involving thousands of technical and legal pages, from Mexican Spanish into English. One of the terms that kept appearing over and over again was a car part, which has the same name throughout Latin America, but a different name is Mexico. Our translators, all of them highly experienced, come from all parts of the Spanish-speaking world, and most of them missed the Mexican term. After checking it in this new dictionary, we realized what the problem was, and equalized the translation of this particular term. This is a good example of how a specialized dictionary of this kind can save one a great deal of grief. A word of caution: It does not replace the general Spanish-English dictionaries, of which there are several good ones. It is to be used as a supplement in cases where a basic word changes meaning from one country to the next. We are looking forward to a future expanded edition, but in the meantime, this is the best there is."},{"Title":"Multicultural Spanish Dictionary (Spanish Edition)","review":"I'm referring, of course, to there not being a 0 star rating.

To the dictionaries credit I did find that it was about 8% accurate. I calculated this by adding up all the entries (a rather limited and useless compendium of words to begin with) and determined from various sources which were accurate and which were not. About 8 in 100 fit the bill, meaning that 92% of the dictionary is just plain wrong!

Jones in 1948. It's an odd, very haunting book. At times it is extremely beautiful and moving, though I don't think Nathan quite manages the ending: which isn't to say I can see a better answer. It's about a young struggling artist who meets a mysterious little girl playing by herself in a park. He befriends her and learns that her parents are high wire jugglers. Then she disappears, but reappears a few more times, always a few years older. After a while the artist realizes how strange things are (Jennie always seems to know). Basically, she seems disconnected from time. The artist's sketches of Jennie give him the break he needs to make his career, but before long Jennie is all he cares about. The book moves quickly to the inevitable ending. Parts of it, as I said, are haunting: the images of the lonely girl in the park bring tears to my eyes as I type.

I read this book yesterday, dipping in and out throughout a restful day until I finished it. To me, this book is more about an artist's struggle to live in the material world and still be true to his creativity than being a love story. The \\"love\\" Eben, the protagonist of the story, has for Jennie, is akin to Don Quixote's love for Dulcinea, a woman mostly of Quixote's imagination who provided the inspiration for his good deeds. Of course, Cervantes was mocking romantic novels of his times, whereas Nathan is showing the beautiful relationship between creativity and our deepest feelings of love and trust in its divine nature - by \\"divine\\" I mean that timeless quality. That Jennie first appears as a child is important in that Eben realizes his feelings have a connection to the romantic realm, which for grown men and women in the material world means sexuality becomes involved. Nathan addresses this by having Jennie be a kind of time traveler so his feelings don't seem creepy. This brings Lewis Carroll to mind, whose muse Alice was a child. This book also made me think of Death in Venice by Thomas Mann, another great work that questions how our creativity fits, or doesn't fit, into the material world."},{"Title":"Portrait of Jennie","review":"Portrait of Jennie\\"Portrait Of Jennie\\", D.V.D. too (The movie was bought off Amazon.com but not from them specifically.)February 3, 2011The book very much reminds me of the movie, which I also put down below.

In the months following their first encounter in New York City's Central Park, the enigmatic Jennie mysteriously vanishes and reappears. With each visit, she defies time, magically growing into young womanhood before Eben's bewildered but appreciative eyes. Jennie's beauty and supportive devotion to Eben inspires him to create his masterpiece.Written by Robert Nathan, also the author of many prose and poetry works including \\"The Bishop's Wife,\\" \\"Portrait of Jennie\\" was made into the 1948 movie starring Joseph Cotton and Jennifer Jones. Possibly a bit leisurely and introspective for those with fast-paced, action-oriented tastes, \\"Portrait of Jennie\\" nevertheless is a haunting and heartwarming tale of timeless trust, patience, and affection."},{"Title":"Portrait of Jennie","review":"Portrait of Jennie is a great work from one great writer. The story floating between sensibility and mystery. Robert Nathan shows his hability to compose his work with romantic and supernatural style. Masterpiece!"},{"Title":"Portrait of Jennie","review":"I first encountered this beautiful story as a teenager, watching a late night movie channel. I found the book and since have read it three times, with a fourth on the way as my selection for a book club reading. The story is of a man, lost and broken by the Depression, unable to express his immense talent as a painter. He encounters an enchanting little girl, about four years old, and converses with her on a park bench for a while. She seems to haunt him and he looks for her again, still unable to use his talent. Suddenly he sees her once more in Central Park--only she seems older, not a month or two older, but years older.From this premise the story--and Eben's talent--blossoms into something beautiful, mysterious, and haunting. Robert Nathan used elements of fantasy and--then--science fiction to spin this tale of destined love over time and space, warping both to bring a girl from the past and a man from the present together. But the book is neither; nor is it magic realism, which it precurses. In fact, in his autobiography, Living to Tell the Tale, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, one of the foremost writers of the magic realism genre, paid respectful homage to Nathen for Portrait of Jennie. Twice in the autobiography. Marquez's praise was not easy to earn, so to hear him speaking in awe of Nathan's work is a fine recommendation.Nathan's writing is both crisp and poetic, rich in imagery and atomosphere with a fine feel for the Depression of the 1930s, and the grey hopeless depression that accompanied it. Jennie brings light into Eben's dreary world and transforms it and him. The impossible possibilities of the meeting and fate of these two people keeps the reader wondering, fascinated, and turning to prior pages to reread and discover the secrets. One wants to read this book fast to see what happens, but must read it carefully to follow what we think of as impossibilities of fate, time, and space. It's a beautiful read, but not an easy first read, for the mysteries of time and space are observed, but not solved, of course. I wonder what Stephen Hawking would think of Nathan's exploration."},{"Title":"Portrait of Jennie","review":"I watched the movie several times. Even bought the video. Then I read the book. I suggest that you do it the other way around. Both have their strong points. The feel is the same. However the book allowed other people to see and interact with Jennie. In the movie only Eben sees Jennie. The portrait in the bar is different; it is probably some adjustment for the time of the movie. And the ending is different. I am not sure which ending I like best. One interesting notation on the movie, it was shot with a filter that made the movie look like a portrait.Any way I do not want to describe the plot. So I will tell you that it was nicer to get the Hardcover Buccaneer book, than some old yellowing thing from a secondhand store that costs just as much. I have it next to the video and still re-read it periodically. If you can not get the Buccaneer version this one will do."},{"Title":"Portrait of Jennie","review":"This book, first published in 1940, was adapted to film in 1948, which film starred Joseph Cotton and Jennifer Jones. I was sufficiently intrigued by the film, so as to want to read the book upon which the film was based but was surprised to discover, however, that the book is more of a novella, as it runs a scant one hundred and twenty-five pages in length. While not lengthy, it is, nonetheless, a haunting story, although it differs is some respects from the film.The book tells the story of a young, struggling artist in New York named Eben Adams, who is really little more than a hack. One winter night in 1938, a down and out Eben is in Central Park, having been unsuccessful in selling his paintings. There, he encounters a very young girl named Jennie Appleton, who is mysteriously in the park by herself, playing hopscotch. Thus, begins Eben's acquaintance with Jennie.Eben sketches a picture of Jennie, which to his surprise, he is able to sell. Periodically, Jennie begins appearing in his life at odd times, always swathed in mystery as to her origins and always appearing somehow older than expected each time he sees her. Eben continues to sketch her, finding that he can sell those sketches with ease. Inspired by his muse, he paints her portrait, a masterpiece that eventually lands in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.He is puzzled, nonetheless, by the anomaly and mystery that surrounds Jennie, who has an air of being from another time. Yet, an unusual bond is developing between them, one that not even the vagaries of time can break. It is also one that becomes increasingly romantic over time, as Jennie quickly grows into womanhood. The fates, however, Eben finds, can be cruel.Those who enjoy romantic stories with supernatural portents will very much enjoy this haunting tale of two star crossed individuals."},{"Title":"Holt McDougal Larson Algebra 2: Students Edition 2007","review":"The Algebra 2 book by Larson (et al.) is excellent. Obviously, you need to finish an Algebra 1 course before you start a course that uses this book (McDougal Littell Algebra 1: Applications, Equations, Graphs). A geometry course is not a prerequisite for this course. This book is easy to read and understand: I would guess that it is written at the seventh grade level.Just like Larson's Algebra 1 book, I admire Algebra 2 for its peerless instructional design. Just like Algebra 1, it is obvious that the designers of Algebra 2 employed a systems approach to (1) meticulously identify all of the knowledge and skills required in an Algebra 2 course; (2) translate these into learning objectives for the course; (3) systematically identify course prerequisites (the starting point for the course); (4) specify final course outcome (the end point for the course); (5) sequence and repeat training to optimize learning and retention; and (6) design evaluation measures to ensure that each student has met the course objectives.Algebra 2 is written at a higher cognitive level than Algebra 1. In addition to systematically developing higher math skills, Algebra 2 develops the student's abilities to use graphs and calculators. This book does an excellent job of developing student skills and knowledge for every identified objective.For what it covers, this book is excellent. I personally feel that the course is too easy. However, I bow to the wisdom of instructional designers who have taught this material to large, diverse audiences and have consulted with active math teachers and school administrators. Having said that, I would prefer a more challenging treatment of the subject matter (perhaps include \\"honors\\" problems and rigorous mathematical proofs).Math experts often find it difficult (or impossible) to teach math to beginners, because they have forgotten all the little steps required to gain mastery of the subject matter. This textbook brilliantly breaks the subject matter down into to small \\"chunks\\" (small enough to grasp in a few minutes at a time) then optimally sequences and integrates those \\"chunks\\" for effective learning. All along the way, student mastery of prerequisite learning is reviewed, retested, and systematically integrated with new learning.I like the way the textbook includes calculator operations, without abandoning the need to perform calculations by hand or in the head. The book is very effective in getting students to think about problems visually, including the creation and use of graphs and problem diagrams. I like how it gets students used to the idea of creating graphs similar to those one can produce in a spreadsheet program. There is an excellent Glossary in the back of the book.The examples and problems in the book are very good. Examples and problems systematically build from simple, short problems that ensure basic skills have been acquired to more difficult problems that integrate prior learning and apply multiple skills. The application problems are pretty good - - - many of them do a good job of steering the math from the abstract to the concrete.The textbook is one of the very best I have ever seen at presenting information in a way that maximizes attention, memory, and understanding (the presentation reminds me of InfoMapping). Information is presented in small, organized batches - - - small enough that the average student can keep focused on the specific topic under discussion (most folks can only keep five to seven objects in mind at any one time). Such a batch is clearly delimited (grouped under a colored header or inside of an example box or with a right-margin annotation), and seldom splits across a page.The book includes (in the back) answers to only selected problems. I wish this book provided the answers to all of the problems, or (as is done customarily) all of the odd numbered problems."},{"Title":"Holt McDougal Larson Algebra 2: Students Edition 2007","review":"My son is taking algebra 2 this semester at school and the teach did not issue them books.

There actually two levels to the story, on one level, it can just be read as a romance, and on the second level, it seems to be mocking the genre. The ending was incredible in that the reasons for the main character's final choice can be seen as both moral and life-defeating. It's hard to explains how without spoiling so please just go and read the book itself! It's short and extremely readible."},{"Title":"The Princess of Cleves (Norton Critical Editions)","review":"This book is written in an unusual format, almost at a remove from the main character.

Knowing she was doing the wrong thing, and hurting the people who love her most, but unable to stop.I really enjoyed this book,and I'm sure I'll read it again one day.

Turns out, it was free because it' the old public-domain download (the translation of which is amost a century old) instead of the far more readable Mitford version.I DO recommend \\"The Princess of Cleves,\\" and free downloads are nothing to spit at, which is why I still gave this a 3-star review. \\"The Princess of Cleves\\" is an excellent example of literature from the Age of Reason, because the heroine (never given a first name) is so driven by public appearnce and virtue and proper behavior. I'm also a sucker for the Henri II & Diane de Poitiers romance, some of which plays in the background of the Princess of Cleves' story.But seriously, I do recommend the Mitford translation.

Everyone is inflamed by extraneous attachments, whether they are kings, dukes, queens, viscounts, or Mary of the Scotts, with unsigned letters serving as gaming pieces for their various intrigues. Henry himself is an impulsive fool who lacks the patience of good judgment, his queen and his Dutchess of Valentinois mistress are vain and vicious backbiters, wherein the Cleves themselves suffer from an excess of conscience which prevents them from living and thus kills them, with her love, the Duke de Nemours, being a better than average womanizer who lives on in history as the almost husband the Great Virgin Elizabeth did not marry at the end of the day out of fear for her own mortality. The Princess may not have known about Nemours in Liz's Court, but by the novel's climax she so fairly has her read on this gallant that one wonders why she bothered in the first place.For those who are interested in the historical development of novel forms, Lafayette's work is an interesting study against Cervantes, Fielding, and even Henry James, who made frustrating the readers expectations an art form in itself-- it traces back here-- the fragmentation, the sameness of everyone's behavior and sexual needs with their undercurrent of political tensions; it makes for a marvelous and cynical look at the cultural energy of the Renaissance era in Europe."},{"Title":"The Princess of Cleves (Norton Critical Editions)","review":"This is an old novel written and translated from French.

For example, I'm sure I came across 'agitation' three times on one page, and I can tell you I ended up more agitated than Mlle de Chartres ever would be after trying to scrape my way through it.Needless to say, I'll be allowing more time to read these books beforehand so that I don't have to delve into another poorly translated version again.Get it in French."},{"Title":"The Princess of Cleves (Norton Critical Editions)","review":"Allegedly the music is lost in the translation, and since the novel reads like an encyclopedia entry i wouldnt bother unless you have no choice.

Mr. Gruenwald is underappreciated genuis. It's unfortunate he, and the Squadron, haven't been appreciated sooner. And, that Mr. Gruenwald didn't get to see his most cherished creation enjoy the recognition and popularity it deserves. The exciting and innovative concepts and ground-breaking devices aside, I enjoyed the heck out of the Hyperion character. With Superman being one of the premier characters of the superhero genre, and practically a pop-culture institution today, it seems odd that unlike other hit characters, he has never seriously been emulated. But it is that very popularity that prevented it. He is so recognizable, writers were just too afraid of being &quot;copycats&quot;. Leave it to Gruenwald to have the courage to create his own version of a classic(as well as the rest of JLA), and instill it with it's own identity, and his own unique vision. Not unlike an &quot;ElseWorlds&quot; story, there is much familiar, and much strikingly different. Powers and origin parallel. But Hyperion, like the other Squadron characters, has his own unique quirks, hang-ups, dreams, and ambitions. The story takes the &quot;What-If?&quot; concept to extremes, as Hyperion and the Squadron say and do the things their &quot;original&quot; counterparts wouldn't even think. Fans of Superman and/or JLA should love this, as will any fans of good comic story telling. Don't pass on this one, if you miss it the second time, you may regret it."},{"Title":"Squadron Supreme","review":"Squadron Supreme is an attempt to tell a \\"realistic\\" superhero story where the heroes of America decide to solve all of the countries problems in a year. Of course, things go wrong. They start by bringing everyone food, then removing all guns (including police and military), then \\"B-Modding\\" (brainwashing) criminals. They don't get around to curing disease, but create a system of suspended animation to keep people alive until technology improves. I have two big problems with this series, especially when viewed as coming out about a year before Watchmen, which does everything much better. The first is the disjointed nature of the story. There's a definite, overarching arch, but the individual chapters play out like a typical 80's comics. There's a villain of the month, usually followed by a big fight, and there's a recap of the story in the first couple of pages. A lot of non-subtle describing the action and motivations. The other problem is the lack of subtly (compare to Watchmen, Marvels, or Kingdom Come like the back cover tries to). The solutions to the problems of the country are complete 180 degree turns (enabled by fantastical inventions, of course) and when it all goes wrong at the end, the solution is to eliminate every change made by the Squadron. Also, while some of their solutions are over the top (brainwashing criminals) while others are too lenient (punishing a rapist on their team by kicking him out). It's like the Squadron (or writer) didn't think about all the consequences before implementing changes.On the plus side, the character interactions are quite done. There's plenty of room for self doubt, for adversaries, for love interests, for changes of mind, etc. It all starts a bit chaste (Comic Code Approved, after all), but the writer gets more blatant as he goes on."},{"Title":"Squadron Supreme","review":"Squadron supreme is an amazing story,ive always preffered marvel to dc.but this seems like a classicly written dc story taken to the extreme.ive always thought watchmen was a little overated and squadron supreme was vastly underated,watchmen may have better craft in storytelling but squadron supreme has a much more interesting story."},{"Title":"Squadron Supreme","review":"Squadron Supreme was one of the best comic book series I have ever read.

People do not want to give up their liberties and freedoms just for a little sense of security.Gruenwald and Ryan took this wannabe Justice League and turned it into a winner by making the characters flesh and bone instead of mere cartoon characters. The writing and drawing duo would later rework the Squadron into their ultimate creation, D.P.7. They used the basis of the Squaders and made the best comic book in the entire New Universe series.

They finally realized that, if they really wanted to make a difference, they'd have to combat the ills of society, things like war, poverty, famine and disease. So they took over and started going about rebuilding society from the ground up, trying to turn their world into a utopia.If the concept sounds vaguely familiar, it should. For years superhero comics have been exploring such moral questions as these, all the way back to the famous story &quot;Must There Be A Superman?&quot; In that tale, the man of steel wrestles with the fact that by doing so much to help society he might actually be holding them back from striving and succeeding on their own. In the end Superman decides that he will help the people of Earth with problems beyond their means like earthquakes and supervillains, but for the rest of it we were on our own.Not so in the 1985 Marvel maxi-series Squadron Supreme. In this book, the heroes decide that we humans need someone to make decisions for us. So they usurp the government's power, take over America, and start fixing things the way they see fit. Now that description of the book makes it seem like these heroes are bad guys, but they're not. They're good people, heroes with the best of intentions. But you know what they say about the road to hell, right?Pretty quickly one of the heroes speaks out against the rest of his team. He objects to the ideas of these heroes, stating that by taking control away from the common man, they are trampling on all the freedoms America stands for. But this hero is voted down by the rest, who say that a few of the individual's rights lost are nothing in the face of what will be gained by society as a whole. So this hero resigns from the team and starts planning a way to show the Squadron Supreme the error of their ways. And that hero is Batman.Well, actually it's Nighthawk, but it might as well be Batman. It is well-documented that writer Mark Gruenwald was a huge fan of the Justice League and that, when he created the Squadron Supreme at Marvel, he was openly aping the DC team so he could play with the other company's toys in his own backyard. Even reading the names of some of these heroes you can see obvious parallels. Hyperion, Power Princess, Amphibian, Whizzer, Dr. Spectrum-the list goes on and on.But Gruenwald takes the characters and makes them his own, drawing on the archetypes we're familiar with and taking their personalities to the inevitable conclusion. Each character stands out from the creation they were originally carbon-copied from. Golden Archer's obsessive love for Lady Lark stretches into darker corners than Ollie and Dinah's relationship ever did, and Nuke's youthful impetuousness is at times incredibly destructive, a far cry from Firestorm over in the JLA.Apart from making the characters his own, Gruenwald similarly pulled no punches with the plot and showed that even the actions of superheroes have very real consequences. This story is mired in tragedy and heartbreak; as the story unfolds over the course of a year in this utopia, members of the Squadron Supreme quit the team, are forced out, and even die. The inevitable conclusion to the story is very much a predecessor to the widescreen action style we see in comics of today, yet its violence is not sensationalized or especially bloody. Characters are killed in horrific ways in this melee, not just for a cool fight scene but for a logical purpose, to drive the theme of the story home for the reader.Dozens of stories since 1985 have taken this idea and run with it, and I freely admit that those books, books like Kingdom Come or The Authority, did the concept a bit better than Squadron Supreme does. The art here is uneven and juvenile at times; the dialogue is similarly a bit cheesy, as characters break into long speeches to debate the larger moral issues behind their actions without a hint of subtlety. But still this work is groundbreaking and many stories of today owe Squadron Supreme a great debt of gratitude. For this reason, and for many others, this book is worth your attention.Unfortunately this graphic novel has never received the credit it so deserves to its initial release coming at almost the same time as Watchmen's. But with the new series Supreme Power by J. Michael Straczynski and Gary Frank on its way in August (supposedly set in the same universe and involving the same characters), now this story might finally be recognized for the paradigm-shattering masterpiece that it truly is."},{"Title":"Squadron Supreme","review":"The late Mark Gruenwald was well known at Marvel Comics for his writing and editor positions (and lesser known for the occasional artwork he drew). Among his BEST works was Marvel's &quot;Squadron Supreme.&quot; Originally established as a team of villains from a mirror universe (who occasionally guest starred in &quot;The Avengers&quot; and &quot;Thor&quot; in the 1970s) the Squadron Supreme were knock-offs of rival DC Comics's Justice League. Hyperion=Superman, Whizzer=Flash, Lady Lark=Black Canary, Nighthawk=Batman, etc. In the 1980s, writer J.M. DeMatteis wrote an intriguing storyline in &quot;The Defenders&quot; which brought back the Squadron Supreme. This time, the team featured additional members (borrowing again from some of the &quot;Justice League&quot; characters and adding a sense of warped nostalgia for comics fans). Following the success of their appearance, Gruenwald and Co. launched a 12-part mini-series which focused on the plight of the post-&quot;Defenders&quot; appearance Squadron Supreme. The mini-series was *outstanding*. The characters were given more depth and background. Subplots and mysteries abounded. Artist Paul Ryan blossomed into a mainstream artist with his pencilling work (and let's not forget Bob Hall's contributions). From issue #1 through #12 of this limited series, you wanted the Squadron Supreme to have a permanent place on the comic book store shelves. The stories were VERY well-done. And ironically, DC Comics's effort with its &quot;Justice League&quot; comic (at the time) paled in comparison to &quot;Squadron Supreme.&quot; If you're a long time Marvel fan--even a DC Comics fan--take the time to purchase this compilation of issues #1-12 of the Squadron Supreme mini-series. It is a strong testament to why Mark Gruenwald is sorely missed in the world of comics. Rest in Peace, Mark."},{"Title":"Squadron Supreme","review":"When this series was originally released, I didn't give it much attention and wrote it off in 4 issues. I saw it as a pale parody of the Justice League of America, and I only focused on my theory that Marvel was trying to copy DC's greatest heroes. After reading Waid and Ross' Kingdom Come years later and hearing the references to Mark Gruenwald's Squadron Supreme, however, it all came together. I had to buy the collected edition.Reading the Squadron Supreme storyline all at once, it's amazing that this was a sleeper. It may have been due to several factors, ones which led me to give this book 4 stars: the varying quality of the art (all of it good, but some much better), the cheesy Stan Lee-styled dialogue (sometimes hilariously so), or the outrageous melodrama (too many upstanding heroes wearing their emotions on their sleeves). Whatever the case, the overall storyline is exceptional, and Mark Gruenwald deserves much more attention for this story than he gets. There are WAY too many similarities between SS and KC, and I can't continue to give KC the fanatical praise I once did - Gruenwald did it first.This is a fairly realistic treatment of a pseudo-JLA, showing what might happen to the world if a group with that kind of power existed. For all the potential that the real JLA has, they're held back by history, popular culture, and the editor's fear of alienating fans. Squadron Supreme has no such boundaries, and the result is a real treat. Don't waste your time reading (or more appropriately &quot;looking at&quot;) The Authority. This is the way to go."},{"Title":"Squadron Supreme","review":"This graphic novel reprints the amazing epic comics written by Mark Gruenwald.

This idea slowly divides the team against each other. At first they do good by getting food for the hungry and finding job opportunities for the out-of-work. However their deeds become more and more controversial, albeit well-meaning, such as banning guns and criminal reform via mind altering.The story progresses to a final deadly conflict. In the end you question to what limit your own morals extend. ... This is highly recommended for comic book fans. A must-read for those who enjoyed \`Marvels' and \`Kingdom Come'."},{"Title":"Squadron Supreme","review":"I recently bought and read the collection after having read the original limited series back in the 1980s. The late Mr. Gruenwald's storytelling skills and love for the old JLA series continue to shine. I loved some of MG's takes on the classic heroes. How would Superman change his outlook if he abandoned his Clark Kent persona? How would the Golden Age Wonder Woman act if she outlived Steve Trevor and lost her Amazon homeland? Would Batman be more effective on the streets or the White House? We see all kinds of fantastic technology in comics, but what would happen if it was unleashed on the real world? Before Kingdom Come, he had the courage to present the ramifications of great power taking on greater responsibility at the expense of free will. Unlike KC, SS does not get bogged down in dark tones and endless fights, while it still allows the reader to empathize, as well as root for, the Squadron even though they have gone beyond their lawful duty. One wonders what comics would have looked like today if Squadron Supreme had been the big influence instead of Watchmen."},{"Title":"Squadron Supreme","review":"I've had this story for at least a year now, and I was aware of it when it was first released in 1985/86, but I just got done reading it. I'm glad I waited. As some other reviewers pointed out, the artwork is only average at best, except for some covers inked by Bob Layton and Issue #7 drawn by the late, great John Buscema. Some of the sequences are over the top with emotion, clumsy, even unintentionally funny. A few scenes may even be considered politically incorrect these days, as for even an 80's Marvel comic, it has some strong 60's/70's sensibilities.The story's the saving grace here though. I'll admit, being used to today's comics, this can be a tough read: much more dialog per page, more exposition (there are even some scenes where heroes are captured and tell the villians everything, even personal feelings for their teammates), fewer \\"twists\\", and at first glance, it just looks like Marvel trying to ape DC's most famous super-team. It's worth it to read it in it's entirety. Today's reader will be rewarded with themes and conflicts that were used more recently in not only Kingdom Come and the Authority, but OMAC/Infinite Crisis, Identity Crisis, and Civil War. Even 52's \\"real time\\" formula was first used here, as this 12 issue series takes place over the course of twelve months in this alternate Earth.Mark Gruenwald has done some great work here. I'll admit, I wasn't crazy about some of his Captain America stories, but I may have to reevaulate that now. In addition, this series also crosses over into Cap #314, also written by Gruenwald. You will need to find that in the back issue box of your local comics shop to get the whole story, but it's not essential, as a recap is provided here."},{"Title":"Squadron Supreme","review":"Other reviews have mostly summed it up. This story is superb. Mr. Gruenwald is underappreciated genuis. It's unfortunate he, and the Squadron, haven't been appreciated sooner. And, that Mr. Gruenwald didn't get to see his most cherished creation enjoy the recognition and popularity it deserves. The exciting and innovative concepts and ground-breaking devices aside, I enjoyed the heck out of the Hyperion character. With Superman being one of the premier characters of the superhero genre, and practically a pop-culture institution today, it seems odd that unlike other hit characters, he has never seriously been emulated. But it is that very popularity that prevented it. He is so recognizable, writers were just too afraid of being &quot;copycats&quot;. Leave it to Gruenwald to have the courage to create his own version of a classic(as well as the rest of JLA), and instill it with it's own identity, and his own unique vision. Not unlike an &quot;ElseWorlds&quot; story, there is much familiar, and much strikingly different. Powers and origin parallel. But Hyperion, like the other Squadron characters, has his own unique quirks, hang-ups, dreams, and ambitions. The story takes the &quot;What-If?&quot; concept to extremes. Fans of Superman and/or JLA should love this, as will any fans of good comic story telling. Don't pass on this one, if you miss it the second time, you may regret it."},{"Title":"Squadron Supreme","review":"In the 70s writers from DC and Marvel arranged a stealth team up between the Justice League and the Avengers. Each writer created a thinly-veiled version of the other company's team. The Squadron Supreme was Marvel's answer to the JLA, after the initial story they reappeared from time to time as obvious foils for Marvel's heroes. But in 1985 writer Mark Gruenwald took them to the next level, using their status as an off-brand JLA to tell a story DC would never allow. What if superheroes took over the world?The book starts with the world in chaos, after the Squadron foiled an attempt to rule the world governments collapsed, people are starving and civilization is on the verge of collapse. With no other option they decide to take over the world (America at least) to save it.This is a story that's been done several times in many comics but this is by far the best one. Readers never feel like the Squadron have turned evil. Every step they take is believable and makes sense. First they distribute food. Then they develop Behavior Modification technology to reform criminals. They have problems but cover them up to maintain people's confidence. And when things finally fall apart it's hard to tell who the heroes really were. All the time Gruenwald manages to balance heroism with mistakes, hope with despair and humor with darkness.This really is a mature piece of writing. The art by John Buscema, Bob Hall, Paul Ryan and an issue of Captain America by Paul Neary is very good throughout the book. None of them are superstars but all of them turn in great work.This is one of the classic books of the 80s and belongs on everyone's shelf. Gruenwald was justly proud of his work. How proud? At his request after he died his ashes were mixed into the first printing of this book. The book is filled with essays by other comic writers about Gruenwald's life making this a fitting tribute to the writer. If DC had printed it, Squadron Supreme would be one of the best JLA and Superman stories ever printed. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Squadron Supreme","review":"(I should preface this review by stating that I purchased this elsewhere for a much more reasonable price, so my review is purely about the comic and not the value.)This book has gotten a lot of mixed reviews, but most of them miss the point. Yes, the characters are shameless rip-offs of the justice league. But this book is not a character study--any expendable heroes would have worked. Yes, the dialog is corny. But keep in mind that this was before Watchmen and The Dark Knight Returns. Corny dialogue in superhero books was the gold standard. Yes, the art is all over the place. But art will always be secondary to the story, which is the real merit of this comic.This is one of the first (if not THE first) books to explore what would happen if superheroes used their powers to combat the real problems in our society (instead of just battling crazy super-villains all day). Real problems like war, crime, poverty, hunger, disease, pollution, the economy, etc. It also examines the relationship between choice and morality, pretty heavy stuff for an 80's superhero comic (think A Clockwork Orange but with super-villains).The twist is that these heroes don't just sit in a lab or run for office--they effectively take over the entire globe in an effort to bring about a forced utopia, much to the horror of the populace. This story is also one of the first to take place in real time: the squadron declares they will bring about utopia within a year, and each issue comprises approximately one month. And I don't want to spoil anything, but this book probably set a record for super-hero body counts (one of the many benefits of working with spin-off characters, as opposed to the real thing).It's far from perfect, but make no mistake--this is an important piece of comic history.(And regardless of your opinion of this book, I would still highly recommend the 2003 prequel/re-imagining titled Supreme Power (MAX). It lacks the cheesy dialogue and one-dimensional characterizations and features spectacular art courtesy of Gary Frank.)"},{"Title":"Squadron Supreme","review":"If any book could claim to trump Watchmen's role in this particular sub-genre, it would be Squadron Supreme.Squadron was published in 1986, reputedly as a parody of DC's popular \\"Justice League\\" - including analogues of Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman. Instead, Gruenwald turned it into much, much more.For the good of humanity, the Squadron Supreme wind up taking control of their version of Earth. Despite their noble intentions, things go horribly horribly wrong. Touching on serious issues, but in a very four-color way, this never had quite the impact or the gritty tone of Watchmen, but certainly had the ambition.Squadron Supreme has been revived in the past few years, but that's long after the fact - Gruenwald was ahead of his time."},{"Title":"Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Dummies","review":"Easy to understand the concept as the author made a very comprehensive approach to lead the readers to explore CBT"},{"Title":"Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Dummies","review":"I would recommend this book to anyone as it is very well written and informative.I know this book is a great asset for me due to stress and the state of the economy.Highly recommended and if it will help a Veteran like me it will be of great value to anyone in these times we are living in,one of the best self help books I have ever read and very easy to understand.Buy this book,you won't be sorry!

Fabulous."},{"Title":"Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Dummies","review":"CBT is recognised as one of the most successful means of dealing with a variety of psychological problems. Trouble is that up till now, you need to spend thousands on talking to a therapist. What if there was a book you could work through, either with your therapist or if you are capable then on your own? What if there was a book that enables you to get more value out of your counselling and learn to cope more quickly and more effectively with your problems?I believe that CBT for Dummies is that sort of book. It is a very well structured, effective book that will help you come to terms with problems such as depression, bipolar2, obsessive compulsive disorder and post traumatic stress. It is not a book to be read but one you slowly work through, doing the exercises. When I did the 1st exercise called the ABC, (activity belief, consequence), I realized I'd got value for money but the book contains a dozen more.The down side to this book? It won't cure psychological problems but then I believe that nothing will. It will however give you powerful coping strategies. The book requires work, sometimes quite uncomfortable work. I would recommend that you have the safety net of a CBT therapist that you can call on if things get too uncomfortable.I've had depression problems for over 40 years, triggered by a rough childhood and fighting in one of those ugly wars of Africa. After working with the book for four months, I'm starting to have a day or two, sometimes almost a week when I feel normal.

He became an American explorer, historian, author and anthropologist in his lifetime, authoring an impressive amount of material on the subject of Aztec, Maya, and Inca civilizations.He spent significant amounts of time trekking through the lands of South America studying the land and its people, and before his death in 1985, Hagen managed to publish over forty literary works corresponding to his travels. In Ecuador and the Gal&aacute;pagos Islands, Hagen tells much of the history of Ecuador, beginning with Spanish colonization, and describes the environments and peoples of multiple different areas of the nation.Each chapter of the book is dedicated to a different locale or aspect of Ecuador, beginning with the capitol city of Quito and ending with the Galapagos Islands. Hagen is thorough in his historical data and blends it well with geographical and social information. The book largely deals with the Spanish colonial period of time, but also includes information from post-independence Ecuador.The book is very effective in telling a broad history of Ecuador, and describing much of its qualities. While the book remains non-fiction, Hagen writes in a way that the book at times reads like a novel, which allows the reader to easily maintain interest. Hagen includes many accounts of people directly from the era of history being covered in the book, adding another level of interest for the reader. The book does a wonderful job of supplementing historical knowledge of Ecuador and supplying stories and descriptions of each of the areas covered in the book.Hagen's composition is good, and the chapters flow along coherently, in a way that the reader feels as if s/he were traveling along with the author.Although I believe Hagen could easily have made two separate books, one on Ecuador, the other on the Galapagos Islands; having them together does create an interesting perspective on both areas.The amount of information that Hagen supplies his reader on each of the topics covered is quite impressive, and in his writing the reader is able to sense a definite passion for the things inside the nation of Ecuador, and off the coast as well.I believe that the book should appeal to general readership, as well as to those with existing knowledge of Ecuador, due to Hagen's well written chapters and interesting style on subjects both fascinating and thought-provoking."},{"Title":"Mahjong All Day Long","review":"There are several things I really like about this very unique book at an old traditional game called mahjong.The first is that not only is this book written in English, but also has lots of Chinese Characters. Not only do they have the characters for Daddy, Mama, Big sister, Little brother and Mahjong, but also word associated with the game such as \\" Hu Le!\\" ( I win! ), \\" Peng \\" ( 3 of a kind ), \\" Chi\\" ( 3 in a row ), counting in Chinese from 1 to 10 and Do you want this tile? And your typical pestering of siblings ... Sounds terrible, Don't touch, and Don't act crazy!The second is that instead of drawing illustrations on paper, Beth who is a ceramic arts professor made the illustrations on ceramic plates. How cool is that! The drawings are simple, colorful and have qualities that can and are found in families across the world! Upon 1st reading and looking at the books illusrations I thought, they are Ok, nothing really special, then upon reading the dust jacket I found out that illustrations where actually glazed & fired plates. With that in mind, I went back and carefully looked at each plate and was really impressed! Now,I can easily see those plates now hang proudly on the walls in their parents home!The third is that in the last 2 pages there is more information about Mahjong, and if you are interested in learning mahjong from reading this book ( like I now am), they have thoughtfully complied a list of 9 books on Mahjong for you to read.The fourth is that the two sister when as young sat on their fathers knee and watched their parents and family members play mahjong and now they too play mahjong with their families. What a lovely way to pass on a family tradition and beloved game."},{"Title":"Software Project Secrets: Why Software Projects Fail (Expert's Voice)","review":"I work for a software company as a Senior Technical Writer, so when I reviewed this book, I expected it to hit close to home. It did.In the second of two software development firms I have worked with, I realized that the issues which George Stepanek brings out in his book were the same challenges for each company. All parties involved had their own agendas but none of them followed the same methodologies for getting things done, or they found their methodologies did not exact work with Software Development projects.This is especially true when it comes between the Software Developers and the Project Managers. The Project Managers tend to see only their schedules and not the challenges of the Developers, such as time, code requirements and adequate staffing. I think sometimes the Developers live, eat and sleep at the office to try to get the software to GA (General Availability).At the end of a development project, many times you look back and try to figure out what went wrong, or what steps to avoid for next time. I think it is wonderful that Stepanek details the key factors which cause a project to fail. Many Project Managers look at the specifics of a software development project only to find they can't quite figure out the difference between this type of project and the others. Fortunately, for the reader the author identifies twelve facts that make software development so different from other projects. With these facts, clearly in hand, Project Managers and Developers can come closer together to make the project a success. Unique to this book as well, Stepanek also identifies ten wrong assumptions (in his analysis of the \\"Project Management Body of Knowledge\\") that are made by managers and how to avoid them.Stepanek also takes a look at three modern project management methods. This is a topic that many books on Software Development and Project Management fail to address. He details what parts of each methodology works to solve some of the issues of software development projects. Almost more importantly, Stepanek identifies the areas in which these tried-and-true methodologies fail to solve the unique problems of software development projects.Going one step further, the author discusses seven different techniques that can be used by Project Managers to ensure that the projects come in on time and on budget. This should be music to Project Managers' ears!One thing I do like is the illustration of a point or an example. Stepanek includes a case study at the end of the book which shows what challenges can appear and how to cope with them successfully.This book should be required reading and a great supplement for the Project Managers, Product Managers, Software Developers and even customer who have been trained to use the methodologies commonly used in the industry, but still have project that fail or are difficult to manage to completion."},{"Title":"Software Project Secrets: Why Software Projects Fail (Expert's Voice)","review":"When I first read this book about two years ago, I wasn't that impressed. I thought author George Stepanek spent too much time explaining things that seemed obvious, and was indecisive in the recommendations he made. Having a few more years experience under my belt, I have a better sense for author was getting at and more of an appreciation for the book.The first section of the book runs down 12 challenges of software development that make it unique from a project management perspective. This section is mostly valuable for novices, but objective enough to be worth reading for veterans as well. The author makes a particulary good point in that software development is research and that you're inevitably doing something new each time. However I find the real value in this section is that it allows the reader to objectively judge the processes introduced later in the book.The approaches that Stepanek advocates are all clearly in the Agile realm. The three methodologies discussed are Crystal, Rational Unified Process, and Extreme Programming. This is probably the only book I've ever read on software development process that doesn't advocate one methodology over another. Stepanek recognizes that different approaches apply to different situations, and this is one of the book's biggest strengths. If you're unfamiliar with any of these three approaches, this is a good book to start with.Stepanek brings things together with a pair of case studies, which he uses to contrast the traditional waterfall approach to the more modern Agile methodologies. The Agile case study is of more interest; Stepanek blends techniques from different methodologies and shows how they can be used in conjunction to solve different problems. The case study is somewhat limited in scope, but it provides concrete examples of using the techniques described earlier in the book. By blending techniques from different methodologies, the author avoids a \\"one size fits all\\" recommendation, which I've found other books prone to.The one thing to be aware of when reading this book is that its content is better suited to developing internal applications rather than external production applications. The thinking is more geared toward an environment where budget and schedule are more important than things like user experience and performance. If you're contributing to an internal software project in any role, I'd recommend giving this book a read."},{"Title":"Software Project Secrets: Why Software Projects Fail (Expert's Voice)","review":"This is a book about software development processes and project management. In fact, it is a concise and up-to-date introduction to the problems that confront every software project.If you have read other books about software project management, the \\"secrets\\" in this book may come as no surprise. Using numerous examples, though, the author makes very compelling arguments about why software project management is different than conventional project management. In fact, many of his points were so vivid that I was tempted to forward them to my supervisor.Author Stepanek doesn't have a silver bullet that kills the \\"software werewolf\\". He does have some good advice though. Perhaps more importantly, he clearly describes many of the recurring problems that developers and managers encounter. Identifying a problem is the first step toward solving it."},{"Title":"Software Project Secrets: Why Software Projects Fail (Expert's Voice)","review":"The book compares software project management from a number of \\"agile development\\" perspectives to the PMI model for project management.

You know that the house always has an edge, but you assume you have a chance of winning, otherwise you wouldn't play, right?In Nevada, where the economy depends on gambling, there are two regulatory agencies, the Gaming Control Board and the Gaming Commission. In general, the Commission licenses casinos and the Board enforces the laws regarding gambling. Together they have a responsibility to make sure the public has confidence in the gambling system.Jeff Burbank used to be a business reporter for the Las Vegas Sun and then the Las Vegas Review-Journal, the two major newspapers in Nevada. He investigated the casino industry from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s. During that time there were a number of landmark cases that the Commission and the Board dealt with. In License to Steal, Burbank describes seven of the most controversial and entertaining cases.One story tells of the casino owner who had a Nazi memorabilia collection that he liked to exhibit to a few hundred close friends from time to time. He'd throw a party, sometimes on Hitler's birthday, to show off the collection. The parties were held in his casino, but not in public view. Word got around (apparently the collection was really something) and the Commission wondered if it shouldn't do something, since one of their mandates is to ensure the licensees (casino owners and operators) don't do anything to give Nevada a bad reputation. It was a touchy problem: a lot of people were offended, but what about freedom of speech? And wasn't it somewhat hypocritical to censure someone for offensive behavior in Las Vegas, which has a bit of a reputation for bad taste? In the end, they fined the casino owner. Even in Las Vegas, there are limits to bad taste.Another story explained how a slot machine manufacturer had programmed its machines to make it look as if losing spins had just missed being winners - \\"near misses.\\" The owners claimed that the machine wheels would spin randomly, as they are supposed to, but that once the spin had randomly been determined to be a loser, the wheels would re-adjust to show a near miss. This made it more exciting for the player, who would play more. But the regulators thought it might compromise the appearance of randomness. They decided the near miss feature would not be allowed, but when the company appealed on the grounds that retrofitting thousands of machines would be too expensive, the Commission cut them some slack. They still went bankrupt.Then there's the story about a Gaming Control Board employee who found a way to rig the slot machines he tested so they would pay off when a certain sequences of coins was fed into them. Burbank tells how the employee also learned how to predict keno draws, using a computer program, and was trying out the system in Atlantic City, when casino security became suspicious. This was different from the slots - he hadn't rigged the keno game, he was using an algorithm that found an element of non-randomness in the draws and exploited it. I'm not even sure that qualifies as cheating according to Commission rules, but it certainly does by casino rules. The casinos can make up their own rules and anything that gives a player an edge over the casino is considered by the casino to be cheating.Once Atlantic City authorities notified Las Vegas authorities, the employee's boss at the Board examined the employee's office computer and examined the records of payoffs the machines he had tested and found he and his friends and relatives had been hitting regular jackpots on the machines. This caused a real public relations headache for the Commission and for the casinos. Just the fact that an employee of the commission had been rigging slots for several years was bad enough. But then ABC-TV reported that the employee claimed that commissioners had abruptly stopped an investigation into rigged machines, and that they knew that the jackpot for the Megabucks statewide progressive slots could be triggered from the central computer center, and that several other companies were programming the slots to display illegal near misses. These were claims that should have been investigated immediately and vigorously, if only to maintain the appearance of an honest system. But they weren't.License to Steal is fun to read as a collection of eccentric character sketches and descriptions of clever scams. But it's also disturbing. The Commission and Board members are all political appointees and the casino owners contribute to most of the political candidates. So when you drop a quarter in the slot and pull the lever (or more likely slip a $20 into the currency scanner and press the button), are you playing a fair game? Or would you rather not know the answer to that question?"},{"Title":"License To Steal: Nevada'S Gaming Control System In The Megaresort Age (Gambling Studies Series)","review":"I really enjoyed this book by Jeff Burbank. Admittedly, I don't read a lot of books at all but the topic of gambling got my attention.The book goes in details in many aspects of gambling, from Vegas' early decades and the formation of the Nevada Gaming Control Board to the more fascinating mysterious death of Larry Volk (former employee of the American Coin Co.) to how Computer Wiz Ronald Harris beat the computer system to rack up jackpot after jackpot while working as an employee in the Nevada Gaming Control Board's Electronic Services Division.If you're into finding out more about the gambling industry or or curious about what's has happened over the decades with Vegas headlines, this is a great book to read.

It is incredibly insightful and provides a great deal of humor in what can sometimes be a tough situation. I have totally enjoyed this series online and will be buying the other collections as well."},{"Title":"Piled Higher and Deeper: A Graduate Student Comic Strip Collection","review":"Jorge Cham has a very creative way of illustrating challenges in graduate school in a humorous, yet charming way. I think that one of the challenges in graduate school is that students are isolated, and they think they are the only ones dealing with a certain problem. When they recognize themselves (and their advisors!) in this comic strip they not only laugh, but feel relieved that others have dealt with the same issues. I remember always looking forward to this comic strip while I was a student! Entertaining and creative!Dora Farkas, Author, \\"The Smart Way to Your Ph.D.:200 Secrets from 100 Graduates\\""},{"Title":"Piled Higher and Deeper: A Graduate Student Comic Strip Collection","review":"If you have ever been a grad student these will seem WAY too familiar, and quite funny too. This 1st book occassionally gets a bit stanford specific, but aside from that any grad student anywhere can sympathize with(and laugh at) the confusion and bleakness that is a PhD. (I've been in grad school for 11 yrs...Mike Slackenerny is my hero!!)"},{"Title":"Piled Higher and Deeper: A Graduate Student Comic Strip Collection","review":"This whole comic strip is amazing!

I am a huge fan of PHD comics and this is a great way to preserve my memories of this wonderful comic. Keep it up George Cham.."},{"Title":"Piled Higher and Deeper: A Graduate Student Comic Strip Collection","review":"This is a great book. His humour is so spot on - it really is a great representation of grad life. This first book also shows how the strip has progressed over time - the artwork and the story arcs have developed a lot.A comic book that is extremely cathartic - and yeah, It really did help me get through my PhD."},{"Title":"Piled Higher and Deeper: A Graduate Student Comic Strip Collection","review":"Jorge's comic makes light of the trials and trival exsistence of graduate life.

The comic strips are nice and hillarious...As a PhD student, what Cham says in his comics really apply to your day to day life and this makes this comic strip really special.....Any Postgrad student who's interested in purchasing this book, don't think twice go ahead and order now!!!....I myself am thinking of ordering the remaining two books in future...."},{"Title":"Piled Higher and Deeper: A Graduate Student Comic Strip Collection","review":"Grad students! Are you working too hard? This comic strip collection can help.\\"Piled Higher and Deeper\\" (\\"PhD\\") is the first collection of strips of the legendary webcomic of the same name, written (and published) by Jorge Cham of Stanford University. This volume contains comics from roughly 1997 - 2002, including classics such as--The Grad Student Documentary (\\"Having feasted, the grad student enters a lethargic state called \\"researching\\", in anticipation of the next free meal.\\")--What is... the Thesis (\\"Is it so hard to believe? That grad school isn't real?\\")--Post-Bachelor's Disorder (\\"Do you experience frequent headaches trying to count how many years you've been in school?\\")--The High School Renunion (\\"Um... well... I... I'm still in school...\\")and many others. From the first crudely drawn sketches of cramped classrooms and quals to the later, well-drawn strips of research and conferences, \\"PhD\\" never fails to entertain. Some of the humor may be dark and depressing, but that just makes it more realistic, and all the more potent.If you don't believe that a grad student comic strip could possibly be so good, feel free to check out the strip's website, [...], where all of these strips are available for free. (But be warned - reading the entire archive could be hazardous to your research, and once you start, it's hard to stop...) Why buy the book when all its content is available free online? For one thing, to thank Jorge for all the hours of procrastination that he has so kindly provided. For another, to have access to the comics even when you're away from your compu... ok, never mind. The first reason is more than good enough by itself.Even though \\"PhD\\" focuses on engineering, grad students in all fields should find it equally entertaining. And of course, grad students are not the only people who can appreciate this volume - former grad students and future grad students will almost certainly enjoy it as well. All grad students past, present and future should purchase this first \\"Piled Higher and Deeper\\" collection (or better yet, have it purchased for them) without delay."},{"Title":"Piled Higher and Deeper: A Graduate Student Comic Strip Collection","review":"I especially suggest this book to people thinking about taking the PhD route. Read it before making a decision. Twice. Then, if you decide to go for it anyways, don't come crying to me when you finally realize that the thing you call your daily life is actually the raw material for one of the funniest comic strips around. And, believe me when I say Jorge is a funny guy but he doesn't really exaggerate that much, which makes the whole book more funny ( and kinda sad, too ). In any case, this is the second funniest thing I have read during the last couple of years. So, get it!Oh, curious about the funniest thing? My lame attempts at writing drafts for my thesis introduction, of course, what else?"},{"Title":"Piled Higher and Deeper: A Graduate Student Comic Strip Collection","review":"This is a unique collection of hilarious comic strips about graduate school life drawn by Jorge Cham, a genuine PhD student at Stanford University. Anyone who has ever been or known a graduate student struggling towards the completion of his or her thesis will recognize and appreciate the characters and scenarios herein. And although there are a number of inside jokes, and knowing the real-life inspirations for some of the characters certainly added to my personal enjoyment, most of the strips reflect the universal absurdities of the grad school experience rather than being specific to Stanford students. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Piled Higher and Deeper: A Graduate Student Comic Strip Collection","review":"You think you have unique problems in grad school. Then I read PhD comics and realized that ALL grad students have the same problems. Even though you can go for DAYS not talking to another human (professors don't count!), Cham describes our lives accurately! :) It's a perfect gift!"},{"Title":"Piled Higher and Deeper: A Graduate Student Comic Strip Collection","review":"I was a doctoral student at Stanford at the same time as Jorge, and have been reading the strip since it first appeared in the student paper. From virtually the first day it ran, it has always demonstrated remarkable insight into the highs and lows of the experience. A small part of the humor is Stanford-specific, and so won't make much sense to people from other schools, but the vast majority is remarkably universal. The sad thing is that the handful of friends for whom I've bought the book -- as a way to give them a sense of what I was going through, since no amount of verbal explanation really seemed to convey it accurately -- all had pretty much the same reaction: \\"Geez, why would you put yourself through that? Why would anyone?!?\\"Despite that, both books are brillant, and very much worth having."},{"Title":"Piled Higher and Deeper: A Graduate Student Comic Strip Collection","review":"A truly entertaining portrayal of graduate life. Anybody who's in grad school can find at least one strip (if not whole sections of the book) which fits them to a T. You find yourself laughing at just how true it is, and at the same time thinking it's all too warped to be real. I enjoyed every page!A word of caution -- this is a very effective procrastination tool and may inspire cynicism (but that's not bad, is it?...)"},{"Title":"Piled Higher and Deeper: A Graduate Student Comic Strip Collection","review":"ok, so it may not be so funny if you haven't done the post graduate life avoidance routine, but if you have, it's so funny it hurts. it's the perfect primer for those considering an advanced degree!"},{"Title":"Piled Higher and Deeper: A Graduate Student Comic Strip Collection","review":"Whew, how I love this comic strips very much !I've already forget how I came to this homepage. I was - procrastinating - at that time - just surfing the web while suddenly I saw this webpagephd.stanford.eduand boy, it makes me laugh aloud. I registered instantly at that time, and I've also read all the previous issue.For you who haven't read this comics, I'll tell ya abit.The comics' story circles around a few individuals - graduate students - at Stanford University. Hey, isn't that one of the famous school in America, and in the world. Where Silicon Valley is just a stonethrow away. Where Chelsea Clinton study too. Where some matches of the 1994 World Cup Soccer was held.Yes, but the story really touches the human side of graduate study. Yes, sometimes he exaggerated too much - but what matters is that he knows the real thing. Grad study is hard - classes and TA-ing in the early years - qualifying exams - research for the thesis.And you are underpaid. You live in a dorm - a very small room. You work in cubicles. You meet your friends in high school reunion, and finding out that they have already made a success - while you still, yes, stuck in grad school. You fail your horrible, tortorous qualifying exams.You are doing research - which you yourself are not sure about the outcomes of this research. Your family has a great expectation for you: a PhD would certainly be a cool thing, yet the real answer is not.Although some of the facts and stories are highly exaggerated, yet I saw a clear reflection of my own experience, and thousands other people's experience - graduate students in all parts of the world. I can laugh at myself now, and that bring a big relief to me.The characters: a character who in my opinion describes himself (the nerdy boy with a glasses, and later dark hair), Cecilia (who is absolutely smart but hasn't graduated yet - and meet her highschool's first crush in a reunion), Mike (a senior graduate students - only God and Jorge himselfknow how long he has been in grad school - even his professor doesn't know), Tajel (a graduate student in Philosophy), and Profesor Smith (the nerdy boy's advisor).My favorite characters' are Cecilia and Mike.Now here's my recommendation:If you are ordinary people: BUY this book so you also can feel what is a graduate student's life like.If you are an undergrad who doesn't want to go to grad school: BUY this book so you might want to CHANGE your mind.If you are an undergrad who want to go to grad school: BUY this book so you would THINK again about your decision.If you are graduate students, professors, post docs: BUY this book so you can see a reflection of all your experience in a more comforting, and leisuring way. I also hope you would get some spirit to get back on track for those who are already frustated.And if you buy this book, whoever you are: TELL Your friends to buy it too, or at least tell them about the websites !Finally, kudos for Jorge Cham. He's a PhD student in Mechanical Engineering at Stanford himself, but his talent in cartooning is great.I strongly hope he would keep his comic strips alive after he graduated.But now, he might called himself \`Professor' this time.Kudos for you, Jorge. May the geeks be with you, and you be free from The Thesis !"},{"Title":"Piled Higher and Deeper: A Graduate Student Comic Strip Collection","review":"Being a graduate student myself this book has made me laugh, cringe and laugh again over and over.

You will laught really hard, almost to the point of tears... if you have a PhD, have attempted to get one, or you are in the process of getting it.Humor is regularly very dependent on our backgrounds, and although there are quite some of the strips who will make everybody laught their socks off, to most people, most of the strips will make little or no sense at all.Now, if you are a grad student...

It kept me sane during the long trials and it kept me LAUGHING, which is always a key to keeping one foot going in front of the other. I highly recommend it to ANYONE still in the midst of a PhD, or those who, like me, still have the memory fresh in our minds. Highlights include Newton's three laws of graduate school (my favorite: Every action towards graduation has an equal and opposite distraction), and many other priceless moments. BUY IT!"},{"Title":"Piled Higher and Deeper: A Graduate Student Comic Strip Collection","review":"Jorge Cham has really captured the essence of the graduate student and his/her graduate school experience.

Often. Life in PhD is not that different from the real doctoral life (with some precautions), if you ever want to spend some time in a funny reading (or just procrastinate some real work) that's a good way of doing this. During the reading you will notice how the characters will be more and more refined as time goes on.

This book is about all the things you secretly think, but would never dare share with others. It's about the things you are certain that no other human experiences. Jorge Cham just writes them in the most hilarious way, helping you see that you are NOT alone. A recent study found that 95% of all graduate students feel overwhelmed. Without this book, I think they would have found 100%."},{"Title":"Piled Higher and Deeper: A Graduate Student Comic Strip Collection","review":"Its a shame this comic isn't right next to Garfield in every paper!"},{"Title":"Piled Higher and Deeper: A Graduate Student Comic Strip Collection","review":"HI Jorge,I finished your book in 45 mins after I tore open the shipment from amazon. The excitement was due to the fact that it talks abt us(hmmm, i'm a phd student myself!)and I wanted to know who well u portrayed it. And you did it damn well! Just one complaint!!! I thought the book would be thicker...stories of grad life are bigger...and bigger it gets,we'll like it even more! So plz don't stop writing. I know u'll graduate, but pass on to your colleagues who are still looking for the light at the end of the tunnel!"},{"Title":"Piled Higher and Deeper: A Graduate Student Comic Strip Collection","review":"I bought this book due to the recommendations listed here and was very disappointed! Not only was the print quality of the book very poor, the comic strip was only mildly amusing at best. This was surprising to me, because as a Ph.D. student, I am intimately aware of the insanities associated with grad student life, and thought they would be humorously profiled here. Although a few of the strips made me smile, none of them evoked the rolling on the ground laughter that I was hoping for. I guess I will have to find another diversion from my thesis! :)"},{"Title":"Piled Higher and Deeper: A Graduate Student Comic Strip Collection","review":"This comic strip presents a very realistic (and very funny) perspective of graduate student life. Several archetypes are followed: the grad student who has been there since the dawn of time and his ever-pregnant wife, the wishy-washy grad student, the female grad student who can't get a date, the first-years, and the token humanities grad student. All are drawn and written to a T. Although the humor will be apparant to anyone who reads it, the biting observations will ring especially true to anyone whose gone through the graduate student process."},{"Title":"Piled Higher and Deeper: A Graduate Student Comic Strip Collection","review":"Piled Higher and Deeper helped me get through graduate school. They say depressed people make the best comedians -- and who is more depressed than the average grad student?There are many rolling-on-the-floor hilarious moments, but for the most part Ph.D. is more of a gentle tease on grad school, which is often just the sort of thing you need when you start taking the difficulties of grad school a little too seriously.(Oh, and yes, I did finish my Ph.D., in philosophy, and am now happily employed. I still read Ph.D. every week.)"},{"Title":"Piled Higher and Deeper: A Graduate Student Comic Strip Collection","review":"The insight was hilarious.

I have shared this book (and Cham's website) with my advisor and fellow grad students. Everyone gets a kick out of it.

I am a HUGE fan."},{"Title":"Piled Higher and Deeper: A Graduate Student Comic Strip Collection","review":"If you're in grad school, you WILL love this book. This strip really captures the weird geeky culture of grad school will knock you off your socks laughing. Great artwork, cute characters; the works."},{"Title":"Piled Higher and Deeper: A Graduate Student Comic Strip Collection","review":"I finished my Ph.D. more years ago than I will admit to in public, but virtually all of what Jorge Cham writes about is true, including the long hours, the lack of money, the effect it has on your diet and even (especially) the way undergrads wear you down when you're a T. A. (teaching assistant). About the only difference between what he draws and the reality that I lived through (artistic license taken into account) is that PCs were not really around when I was in grad school (although they were just on the horizon)."},{"Title":"Piled Higher and Deeper: A Graduate Student Comic Strip Collection","review":"Jorge Cham and his PHD Comics are for graduate students what Scott Adams and his Dilbert cartoons are for the cubicle-dweller white-collars of the corporate life.

While its main characters are mostly engineer-types, I am sure humanities majors would also appreciate the witticisms presented here in cartoon form on the trials of advisor-student relations, free food, and procrastination techniques. Most of the time I was laughing hard and appreciating the commentary for its accuracy, rarely it was so spot-on as to be a little depressing!

We all loved it."},{"Title":"Piled Higher and Deeper: A Graduate Student Comic Strip Collection","review":"After taking quals .. I kind of had this little stress out session and felt a little depressed.. (who can explain why??) Anyway.. this book was just what i needed.. I keep it on my desk when I am working and open it to any page and find the humor in this stage of my life... I have showed the book to so many people and they have had the same result. One of my favorites is the one where someone new is being introduced and one of the characters asks 'What is the your dissertation topic?\\" and another smacks him and says \\"You might as well ask a woman her weight...!\\" I think this should be a gift for any grad student you know... at first I was worried that the Comp Sci twist on the comic would not be relevant to my phd experiences in education, but it is very relevant and great to know others question the sacrifices of graduate school everyday."},{"Title":"Piled Higher and Deeper: A Graduate Student Comic Strip Collection","review":"Jorge Cham's incisive vision lets us laugh at the petty triumphs, carefully cultivated neuroses and mild paranoia that flavour graduate life.

If you are not in that category of the struggling in need of ego-stroking, then you probably won't be interested. Firstly, it is not funny. After a few pages we get it: grad students are overworked, tired, poor, starving, and mostly geeks seeking dates. How is that different than the life of undergrads? Ok, grad students have an awkward relationship with professors (who don't even know their names and use them as slaves) and under-grads (who consider them authority figures) which gives the grad students an odd mental complex. No much real humor here. Unless you count references to how supposedly great the weather is presumably in Palo Alto which is not really that good compared to southern California.

Jorge Cham brings some of his own insights from his time at Stanford and all that hits close to home. The comic might have a slightly niche audience as I can imagine that it might be hard for an outsider to get some of the humor. The strip is immensely popular though among grad audidence and you can see the latest comic pasted on notice boards or across the lab windows or even outside the offices of profs themselves. I feel every one in grad school can relate to at least one of the characters in the strip, and of course compare their advisor to Prof Smith ;).

Nick was the town's sexy bad-boy when he left home sixteen years ago; Craig was the golden boy and his father's favorite, but Craig was still a very good big brother to Nick. Nick only had one close friend growing up and that was Jenna; and then Jenna married Craig and they should have lived happily ever after.Jenna Profit and her two young sons have not had an easy life since Craig died and the ensuing scandal. Craig's father died a month later after rewriting his will; he set aside a portion for his grandsons' educations and gave the rest of his money and property to charity. Jenna has been shunned by the \\"good\\" people of Harmony Hills, and supplements her teaching salary by taking in roomers in the big, old rundown mansion she and Craig had bought before his death. Jenna and her tenants all have one thing in common - heartbreak and betrayal. Having Nick staying with her and her ladies can only add more fodder for the gossips to feed on, but it feels so right having him in her life again.317 Beulah Street is a rich and emotional story, which captivates the reader from page one. Nick is a troubled, tortured hero who only wants to make everything right for the only woman he has ever loved, Jenna. Jenna, however, is strong enough to overcome almost everything except Nick's doubts about his own brother's honesty. There is never any doubt to anyone that these two people have a future together.

Nick revises his charter as he must know why his brother's family have been ostracized and where did his now deceased father's wealth go, a task made easier because he is falling in love with Craig's widow and two sons.This is an interesting character study and contemporary romance that focuses on the key cast members' actions to the death of a loved one. The heroine keeps on moving in spite of the condemnation of the community because she knows she must provide a nurturing environment for her two children. Nick is more enigmatic because he never seemed concerned with life back home even when he didn't receive letters from Craig, but that still doesn't lessen his need to know now.

Good read!"},{"Title":"Hark upon the Gale: An Illustrated History of the College of William and Mary","review":"This book is a combination of text and photos with some sketches. The College of William and Mary has perhaps the most interesting history of any college in the US. The book starts with the royal charter of 1693 and continues almost to the present day. It is a great addition to the collection of friends of the college. It would be a great addition to libraries. The history of the school is interwoven into the history of the US, especially from the founding of the colonies until the years following the Civil War. If one has not been to Williamsburg, the campus of William and Mary is perhaps overall the most beautiful in the country. It does not have the vast buildings of Harvard or Princeton, but it is in a smaller sense more lovely. This book would be a great gift for any graduating senior or alum."},{"Title":"The Teacher's Gradebook: Strategies for Student Success","review":"Dr. Raebeck has written a thoughtful and up-to-date work regarding all elements of the grading process. He knows how to obtain student success, and has a proven record of effective classroom practice. The strategies are intriguing and the writing is engaging, informative and even humorous. This book really upgrades current discussions about the grading and assessment process in our secondary schools."},{"Title":"Swamp Thing, Vol. 7: Regenesis","review":"Rich Veitch certainly gets off to a good start with this collection. This collection picks up after the reunion of Swamp Thing and Abby, his wife. Veitch begins a compelling storyline in which the Parliament of Trees has accidentally planted the \\"seed\\" for the NEW Swamp Thing, thinking Alec Holland had died during his time wandering the universe. Swamp Thing goes head to head against his elders, and a new monster, the \\"Wild Thing,\\" is introduced. Veitch even works some magic in making Abby a stronger character, and bringing back John Constantine.The \\"BUT\\" in my review comes from the relatively scant amount of material included in this book. While it is not as expensive as the others in the Saga series, it collects only SIX issues. And the final issue feels like a cliffhanger. If DC/Vertigo has no plans to release AT LEAST the rest of Veitch's run, I will be very disappointed. A great deal of new information is presented in this collection, without much payoff by the book's conclusion."},{"Title":"Swamp Thing, Vol. 7: Regenesis","review":"Following one of comicdoms high-points can't be easy. One of two things usually happens: the writer moves in a new direction leaving the past continuity completely behind (think Geoff Johns on the Flash after Mark Waid) or the writer tries to keep the book what it was but fails (think Doom Patrol after Grant Morrison left - Rachel Pollock was miserable). But in taking the reins on Swamp Thing after Alan Moore finished up his multi-year run, Rick Veitch does a real interesting job. His first few issues are in this collection. It's definately worth reading and I hope DC keeps 'em coming. But if you haven't already read the six collections that make up Mooore's run on the title...well, you should do that first. Then come read this."},{"Title":"Swamp Thing, Vol. 7: Regenesis","review":"While no one is (or could be) Alan Moore, and he is certainly the definitive Swamp Thing writer, Veitch does a really good job. Moore concentrates on ST as horror, Veitch centers his story on sci-fi aspects.These issues make up only a small part of Veitch's (almost) 2 year run (with the abrupt ending caused by the infamous Jesus issue cancellation). Altogether, it is rare that a writer can pick up and produce quality stuff after the great master has left."},{"Title":"Call Me by My Rightful Name","review":"BRAVO! I ENJOYED READING THE BOOK TITLED \\"CALL ME BY MY RIGHTFUL NAME\\" BY PROFESSOR ISIDORE OKPEWHO. THIS BOOK IS A PAGER TURNER, HISTORICAL, INTELLIGENT, AND THE PREMISE IS VERY FASCINATING. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! GET YOUR COPY TODAY!"},{"Title":"Call Me by My Rightful Name","review":"I used to visit a friend at SUNY Binghamton who swore up and down that his professor, Dr. Okpewho, was the cat's meow. Okpewho's heavily accented Oxfordian English was elegant and precise, like the man himself. I expect he must be in his sixties today, and his new book has a sort of weary feeling to it. It has a surprising story which begins sort of like The Exorcist--an American man starts speaking in long lines of what seems like gibberish to his family and friends, a language he cannot account for himself, an experience like the famous \\"speaking in tongues\\" of evangelistic Christianity. Instead, linguists identify this language as the tribal dialect of Central Africa! One further note, the book takes place in the glory days of the Civil Rights Movement (the 1960s) and occasionally Dr. Okpewho seems to have forgotten how to bring this era alive, so that his protagonist's sttruggle has the dusty effect of an episode of AMERICAN DREAMS. But all in all, the author of The Victims (1970), The Last Duty (1976), and Tides (1993) has created a wonderland of a new novel.The plot is intricate and extraordinary, bridging the gap between the USA and Africa as very few novelists are prepared to do, and very few readers ever get to understand. At the heart of the book is the simple cry of a man who is lost here and finds himself there, only to find his way once again back here in America, a country that sometimes seems as benighted as the Middle Ages, while flashing all kinds of high tech gimmickry. This novel is old fashioned in some ways, but it's a mind trip!"},{"Title":"Bequest","review":"This novel has it all--sensuality, danger, mystery, and a beautiful love story, all told in Candice Proctor's wonderfully evocative prose. The descriptions above really don't do justice to this story. Gabrielle Antoine is a convent raised orphan desperate to learn more about the mother she only dimly remembers. When she arrives in Central City, Colorado, she discovers more than she can handle: that her mother was a brothel owner and has only recently died, leaving her whorehouse to Gabrielle and to her mother's partner, a dark, dangerous, haunted man named Jordan Hays. Horrified, Gabrielle can think of nothing but leaving town and selling the house. But the evil nature of the prospective buyer and a sense of responsibility to the &quot;girls&quot; changes her mind.What follows is a story of the corruption of innocence, deftly written by a master hand. Gabrielle's noble plans to help the &quot;girls&quot; find decent jobs and turn the house into a school are complicated by her desire to learn more about her mother and her mother's backgroud. An intelligent but fundamentally innocent and sheltered woman, Gabrielle must come to understand sin and human weakness and her own awakening sensuality against the decadent background of a 19th century whorehouse. The tortured hero, Jordan Hays, is gorgeous. Bound by his own noble nature and a promise made to a dying friend, all he wants to do is run away from Gabrielle, from the feelings she threatens to reawaken in him, and from what he knows will be the inevitable result of her growing physical attraction to him.There is so much more to this book--wonderful secondary characters, a dangerous mystery, and the beauty of the Colorado Rockies, so wonderfully depicted. Candice Proctor writes with the power and intensity of Laura Kinsale, and the emotional depth of LaVyre Spencer. This is a wonderful book. Don't miss it."},{"Title":"Bequest","review":"One of the things I liked most about this book was the characters. They were always honest with each other. They shared their pasts, they talked about things, they understood and accepted each other as they were. I really liked that. Fear and pain kept them from committing throughout the book not misunderstandings.This isn't a comfortable book to read. It's set in a whorehouse and is filled with violent, dirty images. The author writes so well you can see and smell the countryside and feel the moments of tranquillity the hero shares with the heroine but on the downside you also see, smell and experience the filth and vile acts that she doesn't shy away from writing about. It's a rough, realistic and oftentimes heartbreaking depiction of the lives of woman who sell their bodies for various reasons. But throughout it all the love story remains tender and loving.This isn't a story I'd normally read. I like light and funny these days. The dialogue isn't witty, and I honestly didn't like the plot but for some odd reason I could not put the book down. Never did I feel the urge to start skimming. I know why too, it's because I cared about these people. I liked the hero and heroine, their honesty, their motivations, and their blossoming feelings were all so real and so raw. And two of the sympathetically drawn secondary characters really tugged at my heart. I wouldn't want to read this type of plot often, that's for sure, but I do recommend this book because the love story is well developed and believable."},{"Title":"Bequest","review":"Candice Proctor has ingeniously spun a beautiful and suspenseful story set in a rough and tough mining town in 1874 Colorado.Gabrielle Antoine, a twenty year old New Orleans convent bred woman, inherits a bordello in Central City Colorado from the mother she never knew. Enticed by her life long desire to know who her mother is, Gabrielle travels to Colorado. Jordan Hays, her mother's partner and loyal manager, always dresses in black except for his crisp white frilled shirt. Even the leather holster for the gun strapped low on his hip is black. The only thing Gabrielle wants is to learn who her mother is and the only thing Jordan wants is to sell the property, split the money with Gabrielle, and go on to something new.The innocent and nave Gabrielle and the suave and savvy casino gambler that Jordan is want first to avoid each other but are gradually attracted to each other as the plot unfolds. The Bequest is filled with interesting, exciting, and realistic characters, both main and secondary. Gabrielle and Jordan have their own demons with which they must grapple and which are craftily revealed in measured doses. The sexual tension between them slowly and excruciatingly escalates until they are unable to suppress their urges and desires.Every page is filled with suspense and intrigue and just about every chapter ends in a cliffhanger. About two-thirds through the book, the plot reveals surprises that breathe new life into an already exciting story. This is the second book I've read by Candice Proctor and, it too, captured me at the very beginning and didn't let go until the last page. The Bequest is a western and a romantic suspense ingeniously melded by Candice Proctor. It's a great and entertaining read. If you are like me and don't care much for westerns, The Bequest is the book that will change your mind. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Bequest","review":"Gabrielle Antoine has lived a sheltered life in a convent in New Orleans since the age of 5, thinking that her mother had died a long time ago. She receives a message one day to say that she has been left a house in Central City, Colorado by a person unknown to her.She heads out to Colrado to discover more about her past only to find out that she has been left a brothel by her mother who had only died recently from a shot in the back. There she meets the ruggedly handsome business partner of her mother, Jordan Hays. A loner and drifter who hides his secret painful past.Together they run the brothel, with him in charge of the gaming rooms and her playing at the piano. Gabrielle wants to turn the brothel into a school and find decent jobs for the girls who work at the brothel. But in order to this she must keep the brothel open a bit longer so that she can buy out Jordan's share of the business. As time goes by Gabrielle and Jordan find themselves being attracted to the other. Only Jordan keeps repelling Gabrielle's love for him as he knows that he will not stay long and will leave Central City and Gabrielle's life forever.Lurking in the background is danger in the form of Doug Slaughter. He wants to get his hands on Gabrielle's brothel and eventually on the gold mines that belonged to Gabrielle's mother. Together Jordan and Gabrielle fight the ruthless Doug Slaughter time and time again, risking their lives.This was an intense and exciting romance set in the West with danger lurking in every corner. As always the hero has a painful past which prevents him from loving again but with the soft coaxing of the heroine he opens up and sees a new and more hopeful world. In return the heroine finds her body and senses awoken by the dark an mysterious hero. This was good book to read overall. The plot was well thought out and the romance with lots of tension. This is my second book by Candice Proctor and so far I have not been disappointed. I will be looking for more books by this author in the future.Lea Ling Tsang"},{"Title":"Bequest","review":"The Bequest was a wonderful love story. A bit on the unusual side because she takes us into the world of brothels in this historical romance. Jordan Hays is every woman's dream; sensitive and caring yet rugged and dangerous. Gabrielle was a wonderful heroine for him and I really enjoyed how the author brought these two together and how they genuinely cared for each other. This is only the second book by Proctor that I've read and I am looking forward to getting her other work and reading that also. A truly amazing love story."},{"Title":"Bequest","review":"Wow! Penelope Williamson is one of my favorite authors.......she writes with such depth and emotion...never shying away from pain, hardship, or \\"life\\". I didn't think I'd ever read anything that could match her.....but guess what.....SHE HAS A SISTER!Candice Proctor can write every bit as well as her sister and I have loved both books that I've read by her. Night in Eden is one of my all time favorites, so The Bequest didn't quite live up to the brilliance of her debut novel, but it sure came close!The Bequest is set in Central City Colorado in the year 1874. It reads like a western.... hired guns, saloons, brothels...you name it this one's got it! Many others have done wonderfully with their synopsis's, so I'll just give my two cents!The hero and heroine MAKE this story GREAT! He is a wounded soul that is hardened and cynical from loss. She is an innocent, raised in a convent, optimistic and hope-filled. She teaches him to have the courage to love again, and he teaches her about the hard reality of life and what her Body was made for....HIM!The brothel scenes were descriptive but not crude, the girls from the brothel came to life, each having their own story and the villain in this story was \\"evil incarnate\\". The love story between Gabrielle and Jordan is the foundation of this story that is laced with mystery, intrigue, and a stunning conclusion....I recommend this book and this author HIGHLY.Also check out her sister Penelope Williamson....The Outsider is my favorite of hers!"},{"Title":"Bequest","review":"I love this book!

I can't wait to read Ms. Proctor's next."},{"Title":"Bequest","review":"Set in Central City, Colorado in 1874, this story of the post Civil War west makes for a most interesting romance. Proctor writes exceptionally well and the story will definitely hold your attention. There is lots of action, mystery and a love that will tear at your heart. If you've ever love a man who couldn't return your love because of his haunted past, this one's for you.Gabrielle Antoine has been raised in a New Orleans convent, believing she is an orphan. Her dream is to one day have a school for girls. Then one day, as a young woman, she finds out her mother only recently died and has left her a house and a business in Colorado. Gabrielle is most curious and decides to go there to learn more about her mother. It turns out the house and business are the same--a brothel--and her mother was the madam who, while still a beautiful woman at 40, was murdered. Once in Colorado, Gabrielle meets her mother's business partner, a tough ex-Confederate officer and former Texas Ranger named Jordan Hays, whose brothers died in the war and whose pregnant wife was raped and murdered by Union soldiers. He is one cold guy, but he can also be charming and he charms Gabrielle. An innocent virgin, Jordan tells her he will take her innocence and leave her with less than she had when he leaves as he intends to do. He has no desire to marry again. He thinks it will be easy to take her and ruin her. It is and he does. Gee, what a good guy (not!). Gabrielle's one fear is becoming like her mother...and it seems Jordan is willing to help her down that path. Then comes a bad guy who wants the brothel to add to his kingdom, and he doesn't care who he has to corrupt or murder to get it.There are wonderful secondary characters, the prostitutes in the bordello, their children and the villains (and there are more than one!). As Gabrielle develops a heart for the women and their children, so will you. We are all a product of our pasts and these women had very difficult pasts.Though Proctor lives in Australia, she writes about Colorado as if she had been a long time resident. Her descriptions of the natural beauty of the place are quite accurate and well done. She is a master storyteller. Suddenly, you are back in the west of the 19th century when people were trying to carve a life for themselves out of the rugged terrain and difficult circumstances.I recommend this one!"},{"Title":"Bequest","review":"I really liked this book, they had real problems to overcome not just silly misunderstandings you will really love this book"},{"Title":"Things Your Grammar Never Told You: A Pocket Handbook","review":"I was a student of Dr. Maurice Scharton's and also acted as a teacher's assistant for a semester while he worked on this book.

Wilkinson wrote a book, devotional and study. I read the devotional first and loved it. So I put together a study. The Bible Study works best in a group.

Remembering Our Home is a most gently written, beautifully illustrated book that invites the reader to reflect on the earliest and most impressionable moments of being human--in the womb. If at first this strikes you as improbable to do, consider the countless life dreams and aspirations you, or people you know have had, and somehow, someway fulfillment seems to be just out of reach. Remembering Our Home can help build bridges across the gaps to fulfillment by revealing potential blocks, that can form in our first experiences of feeling physically and emotionally. Some examples of causes of these blocks discussed in the book are being born early, or late, toxins like niccotine or drugs, and parents in a stressful environment. Throughout the book there are suggested processes and tools for accessing our earliest potentials. I was born with a disability, and working with this, and the ample additional referals in the book is transforming the quality of my daily life. I am learning from it to benefit myself and all the babies and children in my world."},{"Title":"Remembering Home: Healing Hurts & Receiving Gifts from Conception to Birth","review":"This book is such a hidden gem. It is quite unpretentious, but fulfills a need that many therapists don't even perceive or know how to address. So many of my clients struggle with lack of attuned early parenting. For many, their parents still have difficulty being supportive. This slender volume provides a way to help clients understand that they have \\"archetypal parents\\"--ones that don't fail them the way their human ones do. It can be such a support to feel the love of an archetypal parent--and so necessary. Don't let the Christican symbols used in the book turn you away; all spiritual traditions have these same figures--just with different names and stories. Everyone who enters therapy would be well served to read this book--and get their therapists to read it as well. It is also a great book for conscientious parents to read. It is one of the most cohesive approaches to healing parental wounds available in book form that I have ever seen--one that addresses all three levels of existence: personal, cultural, and archetypal. Plus it is so wise about issues concerning pre- and perinatal psychology as well. Even after having read it several times, I am still informed and inspired by this little book."},{"Title":"Remembering Home: Healing Hurts & Receiving Gifts from Conception to Birth","review":"It is amazing to think that babies in the womb are so aware of things that are happening to mother and father.

The other authors offer a spiritual context for handling such matters."},{"Title":"Remembering Home: Healing Hurts & Receiving Gifts from Conception to Birth","review":"The four authors have been delivering large public playshops on this for decades mostly \\"underground\\" on various church circuits.The book expands magnificently on the idea of imaging and visualizing a new spiritual father and/or new spiritual mother. The book is a journey to redeem your self from unresolved trauma prior to conception, thru birth, to the weeks after birth. It's also a brief manual of best practices for expecting parents.Readers familiar with the heavy breathing technique of Rebirthing will see this technique mentioned. Thankfully the emphasis of the authors is NOT on the extremely problematic practice of forceful return to birth trauma thru rapid breathing. Rather it is the \\"Spiritual Exercises\\" of Saint Ignatus to relive, in guided visualizations, the life of Jesus of Nazareth, as if you were going thru it as His bodily companion, in great detail.Then again, the book is not that; rather, 90% of this book is a gentle review of the pre-conception thru birth experience of the soul, pointing out all the ways souls are \\"tricked\\" into believing themselves separated form God, in the human birth process. Insights on how we became separated and how to reconnect imaginatively, are not delivered thru dry psychiatric or even Jungian terms but grounded in personal stories by the four authors of their own birth regressions, stories about the results of healing sessions done on their adopted infant son, other client stories, humor and other learnings. One of the authors, William Emerson, is a birth psychology specialist; all the authors lead workshops on this material.The net effect is a \\"light\\" tone enabling readers to go as shallowly or as deeply into unresolved pre-natal and peri-natal experiences as they wish. Exercises, group discussion questions and other helpful things for facilitating growth experiences for others are included."},{"Title":"Remembering Home: Healing Hurts & Receiving Gifts from Conception to Birth","review":"It's hard to give this book a one-star rating. Although the authors have everything wrong about pregnancy, memory, trauma and therapy from a scientific standpoint, the book is so weirdly silly!For example, as I recall, Emerson claims to have helped his twin be born by pulling her out behind him. One author, the Catholic priest, claims to have healed himself of his issues with women by imagining, for extended periods of time, being breast fed by the Virgin Mary.

For although it can be thoroughly enjoyed as a \\"stand alone\\" adventure, \\"Invisible Chimes\\" is actually an intriguing and clever follow-up to the previous title in the series, \\"The Haunted Attic\\".Here, while working on a new mystery involving a daring robbery and an injured young girl with a secret past, Judy slowly becomes aware that she (and by extension, we the readers!) overlooked an important clue that she uncovered during the course of her last investigation ... a clue that might have a direct bearing on her current case. How Judy fits together the final pieces of a puzzle that was larger than she (and we) first suspected makes for thrilling, \\"just-one-more-chapter-before-bed\\" reading.As the mystery unfolds, Judy learns some more valuable lessons about herself and other people, confronting her own quick temper and tendency to pre-judge others, and experiencing a healthy dose of shame along the way. That's what makes Judy one of the most interesting characters in juvenile series history ... her imperfect humanity and her ability to grow as she experiences more of life. \\"The Invisible Chimes\\", like the rest of the series, is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Hostage: The History, Facts & Reasoning Behind Political Hostage Taking","review":"I started reading this book for a research paper on hostage taking situations. However, after three chapters, I had to put it down. It is poorly edited (missing apostrphes, etc.) and poorly written.

Although I had hoped that the book would still be useful as a resource for my paper, I finally realized that it was not credible source."},{"Title":"Hostage: The History, Facts & Reasoning Behind Political Hostage Taking","review":"First, I give the author credit for his thorough research of the subject. If you are looking for a starting point to research the topic of political hostage taking, then this will serve you well. Most of the major recent hostage incidents are addressed as the author analyzes when political hostage taking works and when it does not. He also tackles the subject from the view of the hostage taker and the hostage themselves. So, overall, a decent work.However, I give this book only three stars for several reasons. To start, this is a very dry work. For such a dramatic, exciting subject, I wanted to go to sleep after reading every chapter. The author's style is that of an academic, not an entertainer. Also, the author undermined the credibility of his work by inserting inappropriate political comments that had absolutely nothing to do with the subject (i.e. criticizing U.S. foreign policy, George Bush, Don Rumsfeld, and also criticizing female leaders like Margaret Thatcher). The author has every right to his opinions, but please stick to the subject matter.Also, I do not give the author any credit for originality. He took a very predictable approach to the subject and did not bring anything new to light for someone already versed in the field.

The tales included also help to get into the abstract wisdom and back the advices given.I am in the self-help business and in my opinion: this is a great book for all people. At least you will smile once in a while and you will understand some things better about life or yourself. Even if you already know it all!!"},{"Title":"How to Be Happy, Dammit : A Cynic's Guide to Spiritual Happiness","review":"This is a bright and entertaining guide (or stimulus) for people who are prone to cynicism and pessimism. The book design is itself a pleasure to behold -- bright, colorful graphics that are creatively designed and boldly executed. Perhaps the jaded and cynical among us can be more happy, especially spiritually happy (more than socially), without having to become people who use those yellow smiley face symbols all over the place. I like that premise and hope it works for a lot of people. Being an anti-smiley-face person myself, I love the cover of Barbara Held's book &quot;Stop Smiling, Start Kvetching&quot; which draws a red 'NO' circle and line through that ubiquitous yellow face. Now I have noticed among my circle of friends that different people like or dislike different ones of Karen Salmansohn's many books. So if &quot;How To Be Happy -- Dammit&quot; does not appeal to your taste in books, you might want to check out her newest 2003 book, &quot;How To Change Your Entire Life By Doing Absolutely Nothing.&quot; Salmansohn has a fabulous sense of humor, and she also is very perceptive about what it is like to be an individual living in contemporary society, in a manner that can be helpful as well as entertaining. Great combination."},{"Title":"How to Be Happy, Dammit : A Cynic's Guide to Spiritual Happiness","review":"I love most of the books by Karen Salmansohn. And I agree that How to Be Happy, Dammit: A Cynic's Guide to Spiritual Happiness, is one of her very best -- nice graphics, attractive book, with a funny and warmly helpful message. I have to add, with Valentine's Day coming (but good year round), she just published a new book, How to Speak Fluent Lovey Dovey in 11 Languages in 24 Hours, and I love it, too. Also attractively designed with a positive yet funny message."},{"Title":"How to Be Happy, Dammit : A Cynic's Guide to Spiritual Happiness","review":"I really like almost all of Karen Salmansohn's various and diverse books. They can be read for the humor, read for the insight, and/or read for comfort. For those of us sometimes troubled by our sensitive temperaments or our tendencies toward negative attitudes and feelings, How to be Happy - Dammit, can be a comfortable and helpful companion. It is an excellent book, in terms of 'the content, the illustrations, the layout, the whole attitude' as another reviewer summed it up. On my bedside, for when I can't get to sleep or I wake up feeling down, I keep copies of The Blue Day Book and KS's How to be Happy - Dammit. They are good books that help me keep my spirits up."},{"Title":"How to Be Happy, Dammit : A Cynic's Guide to Spiritual Happiness","review":"I think this is one groovy book! The graphics are sharp, and add to the lighthearted approach the author has taken to a heavy, heady subject (i.e. how (why?) individuals fit into the bigger scheme of the universe). You don't have to be an expert in chaos theory or zen or anything to understand, and ENJOY this book. Buy it, read it!"},{"Title":"How to Be Happy, Dammit : A Cynic's Guide to Spiritual Happiness","review":"Well, this is a book that helps you see life in a different way.

Uplifting, entertaining; good guidance.Dr. T. Kelemen-Beatty,DD,BFHM"},{"Title":"How to Be Happy, Dammit : A Cynic's Guide to Spiritual Happiness","review":"A fun, fun book with a great message. I bought it when I was completely stressed at work and now I keep it there. When I need a break, I'll just open it up and read a couple of pages and feel much better. The book is also beautifully designed. Once I bought a copy, I ordered a second one for a friend whose dad had passed. She too found it to be very inspirational. It is the type of feel-good book for people that HATE those kind of feel-good books. No cornball or cheese in this book!"},{"Title":"How to Be Happy, Dammit : A Cynic's Guide to Spiritual Happiness","review":"I decided to buy this book after checking out another book by the same author. All I saw was the title &quot;How to be Happy, Dammit&quot;, and I thought &quot;oh my god, that's something I would say!&quot;. I immediately knew this would be a perfect book for me, and I must say, it certainly is. I don't think you have to be a cynic to enjoy this wonderful little book, though being one does make you even more entertained by it. Now that I have myself a copy, I'm going to have to pick one up for all of my cynical friends."},{"Title":"How to Be Happy, Dammit : A Cynic's Guide to Spiritual Happiness","review":"This is probably the lamest self-help book I've ever read. I was hopeful... the cover was appealing, the title very much so... but there's nothing in this book to appeal to a cynic. In fact, I think the word \\"cynic\\" is only used in the whole of the text... maybe twice? It's full of kitschy new-age pop mantras that might work for someone who's used to being happy but has maybe hit a bad streak. I get the feeling this author has never had a cynical day in her life. My biggest consolation is that I picked up this title at a used book sale, and only wasted fifty cents on it."},{"Title":"How to Be Happy, Dammit : A Cynic's Guide to Spiritual Happiness","review":"This book is billed as a &quot;cynic's guide to spiritual happiness.&quot; I am a cynic, and this book is not for me.

With pretty, glossy pictures, varyingly inconsistent text size ,and a damn flower on the front. Theres more stock imagery in this then Microsoft office 03. So, should you buy it, or not.

I also just finishing ENOUGH DAMMIT..which offers very insightful advice for breaking bad patterns and going after what you want in life...or what Karen calls your dream quest.

The hits kept coming (health, job, moving from a city I love, etc) and things just kept getting worse. I felt so isolated and alone. Despite being skeptical of self-help books in general, I decided I had to try something to snap out of it. The title alone sold me on this book, and the previous reviews encouraged me to stick it in the Amazon cart. Glad I did.Seriously, I knew I was going to enjoy this book by pg 14. (And for the record, that's probably less than 300 words). The build-up to Life Lesson #1 was a great way for me to get perspective on my current situation, and it only got better from there. There was a small section in the middle that I had difficulty resonating with, but just as I was beginning to think this book was getting beyond my interest, it sucked me back in and finished strong.It is a simplistic book, which certainly works for those who like me aren't big into self-help (or reading at all). Inevitability, you as a reader have to put the things learned from this book into motion, but it certainly gives you a much more positive perspective/outlook to move forward with.This is a book which I forsee myself reading at least once a year for the rest of my life."},{"Title":"How to Be Happy, Dammit : A Cynic's Guide to Spiritual Happiness","review":"I have no patience for self-help books. The print is small. There are no pictures. They throw in references to religions I don't believe in, lists I don't feel like making, blah blah. Let's face it, when you look for self-help books, you're oftentimes hurting. Who wants to read 300+ pages of mouse-type spiritual-psychobabble that some friend INSISTED you read when you feel like nobody really understands what you're going through anyway? Not me. I thumbed through a million \\"self-help\\" books before stumbling on this ray of sunshine. \\"How To Be Happy, Dammit\\" is sunshine, dammit. The kind of sunshine you want when your mind is racing, dammit. I respect where the negative reviews are coming from... this isn't a step-by-step \\"one life fits all\\" manual to living what society says your life should be. Rather, it's a medley of food for thought -- that's actually DIGESTIBLE. Eat it up. And come back for seconds if you want. Spit some out when a friend is down. It's all good. A dash of zen. A pinch of Patanjali. Some physics, just for good measure. And pictures. Groovy typeface. Aside from the reference to answering machines ... this book is timeless. If you're going through a break-up/divorce, you'll get something out of this book. Moving? There's inspiration for you, too. Unemployed? It'll uplift you. I particularly appreciated the fact that this book touches on a variety of tenets, yet doesn't cram one or the other down your throat. Food for thought ... that you can digest ... especially if you're tired of bloated self-help books. \\"How To Be Happy, Dammit.\\" Read it. Share it. Love it."},{"Title":"How to Be Happy, Dammit : A Cynic's Guide to Spiritual Happiness","review":"****This book is a fun, quick read for strangers to self-help---for those who don't like or read self-help books, or even for people who don't like to read at all.Although over 200 pages, it took me just an hour to read because of the engaging format---cool design, lots of pictures, and few (but well-chosen) words---all arranged in a way to make an impact. When you're done reading you'll feel like you have some new tools to move away from cynicism and the doldrums and negativity---and toward being happy!Recommended, especially for people you know who are not \\"into\\" self-help and personal growth. As such, it fills a unique niche.****"},{"Title":"How to Be Happy, Dammit : A Cynic's Guide to Spiritual Happiness","review":"I LOVE THIS BOOK! the content, the illustrations, the layout, the whole attitude. It's just great! and having that bright book right next to my alarm clock is quite a bright way to start the day! It's just such a cute little book and it has nothing to do with being a cynic. Buy this for anyone you'd like to see smile!"},{"Title":"How to Be Happy, Dammit : A Cynic's Guide to Spiritual Happiness","review":"I really like this book. The tittle could not be more accurate. This is a funny book! There are a lot of inspirational quotes and tales, followed by funny but accurate advise on how to change your view of the world to a more positive one.I do not normally read self-help type books at all. This one caught my eye and I am glad it did. Worth every penny."},{"Title":"How to Be Happy, Dammit : A Cynic's Guide to Spiritual Happiness","review":"The funniest part of this book is the title. After that it's a bit 'try hard'. Some parts are funny, but basically it is too simple an approach of a serious topic, and hence, much of it isn't either particularly funny or helpfull. There are so many more books on subjects such as 'the law of attraction' that are better value, and humorous books that are funnier, that this book wasn't worth the trouble, in my opinion. If you want a good laugh I recommend you buy something else. If you want a self-help book I recommend you buy something else."},{"Title":"How to Be Happy, Dammit : A Cynic's Guide to Spiritual Happiness","review":"Great, easy read, with fun graphics. Perfect for the cynic who begrudgingly acknowledges the need for self-improvement."},{"Title":"How to Be Happy, Dammit : A Cynic's Guide to Spiritual Happiness","review":"A friend gave me this book for Christmas, recognizing my innate cynicism, especially relating to the self-improvement, New Age, traditional coaching world. And ...I liked it!Author Salmonsohn presents some basic truths that we've all heard before. (&quot;Relax.&quot; &quot;Let go.&quot;) But she presents these sayings in a context of sophisticated graphics and down-to-earth realism. I especially like her warning, which I paraphrase as, &quot;Don't seek career advice from people who don't have careers, or relationship advice from people who don't have relationships.&quot; It's not completely accurate: some people can &quot;teach&quot; better than they can &quot;do.&quot; But it's worth considering.And her warning that every year has a &quot;winter phase&quot; is right on.Like most readers, I'm absorbing Salmonsohn's words after reading dozens of self-help books, so none of these ideas are really new. I'm wondering if this book would really melt the heart of a cynic or someone who is truly resistant to change -- or if they'd respond like an atheist who is urged to try a contemporary hip &quot;new&quot; religious service.My hunch is that this book makes a great gift and recipients, like me, will appreciate the sender's thought and intention, regardless of the book's actual content. It's nice when someone says, &quot;I know you're a cynic but I like you anyway.&quot; Hmm...that's a sentiment right out of the book!"},{"Title":"How to Be Happy, Dammit : A Cynic's Guide to Spiritual Happiness","review":"I can't say enough about how much I love this book! I came across it in a bookstore when I was grieving the unexpected loss of a loved one in addition to a series of smaller tragedies. I was intrigued by the title, as I was extremely cynical and had no interest in wimpy &quot;the world is a wonderful place&quot; type self-help books. This book hit the spot! Karen Salmansohn speaks in a language that I completely relate to - very catchy, but with logical explanations for the information she provides. The bright pictures and catchy analogies made it very easy and pleasant to read. In some places the photos spoke almost as loudly as the words. I related so well to Ms. Salmansohn's style that I have since bought three of her other books and have not been disappointed. She is one of those gifted writers whose ability to express herself in so many new and fresh ways just blows me away! This book has literally been my lifeline for several months now, and I intend to buy copies for all my friends. I highly recommend this book for anyone who needs a pick-me-up, or a hopeful new perspective."},{"Title":"How to Be Happy, Dammit : A Cynic's Guide to Spiritual Happiness","review":"I found it at a local bookstore and skimmed through it. Flipping through the pages, though the nice graphics and typefaces caught my attention, the text itself didn't make much sense. I picked up the book anyways because I really am a cynic looking for spiritual happiness. When I finally got around to reading it, I discovered why flipping through the book didn't make much sense. This is not a coffee table book. It must be read from beginning to end, otherwise it won't make much sense. It's a quick read, it only took me an hour or so and I'm a slow reader. It's very catchy, witty, to the point, and perfect for cynics alike. I bought the book for a couple of friends and they really liked it as well. I'm not exactly happier, but it did give me a better perspective on life as a whole. If you're skeptical, pick it up anyways. It's inexpensive, a quick read, entertaining even if you don't like the entire book, and you really have nothing to lose. If it doesn't jive you well, give it to a friend."},{"Title":"How to Be Happy, Dammit : A Cynic's Guide to Spiritual Happiness","review":"The last few months have been very &quot;challenging&quot; for me...so a friend gave me this book. I was skeptical at first that any book get me to shift my emtoional state...but I gotta say this book definitely did! I laughed as I read it...which helped me to kinda feel better right away...BUT... mostly (and surprisingly) I found its insights and advice very VERY helpful to get me to a stronger emotional place to make the changes I need to make..and make them I did. I totally recommend this book to anyone out there who is in that &quot;challenging&quot; place in their life. I also loved Ms. Salmansohn's THE 8-MINUTE GUTS BUILDER...which also motivated me to make some needed changes in my life. Thank you Ms. Salmansohn! Thank you, thank you, thank you!"},{"Title":"How to Be Happy, Dammit : A Cynic's Guide to Spiritual Happiness","review":"Not being an optimist by nature or upbringing, my life is all about the struggle between negativity and positivity -- so I was pleased to discover Karen Salmansohn's 'Cynic's Guide to Spiritual Happiness.' It is a truly wonderful book. Right now, facing 2003, I rely on my 3 favorite books to keep me sane. The other 2 are 'Stop Smiling, Start Kvetching' and 'The Positive Power of Negative Thinking' -- all 3 help me to harness the positive energy of negativity. These 3 books make up my personal triple play for dealing constructively with anxiety, worry, irritation, and cynicism/pessimism. So my new year's resolution is to make the most of who I am and how I deal with the world around me. And Karen Salmansohn is a great author to have on your team -- she has new books coming out this year, and I'd keep an eye out for them too."},{"Title":"How to Be Happy, Dammit : A Cynic's Guide to Spiritual Happiness","review":"I think that this book helps to give hope and reminds us to stop feeling sorry for ourselves all the time. While the other reviewers did not like the book at all, I completely disagree with the reasoning. This is basically a 'coffee-table' book. It has glossy pictures with simple statements about life's truths and the reality of being alive. Things aren't always great, but if you give up on life then you might as well go live in a cave somwhere. It contains positive thoughts and reminders of the fact that we don't always have to feel like victims. Some of the statements are pretty obvious and occasionally cheesy- but why is that so bad? It made me smile for 15 minutes and reminded me that 'doo-doo happens' in life, but when it comes down to it none of our lives are REALLY that bad."},{"Title":"How to Be Happy, Dammit : A Cynic's Guide to Spiritual Happiness","review":"Like me, I bet you know someone who just seems to refuse to be happy, no matter what, year after year after year ...I have known my friend \\"Z\\" for 15 years. She always has something to complain about. No matter how well the day, week, month, or year is going, she will tell you stuff she is anxious about, that she just has to complain about, etc. etc.Really, some years are better than other. But she won't admit it. I get it now -- she refuses to be happy; complaining is her habit, her worldview, her addiction.So I gave her this book for her birthday to say to her, please learn \\"How To Be Happy - Dammit !!\\" This is a fun but also provocative book in that it communicates more than just humor. If this does not work, I'll give her the longer, more serious book 'Addicted to Unhappiness' to try. But I'm hoping Salmansohn's attractive gift book will communicate my message to my friend. Worth a try."},{"Title":"How to Be Happy, Dammit : A Cynic's Guide to Spiritual Happiness","review":"Too simple. Relationships, love, careers and life take work. It is give and take. It is easy to say, &quot;It's not working, get rid of it&quot;, instead of working at it. It is give and take all the way around. This book tells you to think of you and only you without a thought of others - that is selfish. Yes, we want to be happy, but you can't keep throwing people, work, things away because it is not working the way you want (what are you going to do if the next way doesn't work, get rid of it too?) You need a balance in life, work and love, it is finding that balance that you need to think about."},{"Title":"How to Be Happy, Dammit : A Cynic's Guide to Spiritual Happiness","review":"I love this book. And Im a guy who does NOT read self help books. It was thrust on me by a friend -- a good friend. I found the book engaging and insightful and inspiring.

Thank you to the author!"},{"Title":"How to Be Happy, Dammit : A Cynic's Guide to Spiritual Happiness","review":"My divorce has been one of the hardest times in my life...and a friend gave me this book when they sensed how lost and stressed I'd become.

YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT SDME PLANTS ARE ONLY MEANT TO LIVE A CERTAIN TIME A CERTAIN SEASON IF YOU TRY TO MAKE THEM LIVE LONGER YOU WILL BE A BAD GARDENER.

M-P claims that simply by paying attention to this lifeworld, we see that previous philosophical systems have overlooked ineliminable dimensions of what it is like to be a person, and that this oversight has led to radically incomplete philosophical accounts of things like memory, perception, etc..The book is so rich, original, and nuanced that it is hard to do it justice in a short review here. Not saddling himself with narrow academic techniques or fields, he draws on any resources he can to come to make sense of human experience. He cites not only philosophers such as Heidegger and Sarte, but draws equally heavily upon the Gestalt psychologists and neuroscientists of his day. He discusses phantom limbs, experiments on spatial perception, and psychophysical results from the Gestalt psychologists.Many ideas that are popular in modern analytic philosophy and psychology can be found in this book: the view that 'sense data' are simply theoretical constructs, the view that attention focuses on objects not abstract spatial locations, and the claim that our original concepts cannot be understood independently of the embodied interactions with the world where we first come to use them.I fear that Merleau-Ponty's nuanced philosophical psychology will fall through the cracks, being ignored by continental philosophers who focus on other things nowadays, and also by English speaking philosophers who dismiss Merleau-Ponty because he is a continental philosopher.If you consider yourself a philosopher of mind, epistemologist, or a continental philosopher, please read this book. Twice."},{"Title":"Phenomenology of Perception (Routledge Classics)","review":"Originally, I read this book as part of a Philosophy of the Body course, in companion with Sartre's magnum opus, Being and Nothingness. Trying to keep the two thinkers separate was quite easy, because of the difference in approach and ideas that they both take. Sartre relies on a dualism and intellectualism not easily understood, resulting in a complex and amorphous work, which is still utterly powerful.M-P, however, as one review said, remains in the concrete experience of everyday life. Perception, the way the mind interprets the senses, the importance of memory, time, and freedom in the world, are all utterly important in this work. M-P provides a work which attempts to synthesize psychology, physicality, and philosophy resulting in a more holistic and foundational work than many 20th century philosophers.This book can be read as philosophy or psychology, in fact, any course on perception in a Psychology department should read it. Anyone wishing to discuss the question of Pontius Pilate (&quot;What is truth?&quot;) should read this book. It touches on so many themes of intellectual life that it will become perhaps the most influential work of philosophy of the 20th century, vying with Sartre's Being and Nothingness and Heidegger's Being and Time."},{"Title":"Phenomenology of Perception (Routledge Classics)","review":"When all is said and done (and that will take a while) on the studies of philosophy in the 20th century, two names will stand out as being the most influential: Martin Heidegger and Maurice Merleau-Ponty. The Phenomenology of Perception was Merleau-Ponty's second work and lays the foundation for his later writings. What Merleau-Ponty attempts to do in this work is to take phenomenology away from the idealist and dualistic tracks of Husserl and Sartre and ground it firmly in ontology through a psychological analysis of perception. In doing so, Merleau-Ponty lays the foundations for Structuralism and its later incarnations, for better or worse, Poststructuralism and Deconstructuralism. (Derrida and Foucault attended his lectures.)Required reading for any student of 20th century thought and anyone who wants to know how philosophy came to its present position."},{"Title":"Phenomenology of Perception (Routledge Classics)","review":"This early work of Merleau-Ponty is one of the great works of phenomenology. It is a tremendously rich book, and contains a great deal of thought not reproduced elsewhere in his writings. He takes phenomenology in a different direction from that of Husserl, Heidegger and Sartre, though he remains in dialogue with all three throughout. Late 20th century philosophy owes much to Merleau-Ponty, and this is a key work in understanding his thought. In my own opinion, it is one of the great books of philosophy, and the translation by Colin Smith is excellent. I highly recommend it, as you may have guessed."},{"Title":"Phenomenology of Perception (Routledge Classics)","review":"The book shipped to Toronto Canada within a a week an a half.

Unlike many progressive thinkers hesitant to criticize the family planning movement for fear of landing themselves in bed with the &quot;radical religious right&quot;, Greer takes on Planned Parenthood founder, eugenicist Margaret Sanger; her cohort, Marie Stopes; UNFPA; USAID; and more. A caustically-written yet somber look at the harm incurred by both misguided and insidious meddling in foreign affairs."},{"Title":"Sex and Destiny: The Politics of Human Fertility","review":"Greer worries at the beginning of this book that she may be overdoing it, and people may be alienated rather than persuaded. That's certainly true for me.When people found this book to be an odd contrast to The Female Eunuch (which I also didn't like), Greer said that it is consistent, being taken from the bits of the earlier book that no-one liked. The parts where Greer, moved by loving close-knit Italian family life decides that it would be a great idea to buy an Italian farm and have her children raised by her tenants. Except for visits, she would continue her sophisticated life in decadent England. (She has denied this, but read the book.) The parts where she said she changed her style of dressing in order not to make a spectacle of herself in rural Italy, after urging the rest of us women in the Western-industrial cultures (WICs) to join her in making a spectacle of ourselves at home.The greatest flaw in Greer's consideration of birth control is that she seemingly cannot see the difference between having two children, or twelve, or twenty-two. She argues as if one is for or against children, and cannot want a limited number of them. She is wildly indignant about the death of one woman from an IUD and oblivious to the much more common deaths of women from complications of pregnancy and childbirth. She incidentally defends selective female infanticide and argues that women may be responsible for rape, since men may need for us to appear to be afraid of them.I can appreciate the need to accept other people's right to their own values, but why is Greer such a hypocrite about it? She is extremely intolerant towards anyone in WICs, even, or especially, if they seem to share the attitudes that she lauds here. She talks loving of the traditional cultures' warmth towards their children, although she mocks parental and marital devotion in WICs. Greer's thinking seems to be permanently warped by her bad relationship with her parents, especially her mother, but she refuses to consider that others in WICs may have found family life more satisfying. Throughout her writings, I cannot get over the feeling that one of her chief purposes is to offload responsibility for the Greers' problems outward to \\"society\\"; she seems to believe that in any other type of culture, she would have had a happy childhood. Perhaps that is why the woman given to sharp and incisive comments about her own society is so gormlessly naive about others, accepting everything at simple face value, assuming that everything functions according to those societies' highest ideals. All spouses are loving, all parents are devoted.Beyond the stupidity and hypocrisy of her opinions, it's simply not a good book. As usual it is inflated with extraneous material, arrogant and illogically argued. Obviously, it is possible to do a lot of research on a subject without gaining much insight."},{"Title":"In the Spring the War Ended: A Novel","review":"In the spring of 1945, with the war winding down in Europe, Nick Leonidas is one of the thousands of GIs who have become deserters, hiding out in Brussels and Paris.

A fascinating premise and a quick read. And if not a flashy writer, Linakis is a sold one.

This is the smallest Greek text book I have ever seen (it literally fits in one's back pocket) but the font for a lot of it is really not too small, so it is a useful text to carry around. It contains all of 1 John, the Lord's Prayer and 1 Cor 13, so on top of everything else it can be used for a tYPE of portable NT Greek prayer book. It has the complete grammar and seems to actually use the same paradigm charts that Machen would later use. The exercises are all from the NT but are short and the glosses are kept to a minimum.

Premature, abused at birth, and facing countless physical and mental challenges, this precious child fought even as an infant to survive. God lovingly placed foster parents with huge hearts and mountain of commitment to care for him in his first few years.The author was a single mom and had already adopted a child but was willing to open her heart and home to an infant with serious physical and medical needs. There is only one explanation and that is the one she shared: God had called her to do so.This book is not only the heart wrenching story of Darrell's difficult life. It is most of all testimony for our Heavenly Father's love and care that surmounts all obstacles and paves the way for one who was totally helpless.I hurt for Ms. Weishampel as she faced the maze of doctors, therapists, social workers, and agencies to get Darrell the very best of care. I was awed by her perseverance in the face of caring for mentally and physically handicapped child, with little sleep and in the addition to her other children. Her focus was on Darrell and the children, putting their needs before hers.Her story is an amazing testimony of pure sacrifice. Her hope was focused on the Lord and her strength came from Him only, and she gives Him the glory for everything she did.I was inspired by her faith, determination and incredible gift of putting others before herself no matter what the cost.

This book is a complete waste of money and time. Any 10th grader can throw words on paper and create a \\"postmodern\\" book without having to exert the brain-cells to put together a real plot & characters. It makes me angry when someone does this and has critics fawning all over him & calling it a bestseller. It is a slap in the face to the legions of real writers who have crafted real novels, and have been unable to get published because their subject matter is \\"commercially risky\\" (for example, an obscure empire called Khazaria). Oh, by the way, this book is also an insult to the REAL Khazars, who were not magicians or circus freaks the way this book paints them. I belong to the yahoo group 'khazar fiction.com' and we have had people ask us about the Khazar \\"dream-hunters\\" and other ridiculous concepts engendered by Pavic's book. It is enough of a tragedy that Stalin tried his best to erase all evidence of the Khazars from this earth; now Pavic has further obfuscated Khazar studies with this travesty. If you want to read about Khazaria, read The Rabbi King."},{"Title":"THE DICTIONARY OF THE KHAZARS.","review":"I saw this book in a store and saw that there were two editions. This intrigued me -- why &quot;Male&quot; &amp; &quot;Female&quot;. It was only several years later on the Internet that I was finally able to find the differing sections -- and different they are, although not necessary for the enjoyment of the book. Choose either edition; you will find the same pleasure.The Khazars were a real people, holding wide areas of modern-day Russian. They did convert, eventually to Judaism, although you would never learn this from Pavic in particular. No, Pavic is not worried about the reality of the Khazars, but in the melding of cultures of the Balkans, the state of Man and God and their relationships to each other, and odd connections that a literate reader makes between multiple books.This is not a book with a plot. This is not a book with a single or simple way to read it. I believe that I have read the whole book twice, but they only way I could say that for certain would to be like Hansel and Gretzel and leave marks on the pages that I have actually finished. Like swimming through a dictionary or encyclopedia, this book invites you to read sections in no particular order, or, more realistically, in the order YOU see fit to choose.The three sections (Christina, Muslem, Jewish) are seperated, yet intermingled due to cross references (many of them contradictory). They are colour-coded, yet this only provides one level of deliniation. Each section is set up like an encyclopedia in its own right. The unifying figure of Princess Ateh is sure to intrigue any sagacious reader; the whimsical nature of the book may seem superficial at first, but you will be drawn deeper into the mystery of &quot;What is this all about?&quot;Prepare to lose yourself in a magical world of words and inter-relations. I have noted that previous reviewers have compared the writing to Marquez and Calvino -- this is not far off the mark, especially if one could only spin the two together."},{"Title":"THE DICTIONARY OF THE KHAZARS.","review":"This book has taken me years to read, not because it reads badly, or because it lacks hooks, au contraire, the problem is that there is so much to take in, such richness, that I spend my time re-reading and cross-reading all the time.The book is basically a dictionary of the imaginary Khazar people (this one happens to be the male version, the female version differs in only one word, but THAT makes all the difference), you read it as you would any other dictionary, you pick and entry and you read, that entry is also filled with cross references to other entries, where pertinent. It is at that point that the fun begins. By navigating in seemingly random fashion, a world begins to emerge, one as mystical and strange as it is real and solid.Pavic has an unusual command of the absurdity of meaning; his juxtaposition of the normal with the bizarre as if there was nothing to it makes reading him exciting, new. The book will probably appeal to the historian inside us, as well as to the meddler, the gossiper and the prude in us. That juxtaposition creates a desire to know 'what next then?'We meet princesses with deadly eyelids, slow mirrors and fast mirrors, poisonous books and killer winks...Read it, but you will never be done with it!"},{"Title":"THE DICTIONARY OF THE KHAZARS.","review":"This book was written by a serbian professor of literature, but might have been written by a former argentinian librarian: Jorge Luis Borges. Both the authors share a love for combinatorics, puzzling coincindences, catalogues, and bizzarre stories. Their stile is rational and dramatic at the same time, like the facade of a baroque church. Also, this book was published in 1986, the year of Borges' death, and is maybe the epitaph that Borges would have liked.This is a book about the truth. The king of a mysterious people (the Khazars) summons three sages (a christian, a muslim and a jew), because he wants to convert to the true god. Centuries later, three literati write their own accounts of that conversion (each one is different). And this century, three researcher investigate again on what happened.Finally, there is not a single truth. The book is organized as a dictionary, or better, three dictionaries (one for each religion). Every word inspires a different story and explanation, but all are filled with magic events and mysterious characters. The reader is the ultimate investigator -- and creator -- of the Khazar empire. It's up to him to discover the truth.A final (and personal) note. This &quot;dictionary&quot; may seem an extremely sophisticated literary game, similar to those of Calvino and Perec. This is is true, but there is more. When the book was out, the civil war (apparently motivated by secular religious intolerance) had not begun yet. To me, this book seems also a passionate attempt to show how difficult is to attain the truth, and an invitation to tolerance."},{"Title":"THE DICTIONARY OF THE KHAZARS.","review":"This book is a rare gem. Milorad Pavic is known for his unqiue formats and incredible imagery, and \\"DotK\\" is certainly no exception. The 3 sub-books (each an individual dictionary) provide alternate perspectives about entries that serve to flesh out the story, which centers around what is referred to as the \\"Khazar Polemic\\"; a debate set forth by the Khazar Khaghan to determine which of the three major religions to adopt: Christianity, Judaism, or Islam.This little tome is filled with beautiful, bizarre word pictures that shouldn't be passed up. As someone has already remarked, he very much is the Salvadore Dale of literature. Buy this book and read it at least twice; once to get the story and again to appreciate the phenomenal minutia. All of his characters are so fantastical and colorful that it will take more than a cursory glance to absorb the feast Pavic has set before us. Belly up and dive in, it's great.This is also a perfect spring board to launch into future Pavic novels."},{"Title":"THE DICTIONARY OF THE KHAZARS.","review":"Milorad Pavic's Dictionary of the Khazars is a very odd book. It's written more like an encyclopaedia than a dictionary, and more like a book of mythology/folklore than an encyclopaedia.Perhaps the book can be best described as the ultimate bathroom reading for post-modernists. The book is divided into three parts: Christian, Jewish, and Muslim. The entries are generally short, and can be read in any order. As you read, you'll find crossovers, similarities, and outright contradictions to perplex and tease your mind. The time periods covered jump from the distant past to the present, with murders, accidental deaths, personification of devils, and dream-hunting.Some parts I found rather dry, but on the whole, the book is filled with moments where I would put the book down to contemplate a sentence. The Dictionary of the Khazars is full of nice, chewy ideas and insights, and reads a bit like a more user-friendly Umberto Eco."},{"Title":"THE DICTIONARY OF THE KHAZARS.","review":"Are you ready for this ? Do you want a novel with a plot, tangible characters, and the usual narrative style ? OK, forget this book. You are flying over an unknown land, maybe New Guinea, below all is steep mountain and impenetrable jungle. It's a land sparsely inhabited by utterly different people. You fly through some clouds, get lost. Now how will you navigate ? It's all so beautiful, but where are you going? You look down and in the immortal words of Bob Dylan, \\"you know something's happenin', but you don't know what it is..\\" Yes, you are definitely reading DICTIONARY OF THE KHAZARS, a beautiful, strange book, redolant with poetry, myth, fantasy, legend, a murder case, dreams, scraps of history, and a political allegory about former Yugoslavia. Pavic has a 17th century fresco painter who is also the Devil say, \\"Why shouldn't someone create a dictionary of words that make up one book and let the reader himself assemble the words into a whole ?\\" Pavic has come close to that. The words dazzle. In what other book can you find an egg that holds one day of life, a Thursday or Friday ? Where else do you read about a man with ears so pointed that he could slice a piece of bread with them, about parrot poems, eleven-fingered lute players, or inheritance according to the color of one's beard ? When I read that \\"it was so quiet in the inn that the hair of the dreamer could be heard splitting somewhere in the dark\\" I knew that I could not give this novel less than four stars.The Khazars were a Turkic people living on the Ukrainian steppes and between the Black and Caspian Seas. They disappeared close to a thousand years ago, but not before their khan converted to Judaism, leading Arthur Koestler to write \\"The Thirteenth Tribe\\", in which he claimed Russian and East European Jews were all descendants of the Khazars. The conversion was effected by means of a debate between three scholars invited by the khan, a Christian, a Muslim, and a Jew. With this nugget of history, Pavic creates a fantasy, divided into three books, Christian, Muslim, and Jewish, in which characters, institutions, books, and events are treated as in some fabulous encyclopedia. Slowly, with some concentration, being constantly diverted by dreams, weird tales, and witty asides, you see the connections appearing. The number three (as in the 3 religions) is repeated three times---three characters who were the original debaters, three characters who converged around a battle and manuscript in 1689, and again in Istanbul in 1982. You don't have to read this all in order---you can start anywhere---but my advice definitely is to finish.Surrealistic in the extreme, DICTIONARY OF THE KHAZARS is like a Dali painting or maybe a Fellini movie. If you like those, you will find the novel attractive. It would help to know something about Yugoslavia between 1945 and 1991. Though this political factor is there, mainly alluding, in ironic observations, to the situation of the Serbs, it is far from omnipresent. This is a first novel about life by a highly original poet. It may be confusing sometimes, but it is never dull. A moth may see a white wall as the whole sky. Or maybe not. But you can certainly find the whole human condition in this novel. Try it, you may be glad you did."},{"Title":"THE DICTIONARY OF THE KHAZARS.","review":"Honestly, I am not certain what to write about Pavic's \\"Dictionary of the Khazars.\\" This is not because I did not enjoy it-- I enjoyed it hugely-- but because I am not certain there is anything else it can be compared to. Unlike his other works, which are certainly amiable enough fiction, this book is inspired, and totally unique.Taking the form of a dictionary, it is completely nonlinear and untraditional, essentially a hypertext novel printed on paper. To make things a bit more interesting, the dictionary is actually three separate dictionaries, each 'composed' by a different character, and 'redacted' by a fourth. One reading cannot suffice to comprehend and appreciate the book, one really must read it at least twice: once to try and figure out who the players are and what the hell is happening; and again to go back and forth, following the tangled threads of characters and ideas to appreciate the quality of the story's craft.The book, unsurprisingly, deals with various people's obsession with the story of the Khazars. I found this delightful, as I have always been fascinated with the story myself, and especially considering it seems few have even heard the tale today. There really were Khazars: they were a Russo-Slavic people, living (as Pavic duly assures us) near to the Black Sea, just north of the Byzantine Empire. At an indeterminate time, but likely around 700 CE, their king decided to change his religion, and requested a disputation (a religious debate) be held for him by representatives of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, so he could pick the proper path. He chose Judaism, and the entire nation converted, becoming, for the rest of their existence, the only sovreign Jewish nation in the world from the Roman expulsion of Jews from Judea in 200 to the founding of the State of Israel in 1948. The Khazars were conquered and dispersed sometime around the 10th century or so, and perhaps might have passed out of history (save for the most curious of esoteric legend collectors) had the Khazari disputation not been used as the literary framing of Rabbi Judah HaLevi's medieval philosophy of Judaism, entitled \\"Kuzari\\" (the Hebraicization of 'Khazars').Pavic starts at this juicy tidbit of historia obscura-- already more than a bit surreal to begin with-- takes it, and runs. The Khazars in his book are an enchanting fusion of excellently-researched fact (or however close to fact the actual legends of the Khazars may be) and Pavic's own strange creations, such as their being 'dream hunters' and treasuring numerous different varieties of salt.The three sections of the dictionary are purportedly compiled in late medieval or early Renaissance times by a Christian, a Jew, and a Muslim, respectively, with the redaction being modern and secular. The helpful device of the book is that dictionary entries which are found in multiple sections (yes, some are only found in one section or another-- read carefully) are marked by a cross, and/or a Star of David, and/or a crescent.What amazes me most about Pavic's work here is how meticulously detailed and well-researched it is. The factual details he uses are scrupulously correct, and the invented details stunningly crafted, to the point where unless one happens to be quite well-acquainted with the Khazars and the history of the spread of religion in the relevant times and places, one will be hard put to know what springs from history and what from the mind of Pavic. The characters also are wonderfully bizarre, with that strikingly surreal colorfulness so frequently encountered in historical figures from the Russo-Slavic areas.Obviously, if you are looking for a serious work about the historical Khazars and their Jewish kingdom of Khazaria, this is not that book. But if you're looking for a truly engrossing read, unlike anything else you've ever read, with which to delightfully while away hours on a trip or a dull evening or even a nice morning, this is a must. A tremendous amount of fun, a joy to own (you will come back to it, and it will not disappoint), and-- I guarantee-- not something you will see anywhere else."},{"Title":"THE DICTIONARY OF THE KHAZARS.","review":"This is a bizarre and beautiful book, and perhaps due to my limited attention span I found its value more in the poetry of its language than its attempts at being a novel. Some of the passages, such as the one describing Man's relationship to God as similar to that of the man and the moth, are breathtakingly wonderful. As a writer myself, I have been endlessly inspired by his new ideas in both language and structure. If you're looking for straightforward magical realism I would suggest reading Gabriel Garcia Marquez or Milan Kundera first, but if you wish to delve deeper into the odd tunnels of human thought (I often wonder how Pavic thought of some of his stories-within-stories)then this &quot;lexical novel&quot; is highly recommended."},{"Title":"THE DICTIONARY OF THE KHAZARS.","review":"This book simultaneously tells several totally distinct estories, but which are all the same. It is incredibly charming, I read it twice, some years ago, and the excerpts that I wrote may be slightly different on the book due to this!The first way to read this book is as a tale of three excludent versions of the conversion of a people to the true Religion: Judaism, Christianity and Islamism. Three wise men were convoked by the Khazars King to explain a dream. Afterwards each claims to have won the debate, although even ignoring the names of their opponents. It seems to me a very proper symbol of the European or even the World History: each one describing events totally blind to other peoples versions.The Khazars, before converting, had a Religion based on Dreams. Afterwards they were destroyed by the Kievan Russians, &quot;so suddenly that the shadows of their palaces had no time to disappear together with the buildings, and still remain there&quot;. &quot;Only some parrots of the Black Sea still remember their language.&quot;It is also a fantastically poetic book, with many moving passages. It relates the fight of Man to recreate a New Man, against the concerted alliance of the devils of the three religions. It tells an incredible maze of personal estories: the powerful princess Ateh, an european noble fighting on the turkish side, a devil who painted religious icons, and so forth.In conclusion, it tells the estory of Man alone trying to create its own Future, but fighting against poerful devils and the omnipresent God, whoever He is. In this way it remembers me a fantastic brazilian romance &quot;The Devil pay on the Backlands (Grande Sertao: Veredas)&quot; of Joao Guimaraes Rosa: Is there a Devil or is everything of our own responsability? That may be a good question to ask ourselves."},{"Title":"THE DICTIONARY OF THE KHAZARS.","review":"Although this novel comes in two versions -- male and female -- this is just a Pavician joke and it's not necessary to hunt the single altered paragraph which is the &quot;key&quot; to the story. At the end of the book, Pavic playfully suggests that male and female readers should meet up to exchange the missing paragraph -- he is perhaps the first meta-fictional matchmaker in literary history! Anyway, this is an absolutely brilliant novel, and Pavic deserves to win the Nobel Prize for Literature. It's a genuine literary event when he publishes a new novel, and he is the only author to bestride the 20th century like a genuine colossus -- one foot in the 19th century, standing with Tolstoy, Gogol, Multatuli, Alas, Balzac, and the other foot in the 21st century, among writers still unborn."},{"Title":"THE DICTIONARY OF THE KHAZARS.","review":"This is truly one of the best books ever about eastern European history. It has a unique style. It's postmodern book and it can be best described as hyperlinked dictionary or encyclopedia. You should read it as a dictionary (you will find reading guide at the beginning) Most of the book is not actually about Khasars but about history and interconnected stories of different nations from Eastern Europe. It is anti nationalism and against all evils that come from religious wars. It's unique style will be problem for some people and it also require some history background.

This intrigued me -- why &quot;Male&quot; &amp; &quot;Female&quot;. It was only several years later on the Internet that I was finally able to find the differing sections -- and different they are, although not necessary for the enjoyment of the book. Choose either edition; you will find the same pleasure.The Khazars were a real people, holding wide areas of modern-day Russian. They did convert, eventually to Judaism, although you would never learn this from Pavic in particular. No, Pavic is not worried about the reality of the Khazars, but in the melding of cultures of the Balkans, the state of Man and God and their relationships to each other, and odd connections that a literate reader makes between multiple books.This is not a book with a plot. This is not a book with a single or simple way to read it. I believe that I have read the whole book twice, but they only way I could say that for certain would to be like Hansel and Gretzel and leave marks on the pages that I have actually finished. Like swimming through a dictionary or encyclopedia, this book invites you to read sections in no particular order, or, more realistically, in the order YOU see fit to choose.The three sections (Christian, Muslem, Jewish) are seperated, yet intermingled due to cross references (many of them contradictory). They are colour-coded, yet this only provides one level of deliniation. Each section is set up like an encyclopedia in its own right. The unifying figure of Princess Ateh is sure to intrigue any sagacious reader; the whimsical nature of the book may seem superficial at first, but you will be drawn deeper into the mystery of &quot;What is this all about?&quot;Prepare to lose yourself in a magical world of words and inter-relations.

It was written with an impecable style, but let me warn you right away: don't expect an ordinary fictional work. The Dictionary is a multilayered masterpiece, it talks about the same event and culture from three points of view. All different. All contradictory. All true. All false.In the beginning, you'll wonder if he's normal; half way through it, you'll wonder if you're normal for believing him and in the end, you'll want to read it again, again and again.

For the most part, Pavic lived up to the reviews -- this is a clever meta-critical look at philosophy, religion and novel writing by an astute author. You may not understand every word, but I think any good reader will pick up the majority of this book -- a challenging yet worthwhile book. I have to admit that I only read the female version and I'm a little skeptical about what difference the male version may hold, but I'd still recommend the book to all readers who enjoy texts from other cultures."},{"Title":"THE DICTIONARY OF THE KHAZARS.","review":"Admittedly, it takes more than one reading to nail this book down, and I have read it only once. It is a very playful book, turning literature on its head. Prepare to read it with a similar irreverential attitude, i.e., don't expect to reap too much, or take it or your time too seriously, just be there for sheer nonsense.Structurally I haven't figured out whether the Khazar polemic and the three religious sects were just another ploy the author used to pique interest (like the male and female edition) or is there really anything more to it. At this point, I haven't found much that differentiate one book from the another. That is, I can put a Christian entry into the Islam book and no one will find any discordance. It is another way of saying: there appear to be no lines demarcating the religions, and the Khazar polemic seems another hoax the author wrote to tease the reader.If forced to glean some \\"meaning\\", I would say the book, by establishing no difference between religions, and in fact making contradicting statements about the Khazar Polemic based on undifferentiated religions, seems to suggest that the only good the religious quarrels do to us is to make us insane, manifested in a book with a total breakdown of logic and reality."},{"Title":"THE DICTIONARY OF THE KHAZARS.","review":"One of the truly great books.

It was used ( not misused, because the author's intent has resonated at exactly the same frequency ) by Belgrade agitprop machine ( &quot;Poor Serbs, in fact *we* are Khazars, an enadangered species ( adding the corollary: threatened by genocide-bent murderous neighbors, from Slovenes to Albanians ) ).On aesthetic level: Umberto Eco's methodology copy-pasted, combined with outright plagiarism of Andreas Okopenko's &quot;Lexikon-einer sentimentalen Reise zum Exporteuertreffen in Duden&quot;. Yet- this is just an example of brainless hip flooding the remnants of what used to be called imaginative literature. The last great works of fiction being the novels of Broch and Lowry ( and good, but still lagging behind, fictions of Marquez, Burgess and McCarthy )- Pavic's book rightly deserves to be admired &amp; praised. In this hollow age swarming with plagiarist snobs- &quot;Dictionary of the Khazars&quot; is a canonical book, well suited for an average afficionado of (post)modern/mortem wasteland.

But the most unexpectable for me was that the author puts the Key of the book in Appendix(I and II),on the place where is less expected,like something that could and didn\`t have to interest You.

Originally written in Serbian, the novel has been translated into many languages, including English.The novel is in the form of three small encyclopedic dictionaries, each compiled from either Christian, Jewish or Moslem sources. The three sections (Christian, Moslem and Jewish) are separated, yet intermingled due to cross references (many of them contradictory). They are color-coded, yet this only provides one aspect of categorization. Each section is set up like an encyclopedia in its own right, with the unifying figure of Princess Ateh \\"presiding\\" throughout the book.Owing to its lexicon format, the novel may be read in any number of ways, rather than simply front to back. Pavic intentionally challenges his readers to shun passivity in reading and become active participants in the novel as they themselves compose the story from often conflicting fragments.As the author writes (in his introduction to the English translation):\\"No chronology will be observed here, nor is one necessary. Hence each reader will put together the book for himself, as in a game of dominoes or cards, and, as with a mirror, he will get out of this dictionary as much as he puts into it, for you...cannot get more out of the truth than what you put into it.\\"Dictionary of the Khazars (\\"DOTK\\") offers a prime example of what is known as ergodic literature (the term is derived from the Greek 'ergon,' meaning \\"work\\", and 'hodos,' \\"path\\") a literature that requires a \\"non-trivial effort\\" to traverse the text. This effort must consist of more than simply reading by moving one's eyes along lines of text, turning pages and mentally interpreting what one reads.The book comes in two different editions, one \\"Male\\" and one \\"Female\\", which differ only in seventeen lines of one critical paragraph.As might be expected, there is no obvious plot in the usual sense, but the book's central theme (the \\"Khazar Polemic,\\" i.e., the mass religious conversion of the Khazar people) is based on an actual historical event generally dated to the turn of the 8th and 9th centuries. Although DOTK asserts that both the indigenous faith of the Khazars and which of the three Abrahamic faiths they converted to remain unknown, it is certain that the Khazar royalty and nobility converted to Judaism along with a portion of the general population. Pavic, however, is not concerned about the historicity of his depiction of the Khazars, but in the events and processes that led to a melding of cultures of the Balkans, the states of Man and God and their relationships to each other, and in formulating the prospect of peculiar, surreal connections that an informed reader can potentially make between multiple books.Pavic often veers into his own style of playful fantasy: most (but not all) of the characters and events described in the novel are entirely fictional, as is much of the culture ascribed to the Khazars in the book, which bears little resemblance to any literary or archeological evidence. One critic has called DOTK \\"a sort of metafictional false document,\\" as the people and events in the novel are presented as factual. Some observers have suggested the novel symbolically addresses the dissolution of Yugoslavia, which at the time DOTK was written had yet to happen, but is nonetheless a distinct possibility.This book, lacking a plot, is without any single or simple way to read it. I have re-read it several times, and on each reading the experience is a different one. Like skimming through a dictionary or encyclopedia, this book beckons you to read its parts in no particular order or in any order you choose.\\"DOTK\\" is sure to intrigue any sagacious reader; and while the whimsical nature of the book may seem superficial at first, the reader is inexorably drawn deeper into the mystery of \\"What is this all about?\\"Reading \\"DOTK\\" opens the door to a magickal world, one well worth visiting and re-visiting. I strongly recommend the book to readers whose tastes are consonant with its themes."},{"Title":"THE DICTIONARY OF THE KHAZARS.","review":"Imagine yourself in a labyrinth where every exit is an entrance. A place that you can never realy leave because just as you think you can you find another wonder to explore which you may have explored already.

And that, according to Milorad Pavic himself, is how long he has been writing for. I can well believe it, for his style is so astonishing that it must have been focused through convex centuries. I won't say much more, other than that Pavic is the best fiction writer in the world, and this book is the best introduction to his work."},{"Title":"THE DICTIONARY OF THE KHAZARS.","review":"Milorad Pavic is a dreamer... plain and simple... If you have noticed there are few dreamers left in this world. The realism of life has obscured the world of creativity and imagination. This books based upon Kabalistic and Babylonian influences which were at the time of Khazars probably quite a marvel. History obscures this because of the mysterious nature of the religions. Not all are able to withstand the Kabalistic concepts of life. Thus they are frightened away by the dark imagery and when they confront their own shadows they flee. In these dreams they are thrown into a fit of their own inexplicable darkness, later to emerge as a star of light.Pavic has been there and back and is a true dream catcher. As a Christian I have lived a life, spouting scriptures and a rigidity of reality that has usurped all other thought. But I wonder where are the Daniels, Isaiahs, Ezekiels and the revelations of John are? They are there lying in the subconscious awaiting the (kabalistic) \\"key\\" to unlock the door to them. This book is a catalyst to all who seek freedom from the static and is an introduction to the figurative emphatic... It opened my eyes...

When it's written by a beautiful, strange, lyrical postmodern Slavic poet. The Dictionary of the Khazars is ostensibly the combined record of the Khazar people of the 8th century: a Christian dictionary, a Muslim dictionary, and a Jewish dictionary. Each has alphabetical entries detailing the legendary \\"Khazar polemic\\" where the chieftain of the Khazars converted to one of the three religions - and each dictionary records the chieftain convering to its own faith. The dictionary also records the mysterious dream hunters of the Khazars, and the three authors of the dictionaries' bizarre and mysterious intersecting lives. And, of course, Satan.There is a plot - but the plot is not the point. Pavi''s writing, as a poet, is evocative and sensuous, baffling and suggestive all at the same time. And part of the fun is cross-referencing the different entries in the three lexicons and seeing how they are the same and how they differ, how the different strands of lives and histories and metaphors blend into each other. In other words, you choose how to read the book and how to construct the plot.

The tone is a bit lighter, the setup simply more playful -- which isn't to say that the book is comic or without darker moments. And it isn't to say that Snake Agent isn't enjoyable -- indeed, it is a fine, clever, absorbing novel.It is subtitled \\"A Zhu Irzh & Inspector Chen Novel\\", suggesting the possibility of a series. And I have seen a couple of short stories set in the same milieu, including one (\\"Adventures in the Ghost Trade\\", Interzone, April 2000) from which the current novel is expanded. The setting is a curious combination of near future SF with Chinese-based fantasy. It might be called an \\"Alternate History Fantasy set in the Future\\", by which I mean that it takes for granted a world much resembling ours in which certain fantastical aspects are true, extrapolated into the near future. The location is a new city called Singapore Three, somewhere in South China. Inspector Chen is a policeman assigned to cases involving Hell -- cases where demons have intruded into our world, or the dead have ended up in the wrong place, or humans are engaged in illegal transactions with the underworld. He is uniquely suited to this duty: he has been granted the protection of a goddess, Kuan Yin, for his occasional trips to Hell, and he also has a domestic secret: his wife is a demon.The story opens with an investigation into a recently deceased young woman, the daughter of a rich man, who seems to have gone to Hell by mistake. Or so her mother says. But before long Chen's investigation bumps into some political roadblocks. It seems highly place interests, in both worlds, are involved in something unsavory. And indeed, down in Hell, Seneschal Zhu Irzh is investigating a case of the souls of virtuous young human girls being taken to Hell for use as prostitutes. Before long, he and Chen meet and realize that their cases are connected. But Irzh, too, finds that political interests in Hell are impeding his investigation. And, finally, Inspector Chen's wife, Inari, is being chased, presumably by the vindictive family of the demon she had refused to marry before escaping to Earth.This central mystery develops quite satisfyingly, leading to a resolution that is effective enough, if perhaps just slightly too rapid and too pat. Both Inspector Chen and his infernal counterpart, Irzh, are engaging characters, reflecting their different origins nicely. Irzh in particular is an amusing creation, for the most part a conventional demon but with urges toward compassion and other virtues that he tries to suppress. Williams's description of Hell is also fun and nicely cynical -- especially its rival Ministries: Wealth, War, Epidemics, etc.This isn't a major work, but it is an enjoyable novel with interesting protagonists. I would be delighted to see further stories about the same pair of detectives: I think the setup quite fruitful, and the lead pair interesting enough to follow for some time."},{"Title":"Snake Agent: A Detective Inspector Chen Novel (Detective Inspector Chen Novels)","review":"In \\"Snake Agent,\\" the ever-clever Liz Williams concocts a tongue in cheek brew combining the police procedural, the horror tale, fantasy, and science fiction. Set in an alternate Earth that seems to be a few years beyond our present, it features Singapore 3's (don't ask what happened to Singapore 1 and 2) Detective Inspector Chen, the police inspector involved with the supernatural--the snake agent of the title. (This is the first of a series, but it's complete in itself.)His current case leads him to hell, where he teams up with Hell's Seneschal Zhu Irzh in order to thwart a vast conspiracy involving one of Hell's many bureaus. Ms. Williams has serious issues with bureaus and the 'crats who run them (she's shown this before in an earlier novel, \\"Empire of Bones\\"), a fact that figures prominently in this novel's clever plot.Wittily written (the characters often speak in phrases that evoke Jack Vance's--hardly a bad thing), cleverly plotted, the book's a total delight."},{"Title":"Snake Agent: A Detective Inspector Chen Novel (Detective Inspector Chen Novels)","review":"Take a healthy dose of mythology and eastern religion, mix in the humor of Big Trouble in Little China and the buddy-cop banter of Lethal Weapon and adorn with a fantastic Jon Foster cover and what do you get? Well, you get the beginnings of an entertaining new mystery series by author Liz Williams.The Snake Agent is a difficult book to categorize. A blurb from the publisher's website reads:John Constantine meets Chow Yun-Fat in this near-future occult thriller. Detective Inspector Chen is the Singapore Three police department's snake agent, in charge of supernatural and mystical investigations.Chen has several problems: In addition to colleagues who don't trust him and his mystical ways, a patron goddess whom he has offended, and a demonic wife who's tired of staying home alone, he's been paired with one of Hell's own vice officers, Seneschal Zhu Irzh, to investigate the illegal trade in souls.Political pressures both earthly and otherworldly seem to block their investigation at every turn. As a plot involving Singapore Three's industrial elite and Hell's own Ministry of Epidemics is revealed, it becomes apparent that the stakes are higher than anyone had previously suspected.\\"Constantine meets Chow Yun-Fat\\" is a tremendously accurate description of Liz Williams' protagonist, Detective Inspector Wei Chen. I recently re-watched The Replacement Killers and I could not help picturing Chow Yun-Fat as Wei Chen's adventures unfolded before me. If ever filmed he would be the perfect choice.I said that William's novel is hard to classify and it is. The story abounds with magic as does a typical fantasy novel. It is a mystery, set in a near future science fiction universe replete with technology that would be at home in a story by Phillip K. Dick. It is also a primer for eastern mysticism and a view of earth, heaven, and hell steeped in ancient mythology. In addition there are elements of horror reminiscient of the aforementioned John Constantine and a wry humor similar to that in the very best cult classic comedies.Having so many varied influences in the wrong hands could result in a mess of a story. Fortunately Liz Williams crafts her tale with deft hands making The Snake Agent a fun introduction to this series of detective novels. It is easy to see why she has been twice nominated for Phillip K. Dick awards. The Snake Agent unfolds at just the right pace to keep one engaged in the story without ever overwhelming the reader. There is a lot going on with the genre-mixing plot but the reader never feels lost.At its core The Snake Agent is just pure fun. The best thing about the novel is the characters and their relationships. Wei Chen is a mortal man married to Inari, an denizen of the Underworld whom he rescued from an unwanted marriage. Inari has a protective animal companion that masquerades as a tea pot in earthly realms. On earth Chen has a law enforcement partner who is a perfect combination of Reginald VelJohnson's character in Die Hard and Danny Glover's in Lethal Weapon. Of course the nether realms have their own enforcement agencies and so Chen's counterpart, Seneschal Zhu Irzh, figures prominently in the tale as well. There is nothing better than a science fiction/fantasy tale flavored with chivalrous romance and solid friendships.If you are a fan of any of the above mentioned films I would venture to say that you will enjoy Liz William's debut novel in the Detective Inspector Chen series. As of this writing the second novel in the series, The Demon and the City, is nearing release and I really look forward to rejoining Wei Chen in his investigative adventures. Funny, adventurous, scary and magical, The Snake Agent is a great opportunity to try something a little different in your reading. I tip my hat to you Ms. Williams. Well done."},{"Title":"Snake Agent: A Detective Inspector Chen Novel (Detective Inspector Chen Novels)","review":"This is the first Liz Williams book I read, after buying it direct from Night Shade books (the publisher).

When he gets involved in a case of a little girl's soul not ending up in Heaven where it was supposed to, but ending up in Hell instead, things began to get complicated. \\"Ghost smuggling\\", real-world politics, a wife who isn't what she seems, a demonic partner, and bureaucratic strife among Hell's Ministry of Disease and Ministry of Taxation all combine to generate a fascinating story.I can't recommend this book enough, and the upcoming sequel looks very interesting as well."},{"Title":"Snake Agent: A Detective Inspector Chen Novel (Detective Inspector Chen Novels)","review":"I loved this book. rich and unique blend of Chinese myth, contemporary fantasy, science fiction, and police procedural with complex, interesting characters and a good pace as well as a dash of quirky humor.Detective Inspector Chen has a strained relationship with his Goddess, loves his wife, and isn't entirely thrilled with his job as investigator of cases that lie between Earth, Heaven, and Hell when he's faced with the matter of a dead young girl whose soul hasn't made it to Heaven. Soon he is sucked into a plot that goes beyond the mere white-slavery of dead girls and into the tangled, demonic ambitions of Hell's most evil bueraucrats whose machinations may be played out on the unsuspecting populations of the living on Earth.A brilliant read and fun every step of the way--I couldn't put it down. My only complaints: too short and the ending was a bit slap-dash-bang-you're-done! Interestingly, although many of the themes are complex and adult, there is very little \\"bad\\" language and no actual sex--though prostitution and sexual deviance are important elements in the plot development.I'm looking forward to the next one and I'll be recommending it to everyone I can think of."},{"Title":"Snake Agent: A Detective Inspector Chen Novel (Detective Inspector Chen Novels)","review":"The Snake Agent by Liz Williams is an entertaining political mystery set in a futuristic mystic-China city called Singapore Three. Due to the illegal schemes of a certain Ministry department of Hell, the balance of order between the worlds of the celestial Heavens, Earth, and Hell is about to explode into mass chaos.The title refers to the undercover role Detective Inspector Chen must assume when he travels to Hell to find the missing ghost of an innocent girl whose soul never reported for processing. An unusual supporting cast includes a demon member of Hell's vice squad ; a pompous, kill-happy, samurai-style demon-slayer ; and the goddess Kuan Yin... not to mention Chen's mysterious and beautiful wife who carries around and talks to a teapot that is not just a teapot.What I really enjoyed about this tale was all the fun the writer pours into exploring elements of Chinese sorcery and mysticism. Nothing is what it seems, including the depth of each character -there are no flat layers of good and evil on earth, in Hell, or even among the residents of the Celestial Heavens."},{"Title":"Snake Agent: A Detective Inspector Chen Novel (Detective Inspector Chen Novels)","review":"I greatly enjoyed Liz Williams' \\"Snake Agent\\", partially for the excellent characterization but also for the unique setting. Williams captures the Chinese atmosphere perfectly, and I've heard from other sources that she does it pretty accurately. I'm not that familiar with the details of Chinese culture, but it certainly seems accurate to my limited knowledge. Most importantly, it *feels* right. She gets the mood down perfectly, an oppressed city, stifling heat (it's unclear whether that's due to global warming or the proximity to Hell, or if that's just Singapore's climate) and a mix of high-end neighborhoods and downtrodden slums. Her version of Hell is wonderfully portrayed too, massively bureaucratic and structured, with various ministries in charge of doing things to keep evil in the real world. However, there are certain rules they have to follow, and they can't step on each others' toes. Zhu Irzh is on the Vice Squad not to prevent and control Vice, but to make sure that everything's being done properly. We don't see Heaven in the novel, but we do see how it interacts with the real world and with Hell, as Hell's minions do have to watch their step so Heaven's bureaucracy doesn't get involved. Williams' description of everything makes you feel like you're there, sweltering in the heat or down in Hell when Chen has to go there to finish his mission.Chen is an extremely interesting character. He's married to a demon who has escape from Hell because of an attempted forced marriage (all of this happened in a previous unpublished adventure). He's world-weary, but he's definitely good at what he does. He's on the outs with his goddess right now, which will make visiting Hell a bit tougher because he won't have her protection. Zhu Irzh is a wonderful creation, a demon with a few ethics; he's not a \\"good\\" demon, but he wants to make sure everything runs smoothly and correctly. Chen and he form an interesting relationship of respect but distrust, and their interplay is a lot of fun to read. In fact, sometimes Zhu is a more interesting character then Chen, especially with little details such as how he keeps on getting his favorite coat messed up and how annoying he finds that. The ending of the book promises that in subsequent novels, we will be seeing more of Zhu, which made me very happy. I wasn't quite as impressed with Chen's wife, but she started to hold her own as her storyline moved forward. Williams also has a handle on her minor characters, making them distinctive even if they aren't a major part of the plot.I really did enjoy Snake Agent, and would recommend it highly to any fantasy or science fiction fan looking for something just a little different. The book can be slow going at times, but that's usually because you're spending more time immersed in the setting and Williams' wonderful prose. I'm usually a quick read, and I was a bit annoyed at first that this book was taking me so long. Then I realized that I was enjoying my stay in it and it was all right. It's an interesting setting and a wonderful book.David Roy"},{"Title":"Snake Agent: A Detective Inspector Chen Novel (Detective Inspector Chen Novels)","review":"I really wish the publisher would drop the Charlie Chan reference in the review, because it is not only inaccurate, it's outdated. It's also bigoted. I would never have thought of describing the main character of the book in that way. He is a police detective who apparently also knows a thing or two about magic and feng shui, and has -- literally -- traveled to Hell and back on more than one occasion. He also talks to goddesses.I thought Williams did a good job of describing the characters and the settings. One character, a demon hunter, appeared midway into the book and I expected his role to be that of a typical upstart, given the main character's thoughts about him. While Williams kept him from being too predictable, I don't think he impacted the story much except for being a guide to another policeman, so that the reader could learn some background to the story.I gave the book only 4 stars because I would have liked to gotten a little deeper into the character's motivations. I see that there are other books which follow this, so perhaps the characters grow in depth.Although the book is classified as science fiction, there is actually little science in the story, although what is there is intriguing. But, it's mostly a prop. I would probably say the book is more of a fantasy. There is some mystery, although the story isn't a classical who-dunnit. There is also a bit of humor. I wasn't disappointed with the outcome of the story, and I'm ready to read the next book in the series."},{"Title":"Snake Agent: A Detective Inspector Chen Novel (Detective Inspector Chen Novels)","review":"I've just discovered a new (to me) author named Liz Williams. I just finished her book, Snake Agent (A Detective Inspector Chen Novel), which is an amazing blend of mystery, police procedural, near future urban fantasy, and just plain fun.Heaven (Celestial Realm) and Hell are real places, each neither all good nor all bad, and each with their own bureaucracies. Upon death, spirits undergo a journey through specific departments before reaching their destinations. Someone is diverting spirits from their journeys to the Celestial Realm and rerouting them to Hell for purposes as yet unknown and Inspector Chen has the job of investigating the crimes.Complications include a wife who is a demon, a goddess (Kuan Yin) who takes an active interest in his actions, and a power struggle between the Ministry of Wealth and the Ministry of Epidemics which is spilling over from Hell onto Earth, proving politics is hell (lol).A fascinating story and I can't wait for the sequels."},{"Title":"Snake Agent: A Detective Inspector Chen Novel (Detective Inspector Chen Novels)","review":"SNAKE AGENT is set in the near future and introduces us to Detective Inspector Chen. He is a police officer in Singapore Three, heading up the supernatural crimes division. The story begins when the daughter of a wealthy family shows up at the gates of Hell, the victim of a murder. Chen begins to investigate, and discovers that it's more than a simple crime. A conspiracy is fomenting in Hell, and it reaches into the highest echelons of the government. With the help of a demon liaison from Hell's Ministry of Vice, Chen races against time to stop what could lead to the death of untold numbers of humans.One thing I enjoyed about SNAKE AGENT is that Williams isn't abashed about abusing her characters. Chen's goal in the story is complicated by the fact that he's married to a demon named Inari who fled from an arranged marriage in Hell. A government-sanctioned ghost hunter believes that Chen is being stalked and takes it upon himself to kill Chen's wife. Inari leaves Chen and goes back to Hell, believing he'll be safer without her. So, while Chen's trying to save the world, he's also trying to convince his wife to return home. Also, Chen is a devotee of the goddess Kuan Yin. His marriage to a demon has put him on bad terms with his patron, and his increased activities during his mission only further strain the relationship.I loved the use of Asian mythology as a building block. Williams does a great job making the different conception of Hell fascinating. Also, there are a lot of great little world-building moments. For example, demons regard blood in the same way that people like chocolate. Additionally, Inari is accompanied by a familiar that can shape shift to be either a tea kettle or a badger. This reminded me a lot of the Japanese folklore about the tanuki.One interesting aspect of this book is that it's set in the near future. There are several technological advances in the area of biotechnology. Also, there's an interesting political twist. It seems that in Inspector Chen's future, China has either come to govern over a large part of southern Asia or has a lot of pull. Today, Singapore is an independent republic, and one would infer that any future colonies would be a part of that republic. However, the ghost hunter is from Beijing and an ardent member of the Communist party.In closing, I'd recommend SNAKE AGENT to readers interested in urban fantasy who also like a good detective yarn. It's an exciting melange that will keep you entertained."},{"Title":"Snake Agent: A Detective Inspector Chen Novel (Detective Inspector Chen Novels)","review":"Really loved it, but more like four and a half stars. I haven't read many books in an Asian setting, much less urban fantasy. Detective Chen is the familiar world-weary but still hopeful police officer who does his best to help people. Williams took that and turned it sideways in a most enjoyable way. The world is something like modern Asia, only cities have been franchised, and Heaven and Hell are real stops on the reincarnation wheel. By the end, (view spoiler) The book was filled with rich detail that created a vivid image of the environment--particularly the humidity and the desperately functioning air-conditioners--without so much world-building that readers will feel bogged by endless detail. Williams did use one of my unfavorite ploys of starting with a scene plucked out of the near end of the book that foreshadowed problems to come, but I forgive her, as the rest was so much fun. My only real criticism is the set-up of the book; we initially meet Chen in third person view, then his wife (\\"meanwhile, back at the ranch...\\"), then the demon Zhu Irzh, and then adds in a further perspective or two as the story progresses, which I felt might have jumbled the narrative unnecessarily. It would have been more fun seeing Zhu gain humanity through others' perspective, rather than reading him thinking about it.But really, what can you say about a book that contains lines such as \\"Passers-by took one look at Detective Inspector Chen hastening down the road with a lobster on a string, like one of the more eccentric French surrealists, and gave him a very wide berth\\" or \\"You have my full and total support, as long as I don't actually have to go any nearer to this supernatural sh** than I can help, and as long as you sort it out,\\" followed by a discussion of how a Ministry of Hell uses pharmaceutical companies?

Gory in spots.The thing I don't understand is: if Earth is the place where \\"the balance is worked out\\" (Miss Qin, Book 3, I think) why is Hell multi-level yet Heaven seems to be only one dimension and a pretty cardboard one at that?"},{"Title":"Snake Agent: A Detective Inspector Chen Novel (Detective Inspector Chen Novels)","review":"This was an outstanding read.

Liz Williams moves onto my list of favorite writers with this one book --and, mind you, there are few enough modern writers on my list; my tastes usually run to pulp adventure, space opera, and Lovecraftian horror-- and I'm hunting her earlier works. The characters are endearing, the plot sufficiently complex and the settings (a future Singapore and Hell itself) are captivating. But what really makes it work is the way Williams writes her characters' thought patterns. The Chinese characters think in Chinese similies and metaphors (little things like \\"sour as a pickled plum\\" instead of \\"pickle,\\" and the Hellish ones are convincingly Hellish. She makes you feel and taste and smell Singapore, and even Chinese Hell. The classic fantasy writers I like created their own worlds on their own terms, and this is what Willaims has done. I can't wait to return there with the next two books!"},{"Title":"Snake Agent: A Detective Inspector Chen Novel (Detective Inspector Chen Novels)","review":"This is the first Inspector Chen novel, and Liz Williams has created a really lush, satisfying story that moves believably between the natural and the supernatural.

To be honest, it is not my kind of book; I prefer more substantial fiction. However, it achieves what it is supposed to achieve: It is breezy and entertaining, with likable characters, interesting ideas, and some humor. I compare it to Jim Butcher's Dresden novels or Glen Cook's Garrett books. You read them to be entertained; you don't expect complex characters or storylines or lyrical writing. As long as you don't expect those elements in Snake Agent, you will probably enjoy it. If you want to read a better fantasy with an Asian twist, I recommend Bridge of Birds by Barry Hughart."},{"Title":"Snake Agent: A Detective Inspector Chen Novel (Detective Inspector Chen Novels)","review":"I do not know Ms Williams, and this was the first of her writings I read.

Writers like Randall Garrett have been able to successfully blend both Christan and pagan aspects,without denigrating either.

This fantasy police procedural, set in an alternative Singapore clone, and. of course, in Hell (Chinese version), is full of solid characters, and the settings are sketched neatly and attractively. There are a number of clever references to Hell's associations with some of the usual, and not so usual (the World Bank) suspects. The gallant Detective Inspector Chen maintains his sense of honor and justice while submerged in the bizarre streets and buildings of Hell. Everyone else has very mixed motives, even the deities, and especially the Vice Ministry Seneschal who assists Chen and makes a fascinating character study."},{"Title":"Snake Agent: A Detective Inspector Chen Novel (Detective Inspector Chen Novels)","review":"This series reminds me a bit of \\"Bridge of Birds: A Novel of an Ancient China That Never Was\\" a 3 book series by Barry Hughart.

Her theme may always be the same, but the depth and sheer inventiveness of her stories never ceases to make her so readable and painfully true. 120 odd pages of magic-a great introduction to McCullers if you've not read her before."},{"Title":"Reflections in a Golden Eye","review":"I was able to read this book in about two hours. The short read time is my only complaint about this extremely interesting and mind stimulating story.It deals with very interesting and complex characters. We have the two military couples, both of which have very bad marriages. The first because the husband (the Major) just shuts out his sickly wife. The second because the husband (the Captain) is an intellectual who seems to have married a fairly simple-minded woman whose only interests lie in material things and the carnal spirit. The four of them are drawn together in a weird relationship where the Major is having an affair with the Captain's wife. Both the Captain and the Major's wife know about the affair but seem to enjoy the get-togethers for Bridge and parties that the couples constantly happen together.Meanwhile, the Captain's wife is being watched by a very strange enlisted man, who the Captain both hates and seems to be attracted to at the same time. The enlisted man spends nights watching the Captain's house to get a glimpse of the Captain's wife. Eventually, he starts to regularly enter the house to watch over the sleeping form of the Captain's wife.The Major's wife seems to be worshipped by her Phillipino servant. Her additional confidante is an army lieutenant who she knits sweaters for.A great deal seems to be hinted at (ex. The sexuality of the Captain), but never fully explained, probably because most of the subject matter was considered very risque when the book was written. I really wish this book could be written in an expanded form. All the characters seemed very complex and the life and psyche of each could be greatly explored in a much larger book.I also think there is a lot of fodder to foster some really good University discussions on each of the characters. I wish we had explored this book when I was in college."},{"Title":"Reflections in a Golden Eye","review":"The main character in this story is Private Ellgae Williams. It is set in an Army Post. Private Ellgae Williams is a shy but determined young man. He is very dedicated to the army and his assigned work. Even when not on duty the private likes to hang around the post. The antagonists in this story are Captain Penderton and his wife. Captain Penderton is a very hostile man. He comes off as a strong man, but in reality he is very weak. He is a coward in many ways, he never stood up for himself especially to his wife. Mrs. Penderton isn't a modest person at all. She is the strong person in the family and takes advantage of that in every way. She is the kind of person that runs around on her spouse and doesn't even think twice about it. Carson McCullers used flashbacks in this book as well as metaphors. She portrayed real problems that happen in real life. McCullers did a very good job on this piece of work. The way she described the characters, I could picture each one, vividly. McCullers did a very good job at proving that the world was not only all about the \\"American Dream\\" and the people's goals toward that, but also the ones that rebelled and were not afraid to do the unusual.

She was never quite as romantic as that may sound: McCullers was one of the masters of the Southern Gothic genre, and Reflections in a Golden Eye is her best work. Her characters are stark and clear, her style crisp, and the action visible. While this is an easy novel to read in some senses, it is more of a prose poem in a novel form. The story deals with two couples on a drab and dull Army base and a young private's animalistic &quot;awakening.&quot; His awakening coincides with those of the Captain and the Major's frail yet strong-willed, and bordering-on-insane, wife (whom McCullers seems to identify with most). McCullers dips in the consciousnesses of the five major characters and the result is chillingly beautiful. It's a shame this, McCuller's second novel and most unique of all her works, is out of print."},{"Title":"Reflections in a Golden Eye","review":"Reflections in a Golden Eye was the second story I've read by Carson McCullers, the first was Ballad of a Sad Cafe which I didn't have much use for. Reflections.. on the other hand hit the right mark for me. I find it one of the most fitting books on the subject of human motivation. The story is really insightful on what goes in the psyche of the caracters. Besides that I really felt for the caracters which is always a good measurement for a good novel. A must read."},{"Title":"Reflections in a Golden Eye","review":"I love the movie \\"Reflections In A Golden Eye\\" so I decided to pick up a copy of the book and read it. I read the book in 2 days. It was such an easy read as the movie stays true to the book. It was like watching the movie which made it a joy to read.It is the story of two couples. The first is a caption who is battling homosexuality among other things. His wife is having an affair with the Major who lives next door. Neither of them love each other. The second couple is the Major and his wife. His wife is disturbed after the death of their baby and wants nothing to do with her husband. There is also Private Williams, an insisted man who is obsessed with the Caption's wife while the caption is obsessed with him.

She did not only write about love.In this novel she reflects some aspects of human condition and creates and atmosphere of individulity. why homosexuality? because she shows a character that has a internal conflic and does not know what to do with this feeling. Captain Penderton fall in love with private Williams and he can not express his desire towards him so the society where he lives is intoletant and it would not understand him. The army post in this case is a microcosm of that society.Carson McCullers was brave to write about this topic in the novel, where atmosphere and characters are related very close."},{"Title":"Reflections in a Golden Eye","review":"The edition of this novel that I own is the one with the introduction written by Tennessee Williams - and that introduction makes a lot of valid points about the novel itself, the darkness that it contains (or attempts to contain - this depth of darkness burns through boundaries), and the reception it received upon its original publication. On this last topic, it should be noted that the novel (her second) was not nearly as well received as McCullers' debut masterpiece, THE HEART IS A LONELY HUNTER. Williams points out - and rightly so - that \`...in her second novel the veil of a subjective tenderness...was drawn away.' What readers and critics were left with was a chilling - and compelling - portrait of six people wrecking together at a fog-shrouded emotional intersection in their lives. It's not a pretty sight - but McCullers' incredible writing simply will not allow us (or her characters) to turn away. The characters slam together completely out of emotional control - mainly because none of them really know themselves deeply enough to understand what they're feeling or experiencing. It's excruciating - and fascinating - to watch.The book may not have been well received critically when it was new - but time has shown McCullers' talents to be long lasting. She is truly one of the giants of 20th century literature."},{"Title":"Reflections in a Golden Eye","review":"This novella is a brave, bald exploration of homosexuality and infidelity in the military. It presents itself as a rare event that disturbs the routine dullness of peacetime military life.The small circle of characters is individually and collectively self-destructive. There's Captain Penderton, who comes to nurse ambivalent homosexual yearnings for Private Williams, who fancies his wife. Meanwhile, Mrs Leonora Pederton is sleeping with General Langdon, whose wife, Alison, eventually succumbs to a complete breakdown of sanity. Got that? Good. It's compulsive stuff.In this narrow social circle, author McCullers sets \\"normal\\" domestic events such as cooking delicious Southern dinners, and card evenings, against sexual episodes (both overt and latent). These range from Private Williams crouching in Mrs Penderton's room all night long to observe her sleeping naked, through to the tormentedly homosexual Captain Pemberton wrecking the body and spirit of his wife's horse on a particularly brutal ride.In some ways, the strangest character is the Langdons' Filipino houseboy, Anacleto. Effete, devoted and fastidious to a \\"T\\", a would-be dancer and artist, he provides tragic Mrs Langdon with a kind of love. And it is Anacleto's artistic vision of a peacock with grotesque reflections in its golden eye that explains the title.Typically of McCullers's Southern Gothicism, the writing infuses poetry with a feeling of utter menace. At times it's scarily bald, yet lyrical: \\"In the sky there was a white brilliant moon and the night was cold and silvery.\\"Some have found it too short, but I don't see that as a problem. It's a quick, chillingly stylish read that plumbs hidden psychological depths and doesn't shrink from uncomfortable truths."},{"Title":"Reflections in a Golden Eye","review":"Written in 1941, Carson McCullers' second novel probably qualifies as a novella or long short story. Surely it was light years ahead of its time as Ms. McCullers takes on homosexuality-- latent and the other kind, masochism, adultery, voyeurism, self-mutilation, a nervous breakdown and animal cruelty in fewer than a hundred pages. In the hands of a lesser writer, this tale would have degenerated into a trashy detective story. Ms. McCullers, however, manages to make the characters, with all their warts, believable, and for the most part, sympathetic. Captain Penderton, for example, is tormented by his hidden feelings for other men-- he is simultaneously attracted to both Private Williams as well as Major Langdon and hates Williams, even though he ought to despise the Major since he is cuckolding the Captain who, along with everyone else, knows about it. But Penderton is a real person, unhappy, lonely but capable of murder.Ms. McCullers keeps this story first class with her spare, though poetic language. \\"An army post [the story is set on a military post in the 1930's in the South] in peacetime is a dull place. Things happen, but then they happen over and over again. . . At the same time things do occasionally happen on an army post that are not likely to re-occur. There is a fort in the South where a few years ago a murder was committed. The participants of this tragedy were: two officers, a soldier, two women, a Filipino, and a horse.\\" With those opening lines, the story begins and never slows down.I never had an English professor who would give Carson McCullers the time of day. Her novels were too gothic, her plots unbelievable, there were too many kinks in her characters. Could it have been that her stories were too close to home or were they jealous of her popularity with the reading public from the publication of her first novel THE HEART IS A LONELY HUNTER?REFLECTIONS IN A GOLDEN EYE holds up well on a second reading. Made into a movie by John Houston in 1967 starring Marlon Brando-- in one of his best roles-- and Elizabeth Taylor, this novel is ripe for a remake now by someone with the talent of Mike Nichols."},{"Title":"Reflections in a Golden Eye","review":"Carson McCullers' often critically overlooked but excellent second novel, 'Reflections In A Golden Eye' (1941), represents the author at the height of her creative powers. At the time of its release, Anais Nin thought the book betrayed the influence of D. H. Lawrence, but a more likely inspiration was fellow Southerner Erskine Caldwell, whose early novels 'Tobacco Road' (1932) and 'God's Little Acre' (1933) shared McCullers' tart black humor. Like Caldwell, McCullers parted the heavy curtains of social respectability and looked human nature unsentimentally in the face: 'Reflections In A Golden Eye' examines infidelity, madness, sexual frustration, emotional insensitivity, erotic obsession, the failure of self actualization, voyeurism, homosexuality, and bisexuality with perfect calm and assurance.As the first paragraph bluntly reveals, 'Reflections In A Golden Eye' is a tragedy involving \\"two officers, a soldier, two women, a Filipino, and a horse.\\" The novel takes place on a microcosmic army base in the Deep South: and \\"an army post in peacetime is a dull place.\\" Despite the insulation of the setting and the generally grotesque inner lives of the cast, the smoothly critical tone of the book suggests that McCullers' characters are largely everymen, and thus essentially no different in any specific manner from the average American man or woman.The novel's predominant theme is the general lack of self-awareness which, in the author's vision, most members of society, at all levels, enjoy or suffer. The book begs the question, \\"Which is the greater burden, consciousness or unconsciousness?\\" McCuller's answer is clear: for most people, the burden of consciousness is by far the heavier cross to bear.Adulterous, lust-object Leonora Penderton is not only \\"a little feeble-minded\\" and inherently \\"very stupid,\\" but emotionally coarse as well, while her stolid married lover, Major Morris Langdon, keeps \\"very recondite and literary\\" books by his bedside but privately longs for the \\"pulp magazines\\" featuring \\"wild, interplanetary superwars\\" hidden in his bureau drawer.Alison Langdon, Morris' tense, cuckolded, and perpetually ailing wife, suffers from fits of \\"madness\\" which drive her to acts of self-mutilation. Sadly, Alison, the proverbial 'eye among the blind,' is the single character capable of making an accurate assessment of the terrible events unfolding around her. When the exasperated Alison finally announces what she has witnessed, she is diagnosed as mentally ill and taken away, a theme McCullers admirer Tennessee Williams would adopt and develop to great effect in the following decade.'Reflections In A Golden Eye' is also dominated by characters who are, to varying degrees, homosexual in some capacity of their natures. The book's main character, secret aesthete, figurative eunuch, and kleptomaniac Captain Weldon Penderton, is vaguely aware of his homosexual instincts, and routinely and masochistically becomes enamored of his wife's lovers. Pompous and absurd, Captain Penderton, who was raised by \\"five old-maid aunts\\" and who is known as \\"Flap-Fanny\\" among his subordinates due to his flabby buttocks, receives the brunt of McCullers' often hilarious scorn.All of the book's homosexual elements converge and are caricatured in Alison's mischievous house boy, Anacleto, who spontaneously creates and performs ballets, wears \\"a blouse of aquamarine linen,\\" speaks rudimentary French to Major Langdon's annoyance, and whose paintings, which are at once \\"primitive and over-sophisticated,\\" lay \\"a queer spell on the beholder.\\" Like a folkloric animal trickster, Anacleto is continually described in physically atavistic, monkey-like terms. But McCullers allows the effeminate Anacleto a revenge of sorts: he is the only character who is both self-aware and self-accepting.Rounding out the cast is the introverted Private Williams, a somnambulistic young man--and undetected murderer--who awakens to a new level of consciousness and strange longing after coming into contact with Leonora, whose horse, Firebird, he stables. Unfortunately for all concerned parties, Captain Penderton becomes as uncomfortably enamored of Private Williams as Williams is of Leonora, with fatal results. Though Private Williams clearly develops a definite sexual attraction for Leonora, he also becomes oddly mesmerized by Captain Penderton's halting overtures, which in turn lead him to spasmodic acts of irrational violence.Though McCullers slightly loses her tight focus as the story winds to its conclusion, 'Reflections In A Golden Eye' is so pristinely and economically written that it feels organic: there is barely a false note in any of its deft 124 pages."},{"Title":"Reflections in a Golden Eye","review":"One would expect a 20-something year old in 1940s southern USA to be all prim and nice, with no knowledge of such things as deep emotional trauma and burning homosexual desires. Well Carson McCullers defied conventional wisdom and not only was aware of such matters but deftly encapsulated it in a short, brutal novel. Reflections in a Golden Eye is a painful examination of the wrecked lives of two couples (, and other characters, ) on a military base in the South. There is little in the way of action or story per se, but it is her examination of characters which makes this novel such a winner.This novel is not for everyone. It is rather depressing, with everyone leading neurotic lives. No happy endings, and one has to wonder if there is moral to the story. But those who can tolerate looking at the world without wearing rose-colored glasses will appreciate this masterful work.PS - the novel is MUCH better than the film. And I enjoyed it better than her other famous novel The Heart is a Lonely Hunter."},{"Title":"Reflections in a Golden Eye","review":"With its short page count, \\"Reflections in a Golden Eye\\" is more of a novella than a novel. What is disappointing about it is that it takes about fifty pages (the majority of the novella) to get involved in the characters and the plot. It starts intriguingly enough, with the promise of a murder involving the central characters (\\"two officers, a soldier, two women, a Filipino, and a horse.\\"), but McCullers' prose is so cold and distant that it makes the plot inaccessible to the reader. The descriptions of the setting benefit from this and become starkly beautiful -- \\"Then suddenly the sun was gone. There was a chill in the air and a light, pure wind. It was time for retreat. From far away came the sound of the bugle, clarified by distance and echoing in the woods with a lost hollow tone. The night was near at hand.\\" -- but the characters are rendered so abstruse by it that it feels slightly maddening. After thirty pages someone asked me how the book was so far and the only word that came to mind was bizarre. The violence (both subtle and overt) is startling and seems too unreasoned.But stick with it. In the last thirty pages or so you begin to comprehend the pathos of the characters and their situations, and suspense begins to build as the novella heads to its shattering climax. What McCullers is exploring is how repressed desire can turn to intense hatred, and how that loathing can turn to violence in one sudden moment. The characters are all stuck in their own traps, and most of them are being driven mad by desperation. At the center is Captain Weldon Penderton, a repressed homosexual whose desires are so internalized that the only expression they can find is rage and despair. When his colleague, and his wife's lover, remarks that another character would do better in life if he conformed to the mainstream a little more Penderton angrily disagrees, bitterly wondering \\"that any fulfillment obtained at the expense of normalcy is wrong, and should not be allowed to bring happiness. In short, it is better, because it is morally honorable, for the square peg to keep scraping about the round hole rather than to discover and use the unorthodox square that would fit it?\\" When you consider the ramifications that a life of trying to scrape into a round hole have had on him, you can't help but feel for Penderton. This becomes all the more resonant when you consider that \\"Reflections in a Golden Eye\\" was written at a time when McCullers' own marriage (to a bisexual soldier) was failing as a result of their homosexual affairs.In the end \\"Reflections\\" is a startling and intelligent, not to mention socially important, work. I just wish that it wasn't so hard to get into in the first place, because its initial heartlessness is a misgiving. There actually is a lot of emotion and depth in this novella, and yet it is only toward the ending that it truly shines."},{"Title":"Reflections in a Golden Eye","review":"This book was written in 1941, and deals with homosexuality as well as infidelity in the military. Now being a former Marine and I know what that is like. That alone was enough to make me read it, and I was suprised as to how tastfully it was done. I loved the characters McCullers created and how she was short and to the point with there feelings. A quick read and a ...honest one at that. Very honest about gay supressed passions. I recommend it."},{"Title":"Reflections in a Golden Eye","review":"\\"there is a fort in the south where a few years ago a murder was committed. The participants were: two officers, a soldier, two women, a filipino, and a horse.\\"So starts ms mccullers novel, \\"reflections in a golden eye.\\" This novella was written in 1941 and its underlying sexual tones are well ahead of its time. From extra marital affairs to homosexuality with a little voyeurism mixed in, we get a very unique picture of a southern army base in the 1940's.The story is told with great precision and limited verbiage. As a result I enjoyed this more than I did ms mccullers more famous \\"the heart is a lonely hunter\\". Captain penderton's battle with his demons-which include his wife, her horse, and a private for whom he has unwanted feelings-is interestingly contrasted to the singular and more simple desires of the other characters.A very well written book which, by the way, was made into an excellent movie starring marlon brando and elizabeth taylor. Don't miss either."},{"Title":"Reflections in a Golden Eye","review":"This short novel, is extremely well written, not a word out of place. Carson McCullers I very economical with her descriptions, evoking a drama of odd circumstance that must have been a taboo topic when the book was first published. McCullers doesn't seem to really like any characters in the book but she treats them fairly as she surgically dissect each one, revealing repressed feelings, narcissism, shallow intellect, emotional fragility, and dangerous sublimation of emotion.Repressed homosexual Army Major Penderton is the most complex character in the novel, an unloved and unlovable shell of a human, who is barely able to sustain a rigid mask of sanity as homosexual compulsions eventually, drives him to rash acts of violence against himself, his wife's horse, and others. He is the victim of Venus, the goddess who infects humanity with sexual obsession. He is struck by a vision of a handsome young man, Private Williams, and vacillates between fantasy of sexual encounters merged with combat and struggle. The Major's wife, Leonora, is not a complex thinker, but is a bold, beautiful spoiled military brat who has married a career officer with a repressed secret that undermines their entire relationship, making them enemies. As a sexually frustrated wife, she meets her sexual needs with an affair that is so open that everyone on the military base knows it is occurring, with the possible exception of Major Weldon Penderton. Major Penderton may know about her affair with Lt. Colonel Morris Langdon, their next-door neighbor, but he sees it as punishment for his dark secret. She releases some of her pent up passion through horseback riding on her beautiful white stallion, Firebird, an animal that her husband sees as somewhat of a rival.Some may indicate that this is a dark Southern Gothic tale by a Southern writer. It takes place in a post-World War II army base in Georgia where officers and their wives make use of a stable of horses, maintained by the enlisted men. When riding, there are multiple trails in the southern forest that surrounds the Army base. It is here that Leonora and Colonel Langdon frequently go to have sex among the blackberry bushes. It is here that Private Williams, a handsome animal force from nature, rides a black mare nude. It is here that Major Penderton pushes his wife's horse into panic and frenzy in a wild ride of desperation to escape his life condition.Private Williams is a fascinating character, his actions bring about the crisis of identity for Major Penderton for he becomes the object of male obsession. He is a force of nature drawn to nature and destined to appeal to the nature hidden within others. He is as one with horses and the forest where he takes off his clothes and either rides or naps in the nude. He recognizes in Leonora an animal instinct and animal passion that is unreleased and seething. As a voyeur, he observes Leonora taunt her husband while she is nude. However, Private Williams has his own secret, for he becomes obsessed with Leonora and enters the Penderton home nightly to watch her sleep and to smell her clothing. There could also be a Jungian interpretation of Private Williams, for he acts as a shadow archetype for Major Penderton. He nightly enters the home of Penderton (which is the symbol of the psyche) as if the repressed homoeroticism is breaking through the unconscious into consciousness.Alison Langdon, the mentally disturbed wife of Colonel Langdon, watches as her husband courts Leonora, hating both but too weak to escape. As is many classics, she may be mentally ill but she sees all. She sees that her husband is unfaithful and she sees that Private Williams enters the Penderton home on a nightly basis. She is tended to by an effeminate butterfly of a man, Anacleto, who is the houseboy for the Langdons. Alison lost a female child in childbirth and mutilated her nipples afterward in an act of grief and an emotional break from reality.Much story is told in this short novel. The weaknesses of every character are revealed. We are swept away by McCuller's beautiful writing into an odd story of repression and violence."},{"Title":"Reflections in a Golden Eye","review":"What makes a southern novel? There was, of course, a golden age of the southern novel, with the O'Connor, Welty and McCullers as the holy trinity, along with Faulkner. In the 80s there is resurgence, with Lewis Nordan, Clyde Edgerton and the rest of the Algonquin catalogue. After reading FEBRUARY HOUSE I had decided that I wanted to delve into the work of McCullers, having only read THE HEART IS A LONELY HUNTER, and that was in high school. I started with book two, 1941's REFLECTIONS IN A GOLDEN EYE, with that incredible opening line: \\"An army post in peacetime is a dull place.\\" The question is, is this a Southern novel? The edition that I read has an afterward by Tennessee Williams, who goes into detail about the gothic sensibilities, but not so much as to how it relates to this slim novel. An army post can certainly take on the flavor of the local geography, but with such a mix of people here seems to be little cohesiveness of spirit. The army base in REFLECTIONS is home to odd Captain Penderton, his lusty wife Leonora, the enigmatic Private Williams and the Pendleton's neighbors, Major Langdon and his wife Alison. Most interestingly, and perhaps the most gothic, is the effete Filipino houseboy Anacleto, who is Alison's strange confident. For 1941 the book is quite an envelope-pusher, with its sexuality and violence. I am sure the book was rampant with symbolism (horses, shears, adultery) but I wasn't keen enough to pick up on all of it. FEBRUARY HOUSE sets up McCuller's writing of this story, and of the almost-positive universal reception (although her father was apparently so repulsed he threw the book across the room). The idea of being lonely in marriage, a constant theme in some of my favorite authors (Updike, Roth) is on full display here. The book is set in the South of the 1930s, but as I said, the inclusiveness of an army post overrides the kudzu and magnolias. I am looking forward to marching through McCuller's canon over the summer and continuing to explore her twisted worlds."},{"Title":"Across America in the only house on wheels;: Or, Lasley's traveling palace","review":"I am the Great Grandson of the author and have several original copies of this work.

Not at all true to life as it is lived on Tahiti, the coffee plantation should have been sited on the Big Island, where this kind of coffee growing is done. While some coffee is grown in Tahiti, most of the local coffee comes from the Austral Islands, and is not a premium product. The author only spent a week in Tahiti (I spoke to him at a fund-raising auction- we were interested because we had lived down there for several months on two occasions). Readers wanting to get some idea of daily life on Tahiti will not find it here."},{"Title":"Twenty Blue Devils (Gideon Oliver Mysteries)","review":"I always enjoy Gideon Oliver mysteries. The puzzles are always cleverly constructed and full of intriguing details. They also benefit from a nice touch of humor. &quot;Twenty Blue Devils&quot; is no exception. The mystery revolves around a family-run coffee business in Tahiti. Gideon has to figure out the meaning of some curious details on corpses and skeletons to prove that a murder has actually been committed, and then to figure out who's guilty of what. Followers of the Gideon Oliver series will remember that Gideon started as a bachelor, and his sidekick was John Lau, friend and local FBI agent. Then Gideon met and married Julie, and she has increasingly generally become the principal sidekick. John's role has diminished accordingly. This isn't a problem. Julie is a satisfactory character. Sometimes you might miss John, though. I did, anyway. In &quot;Twenty Blue Devils&quot; John makes a nice comeback. It is his family that owns the coffee business, and it is through him that Gideon gets involved in the case. Altogether, this is one of those books that keeps you turning the pages to see what happens next. I always hesitate to give mysteries a five-star rating. In my opinion, few can match Christie and Doyle for plot and characterization. They are my standard. Among current writers, however, Elkins is one of my favorites.

To be honest, it usually sounds like a cat fight between to very large cats (Traditional Christianity vs. Mormonism). Accusations, insults, false assertions, misguided criticisms abound on both sides, and NOTHING is accomplished.This book by Abanes, I am pleased to say, goes in a different direction. He is clearly and evangelical Christian, but seems to have chosen a path of tolerance and accuracy rather than just seeking to bludgeon another religion. He tries vey hard to not shy away from difficult issues by raising concerns he has about Mormonism, but at the same time, seeks to simply lay out where differneces between Mormonism and his evangelical views exist. It is a very, very fine line he tries to walk in this book, but the job he does is admirable.The volume is broken down into 10 chapters, covering ten different doctrinal topics, and each is discussed in a way that, was rather enjoyable. The writing style is fast, popular, and engaging. There are four appendices at teh end of the book. One of which is actually written by Dr. Daniel C. Peterson, a Mormon professor of Islamic and Arabic studes at BYU. This has got to say something about what Abanes is trying to do with the book.I especially like the personal stories that Abanes shares form his own life in order to start off each chapter. He uses these short stories to illustrate his personal interaction with Mormons involving the very issue he is going to discuss in the chpater. Brilliant, and again, very engaging.Endnotes abound, if that is your cup of tea. They add a whole different dimension to the book for those who want to dig even deeper into the issue of Mormon beliefs.This is a great book. No need to worry here about whether or not it is just going to be some fundamentalist diatribe against a faith that is held by millions of sincere people. It is critical, to be sure, but in a way that I think has moved us all beyond the name-calling and barbaric bashing of each other that has marked the history of communication between traditional Christians and Mormons.1.

The issue is, how do Mormons think today (or, at least, how are they taught by their LDS Church leaders), and Abanes provides abundant documentation to show that this material is more than just his personal opinion. I found it interesting that he included a short chapter in the appendix by Mormon apologist Dr. Daniel C. Peterson titled \\"Why I am a Mormon.\\" I am surprised Dr. Peterson would write what amounted to a page and a half (of a 460+-page book) about why Mormonism is, for him, \\"inexpressibly good.\\" Anybody reading the parts before the appendix would certainly not be convinced by Peterson's limited words dealing with his personal testimony that Mormonism is good, especially given the detail that Abanes provided to show how, no, there are too many issues to say this is a true religion. Perhaps this could have led to a \\"Mormon and Evangelical in Conversation\\" type of book, though we've already been there and done that.Although Mormons may not like Abanes' analysis, there is no arguing with his facts. I think he did a very thorough job reporting the differences, making it very clear what Mormonism teaches and showing \\"Evangelical Thoughts\\" (in subtitles) to counter the doctrine(s). My only complaint with the book is that the endnotes are copious--in fact, maybe too copious, taking up a full quarter of the entire book (125+ pages!). Some of the material, I felt, would have been better placed in the regular text. I also wish publishers would get over their apparent fear of scaring readers by feeling they have to use endnotes rather than footnotes. I like to see the information readily at hand, but having them in the back requires a lot of work. Every paragraph seems to have an endnote, and I too often would lose my place, either with the regular text or the endnotes. I just wish it could be placed at the bottom of each page, allowing a reader to either skip them or, if they wanted, look at it and see what else is available. Abanes gets information from a wide variety of sources, and I think these nuggets should not be hidden.Overall, I recommend Becoming Gods for both the layperson and scholar."},{"Title":"Becoming Gods: A Closer Look at 21st-Century Mormonism","review":"While reading this book, it's not painfully obvious that the author is Christian and as someone who is not religious, I appreciate that. Some Mormons may try to argue their way out of his line of reasoning, but his logic is well-founded and clear. If a person tries to say things like Lehi's family was only a small contributor to the population of the Americas, he should look at the introduction to the Book of Mormon, which states the contrary. Also, the hill cumorah as described in Mormon 6:6 clearly states Mormon hid the plates in the hill. Joseph Smith found them over a thousand years later, supposedly where they were originally hidden. In NY, not anywhere else. Abanes is objective, while Mormon apologetics seem to try backflips to keep their brand of \\"logic\\" on top while failing to do so to the analytical mind."},{"Title":"Becoming Gods: A Closer Look at 21st-Century Mormonism","review":"I have a son who recently \\"converted\\" to Mormonism. This book, along with others has helped me understand the cult nature of the Mormon church. It is written is language that a non-mormon can understand and appreciate. They truly believe that they can become gods. The book explains why. A good read for those who want to know more about this strange and scary cult."},{"Title":"Becoming Gods: A Closer Look at 21st-Century Mormonism","review":"Written by an evangelical Christian, this book could have been part of the superb \\"for Dummies\\" series. Neat, readable, and highly accurate, Abanes clearly breaks down the most deep Mormon doctrines (the progression of men to godhood, women as polygamous spirit-baby producers, the three levels of heaven, etc.) in very simple, clear terms. I especially reccomend this book if you are investigating the church, because the missionaries tend to focus on the simpler aspects of LDS belief, and try to guide you toward an emotion-based conversion. Read this and you'll know what you're getting into. If you like what you see, or don't have a problem with it, then you'll be just fine in Mormonism. Otherwise prepare to have a long and difficult struggle with these concepts, as they are everything Mormonism builds to."},{"Title":"Becoming Gods: A Closer Look at 21st-Century Mormonism","review":"I am the author of \\"Becoming Gods.\\" It has been re-titled \\"Inside Today's Mormonism.\\" For those interested, please refer to that title for this book.

Abanes"},{"Title":"Becoming Gods: A Closer Look at 21st-Century Mormonism","review":"This book by Richard Abanes is a comprehensive and thorough account of all of the major beliefs of the Mormon church, and why he believes it isn't Christian. Abanes provides a refreshing perspective from a non-Mormon viewpoint. Anyone who has had Mormon missionaries in his/her home knows how frustrating it is to get them to elaborate on their doctrine whenever hard questions begin to be asked. An old standby of LDS missionaries is to advise potential converts to \\"Pray about it\\". Abanes does much more. He is not bitter, or ranting like some evangelicals. He doesn't even go to extreme lengths to defend traditional Christianity. What he does, perhaps better than any other non-Mormon writer, is to provide both perspectives and tell why he believes the Christian and Mormon beliefs are incompatible. He provides plausible rebuttals to the best and most recent Mormon apologetic arguments. The most unusual part of the book is the end, where he actually allows a Mormon friend of his to give his testimony.I would say that if you are trying to determine whether the Mormon faith is true, read the Book of Mormon, and read Becoming Gods, not necessarily in that order, in order to provide the balance needed to make a fair-minded and truly informed decision."},{"Title":"Becoming Gods: A Closer Look at 21st-Century Mormonism","review":"Albanes is a man on a mission. Unlike other authors who simply prefer to discredit the Mormon beliefs, this author's intent is to additionally preach his own personal beliefs, via an evangelical counter argument on each selective issue raised. It's unfortunate, as for every point Albanes uses to prove Mormonism is untrue, a similar debate can be used to prove Evangelism is untrue (and the Bible, and Christianity as a whole, and every other spiritual belief system out there), and the result is a boring adfinitum debate on religious belief.Albanes is the author of the better knownOne Nation Under Gods: A History of the Mormon Church- a \\"negative\\" history of the Mormon church. While obviously antagonistic toward the Mormon church, it at least followed a historical timeline and reveals a history not so well known to most people. I actually learnt a few things from reading this other work.However, my decision to purchase \\"Becoming Gods\\" was based on its more favourable reviews than the ones found on the \\"One Nation Under Gods\\" page. I was soon to discover, that this book was more biased and polemical than the previous work, and not the better of the two at all. The notes on the back cover alone convey the author's driven motive to impose his own \\"anti-mormon\\" beliefs on the reader right from the get-go.This book appears to be a result of the author's post-\\"One Nation Under Gods\\" experience. He states he has spent a lot of time online in chat groups arguing Mormonisn vs Evangelism. This book is no doubt the result of those many online debates. Each chapter focuses on one subject and relates in no way to previous chapters. The chapters subject is presented as a generic \\"here are the facts\\", followed by the Mormon response, the Evangelist response and a conclusion. The result is a lot of evangelical preaching.While some of the points are extremely valid, this is not the book I was hoping for. Think of \\"One Nation Under Gods\\" as a historical discussion, and this book as a doctrinal debate. If you wish to know what Mormons believe, there are much better books out there. If you wish to compare the beliefs of two completely different \\"Christian\\" religions, then this book might have some appeal to you. For me, it was a waste of my time and money."},{"Title":"Becoming Gods: A Closer Look at 21st-Century Mormonism","review":"I never thought I'd ever endorse any books written by Richard Abanes before now.

He gives proof that the \\"Book of Mormon\\" is not the word of God, and that other Mormon publications such as the \\"Book of Abraham\\" are frauds.Also, he mentions the embarasing Mormon doctrine that men who go to the Mormon temple and go through secret ceremonies will be able to become Gods.I would also like to recommend \\"The Maze of Mormonism\\" and \\"The Kingdom of the Cults.\\" Both by Walter Martin."},{"Title":"Becoming Gods: A Closer Look at 21st-Century Mormonism","review":"A very good book. Very good information."},{"Title":"Becoming Gods: A Closer Look at 21st-Century Mormonism","review":"Mr. Abanes has more research yet to do. His problem with mortals acheiving eventual perfection and thus godhood, has roots is his own Christian backround!The doctrine of the deification of man is not an exclusive teaching of the restored Church of Jesus Christ. Rather, it can be found in early Christian history. In the second century, Irenaeus, bishop of Lyons (about A.D. 130-200), the most important Christian theologian of his time, said much the same thing as Lorenzo Snow:If the Word became a man,It was so men may become gods.Further, Irenaeus asked:Do we cast blame on him [God] because we were not made gods from the beginning, but were at first created merely as men, and then later as gods? Although God has adopted this course out of his pure benevolence, that no one may charge him with discrimination or stinginess, he declares, \\"I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are sons of the Most High.\\" . . . For it was necessary at first that nature be exhibited, then after that what was mortal would be conquered and swallowed up in immortality.At about the same time, Clement of Alexandria (about A.D. 150-215) wrote: \\"Yea, I say, the Word of God became a man so that you might learn from a man how to become a god.\\" Clement also said that \\"if one knows himself, he will know God, and knowing God will become like God. . . . His is beauty, true beauty, for it is God, and that man becomes a god, since God wills it. So Heraclitus was right when he said, 'Men are gods, and gods are men.'\\"Still in the second century, Justin Martyr (about A.D. 100-165) insisted that in the beginning men \\"were made like God, free from suffering and death,\\" and that they are thus \\"deemed worthy of becoming gods and of having power to become sons of the highest.\\" Athanasius, bishop of Alexandria (about A.D. 296-373), also stated his belief in deification in terms very similar to those of Lorenzo Snow: \\"The Word was made flesh in order that we might be enabled to be made gods. . . . Just as the Lord, putting on the body, became a man, so also we men are both deified through his flesh, and henceforth inherit everlasting life.\\" On another occasion Athanasius observed: \\"He became man that we might be made divine.\\" Finally, Augustine of Hippo (A.D. 354-430), the greatest of the early Christian Fathers, said: \\"But he himself that justifies also deifies, for by justifying he makes sons of God. 'For he has given them power to become the sons of God' [John 1:12]. If then we have been made sons of god, we have also been made gods.\\"All five of the above writers were not just orthodox Christians, but also in time became revered as saints. Three of the five wrote within a hundred years of the period of the apostles, and all five believed in the doctrine of deification. This doctrine was a part of historical Christianity until relatively recent times, and it is still an important doctrine in some Eastern Orthodox churches. One writer states that a fundamental prin-ciple of orthodoxy in the patristic period was recognizing \\"the history of the universe as the history of divinization and salvation.\\" As a result the early Christian Fathers concluded that \\"because the Spirit is truly God, we are truly divinized by the presence of the Spirit.\\"And then there is this from that non-mormon, C.S. Lewis: It is a serious thing to live in a society of possible gods and goddesses, to remember that the dullest and most uninteresting person you talk to may one day be a creature which, if you saw it now, you would be strongly tempted to worship.Hmmm....I hope Mr. Abanes does not now rethink Christianity altogether.The more you really, truly understand the LDS faith, the more sense it makes. Hard truths for those whose lifetstyle choices would wish it otherwise. On the other hand, there is tremendous joy in knowing that God hasn't given up on us, that He still call prophets today.

Our heroine is Sophie Hatter, the eldest of three girls, who is convinced that as the eldest she will never be a success or be able to seek a fortune. Instead she is stuck at the Hat Shop, owned by her family, toiling away, decorating hats. However, one day her life is changed forever when she meets the Witch of the Waste. She is propelled on a journey that involves a scarecrow, a castle that never stops moving, a fire demon called Calcifur and a very vain wizard.This book was such a pleasure to read. Ever since Charmed Life I have been a huge Diana Wynne Jones fan, and I've been slowly making my way through her collection of tales. She has a wonderful knack for writing stories that simply leap off the pages and keep you riveted until the very last sentence. Howl's Moving Castle is another example of her incredible talent.The characters in Howl's Moving Castle are simply wonderful. We have the adorable heroine Sophie, who can't seem to piece together the mystery and restore her life, and the ever-vain Wizard Howl, along with his apprentice Michael. Not since Chrestomanci (in Charmed Life) have I found characters to love and cherish this much.Between pages of adventures, there is so many \\"laugh out loud\\" moments as Diana Wynne Jones has spun a tale that is set back and forth from a fantasyland, to modern day Wales.

It is very different from the movie of the same name,Howl's Moving Castle, which shares only the title, the moving castle setting, and some character names; the tone, plot, and most of the characters in the movie are vastly different from those of the book.

As an adult reader I really enjoyed this book, it was a fun, light-hearted romp that has been a pleasure to read and re-read."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I had to read this for a class and I have to say I actually enjoyed it. We watched the Anime first, which to my suprise I enjoyed. I'm not a big fan of Anime but It was a good film and this is a fun book."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I loved this book! It is full of humor, memorable characters, magic spells and fire demons. Not many authors can pull off a novel with the two main characters being a 90-year-old woman and a self-centered and vain wizard. Diana Wynne Jones pulls it off with panache, and leaves readers with a thoroughly contented feeling at the finish.For those who enjoy Caroline Stevermer, Patricia C. Wrede, Teresa Edgerton (sadly out of print) and J. K. Rowling, this book is right up your alley. Jones is certainly an author I shall be looking into regularly in the future. Luckily for us all, she has written several books."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I bought this book after watching the movie (which is great too). This book reads easy and takes some wonderful twists and turns. Diana Wynne Jones' about crossing time and place periods is great. A wonderful book for a reader of any age."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I hadn't read any of Diana Wynne Jones' books before I'd watched Miyazaki's take on Howl's Moving Castle. It seemed that the movie had left out certain plot points leaving it a bit on the confusing side. So, I picked up the book, curious.Overall, I enjoyed reading this book. It is certainly a good book for young adults or readers who enjoy fantasy books such as Brian Jacques' Redwall. There are many wonderfully created events and experiences that are sure to delight.More advanced readers will find that it lacks a continuous driving dramatic plot. There isn't quite the rising action and climax as all excellent fiction has. It does have a climax, but we don't see it coming till nearly the very end, when it just seems to happen.The changes in the movie contain a rising action for the plot. It does increase the danger and excitement in the viewer, whereas the book does not.Oddly, the book and movie together create something that compliments both and further explains and fleshes out the story and characters.Regardless, I'd wholly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys fantasy and a good story."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Only learned about this title because of the box office hit Japanese animation of the same title directed by the master Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki. Since I missed watching it in the cinema, I bought the book of which the movie was based on. I couldn't put it down and finished it in one go! While it may not be as breathtaking as some of the Harry Potter novels, it's level of imagination is unsurpassed. I just bought another title by Diana Wynne Jones (Castle in the Air), and can't wait to start reading it."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I got Howl's Moving Castle for my girlfriend and myself since we loved the movie. The book is excellent and quite different from the movie. So even if you think you know the story it is worth checking out. My only problem with the story was that the ending was very convoluted, I had to reread the last few pages to figure out who was doing what. Otherwise the story was very enganging and the characters likable. I think the story will please both children and adult fans of fantasy."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"This book may get more attention now, with a major anime release in theatres and headed toward DVD. Well deserved! A wonderful movie, and a wonderful book. Fans of the movie will find the book fascinating, and the changes between the story in the book and the movie interesting. I don't want to give much away for those who haven't both seen the movie and read the book, but some of the basic plot elements have changed, as well as some of the important characteristics of the principle characters. For instance, the anti-war theme in the movie really doesn't appear in the book, and Sophie's delightful magical powers don't really make it into the movie. Of course, the book contains many details and elaborations which there aren't room for in a movie. Both the movie and the book are classics, and both should be enjoyed by as many people as possible!"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"This is a quick read, and entertaining. If you saw the movie, it is similar except the characters in the book are more flawed and believable. The movie version of Howl is a bit sanitized - he is not as noble as depicted on film."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I recommend this book to just about anyone who likes Fantasy, Adventure and just all the good stuff. Originally I did not know it was a book until my friend pointed it out when we watched Howls Moving Castle directed by Hayao Miyazaki from Disney. But the book has a lot more detail like any book that has its own movie. Its fun, exciting and you get to hear more of Sophie's thoughts. I truly recommend it, its good for kids and even adults. And if you have seen the movie and are considering buying the book, DO IT. Totally worth it! :)"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"The book was amazing,the package arrived safely, and I managed to get hold of the book as quickly as possible.Diana Wynne Jones is a gifted writer for sure"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I bought the Kindle version even though I already own the paperback. This is one of my favorite books.It's well written, has great characters, a wonderful plot, and a lot of humor. There are great touches of both the &#34;real&#34; and &#34;fantasy&#34; worlds.The Kindle version also tipped me off that there is a third book by DWJ that has the Howl characters - I was only aware of two.Give it a shot if you're looking for a well-written light fantasy book."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"My wife and I read this book together and really enjoyed the fantasy of it all.

Will definitely be look at other Diana Wynne Jones books!"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I must admit that I saw the movie first, and I was entertained enough to give the book a try. I am so glad I did, because it is easily one of my favorite books! I love the tongue-in-cheek manner it tells its story, and the way it good-humoredly pokes fun of fairytales. It is incredibly well-written, and every character is beautifully formed. You love each and every one of them, flaws and all. The classic tale of leaving home to find adventures has never been so surprising and fun!"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"The characters are described so well and the story is just simply amazing.

In fact read all of the Howl Series and am finally getting them on Kindle. Another great series is the Chrestomanci Series. Highly recommend her works."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Our house is full of Studio Ghibli fans. We had seen the movie so many times without even realizing it was based on a book. When the book came in, there was a fight over who would get to read it first. It was as wonderful as we knew it would be. Sophie's motivations are so well explained, and there is a greater depth to her family life than we had known. A beautiful story."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"While this book did hold my interest and kept me wanting to know how it would all end, I turned the final page with a feeling of \\"What was that all about?\\" The chapters and plot are pieced together in a sort of ramshackle way that made it hard to really remember the important details along the way because there were simply too many parts that just didn't matter. Of course, this statement will only lead those who love this story to say that I don't possess the intelligence to comprehend the finer points of this book, but I know for a fact that this book is well below the standard of Tolkien's works, which I have read, and have had no trouble in following, understanding, or remembering.Character motivations were complete mysteries throughout the book and the ending is so rushed that it all ends before allowing the reader to truly understand what had actually transpired in the story and why. The dialogue is written in such a way that it almost seems the writer wanted to keep the reader in the dark about what or who they were actually talking about half the time.As for the humor found in the book, according to the other reviews here, you might be led to believe that you might be left with uncontrollable fits of laughter after reading through the text, but I don't particularly see what's so funny about an arrogant wizard and a stand-offish old woman constantly bickering with each other. Maybe my brand of preferred humor doesn't rest within the realm of \\"pure sillyness,\\" but that's essentially what this book is: sillyness."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I wish I would've read the book first before I seen the movie..maybe that would've changed my opinion of the book but still.....I say see the movie instead of reading the book...The book gets 2 stars because I LOVE HOWL'S CHARACTER. But Sophie was annoying at times. I wish Michael was Marco, the kid in the movie, he was much cuter. The book is boring and wasn't as creative as the movie AND the ending of the book was HORRIBLE. Everything was rushed. The author like crammed up everything..it was like she was sick of the book and just ended it because she gave up on it or something...it was the worst ending ever, it wasn't even worth reading like...so abrupt. The whole book was all suddenly concluded in like 1 chapter."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I saw the Hayao Miyazaki movie two weeks ago and fell in love with it before even fifteen minutes into it. It's one of my favorites, and I adore the English dubbing, which I find to be much better than the original Japanese version.So, since I love the movie so much, I figured I would like the book too. As soon as I got the novel yesterday I began reading it, but I was very disappointed. There was none of the charm and charisma of the movie, and the characters did not interact as well as they could have. Instead of being warm and inviting and protective of Sophie, Howl was a cold, distant playboy who took an instant dislike to the old woman and who spent most of his time chasing women. Michael the apprentice was gracious, but lacked personality, and Calcifer was not as funny or enjoyable as he was in the movie, although he did take special care of Sophie. And even though the book did have a happy ending, it just didn't feel complete.Personally, I say skip the book and watch Hayao Miyazaki's masterpiece. You will probably enjoy it much more. I know I did."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"In the town of Market Chipping in the land of Ingary, Sophie Hatter seems condemned to a boring and uneventful life, being the oldest of 3 sisters. Even her name seems to imprison her into running the family hat shop after her father dies, and her stepmother takes over the destinies of her and her two sisters, Lettie and Martha. While the other two move on to other lives, Sophie sits, working diligently with little reward and probably the future of being an unmarried spinster before her. That is, until the Witch of the Waste comes into her shop, and believing that Sophie has been rude to her, changes the young and pretty Sophie into an 90-something old crone. Not wishing to reveal what has happened to her to Lettie and Martha, she leaves the town and runs smack into the Moving Castle of Howl, a fearsome and supposedly woman-eating wizard! Along with his apprentice Michael, and the fire demon Calcifer, Sophie must learn how to break the spell on herself and also learn how to survive a close encounter with Howl himself.I came to this book after seeing and enjoying the anime version of this novel by the great Japanese director Miyazaki. I have to say that the novel suffered in comparison. Frankly, this novel was a little dull and lacked any suspense. The Witch of the Waste especially suffered from a lack of characterization. The motivations of the characters also seemed to lack any sense of urgency. \\"Oh well, I'm an old lady. No rush to change me back\\". \\"I'm enslaved by Howl, no rush to free me.\\" Sophie and Howl also acted like 5 year olds most of the time, being spiteful, hateful, and crude most of the time. I didn't like them. Flat out. Romance was completely dead here and the whole thing just puttered along with mediocre writing until it ended."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Some of this author's early books are entertaining even for adults in the same way Harry Potter is, but this book is very difficult to get through because of the nonsensical plot. You can feel the author trying very hard to make something out of an idea, and spinning out prose just for the sake of making a longer book, but it is a very very thin story. It was much better conceptualized as an animated film by Miyazaki (Studio Ghibli), also of the same title, because the film made much better use of the characters."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Like many others, I hunted this book down after watching Japanese animation master Hayao Miyazaki's film adaptation. Miyazaki's effort was an unanticipated disappoint in that it was a spectacular piece of work whose virtues made its flaws taste all the more sour. I desperately wanting to see the potential of the story realized.I'll say this much for Jones: her imagination isn't lacking, and this is a book brimming with ideas and spark. The book seems at times too insubstantial to sustain the break-neck rate at which the writer lays into the plot; and yet further down the same page, it will meander and lag, prompting me to thumb the remaining bulk impatiently.My major gripe with this book is that things were woefully underdeveloped. Neither of the two towns in which the story is set are described in any kind of detail. The Castle itself is sketchily rendered. As a result the book's atmosphere must rely on zany events, unpredictable (and often just plain weird) characters, and a lot of flash and bang. Jones's main problem lies in her description - the lack thereof. While she wildly tosses out the seeds of plot, character and theme (sometimes to our delightful, sometimes to our befuddlement), her poor narrative prevents the successful planting and maintenance of the garden. The fight scenes were further evidence of lazy writing. During a battle involving Howl and the Witch of the Waste, I found myself growing quickly bored with the clumsy pacing and weak imagery. I could cobble together only a vague picture of the action as Jones never attempted to delve below the dull surface of her descriptions.Sophie was a character that I never got very close to. She was often erratic and I couldn't get any sense of her. The whip-lash change from mousy recluse to fiery go-getter was nonsensical and hard to swallow. I can imagine that Jones hoped to communicate the instant transformation that came over Sophie - both physically and mentally - but again, underdevelopment meant we never knew Sophie to begin with and thus her change was bewildering. One minute she's a timid hat maker terrified of the outside world and resigned to an uneventful life, the next she's a fiery crone marching out into the Wastes in search of an evil witch, forcing her way into the Castle where she terrorizes its inhabbitants, cleans, and gets into numerous (contrived) arguements with Howl. The book's conclusion was a frantic tie-up that read more like a confused tangle where just about every fairy tale convention Jones could lay hands on was wedged in, thus flattening all the genre subvertion she'd been going for in the first place.In conclusion, although Jones's ideas were fresh, she did not have the skill to implement them to their fullest."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"The book came in the mail perfectly fine and not a single bit of harm but I was dissapointed with the packaging. It came in some sort of box flap, partially opened and I kept thinking of all the ways I could have had a damaged product from it. The box seemed frivolous and I new of many other different ways it could have been shipped easier and with much less expense on my behalf. I encourage buying from a different source when it comes to packaging and shipping costs."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I like to know what my 10 year old son is reading these days. His choices are the Harry Potter books, Captain Underpants, etc. This book looks on the surface to be a good choice for him, but once I got into the story it is more like a twisted romance novel for pre-teens. The sentences are short and choppy with oddly placed words. Story-wise, it is not bad, but CS Lewis or JK Rowling it is not."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"My friend and her relatives highly recommended this book to me. They called this book hilarious, creative, original, and they hailed D. Wayne Jones to be a genius. They said the characters were realistic than Harry Potter. I opened this book with very high hopes of reading the best book ever.After finishing, I felt like the I had been decieved. Surely they were joking! Where were the realistic characters? I didn't read about any. (How come Sophie didn't feel shocked by any of the magic? Why wasn't she in a hurry to change back? How come everyone is always so calm?) And what's up with the generic ideas? (\\"Old ladies act grouchy and thump their canes around.\\" The hero falls in love with the heroin, they've loved eachother all along, yaddy yaddo. Now, let's not make such a big deal about a guy who happens to be a playboy.) And what creativity? None of it is creative. It's just random ideas that have been squashed onto paper. They're like odds and bobs of beads that make an ugly necklace. And in the end, I felt like I must have skipped a few pages or something. There was no exciting and glorious ending.I'm disappointed. I would say that the characters in Potter are more realistic, since they get angry and all. Jones is not my heroic genius. I didn't laugh once throughout the whole book. My friend was not too happy when I told her the book was not what she brought me to expect.As a side note....I noticed that most people who like this book watched the movie first. They wove the characters and plot from the movie and the book together and came up with a better opinion. I've never seen the movie."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I enjoy reading fantasy fiction, including titles primarily intended for children, and I applaud the imagination of the author. A full-sized castle that roams the hillsides is a fascinating invention. The author's inclusion of some side trips into modern-day Wales, set in a Welsh-speaking household, were also interesting and commendable.Nevertheless, the poor character development, flimsy story lines, and impausible (if predictable) plot devices made Howl's Moving Castle a painful read at times. The book seems as though it was published before the final draft was ready, and it could use at least one more thorough edit. As a reader, I got the sense that the author felt that this was \\"only a kid's book\\" and that a feeble story with plenty of flash would be just fine.I would like to see Ms Jones match up her strong imagination with a more proven and compelling writer. Such a team could develop some truly wonderful storytelling!"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"As much as I love the movie this book is just simply amazing, it's so beautifully written and I couldn't put it down, if you haven't read it yet, it's about time you do."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"What a wonderful book.

It was fun and entertaining but it also had hidden messages within it. Such as Sophie's situation which showed me that you are to the world what you portray or think yourself to be. Even Howl said it to her, that \\"she\\" was the one preventing herself from changing back into a girl. Aside from that, it was a refreshing story that had me laughing like a mad woman. The banter between Howl and Sophie was always funny and crazy. However, their story--to me--was jammed in the midst of a whole lot of other things, such as her sisters, the Witch of the Waste etc...and I felt like it wasn't paid close attention too like it should have been, but then again it's a youth/young adult novel. The ending I adored but wondered if there was a stronger, more definite way to finish it.

She works at the family hat shop while her sisters go off to seek their fortunes in apprenticeships--until one day, when the Witch of the Waste comes to the hat shop and curses Sophie, turning her into an old lady. Sophie leaves the hat shop and her home town, searching for the cure to her curse and for her own fortune. Her journey takes her to the moving castle of the a fire demon, an apprentice wizard, and the Wizard Howl, who steals girls's hearts. A playful, fantastic, personal book, Howl's Moving Castle is a magical adventure story about very human journeys of coming of age, discovery of identity, and love. However, as the book progresses the plot becomes increasingly complex and muddled, detracting from the book's clarity in plot and meaning; the ending is abrupt and somewhat anticlimactic. Nonetheless, the book remains a fun, swift, and meaningful read, and I do recommend it.This book is of course the inspiration for Miyazaki's anime film of the same name. While the two have the same concept and many similar aspects, they differ as the plot progresses, and for once the film is actually better than the book: in the book, plot lines, character inclusion, and character growth are often too complex, confusing the story and approaching major themes, characters, and interactions in insufficient depth. In other words: the book lacks the broad narrative sweeps, limited cast, and tight plot of the film, and it suffers for it. This is perhaps most obvious in Howl's character and in the relationship between Sophie and Howl. As the book's protagonist, Sophie's character growth is subtle and well-developed, evolving throughout the book through slow and natural revelation. Unfortunately, the same natural, eventual growth does not exist elsewhere. Howl remains his vain, selfish, shallow self until the book's conclusion; the relationship between Sophie and Howl also remains argumentative and strained until the conclusion. There, in the length of a single chapter, Howl matures and they both realize their true feelings and begin their romantic relationship. Another downfall is the extensive cast. Many of the characters appear only briefly or very late, and become lost in a mess of names and short scenes. Do not mistake: the book is still easily readable, and the plot makes sense and resolves to a logical conclusion. But the plot and the character identities and developments are not as clear as they could be, and the book suffers for it: the story becomes muddled, and so the themes become muddled.Despite the muddled plot, many other aspects of the book shine like diamonds. From the premise, to the characters (at least the better developed ones), to the lively sense of humor, to the land and magic of Ingary, Jones creates a colorful, vivid, truly human story. There is a certain amount of playful irreverence to every aspect of the book: Howl is a beautiful man who seduces beautiful women--and spends two hours in the bathroom every day. Sophie turns from a dull young woman into a batty old lady, taking out her frustrations by vicious house cleaning and calling even Calcifer the fire demon \\"young.\\" The book's setting is similarly off kilter and playful: Howl's moving castle, which frightens Sophie's city, is the same castle that Howl uses to run away from girls, identities, and obligations; in the land of Ingary, magic is at once part of life (so Sophie is entirely unsurprised by her curse) and complete unexpected (so she is frightened of the cursed the scarecrow that chases the castle). Jones exhibits a rare sense of humor. Nothing--not suffering, not journeys, not love--is taken too seriously, and so her book is continually amusing, but at the same time, everything is meaningful--brief plot points come back at the end of the story, and the humorous, faulted characters do go on to immense personal growth. This unusual and delicate combination makes for a book that is funny, colorful, and always a joy to read, but is at the same time intensely authentic, human, and meaningful.I hugely adore the Miyazaki film based on this book, so I will admit that I was disappointed to see how different the film and book are, and even more disappointed that (as very rarely happens) the film is in this case a better story. Nonetheless, I was delighted by Howl's Moving Castle, and I do recommend it. There are some definite faults, and the book is ultimately too complex, muddled, and abrupt, but it remains a delightful read. Jones's style is a pleasure, her characters are faulted, funny, and ultimately realistic, and Sophie's journey--through places, meeting people, and finally discovering herself--makes for a truly wonderful story. This book was not everything I hoped it would be, but I'm still glad I had a chance to read it. It is a young adult title, but I recommend it to all readers. Any age group can and will appreciate the humanity and humor of this text."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Few authors besides Diana Wynne Jones would venture into the satirical fantasy genre and attempt to make it rich and meaningful. But Diana Wynne Jones does just that, showcasing not her full brilliance but just enough to make \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" a classic among the light-hearted fantasy genre.Sophie Hatter is the eldest of three daughters, toiling away in her deceased father's hat shop. In the land of Ingary, it is considered unwise for the eldest to go off and seek for their fortune, so the timid Sophie is content to stay in her hat shop forever. All of this changes when the angry Witch of the Waste shows up in Sophie's shop and turns Sophie cruelly into a ninety year old woman! Sophie than ventures to the moving castle of the dangerous Wizard Howl, hoping he can help her with her spell. Soon, the old Sophie finds herself tangled up into the affairs of Howl, the Witch of the Waste, a fire demon named Calcifer, and the King of Ingary that all somehow connects to a dangerous contract made between Howl and Calcifer.Jones's trademark quirky writing style is evident throughout the story. There are tons of little magical details (such as a door that acts as a portal to four different dimensions) that give the story it's \\"extra spark\\", as Calcifer would say. Jones's characters are again ingenious. Sophie is timid in the beginning and not until after her aging does her true, somewhat fiesty, self come out. Howl is charming, immature, loveable, and unbearable all at the same time. And calicfer is quietly as entertaining as he is mysterious. However, sometimes the story's plotting is a bit lose, such as the ending, but even a mediocre Jones is still brilliant. All readers will recognize Jones's message that outward appearences mean nothing, which runs deep throughout the whole book, and it is this brilliance that makes the story something special.\\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" at its heart is a satirical fantasy, making fun of all the genre's accepted standards and rules. But Jones's adept attention to detail, characters, and story makes the book someting much more meaningful. While not her best work, \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" is still a highly recommended tale for those readers looking for a witty, romantic, and magical read."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"\\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" is the best Diana Wynne Jones book I've read. She is one of my all time favorite fantasy writers. I have about 10 of her books, and I'm building up my collection. \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" is about Sophie Hatter, the eldest daughter of three. When her father dies, her step-mother sends the other two daughters, Lettie and Martha, to be apprenticed. Sophie stays home, to help in the hat shop. (her father was a hatter)One day, Sophie is selling hats, and the Witch of the Waste comes in. The Witch of the Waste is a terrifying old witch who lived in the Waste, a huge desert. Sophie offers her hats, but the witch is not pleased. She turns Sophie into an old lady.Sophie does not want her mother and sisters to see her as an old lady, and she was getting tired of her life in the hat shop. She sets out to seek her fortune, and finds plenty of excitement.She finds the castle of the Wizard Howl, a wizard with a BAD reputation. She first meets his apprentice, Michael. She also meets Calcifer, Howl's fire demon. Calcifer tells her that he and Howl had a contract, and asks her to break it: it was not good for him or for Howl. However, Calcifer can not tell Sophie what the contract is. In exchange, Calcifer will try to break the spell on Sophie.Sophie becomes Howl's cleaning lady as an excuse to find out about the contract. She meets Howl, a funny, lazy, \\"slither-outer\\" wizard. She gradually comes to enjoy her life in the castle, despite her exasperation with Howl, which is hilarious.I don't want to tell everyone the ending, but I'll drop some hints for the curious. Sophie finds that Howl isn't the only one with magic, learns about the contract, and eventually confronts the Witch of the Waste head on.\\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" is one of the best books I've ever read. I lent it to all of my friends, and they all loved it too. I've read it again and again, and I still find it interesting and funny every single time. If you like the book, it has a sequel, which is called \\"The Castle in the Air\\". It isn't as good as \\"Howl's Moving Castle,\\" but it's still a fairly good book.

There's something about this book, that makes me go weak at the knees.It's a fantasy world but the characters are all too familiar, their fatal flaws are so human and annoyingly understandable that you can't hate them no matter how desperately you want to. Howl makes me love him, he literally forces me to love him and wish that he were real when he's only portrayed as selfish and vain; things that should make me detest him. I mean, seriously, I named my cat after him.But apart from the fact that I'm seriously in love with Howl and Sophie, I love the plot line and that it's complicated and you don't pick it before it's revealed, but it isn't overdone and it makes sense in the end. And even though you want more when it's over it's because it was a seriously good read, not because there wasn't enough in the novel.I cannot tell you how many times I have read this novel, and I have to admit, seen the anime based on it. I actually saw the anime first and it was only in a special feature on the dvd that I realised that it had been a book first, and being one of those types of people I instantly needed to read it. And was so wonderfully surprised when the book was a hundred times better than the anime. I feel as if the two works stand side by side, different paths for similar themes and characters. The anime's Howl is much more redeemable than the book's Howl, because Howl isn't quite as flawed in the anime but the imagery that accompanies the story makes the anime a beautiful experience.Whereas the book is meatier and cleverer, and is a real book. A book that you know was written to be a book, not one of so many that are written these days in the hopes that it will get picked up and made into a movie. It's an old fashioned story, meant to be read and savoured.Diana Wynne Jones (in the words of my niece) is my fav'rit!"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I have adored the Hayao Miyazaki's interpretation of Howl's Moving Castle for years. I must know the movie in its entirety by heart now. With that said, I cannot tell you how ashamed I am that I didn't know this was a book first (something I normally always check first) until a few years ago. When I found out I actually refused to read it for so long because I was afraid that the book was going to be monumentally better and I wouldn't get the same good feeling I did when I watched my favorite movie. (That's forgivable right?) Well, it wasn't until this last month that I ran out of books that interested me that I finally worked up the nerve and bought Diana Wynne Jones' Howl's Moving Castle.My fear came true in a sense, I loved every word.I found this book very difficult to put down, and went I got about halfway through I immediately went and ordered the sequel. I found the characters quite different from those I already love. Sophie is so witty and despite how she would get down on herself she was very strong (that whole inner strength thing right?). She wasn't intimidated by Howl and they way they would go back and forth at each other made their entire relationship so much better. Howl, is a selfish, childish, lazy (but works hard to be lazy if that makes sense), yet entirely loveable wizard who, yes, I did manage to fall a little in love with. All the characters are well developed and the story is strong. Though if I had a negative, toward the end I did get a little confused as everything was playing out.So, is my love for the movie totally sabatoged? Not at all. I found Miyazaki's film, while it has all the same characters and setting, the plot lines are very different. Yes, Sophie is turned into an old woman and finds her way into Howl's castle but other than that there are very few other similarities. Which as it turns out I like, I get a fantastic movie and two books and it all feels like 3 different stories to me.As for recommending it to others, go for it. As it turns out I had just finished the entire Harry Potter series (I know like 10 years later) before I read this and as I was reading through I couldn't help but think that maybe, just maybe J.K. Rowling might have read this book at one point in her life. That's my sneaking suspicion anyway. All I know is that the magic and fantasy of Howl's Moving Castle gave me a very Harry Potter feel. But that's just me.To wrap things up, I have a new favorite. Which is saying something because I'm often hard to please book wise (I'm very picky, can't help it), but I'm very much looking forward to reading this again very soon (which is also saying something because I hardly ever read the same book more than once)."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Howl's Moving Castle (1986) is a standalone Fantasy novel. It is set in the Kingdom of Ingary. The royal wizard and the king's brother have both disappeared within the Waste.In this novel, Sophie Hatter is the stepdaughter of Fanny Hatter. Sophie is oldest of three sisters. Naturally, she realizes that she will never win a prince. Yet she is good natured and better at making her sisters mind than her stepmother.Lettie Hatter is the second stepdaughter of Fanny Hatter. She also knows that she will not win a prince.Martha Hatter is the daughter of Fanny Hatter. All know that she will probably win a prince.Howl is a wizard who lives in a moving castle. He has a very bad reputation.Michael is an orphan who was allowed into Howl's home. Now he is Howl's apprentice.Calcifer is a fire demon. He has a contract with Howl.The Witch of the Waste is a very evil person. Even Howl is afraid of her.In this story, Fanny cannot afford to keep the girls in school after their father dies. Sophie had just graduated and was ready to move on, but Lettie and Martha had to drop out. Fanny gets Martha apprenticed to Mrs. Fairfax, the local witch and Lettie apprenticed to the bakery shop.Sophie was trained to take over the hattery. She already knew most everything about the shop and took over trimming the hats. She worked long hours and spent most of her time talking to the hats.The hats she trimmed were well received and attracted the attention of marriageable men. One customer married a count and the Mayor's wife has very contented with her own. Yet Sophie was working very hard and going nowhere.Sophie wants to visit her sisters, but keeps putting off the trip. Then on May Day, she goes to visit Lettie at the bakery. Yet the sister she finds is Martha. She had swapped places with Lettie and both were much happier. Still, Martha says that Fanny is exploiting Sophie.Then the Witch of the Waste comes into the hattery one evening and curses Sophie. The girl grows old and gets the aches and pains of the aged. So Sophie leaves the shop and goes out into the night.While she is wandering, she frees a scarecrow from a hedge. Later she cuts a trapped dog from another hedge. At least she gets a walking stick out of that encounter.When she gets to the top of the cliff overlooking the town, she discovers a tall, thin, black and ugly castle rumbling toward her. Sophie imagines a warm hearth inside and orders the castle to stop. She hobbles up to it and tries to reach the door, but something keeps her away.She walks around the castle and finally finds a door that she can reach. The castle starts moving again and she hits the door with her stick. The door pops open and Sophie gets one leg through the door. Then she pulls herself inside.Michael is standing just inside the door. He is only a little older than Martha. Sophie pushes him aside and dives into a chair. Her aches and pains are worse after all the walking and the chair is blissfully comfortable.Sophie notices that something is moving in the grate. It is Calcifer eating the logs that Michael has provided. Sophie later converse with Calcifer and agrees to break his contract if he will release her from the old age spell.Sophie starts cleaning the castle, despite vehement comments from both Howl and Michael. Howl orders her not to touch his room or the back yard. Everything else is finally spick and span.This tale puts Howl into a bind between the King and the Witch of the Waste. The King wants Howl to find his brother. The Witch wants to have Calcifer.Sophie was fairly timid as a girl, but now she is a cranky old lady. The sequel to this novel isHouse of Many Ways.Highly recommended for Jones fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of magical arts, kingdom politics, and a bit of romance. Read and enjoy!-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I have fond memories of the Chrestomanchi series, so I decided to give this series a try. It has been over 10 years since I read the Chrestomanchi series and I remember a very exciting, well-written, and creative story. This story was creative, perhaps a bit exciting....and it could have been told slightly better. You think that if something bad happened to you that completely changed you, you would be up in arms 24/7. Sophie the heroine of the story is sometimes and isn't others; I found that a bit hard to relate too. The other characters are a bit mysterious and we don't seem to develop strong feelings for them. However, the way the story turns out is really good...it kind of happens fast though and is pretty unexpected/expected. at times. I wish the ending had been smooth out into 10 more pages....it would have been more clear then. I haven't seen the movie, so I am not coming from that pov. I think the really big ending happens within 1 page of the book and it leaves you going ahh??? So I found that a bit frustrating (maybe that is all her stories, I don't know.)"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I enjoyed this book immensely! I have owned the movie for a few years now and after so many times watching the film it became my favorite of the Studio Ghibli films available. I had to read the book and have wanted to for quite a while. I consider the book and the movie two different animals but like them each(very much so) individually. I kind of like that they were different from one another. While reading, I still had the SG images in my head with DWJ's characters."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I bought the book because I didn't know that it was a book before it was a movie. But I like to read book that have been made into movies to see how close to the original they have keep the story and to better understand the characters.In the book the characters are slightly to drastically different to the movie. The story takes on different paths also. Where in the movie the main plot is finding out about Howl and how he became so powerful, the book deals more with Sophie's power and how she learns that she is a witch.I really liked the book and had a lot of fun reading it. But on the Kindle version I felt that Amazon was trying to get me to buy other books by the author, Diana Wynne Jones. Over half of the Kindle file was first chapters of several of her other books. So when I finished reading Howl and still had 50% of the file left to read, I felt let down when I realized that the book had ended without me knowing that it was the end.Don't misunderstand it was a good ending and I liked how it ended, but seeing that I was only halfway through the file made me think that there was more chapters to go and I would get to learn more about the character I came to like and care for and learn more about this amazing world they live in.Of the other books that they put first chapters in the file, they didn't but should have put the first chapters of the sequel's to Howl's walking castle, to make the reader want to carry on reading and learning more about this realm where Howl makes his home, but they didn't.Over all the Book was very good and fun to read, and when my children are older I will read it to them, and let them watch the movie. But on the Kindle file the end of the book will come to fast leaving you think that there is a lot more to read and not realize that you have finished the book already."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I was very happy about the condition of the book and incredibly fast shipping!I love the book, must have read it like 3 times within a two-period week. I love how Howl is portrayed (which is a bit different from the movie) and Sophie as well. It was nice to read further character development for all. Great buy!"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I am one of those who loves the movie version of the story, but often I've thought there were several pieces of the story missing in the movie. Therefore I decided to read the book and all of those pieces fell into place. I am a huge fan of many Juvinile Literature books and this one is very, very good. The writing is tight and suspenseful, without being scary, and the characters are fun with minor flaws. After completing the book, I much prefer it to the movie.I purchased the Kindle version and there are some mistakes, missing quotation marks and indentations that are too far over, but otherwise it was a very good publication."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"The story is a fun read for adults and kids. It is different enough from the movie that you will not know what to expect after having seen the animated film. I loved both the movie and the book."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Wonderful book with a richly drawn world, charming characters, and an engrossing plot that's appealing to adults and young adults alike. This is a real masterpiece that only gets better on rereading."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Like many others who read Howl's Moving Castle before me, I wanted to read this book because I loved Miyazaki's animation based on it - who wouldn't? It's extraordinary! And I was so, so happy when I realized I was loving the book just as I loved the movie, even if both versions can, at times, seem different stories. I think Sophie is a lovely, perfect heroine, and Howl is just to cute for words. I'm eagerly waiting for the next two books in this series to arrive in my mailbox, even if they don't have Howl and Sophie as protagonists, for I really enjoyed DWJ's writing and will surely read a lot more books from her. &lt;3"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"A really fantastic story in theme. Jones's novel is full of fun magic and fantasy suitable for all ages, yes even adults, but I found her pacing to be a little off. It was fun to see how Sophie came to cope with living with Howl in a magic castle, and more importantly to see how her relationship with Howl himself unfolds, but I have to admit, I felt no real mystery from this book. Jones doesn't really build up revelations or secrets very well, in fact I hardly cared at all about what any of the characters were hiding. I was much more interested in their personalities. So when push came to shove and the truth is out in the last 15 or so pages, I was confused and disinterested.In spite of these somewhat strong criticisms, I think that again, the strength of the book lies in its characters. I really like Sophie a lot. She's perhaps only the second fictional woman I fell in love with (the first being Elphaba). She's very strong, witty and independent, a strong female lead character that sheds none of her intimacy or tenderness in her assertiveness. She's devious, but at the same time overwhelmingly kind and deferential, and in spite of the fantasy and magic going on around her, she's incredibly real. I think she can do much better than Howl."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Why I read this: When I heard that the amazing Diana Wynne Jones had passed, I decided it was time to read the books I had been meaning to for some time. And this was one of them. I loved the animated movie and figured the book would be even better.Plot: Sophie is definitely not the luckiest girl. In fact, she doesn't seem all that mad when she gets turned into an old woman. Then she ends up in the incredible moving castle of Howl, a supposedly evil wizard who steals away and kills young maidens. But there's more behind Howl and the reason his castle is floating. I really can't say too much about this plot other than it is absolutely magical. I just loved it.Characters: Howl is possibly the most interesting character I've read in a long time. He's quirky and moody and seems not all together there. Sophie herself makes an interesting old woman and it's her voice that we view the book through. I just love all of Jones' characters. They're so unique and wonderful, even the bad ones.Relatability: Fans of high fantasy with well-developed characters will be begging for more of her books after reading this one. For such a long book it read rather fast as well.Cover Commentary: There's so many covers of this book, it's insane. I really quite like the one I have. It's a bit brighter than some of the others. Not sure if that's how I quite pictured the castle though."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"This is one of my favorite books. I have been waiting for this to come on Kindle for the last two years! The kindle however needs editing. Even that slight annoyance still a great read and a good companion to the Movie however are not exactly related. I am so thankful its finally out. I love how Diane Wynn Jones writes its very comfortable. I don't find it just ended like some reviewers stated. I feel it fit perfectly to the book. I recommend anyone who is into fantasy give this a try!"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"This was a fun little book. It's easy to read, admittedly, it's a little predictable, but it is a \\"young reader.\\" If you enjoy fantasy even a little you will enjoy this bit of \\"brain candy.\\" Most of the characters were well developed. There were multiple plot lines that were nicely woven into each other. My only real critique is that the book ends rather abruptly. It's almost as if the author was pushing a deadline or simply got tired of writing. Otherwise a delightful read."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"About the Book:In this folklore like book, Sophie has already determined she is doomed to fail since she is the eldest of three children so it seems to be only fair that she is going to be the one to be stuck with tending the hat shop. It could be much worse, and worse it becomes when the evil Witch of the Waste comes to visit the hat shop and places a terrible curse on Sophie. This curse ends up turning Sophie into a ninety year old woman, unable to tell anyone about the curse. Sophie then ends up at the castle of Howl, a wizard known for eating young girls' hearts, and there she meets Calcifer, a fire demon who has a contract with Howl. Calcifer ends up noticing the spell on Sophie and says he will remove her curse if she figures out how to break the contract between Cal and Howl, which is just the beginning of Sophie's magical journey.Review:I originally found this book from the Miyazaki film. Having loved the movie, I wanted to read the book, and I was not disappointed. Although I still think the movie is excellent, I found the book more wonderful. Jones did an excellent job of mixing both adventure and humour into her world. Also, the head nods toward the general fantasy genre are excellent, such as how Sophie is doomed to fail since she is the eldest. The characters are also fun, and you get a great sense of them without going into nitpicking details yet there is enough details that the character isn't bland or boring. The plot was a page turner through out, even if you have seen the movie. There are plenty of twists, some which are fairly clear to see and others that jump out at you, such as where the black portal leads. I seriously cannot recommend this book enough. It's an easy read with a punch that both kids and adults can enjoy. Jones can bet that I will be picking up more of her books in the future."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I saw the animated version first and fell in love with it. I thought, this is so wonderful I can skip the read (and I did) for some time, but then I bought it, and it sat on my bookshelf for longer. Then a day ago I picked it up and couldn't put it down. I sat in the kitchen in a chair till 3:30 in the morning. I woke up a few hours later (red eyed)and although my eyes stung I reached for the book and staggered into an easy chair. It went on my daily rounds and when I was at the doctor's office people bent down in front of my book (while I laughed harder than I had since I can't remember) to read the title of the book. I didn't even acknowledge their presence. It didn't matter. I was only somewhat there. Most of me was at Howl's watching Sophie (who has so much more to her in the book). She has some issues of worth, but she's much stronger, funny, opinionated! Speed Boots and Weed-Killer (don't say I didn't warn you)! There is an extra sister (the movie ommited) as well as having greatly altered personalities to fit their own version. I still love the movie, but you do your mind a great disservice if you overlook reading this exceptional treat! I look forward to reading the other two in the series by Diana Wynne Jones. If it's anything like this one I will be sleepless and laughing hard!"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Howl's Moving Castle is a brilliant book, well on its way to becoming a classic. With its spare language and dense content it's like a poem. With its suggestions, hints, and wickedly unreliable narrator, it's like a puzzle. With its allusions both overt and subtle, it's a gateway book: Jones sends the reader out of the story world to visit or re-visit everything from Donne, Shakespeare, and Austen to folklore, botany, and rugby songs (which, as this reader has learned, can be really, really raucous). These forays are worth the effort. You return to HMC with better understanding of bookish Sophie, vain Howl, stern but loving Mrs. Pentstemmon, and the rest.But as Calcifer, Howl's enigmatic fire demon, suggests, you really do have to watch and listen carefully. Otherwise you might breeze right past what is really going on emotionally behind Howl's and Sophie's frantic teasing, bantering, arguing, sulking, cleaning, courting, \\"exploiting,\\" slithering out, slicing suits to ribbons in fits of jealousy, and so on. Very deftly, Jones demonstrates the real pain that both characters bring to the story. Part of solving the puzzle is in realizing that Howl and Sophie each have strong defenses and idiosyncratic, often very funny, ways of dealing with feelings and drives for which they are not prepared. Howl's Moving Castle is, after all, the fairy-tale romance of a young woman who emotionally is an old woman, and a young man who emotionally is a boy.Depending on the reader's age and perspective, it is also a clear-eyed look at marriage in all its aspects, from the mundane--washing dishes and cleaning toilets--to the mystical--both partners' dead-on capacity to heal one another's deepest psychic wounds, all the while driving each other stark raving bananas.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I stumbled on Diana Wynne Jones by way of her Chrestomanci Chronicles, and really, I think this book was much better! It was a magical tale about Sophie, a girl with so much to offer but because of her poor self-image and an ecounter with a witch, becomes a cursed old lady. Sophie thinks that the terrible wizard Howl might be able to help her break the curse, and even though she is fearful of him, she figured he wouldn't prey on her since she is such an old lady.I'm afraid I haven't done the book justice with my poor summary of the plot, but the book is enchanting - both because the plot is exciting, but also because Diana has a great storytelling voice and her ideas are very fresh (even thhough they are over a decade old.)Most of all, her characters are laughably funny, especially Howl himself. I love it that he expresses himself in slime!I have yet to see the movie, so I don't know how the book compares. I can't imagine that the movie could be as good... there's just so much that a movie couldn't capture properly, but I'll reserve judgement until I actually see it. This is a must for lovers of innocent fantasy."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I consider myself picky about the books I like....This one was right up my alley. While trying to find books to fill the void while waiting for the next Harry Potter to come out, my nephew told me about Howl. I was surprised that it was written in 1987 (which would put me in highschool) and I'd never heard of it before. Well, I loved it. It has a little of everything....romance, humor, mystery and lots of magic!Sophie is the oldest of 3 sisters and therefore (in her mind) doomed to a life of bad luck and boredom. She accepts her fate as a hat maker in her family's shop until the dreaded Witch of the Waste visits her store and in a fit of temper, turns Sophie into an old woman and furthermore the curse won't allow Sophie to tell anyone what happened to her.Sophie has no choice but to leave the shop and seek her fortune. She decides to go to Wizard Howl (A handsome and powerful, but incredibly conceited wizard who lives in a castle that is fueled by a fire demon) in hopes that he can remove the spell.Howl is the most interesting character. He is vain and selfish and just when you think you hate him, he turns kind and compassionate. By the end of the book, you can see how Sophie falls in love with him. They are a perfect match for each other.The book can be complicated for younger readers (I even found myself re-reading particularly difficult chapters to make sure I had grasped them) I also found myself coming up with questions that don't seem to be answered in the book. However, all in all, I thought the book was imaginitive and entertaining. It's full of colorful characters and creative plots!"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I watched the film version of this book first.

I was super excited when I heard that someone made a movie of it, but was a little sad to see how much the characters I know and love have been changed. The movie is good as a separate entity but the book is amazing. Someone said in one of the reviews that Howl is a playboy, but he's under a spell for the majority of the book. Also the characters DO get angry, how can someone even say that after reading Howl's reaction to his unfortunate hair disaster (well it was for him). The emotions are very real, the characters believable, and this is quite possibly one of my favorite books.I highly recommend it, and the movie too. But do yourself a favor and read the book first."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I approached Howl's Moving Castle with a little bit of skepticism. It had been a long time since I had read any \\"young adult\\" books, and I worried about the quality of the writing and the story. Plus, this was my first Diana Wynne Jones book. Turns out all my fears were misplaced. Howl's Moving Castle, like Jones' other works, is pure magic. The characters glow with a life and truth that is lacking in many other \\"adult\\" novels. The story is at once gripping and hilarious, moving and light-hearted.Howl is the true star of this story. His self-absorbed personality and overly-sensitive antics are absolutely brilliant.Classic."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Diana Wynne Jones, Howl's Moving Castle (Greenwillow, 1986)I admit it-- I have fallen completely under the spell of Diana Wynne Jones. Howl's Moving Castle is a delight of a fantasy novel, taking things that should be predictable and making them not so (as in, you're saying \\"I should have known that was coming\\" at least ten times as you read it).Sophie Hatter, the eldest of the Hatter sisters, is convinced that she's destined for failure because, well, she's the eldest. Her father dies suddenly, and her not-so-wicked stepmother inherits the business, giving Sophie an apprenticeship and sending her two sisters off to apprenticeships with other artisans (a baker and a witch) in order to make ends meet. Sophie manages to offend the Witch of the Waste, a rather all-around nasty sort, and gets cursed. In order to get the curse lifted, she makes a desperate attempt to throw in her lot with the wizard Howl, whose moving castle (you knew that was coming, right?) putters around the outskirts of Market Chipping, the town in which Sophie lives, despite the widespread rumors that Howl like to eat girls' souls...This is great stuff. Young adult fantasy that, like all good young adult material, is sure to hold the interest of adults as well. Jones' writing style is (for want of a better term) sprightly, and keeps the pages turning, and the characters are quite well-formed. (If there is a place where the book dips, it's that Jones does a bit more telling of the characters' emotions than showing, though she does offset the effect by couching it oftentimes in amusing dramatic monologues).If you haven't yet become a fan of Diana Wynne Jones, this is a fine place to start, especially with the recent film adaptation (by no less a personage than Hayao Miyazaki) getting ready for release in the western market. ****"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Hold on a second while I tie my gaping-in-awe-and-amazement mouth shut. Howl's Moving Castle is by far the best book I have read of Diana Wynne Jones. Though it may lack the depth of books such as Dark Lord of Derkholm or the intricasies of plot as Hexwood, this book is an absolute blast to read. This book that so obviously ridicules fairy tales had me in stitches. Sophie's stubbornness and Howl's mockery of Prince Charming among other things made me love them. And who could forget such a notorious character as Calcifur who reminds me of a pouty child but endears himself to you nonetheless. Incredibly surprising and absurdly wonderful, I will love this book forever."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"The first book I bought by Diana Wynne Jones was the first volume of The Chronicles of Chrestomanci.

I have given copies to my sister (age 60), and, yes, my granddaughter, age 13.These books transport the reader to magical worlds, filled with fascinating characters and page-turning plots.Do yourself a favor, buy one of her books (I haven't found a one that I would not recommend!) - then settle back and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"A review by ChrisSophie's dad was not able to support all the kids in his family so he found some people to take Sophie's sisters.

One day the witch of the waste came and put a spell on Sophie and the only person the could take the spell off is Howl. She goes to Howl and she stays. They go through many hardships. She finds it hard to leave the castle.I only gave this book 2 Stars because the author tells the story in way too many words. I think that the story could have been told in 100 words or less. The plot of the story didn't go anywhere. The story just went on and on. If you took out all but the last 3 chapters you would get most of the story. The story doesn't progress rapidly toward the climax. The author tell way more details that I think was needed. The conflict do not seem realistic because you can not have a witch come into the store and have her turn you old. The ending of the story has a fairy tail ending because everyone is happy and the bad guys are dead, which is disappointing, I think, in a horror story.I don't recommend this book to anyone because it just goes on and on about everything.

They live in a village in a land where everyone knows what happens to each of three sisters who set out to seek their fortunes in the world, and Sopihe, the eldest of the three, has no desire to experience it.So, as one sister is apprenticed to a tavern owner, and one to a witch, Sophie stays behind in the family hat store and makes hats. Her hats soon become something of a rage, and all is doing well until the local Wicked Witch drops by, says a few things that don't make any sense (at that point) and casts a spell on Sophie. One which makes her old and prevents her from taling anyone who she is or what's happened to her.And so Sophie DOES set out to find her fortune (more or less), and winds up knocking on the door of the Moving Castle of the title -- which belongs to Howl the wizard.&quot;Heartless&quot; Howl, who is said to charm young ladies and then eat their hearts.Who, of course, turns out to be both everything and nothing that Sophie had expected.And she meets Howl's apprentice and his captive fire demon, with whom she makes a bargain...Ths is a book to read and read again and read some more, just to savour the tasty bits. You almost have to read it the second time -- which is not at all difficult to do -- because you have to go back and see how the bits you thought meant one thing actually meant something completely different.Magic and love and adventure and betrayal and rescues and slapstick comedy and truth and lies and Just Plain Fun... All between two covers, for the price of one book.Too bad ALL of DWJ's books aren't available in mass-market editions in this country..."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Never has there been another book like this! And there never will be, either. Instead of a pretty young girl there is an old hag called Sophie that OUGHT to be a pretty young girl if life had been fair. But it's not, and what else can you expect when you're the eldest of three sisters. But maybe Sophie should thank God she's not young anymore, because when she goes out to find her fortune she ends up in a castle with Howl, a Casanova wizard who, according to his reputation, eats young girls' hearts. The reputation is exaggerated, but Howl will do anything to have people believe in it. If they don't believe it, they might think he's GOOD, and then he'll have to do really good and dangerous things. Howl is the biggest coward you have ever found as a protagonist in a book, and Sophie is the biggest bitch. And they're both lovely, as is the whole book. Read it, read it, read it!"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Howl's Moving Castle by Wynne Jones starts with an ordinary girl on an ordinary day. Sophie, the eldest of two sisters, lived in the small town of Market Chipping. She worked in a hat shop trimming hats in a dusty alcove and wished for something better to do. When closing the hat shop one day, Sophie ran into a terrible witch who turned her into a small, wrinkly, ninety-year-old-woman! And part of this curse was that she couldn't explain it to anyone!So Sophie left the hat shop, afraid to face her family. She headed out of town and traveled far from the hat shop she knew. Sophie then encountered Wizard Howl who was afraid of commitment and who used different systems to wiggle and squirm his way out of responsibilities. He even avoids tasks from the king himself! Sophie was inclined to leave this cowardly wizard, that is, until she noticed Howl's fire demon named Calcifer, who was stuck in Howl's fire place like a tree rooted to the ground. If Sophie could set Calcifer free, then he would break her curse!See what will happen in this funny, different, amazing book! It's one of my favorite books because it's very unique, and magic isn't the main part of the story. It doesn't have mystical creatures or wands. This story teaches you to appreciate who you are, and shows the bonds that form between people. I would recommend this book to anyone to anyone above eight. I have found that girls somewhat relate to it better than boys. Wynne Jones is very clever in the way she gets you hooked!"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"A fantastically funny tale of witches, wizards, demons and magic, all rolled up into an entertaining book for all ages. If you've seen the movie of the same name, you should note that there were many changes in the story on the way to animation, but the book remains the better version.Sophie Hatter has the misfortune of being the eldest of three sisters, and in her mind she is resigned to spending her entire life in the hat shop, talking to the hats. One day she incurs the wrath of the evil Witch of the Waste, who casts a spell on Sophie, turning her into an old lady with an attitude.As the story goes, Sophie takes off by herself before anybody sees her wrinkles or hears her joints creaking, and ends up installing herself as housekeeper in the weird castle belonging to the Wizard Howl, whom it is rumored eats the hearts of beautiful young women. Here she meets a fire demon named Calcifer and strikes a bargain with him regarding breaking the spells that hold them both captive. She also meets Michael, Howl's young apprentice, and between them they keep the castle running (sometimes literally) while the vain and fickle Howl prowls about his multi-dimensional domain, courting various young ladies who catch his fancy.When a prince goes missing, the King orders Howl to find him, as well as another missing wizard, and while he's at it, to kill the Witch of the Waste. Howl is reluctant to extend that much energy, and besides he has personal reasons why he shouldn't go anywhere near the witch, so he sets up Sophie to pose as his mother and make excuses to the king why he isn't the wizard for the job.To make a long story short, his plan backfires and Howl realizes he has his work cut out for him. Sophie also has to figure out how to free Calcifer, and get back her girlish figure, while the moving castle keeps doing its thing.Highly recommended for young readers with imagination.Amanda Richards, October 7, 2006"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Howl's Moving Castle has become a well known Japanese anime movie. But before it was a film it was a wonderful novel by Diana Wynne Jones. The main character, is Sophie, a girl turned into an old lady by a jealous witch. Sophie has to leave the Hat shop and her life behind to try to seek a cure to her curse. Her journey is in a land where almost anything is possible. Magical boots, fire demons, spoken spells, dirty castles and lots of eggs. Wow, Howl needs to go on a diet.329 pages of delight. Much more detailed than the film and different also. Just because you saw the movie does not mean you should skip the novel. And if you have finished the book get the movie."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I go to any Miyazaki movie and so went to see Howl's Moving Castle. The movie ended up quite confusing in places and when I discovered that he'd gotten the story here I bought the novel.Ms. Jones' writing is superb, her imagination impecable and her sense of wonder intact after all these years. While not The Hobbit or Redwall, it is a fine story with more depth perhaps than the other two.However, be sure to see the movie first else you'll be quite disappointed since it doesn't follow the book very closely and loses a lot for that reason."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"For those of you that are interest in Harry Potter or Narnia or any young reader fantasy books, &quot;Howl's Moving Castle&quot; by Diana Wynne Jones is something you don't want to miss. What can we say about Howl's Moving Castle? Well, its got action, where many battles between Howl the wizard and the Witch of the Waste. Its got humour, consider a fire demon is afraid of the old lady Sophie. It is cool, great characters and surprising events you won't expect. This is one of the book I was reading during the disaster of September 11, and the book really cheered me up. Believe me, if you live 6 blocks away from the World Trade Center and can't get back to your apartment for 14 days, you wouldn't like to get any more depress than that.A surprising news is that an Animation Studio in Japan called &quot;Studio Ghibli&quot; (the same studio that made Princess Mononoke, My Neighbor Totoro, and Kiki's Delivery Service), they have got the right from Diana W. Jones to make an animated motion picture adoption of the novel. Something there to get you reading!"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I first read this book in sixth grade, years ago, and I have loved it ever since. For anyone looking for a synopsis/summary, it is about the eldest of three sisters, Sophie, living in a land called Ingary. Sophie thinks that her life will be boring and predictable, but the introduction of a castle, a temperamental wizard named Howl, a fire-demon named Calcifer, and the Witch of the Waste ensure the opposite. Sophie becomes directly entangled in the whole business by a curse put on her by the Witch of the Waste.I think that I have given away too much already, so I'll only say now that Jones does a fine job of pulling together an intricately and beautifully woven plot. If you read it, you will enjoy it, and I recommend Castle in the Air (title correct?)afterward if you want to see a little more of Sophie and Howl, though Howl's Moving Castle was the better of the two. If you like fantasy with a twist, you'll like this book."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I just re-read this book for about the twentieth time. And I have to say its one of those stories that is so enjoyable and so imaginative that it belongs in any serious fantasy collection. Sophie and Howl are some of the most lovable--and most human fantasy characters I've run into in a long time. When I read this at twelve, I must admit the romance arc of the story completely missed me, now it's one of my favorite parts of the book. For those not familiar with Diana Wynne Jones or with most British based literature, the style is a little denser than Harry Potter and may take more work to get into, but its worth the effort, believe me."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"This was the first book by Diana Wynne Jones that I read. I think I was around 11- 12 yrs old and I just fell in love with it, have been ever since. The following years I read every book published in swedish by this amazing storyteller and I loved every single one of them.I have to say though that Howl's Moving Castle still remains my all time favourite! It's such an amazing book. Sophia and Howl's characters are so charming, funny and just crazy that you can't help loving them. DWJ must have a very vivid imagination, 'cause the plot/story is hilarious! .... and it has such a cute love story. This is simply a must-read-book. Or read anything else she's written 'cause she'll keep you smiling for hours.Just a few weeks ago I was browsing through the shelves in a book store and to my surprise I found a few books in english by DWJ, some of them I hadn't read, so I just had to buy one. It came down to 'Black Maria' which after reading it reminded my why I love her books so much!I haven't read Harry Potter yet, I will soon though. ... hmm.. but I just can't imagine them being as good as Diana Wynne Jones' books (Or Lloyd Alexander, another favourite). I'll just have to see."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Diana Wynne-Jones has a well-deserved reputation for funny, well-plotted, keep-you-riveted-to-your-chair fantasy stories. Here she provides an unusual sorcerer, an unlikely heroine, and a lot of sly winks at fantasies and fairy tales. Very entertaining.Sophie Hatter is the eldest of three daughters, which in this fantasyland means that she's the one who doesn't have an astounding \\"fortune\\" to seek. Instead she's stuck at the hat shop. One day a plump, very rude woman comes to see the hats, and Sophie uncharacteristically insults her. Unfortunately, this woman is the Witch of the Wastes, and responds by aging Sophie into a crone. Peeved out of being shy and retiring, she tramps off to the \\"Moving Castle\\" of the supposedly evil wizard Howl, who reportedly [steals] out the souls of young girls.After arriving at the castle, she encounters Howl's pleasant apprentice and contracted fire demon Calcifer (who promises to disenchant Sophie if she breaks his contract). Though she annoys the rather self-absorbed Howl and drives Calcifer almost nuts at times, Sophie becomes the cleaning lady at the Moving Castle. She begins searching for the chewed-up hearts of the girls, only to find something a lot more bizarre -- including her own peculiar magic.If you've ever read a fairy tale -- Cinderella, Beauty and the Beast -- you'll know that the youngest kids are always are the favored ones. They go on to marry princes or princesses, become wealthy and beloved. Jones mocks this and many other fairy-tale cliches, such as the hilarious scene where Sophie lurches around in seven-league boots. There's even a brief homage to J.R.R. Tolkien.It's certainly an interesting twist to have a not-so-evil evil-wizard, a harried apprentice, and a heroine who appears to be in her nineties. Similarly, the ideas of the \\"Moving Castle\\" with its doors to other places (including modern Wales) is very original. That's not even mentioning the attacking scarecrow.Until she's aged into a crone, Sophie isn't much of a heroine; she's too timid and dull to be of interest. Post-aging, she becomes interesting and delightfully pushy. Howl is not what you think of a \\"bad\\" wizard as; his tantrums over things like hair dye are hysterically funny, and he's also immensely attractive to the opposite sex. Michael is a good sidekick, with the common-sense that Howl lacks; Calcifur the fire demon is one of Jones' most memorable characters, especially when Sophie bullies him.While it isn't quite as spectacular as Jones' Chrestomanci Chronicles, \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" will appeal to those who liked fantasy spoof \\"Dark Lord of Derkholm\\" and \\"Year of the Griffin.\\" A funny, thought-provoking magical ride."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Howl's Moving Castle is, overall, a good book.That said, I don't think it is even in the same sphere of interest as J. R. R. Tolkien, or J. K. Rowling. The tone is different; DWJ maintains a witty tone, very emotional, but practical as well. She keeps you interested because of the ways her characters act. Sophie is a particularly complex character, and I enjoyed the ways in which she tried to deny her, um, feelings for Howl (especially the weed killer). I found Tolkien to be more detail-oriented, and less character-based. His books weren't as easy (or, in my opinion, interesting) to read. J. K. Rowling? A different story entirely. The three books don't compare, and not because one is better than the other. They're just completely different.The book and the movie differ as well. At least two people I know, faced with me coaxing them into reading the book after seeing the movie, declined, with the excuse that they didn't think the book would be as good. This is definitely NOT TRUE. Miyazaki couldn't possibly summarize the character's personalities (Sophie's stubbornness and emotionalness; Howl's selfishness, and total escapism, and his courage, bravery, genius and hot! body, haha). He didn't even try. Come on. Even though I love Miyazaki, admire his films, and think he is truly skilled, I don't think this film was at all his best. The characters were saccharine. Sophie was a nice old woman without a lot of personality, and Howl was a seemingly selfish man who turned out to be a flying bird turned war hero turned 'ideal' male lead. And then there was the Witch. She WASN'T GOOD. SHE WAS EVIL. I know I sound pessimistic, and there were parts of the movie that made me love it... but as a movie. I loved this book first, and I was really disappointed with the movie. If you are looking for more Miyazaki, you're out of luck.The book starts out with Sophie, the responsible sister of two girls constantly in competition and the daughter of a hatter and his new wife, an ex-assistant of the shop. She doesn't believe that she has much chance of striking it rich and living happily ever after. But soon, for reasons somewhat unknown, the Witch of the Waste decides to invade her shop, and turns her into an old woman! Shocked, Sophie soon begins her journey away from the hat shop to cure herself. She ends up staying as a cleaning lady for the notoriously womanizing wizard Howl. Supposedly, he eats hearts. Her encounter with him is complicated, involving two curses, unknown motivations, and all the supporting characters and sub-plots.The best thing about the book is Sophie's personality. She is actually an honorable person. In the beginning, she seems overly dutiful, and near the middle she can seem immature; but if you look more at the reasons she acts that way, her actual character becomes clear. I like that she's human, and acts in different ways. So that was what made the book for me.Give this book a chance! It's better than it might seem."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Sophie lives in a small village in the magical land of Ingary. Her village fears the heartless wizard, Howl, whose dark castle insists on circling the village--but it is a wicked witch who suddenly places an aging spell on Sophie, causing her to leave the village and, exhausted, take refuge in Howl's castle.Filled with finely drawn characters, this is a book accessible for all ages. Perhaps the best part is when the characters visit our world, and we see things through their perspective.Jones includes bits and pieces of standard fantasy, from fire demons to seven-league boots, but what results is, as always, entirely her own.Highly recommended. Jones is finally starting to get her due as an author, and this is a good place to start reading her works."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Before the movie came out on DVD I wanted to read the novel. I know what the movie is about and I heard it was \\"loosely based\\" on the novel.Little did I know that the novel was so delightful! As much as I love Miyazaki films, I don't think he could have wrapped up all the delightful parts for his readers in 2 hours or so. For those who have not seen the movie, I think the two can remain separate (meaning you can partake in one and not the other and be equally satisfied) because from what I read of Miyazaki's interviews, the movie goes along very different focuses and themes.What I found the most enchanting about the book were the rich characters. I don't think any movie could ever do it justice, Miyazaki or not. Howl seems to be the absolute opposite of what a hero should be, but he does grow on the reader and he's really not quite as clueless and self-absorbed as he leads others to believe. And Sophie is the spunky heroine that I thought she would be, although flawed and imperfect, she is very human and this makes her admirable.It's an easy 300 some pages to read and I finished it in a day (laughter occupied some time, and I reread the ending 2x). It brings back familiar themes of fairytales from childhood and evokes some nostalgia on the reader's part. There's an evil witch, a hero and heroine, rich people and poor people, the working middle class and royalty. But the author is a riot in the way she says things so simplisticly, matter-of-factly and sarcastically. She's very witty throughout, which makes it such an entertaining read!In this book there are surprises around the bend, and nothing is as it appears. All in all I think people of all ages can and should read this book, though notably it is in the young reader/independent reader/teen section. My only complaint is that it wasn't long enough to satiate my interest, and the denoument cuts off rather abrutly. But you can be the judge of how much romance you need in your life to be satisfied."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"In the land of Ingary, in a small town called Market Chipping, lives a 17 year old young woman named Sophie. Sophie's family owns a hat shop, and between her stepmother Fanny and her Father Sophie has been named the heir apparent. While Sophie learns the business of making and selling hats Sophie's younger sister Lettie (16) and half sister Martha (14 or 15?) go off to apprentice at Cesari's bakery and a watchmaker's named Mrs. Fairfax respectively. Soon all the businesses are booming, what with Sophie's ingenuity and Lettie's good looks the custom just explodes.One day in Market Square Sophie meets an elegant young man with blond hair who compliments her as she runs off to see Lettie. When she meets with Lettie she is surprised to discover that Lettie is not really Lettie, but in fact she is Martha under an enchantment to look like Lettie. Evidently the girls did not enjoy their assigned positions and switched with each other after administering a magical glamour that altered their appearances. It is Lettie who tells Sophie she must stand up to Fanny by demanding a wage for her efforts at the hat shop, that she is worth more. With these thoughts in her mind Sophie heads off to the hat shop where she encounters a woman who changes her life, the Witch of the Waste, a powerful enchantress whose reputation is legendary. At first the Witch arrives on the pretense that she is hat shopping with her assistant, Gaston, but it quickly becomes obvious that Sophie is going to be compromised for her indifferent attitude towards the Witch. The witch casts a spell on her that makes her age drastically from a girl of seventeen to a woman in her later years.When Sophie realizes just how extreme the change is she decides to leave Market Chipping. She journeys for a time, encountering first a scarecrow that is no longer standing up. Once she rectifies this she encounters a magnificent sight, a floating castle. Now, the reputation of this castle precedes itself, it belongs to a wizard called Howl, whose dastardly deeds of consuming young women's hearts is legendary. Sophie enters the castle and discovers that it is inhabited by three persons, a young man named Michael (15) who is an apprentice to Howl, a fire demon named Calcifer who is confined to the hearth by curse and an agreement with Howl, and Howl (Howell Jenkins) himself, who turns out to be the very elegant young man whom Sophie encountered in the market. Sophie decides to stay on the pretense that she is the new cleaning lady, but in reality she is staying long enough to break Calcifer's contract with Howl so that he might break the enchantment on her once she does.While Sophie is there she learns all sorts of information about her hosts. Michael is a stalwart scholar determined to be a good wizard even when he falls in love with one of Sophie's sisters... Calcifer is stubborn but genuine, and Howl... at first Howl seems to be nothing more than an arrogant playboy. Why, he barely ever attends to his official duties as a wizard to the several kingdoms he serves, Michael ends up doing the brunt of his dirty work while he is off chasing women. Even when Howl is asked to find the Prince Justin he shirks this responsibility at every opportunity, too busy chasing first Sophie's sister and then his nephews school mistress to care about the missing Prince. But a curse drawn up by the Witch of the Waste that Michael unearths in the form of a spell proves that Howl's time may soon be up and it is up to Calcifer, Michael, and Sophie to redeem their friend before he falls prey to the Witches evil clutches.Needless to say I love this book, but let me tell you why. Initially I decided to read it because of the fact that it has been adapted into a film, and a Miyazaki film no less. I adore Miyazaki films with every fiber of my being, so when I saw this book I decided to read it before watching the movie... what a rare and splendid treat this story was. I tell you, it's been some time since a story has sucked me in to this degree. The story and plotline are wonderful, the characters so real they leap off the page at you, and the writing is so sweet, funny and nerve wracking it keeps you reading at breakneck pace. I found myself laughing loudly at Howl's vain efforts to get others to pay attention to him, and yet found it sweet when he would bestow kindness onto his comrades. And Sophie...Sophie is one of those heroines that sticks with you after you close the book, a newfound Dorothy or Alice caught up in her own version of Wonderland... this story is the stuff that classics are made of, and I am not just merely gushing because I loved the book... It's one of those books you compulsively read because you simply can't wait to see what is going on in this world or what magic Jones is creating next. This is a diverting book that grasps at the reader and is a must read for everyone."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"This is, quite simply, the best book I have ever read. I read it first when I was about 12 and have loved it ever since. It is the story of Sophie, the eldest of three sisters who believes that she will never do anything with her life. Through a case of mistaken identity she is transformed into an elderly woman and is forced to leave her old life to seek her fortune in the world. She bullies her way into a magical castle owned by the wizard Howl. Sophie makes friends with Howl's assistant Michael and his Fire Demon Calcifer and together they help Howl to beat the wicked Witch of the Waste. The best thing about this book is the writing, which brings it all to life, particularly when Howl takes Sophie and Michael to visit his sister in Wales. The whole book is fantastic and I have now read it so many times I think I will have to buy a new copy as the old one is looking decidedly the worse for wear. I would recommend this book for anyone who has read other stories by the same author or anyone who just wants to read something exciting and entertaining."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"This is a fabulous book, I took a look into it when my daughter was reading it and was hooked!The only reason I'm writing this review though is to beg you to buy the book edition and NOT the Kindle,I don't know how books are transferred onto Kindle and have had little trouble in the past but the Kindle version reads like it has been proof read by a robot! 'From' is invariably 'form', sometimes names are capitalised sometimes not.'She unlocked the shop door and towed (threw) the wet boots onto the pavement' 'There seemed no reason to sell the sop(shop)\\" She took roosts (roots)from all the bags'. You get the picture. Does it spoil the read? Yes! Buy the book - a great airplane read."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Fairy tales, by and large, adhere to some very strict and undeniable rules. Amongst these is the rule of three. If a household contains three children and there is a fortune to be made, that fortune will be attained not by the first or second children (who are doomed to fail simply due to their birthdates) but by the third. Fairy tales are filled to overflowing with stories about third children. It doesn't take too much imagination to see how much more interesting it is to read a story about a first child instead. In \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" author Diana Wynne Jones pays tribute to the great folktales of the past by turning them topsy-turvy upside-down. The book is an amusing picaresque mystery tale about a girl's attempts to remedy her newly ancient state.Sophie did not mean to upset the Witch of the Waste. It's just one of those things that happens. After working in her stepmother's hat shop for months on end, Sophie's somewhat remarkable workmanship attracts the unwanted attention of a very nasty sorceress. For what appears to be no reason at all, the Witch enchants Sophie to become the age of ninety, or so. With a newfound sense that she no longer need worry about what people think of her, Sophie blossoms in her new state. Just the same, she'd like to get her old body back, and so it's off to the Wizard Howl (a man reported to eat the hearts out of young girls) for a cure. Hopping a ride on Howl's remarkable moving castle (hence the book's name) she befriends the not-so-evil but undeniably vain sorcerer, his apprentice Michael, and their snarky fire demon, Calcifer. What follows is a race to escape the witch, free Calcifer, and figure out just exactly what Howl does or does not know about his new senior citizen servant.The book's a remarkable combination of styles. You have your fantasy, your fairy tale, your mystery, and your subdued but nonetheless present romance. Jones has always been a fan of fantasy stories in which the tale will suddenly produce one heckuva twist 80% of the way through. \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" is no different, and the twist (while something anyone other than myself could probably have seen coming a mile away) is a shocker. The best thing about the book though is the easygoing relationships between the characters. Once Sophie settles down and makes the castle her home (while she tries to find a way to get her old body) she develops a wonderful relationship with Howl, Michael, Calcifer, and any other random people who might stop by (like a dog-man or an enchanted scarecrow, perhaps). Like many of Jones' heroes and heroines she's completely unaware of her own remarkable abilities. If there's any continual theme present throughout Jones' works, it's the idea of knowing oneself. Sophie doesn't, and until she discovers the extent of her own remarkable qualities, she's doomed to putter about.It's a great idea too, making the heroine of a tale sixty or seventy years older than she should be. Howl, for his part, is a great character if a little dodgy at times. He's as vain as a peacock, often appearing as a slightly wittier version of Gilderoy Lockhart from \\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\\". His transformation by the book's end was, needless to say, straining the boundaries of credulity. Just the same, you can't help but fall in love with this story. Yes yes, it kinda falls apart near the end with so many subplots, red herrings, and sudden characters cropping up here and there that you either lose track of what's going on or reread every paragraph three times over just to get your bearings. Jones has a tendency to rush her endings, and the ending of \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" works at a breakneck speed. I wish she'd lingered a little longer over the happy ending too. Once the danger of the book has passed, everything gets wrapped up in a neat little bow quicker than you can spit. I would've liked a little luxuriating in the characters' newfound happinesses, but you go with what you've got.All in all, \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" is bound to please both those Diana Wynne Jones newbies out there who've never so much as glanced at a word of hers before, and those tried and true stalwart fans who methodically gobble her books up like so many Pac-Man pellets. I wouldn't name this as my favorite of her stories (hats off to \\"Archer's Goon\\" for that honor) but I did have a wonderful time reading it. If you'd like a book that is a joy to read and won't do anything but please you, select this one immediately. It inspires movies, it entrances children... it is a spectacular tale."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Okay, I admit it: I'm a college student. I'm almost 20 years old (my god, that's OLD!) and this is still one of my all-time favorite books. I remember picking up Howl's Moving Castle at the library, many years ago, and Diana Wynne Jones shortly became one of my favorite authors. Her writing is humorous and intelligent, her characters are fascinating and real, and she has an imagination about which words fail me. People may talk about JK Rowling (who is also an amazing writer, not to be missed), but before you rhapsodize about Harry Potter, read about Howl. This book is bewitching; Diana Wynne Jones has charmed me for all time."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I wish there was a way to give feedback on specific editions, because this story deserves 5 stars, but the Kindle edition is really a sloppy one.

Buyer beware, and publisher, please make corrections and update!"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"There's never been another writer like Diana Wynne Jones, and out of all the compelling and complicated characters she created in her long life, there's never been any quite like Sophie and Howl. This is my favorite out of all her books. Sophie's freedom that she finds within her curse, Howl's seeming heartlessness, Calcifer's exploited condition, the way the plot builds straw-upon-straw until you're holding your breath for fear the whole thing will crash down, right before DWJ brings it to triumphant conclusion ... it's a masterpiece. Every time I read it I wish anew that Sophie was a real person I could invite over for tea!"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I had originally bought this book to read because of the movie by studio Ghibli, hoping to find it as mesmerizing and enchanting as the movie. I was glad that I did. It was much better than the movie in certain aspects, like Sophie's backstory, how her family played an important role in the story, and how many of the characters, such as Micheal, had a history that was explained; but I was very upset how Sophie's and Howl's relationship didn't really spark up and was made obvious until the last few chapters where in the movie it was made evident about half way through.Overall, it's a must read for any one who has seen the movie and was thinking they might want to read the book; and a must read for those who just plain want to have an enjoyable novel of witches, wizards, and adventure with a splash of romance."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"My son loved the Miyazaki movie of Howl's Moving Castle.

She and Calcifer were my favorites!"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I had seen the movie before finding out it was a book, and bought it as soon as I could. Diana Wynne Jones has created a magical world in which nothing is questioned, but just accepted. The time period is foggy, but vivid in detail. The characters are wonderfully charming and have a life of their own, none needing anymore than what has been imagined by the author. I wish I had more words to describe how great this is.

I have grown up loving fantasy stories like this (Patricia C. Wrede's Enchanted Forest Chronicles were and still are some of my favorites). This novel is up there among my favorites. Like many people, I have also seen the movie, but, in my opinion, the book is a million times better. It has it's differences from the movie version, but these are what make is so entertaining. The characters seem more alive and real - not quite so Disney-fied. I loved the movie, too, but with the book I enjoyed being able to create my own vision of the characters. They were not quite so perfect, and I was able to relate to them much more easily. I devoured this book (and the other two about Howl, Sophie, and Calcifer). I only wish there were more. This is the kind of story that makes you want to live in its world and talk with its characters. I would recommend it for anyone, no matter their age. This is not just a kids book, but one that can be loved forever."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"The first time I ever heard of this book was in 2006 when we lived in St. Louis, MO, and Jackson Pierce, a friend of our younger son Jeremy with whom he played homeschool baseball, gave the following report in the St. Louis Homeschool Network newsletter. \\"A long time ago, I had seen ads for the movie Howl's Moving Castle. A few days ago, I saw the book at Borders bookstore, so I bought it. The book starts: \`In the land of Ingary, where things as seven-league boots and cloaks of invisibility really exist, it is quite unfortunate to be born the eldest of three. Everyone knows you are the one who will fail first, and worst, if the three of you set out to seek your fortunes.' The main character is Sophie Hatter, the oldest of three sisters. Her parents own a hat shop in a town called Market Chipping. She has two sisters. Her mom died when she was two years old and her sister, Lettie, was one year old. Their dad married an assistant from the hat shop named Fanny and Fanny had the last baby, Martha. Now one day, their father died. Fanny sent Lettie to be apprenticed at Cesari's, a pastry shop in Market Chipping, and Martha to a witch named Annabel Fairfax. Sophie must stay and work in the hat shop. It turns out that Martha and Lettie had switched places and used a spell to make them look like each other. Now it just so happens that there was an evil witch named the Witch of the Waste. Sophie doesn't know that the woman is the witch at first, and insults her, and when the witch leaves, she curses Sophie into looking (and sometimes feeling) like as woman 90 years old! So Sophie goes to the one place that could help her: Wizard Howl's Moving Castle. It's called a \`moving castle' because it literally moves around. The castle had moved near Market Chipping before Sophie had been cursed, so it wouldn't be too much of a walk. But I'm going to stop here, as not to give anything else away. The book is very well written, and is kind of long, but it should only take you 2 or 3 days to read it if you are a fast reader. It is suitable for children of all ages, but that's expected because they made an anime (Japanese animation) movie of it. If you don't want to be too disappointed by the movie, watch it first (it doesn't look very accurate). So in conclusion, I think this book is very good and won't put you to sleep when you read it.\\"That is a pretty good summary of the plot. A few years later, after we had moved from St. Louis to Salem, IL, we picked Howl's Moving Castle, made from the book in 2004 by Hayao Miyazaki, for a family video. The film generally follows the book, but as Jackson noted there are some major differences. I read several reviews by people who actually liked the movie better than the book. The main complaints about the novel are that it is has poor character development, flimsy story lines, implausible plot devices, and too many words yet not enough real description. Personally, I found the book well-written and generaly easy to read with a fair amount of excitement, but I did note a few concerns. First, the plot has an almost \\"absurdist\\" quality to it. That doesn't necessarily make it bad, but some people may not care for that sort of story. There are some common euphemisms, such as \\"drat\\" and \\"confound it,\\" a few curse-like terms (\\"damnation\\" and \\"Hell's teeth\\"), and one instance of the word \\"Lord\\" used as an exclamation. Howl has as reputation as a womanizer, courting girls until they fall in love with him then dropping them for someone else but nothing sexual is actually implied. References to drinking beer, brandy, and wine occur, and Howl comes home drunk once towards the end. If you prefer not to have your children reading books which contain magic or witchcraft, you would obviously want to avoid this one. I do make a distinction between books which I believe promote an interest in the occult, such as Harry Potter, and those where the magic or witchcraft is simply part of the fictional setting of a story. Howl's Moving Castle comes about as close to the former as possible, and only the \\"absurdist\\" nature of the plot might keep it from falling into that category.Author Diana Wynne Jones, was born in London, England, on August 16, 1934, the daughter of Marjorie (n&eacute;e Jackson) and Richard Aneurin Jones, both of whom were educators. She is a British writer, principally of fantasy novels for children and adults, as well as a small amount of non-fiction. Some of her better-known works include the Chrestomanci series. Her books range from a broad, almost slapstick delight in the construction of absurd-yet-logical situations, especially evident in the endings of some of her books, to sharp social observation, to witty parody of literary forms. Foremost amongst the latter are her Tough Guide to Fantasyland, a non-fiction work on clich&eacute;s in fantasy fiction that has a cult following as a reference among writers and critics, despite being difficult to find due to an erratic printing history, and its fictional companion-pieces Dark Lord of Derkholm (1998) and Year of the Griffin (2000), which provide a merciless, though not unaffectionate, critique of formulaic sword-and-sorcery epics. Charmed Life, the first book in the Chrestomanci series, won the 1977 Guardian Award for Children's Books. Archer's Goon (1984), a Boston Globe - Horn Book Honor Book and World Fantasy Award for Best Novel nominee, was adapted for television in 1992. According to her autobiography, Diana has been an atheist since she was ten. Howl's Moving Castle won a Boston Globe-Horn Book Award and was named an ALA Notable book for both children and young adults. A sequel, Castle in the Air, was published in 1990. A second sequel, House of Many Ways was released in June 2008. Both are also young adult fantasy novels set in Ingary, though the two works are only loosely related to Howl's Moving Castle."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Not a lot of writers would be brave enough to pen a love story between a girl-turned-old-lady and a wizard missing a vital organ.But one of the few was the late fantasy dowager, Diana Wynne Jones. She had a well-deserved reputation for funny, well-plotted, keep-you-riveted-to-your-chair fantasy stories, and \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" gives us an unusual sorcerer, an unlikely heroine, and a lot of sly winks at fantasies and fairy tales.Sophie Hatter is the eldest of three daughters, which means that she's the one who doesn't have an astounding \\"fortune\\" to seek. Instead she's stuck at the hat shop. One day a plump, rude woman comes to see the hats, and Sophie uncharacteristically insults her... and ends up aged into a crone. Peeved out of being shy and retiring, she tramps off to the \\"Moving Castle\\" of the supposedly evil wizard Howl, who reportedly steals the souls of young girls.After arriving at the castle, she encounters Howl's pleasant apprentice and contracted fire demon Calcifer (who promises to disenchant Sophie if she breaks his contract). Though she annoys the rather self-absorbed Howl and drives Calcifer almost nuts at times, Sophie becomes the cleaning lady at the Moving Castle. She begins searching for the chewed-up hearts of the girls, only to find something a lot more bizarre -- including her own peculiar magic.One of Diana Wynne Jones' favorite sources of humor was poking fun at the tropes of fantasy and fairy tales. If you've ever read a fairy tale -- Cinderella, Beauty and the Beast -- you'll know that the youngest kids are always are the favored ones. So Jones obviously had a lot of fun with this idea, and uses it as the jumping-off point for \\"Howl's Moving Castle.\\"And along the way, she populates her novel with malevolent witches, fire demons, not-so-evil evil wizards, and an attacking scarecrow. It's a fun, tongue-in-cheek ride with plenty of comedy (Howl throwing a tantrum over his hair), but Jones also twines in a more serious fantasy story about stopping the Witch of the Waste.Until she's aged into a crone, Sophie isn't much of a heroine; she's too timid and dull to be of interest. Post-aging, she becomes interesting and delightfully pushy. Howl is not what you think of a \\"bad\\" wizard as -- he's obsessively flirtatious, charming, and sometimes immature. Michael is a good sidekick, with the common-sense that Howl lacks; Calcifur the fire demon is one of Jones' most memorable characters, especially when Sophie bullies him.While it isn't quite as spectacular as Jones' Chrestomanci Chronicles, \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" is a delightful, magical ride that gently pokes fun at fairy tale tropes. A must read!"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I watched the Miyazaki film many years ago, and though I did enjoy it overall I was rather unimpressed with the ending and some of the character development. However, one of my friends had read the book and had suggested I read it. I finally picked this up the other day, and I couldn't put it down! I have to say I didn't expect it to be nearly as enjoyable as I found it. Ms. Jones world is absolutely fantastical and fleshed out in such a way that it quickly moves her story along without seeming to skeletal and unrealistic. She also does an excellent job with giving her characters dimension. If you're looking for an epic fantasy, this is not it - as should be apparent in the book's size. However, if you're looking for that warm and fuzzy feeling from a fairy tale along with a dash of biting humor and raised eyebrows, you won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Howl's Moving Castle may have originally been intended for the young teenage set, but my great-granddaughter is almost 24 and madly in love with the book. She saw the Hiyao Miyazaki movie first, then read the book at our local library. She's now read her own copy at least 15 times since we bought it and she falls more and more in love with Howl, Sophie, Michael, and Calcifer every time. This book is a terrific read."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Sophie lives the boring life of an eldest daughter, wiling away her days quietly chatting with the hats she makes for her stepmother. Expecting absolutely no good fortune in her life, Sophie takes things in stride when, seemingly out of the blue, the wicked Witch of the Waste comes into her hat shop and lays a curse on Sophie that transforms her into a creaky old woman. Setting out on her own with no direction in sight, Sophie finds herself offering her services as a cleaning woman for the mysterious Wizard Howl. Enter a whole host of atypical fantasy elements, including a sarcastic fire demon, a vanity-obsessed wizard, a man-dog, and a strange scarecrow, and Howl's Moving Castle (yes, the castle actually does move) is a refreshingly original fantasy story.Sophie is a likable heroine and while I was a little worried I would have trouble connecting with her as an old woman, this wasn't a problem at all. The romance, while predictable and ok, was the only piece that didn't quite fit. Aside from that, my only wish is that there had been a little more edge-of-your-seat action, which there really wasn't much. Instead, this is a story that happily moves along at its own not too fast but not too slow pace. Surprisingly, all of the unique elements worked beautifully in this fun book that really is in a class of its own."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"This book is great! I saw the movie before I read the book. The movie is amazing (if you haven't seen it) and the book is even more amazing. I couldn't put it down. You receive so much more of the story through the book and you understand so much more of Howl and Sophie. Read this book if you love the movie. Again, great book."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Diana Wynne Jones is my all-time favorite author- I was lucky enough to come across Charmed Life in a used bookstore when I was just a kid and I've been enchanted with her ever since.Howl's Moving Castle has every element that makes Diana Wynne Jones the superb author that she is: quirky humor, wonderful characters, an engaging plot, and witty observations are just a few. This book is probably my favorite out of all the ones that she has written, and I can also recommend it as a starting point to those who are new to her. Books in the \\"Strangia\\" world should be read in this order: Howl's Moving Castle, Castle in the Air, and House of Many Ways."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I first learned about the existence of the book after learning that the Miyazaki film was inspired by the story (go ahead and chide me, faithful readers of DWJ). Since borrowing the book from my library two weeks ago, I've read it four times through and have found it equally entertaining all four times. Re-readability is a common factor in my favorite books. Although this is a young adult novel Dianna does not dumb down the content nor the humor. I'm a 20 year old in college and I absolutely love this book. The characters are believable, the descriptions are vivid, and the pace moves rather quickly. I can't stand slow-moving books.Highly recommend this book to anyone. Really, anyone. I can easily see parents reading it with/to their children and laughing out loud."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I haven't read the book yet, but I'm curious on the different take of it. I loved the movie and would enjoy reading the book. I'm curious on the book's version of the characters and storyline."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I found this book by accident while searching for a copy of Myazaki's movie of the same title, and what a happy accident it was. While I still love the film version, the book, as always, blows it out of the water. If you liked the movie, the novel offers the same charm and imagination with even more depth and delight. It takes a special book to make me gush, but, golly, I'll rant about this little masterpiece all night long. Luckily, for you, I've cut it short without giving too much away.Jones is a master at her craft, filling her tale with wit, heart, and a wonderful cast of unique and endearing characters adventuring through an intriguing plot with plenty of mystery and magic. The humor throughout Howl's is quirky, creative, and laugh-out-loud funny (the scene when Michael and Sophie try to fix Howl's suit . . . oh my . . . ).I'm big on characters--some people love great settings, some people love action, some people love Freudian slips, but I'm a character person. If the story doesn't have characters that feel like I could meet them on the street (yes, even the most remarkable heroes must buy groceries, you know), I just don't get into a book. Jones, however, has a wealth of characters, all memorable, all flawed, all gifted, and all nuzzling their ways into your heart. They work together wonderfully, Michael bringing youth naivety and Calcifer carries the mystery while Sophie's practical yet spunky personality and dry wit are perfectly matched against Howl's clever, flamboyant, and often exasperating nature, making sparks fly in a hilarious fireworks display.Jones has brought back the magic of the fantasy story--a visit to a world we always knew existed with characters you feel you may find outside your door. Nothing feels contrived or forced or leaves you frowning at a lame, shallow explanation (or complete lack thereof, something lesser authors seem to think readers won't pick up on). I could very well buy a plane ticket to Ingary, if I liked, or at least find it in another fairy story where eldest sisters have all the worst luck (Jones does a wonderful job of referring to the tradition fairy tale while creating a new story all her own).Once you visit Howl's, you'll never want to come back."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I'm 22 and still love this book!

I ordered it late but it still arrived before Christmas thank you Amazon!"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"This is very different from the Hiyao Miazaki movie, but I have to say, I love it. The added complexity to characters I already love made this book fun and enjoyable to read. I particularly like the fact that we actually get to see the Waste here as opposed to just hearing about it. Also, after reading it, I found that even though I still loved the movie, there are some things, like Ms. Angorian and a genuinely young Witch of the Waste, that I missed about the book. Definitely a good read for any fantasy or Hiyao Miazaki fan."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Howl's Moving Castle is a sweet and humorous book about a girl who has a spell placed on her by an evil witch. The spell changed the eighteen year old girl into a ninety year old lady. The bespelled girl finds herself finding shelter in the Wizard Howl's magical moving castle. She ends up convincing him to let her stay as a cleaning lady while she tries to find the secret that will break her curse. I really enjoyed this fun book. It was a quick read and the characters were a lot of fun. Although there were some parts where I began to wonder where the story was going, the imaginative world more than made up for these. I really love the humor that Diana Wynne Jones puts in her novels. None of her characters seem to take themselves too seriously. I would definitely recommend this book to those who appreciate a little simple magic in their reads."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"This book is a delight to read. It seems to be written more for middle schoolers, which shouldn't have surprised me since the movie is animated. I love that the romance isn't the whole theme of the book; I believe a good fantasy should focus more on unraveling the secrets and learning about the magic than the emotions of the characters. However, a down-played romance can often become a neglected part of the story, which is disappointing; this was not the case for Diana Wynne Jones. The hero and heroine had time to get to know each other, and fell in love slowly. (There's nothing I hate more than 'Cinderella' romances where the two fall instantly in 'love' after one meeting.)None of the characters were perfect; in fact, Diana tends to focus on making them over-flawed. In the interview included in this printing, she herself comments on how strange it is that, despite her creating such flawed characters, she still has a whole list of girls waiting to marry Howl. I think this isn't really as surprising as it seems. A character must be flawed to be realistic; no matter how much a girl loves that 'perfect' guy, if she can't find any flaws, he'll eventually become too perfect (read: boring) to live with. With Howl, on the other hand, Sophie will never have a dull moment.Most fantasies have either a generally serious tone or so much humor the story is ruined. This is the first fantasy I've read that perfectly balances the seriousness of the magic with the humor of the characters. This, I think, is where the movie disappointed previous readers of this book. The movie has that characteristic serious tone. While the company definitely did right casting Billy Crystal as Calcifer, there just wasn't enough time to truly capture the author's humorous spirit.That said, I really have to give this book two different ratings. As the middle-school fantasy novel it was written as, it deserves all five stars. For teens looking for a fantasy romance, though, I'd give it a three and a half or a four."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Sophie lives in her late father's hat shop when an evil witch turns her into an old woman.

I have to say it is quite enjoyable. The characters are well writen. I plan to read this someday to my child, and I hope the power of Diana Wynne Jones words can take him/her to a fantastic world of witch craft, adventure and romance."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Can you imagine a world that has witches, wizards, moving castles, spells, and more witchcraft? I can because I have read books about such things. If you want to enter this world, you should read Diana Wynne Jones' Howl's Moving Castle.This book is about a girl named Sophie that is the oldest of all three sisters. They all go and seek fortunes, she ends up in Howl's moving castle, after she is placed under a spell as an old lady. Most of the story takes place in Howl's moving castle. She stays there because she made a contract with a fire demon. She finds out that what the fire demon wants is to be free. She also saw that Calcifer (The fire demon) had something lumpy inside him when Howl picked him up to move the castle. After she asked him about it and he told her that it was Howl's heart, she knew that Calcifer always wanted to be free but not die.Sophie wanted to be turned back to normal as soon as possible, too. Mrs. Pentstemmon (a witch) told Sophie that she could make inanimate objects become alive. After getting a scarecrow to speak, she learns what the witch(antagonist) is planning on doing next. Then Howl leaves to fight with the witch but something happens. If you want to discover if Sophie breaks the spell, you should read this book. I won't give away the ending, but in the end there is a lot of people apologizing and asking to be their wife or girlfriend.I liked this book so much because it has to do with magic. I also liked it because this book reminds me of when my friend and I would fight most of the time like Sophie and Howl. I like most of the books that have to do with magic or witchcraft just like Howl's Moving Castle. People should read this book because it will teach them not to be so selfish, think they're all that, and learn to have courage. They should also read it because once they start they won't stop reading it just the way it happened to me when I read it. I even read it two times and I still wanted to read it again"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Not being much of a fantasy fan, I definitely recommend this book.

I approached this book from having seen the movie first and was very surprised at how loosely the movie's story was based on the original work.Diana Wynne Jones has written a children's book set in a land where magic is commonplace and is part of the everyday. While the Castle that moves about of its own accord causes some worry among the populace, its not considered scary or unusual. What this book does very well is build on the relationships it establishes fairly early on. The story itself seems to bounce around quite a bit and I wasn't very impressed with an ending seemed confusing and haphazard...which reduced the impact of the book's climatic scene.

As I read, my mind wanders off to what could happen next given all the details I've read so far and I couldn't be quite too sure at first, especially with Howl's unpredictable behavior. The story takes place in Sophie's perspective and as I was reading I seem to think and feel like her as well.I loved the part where everything slowly revealed (it was almost near the end of the book) itself until in the end the good always prevailed. I have to agree with one of the reviews that the ending seemed to be a bit hurried and I would've wanted a little more detail to it. But then again, it is normal for writers to want to hurry finish putting their ideas into writing that sometimes it affects the ending. It is understandable.As for the book copy, it may just be me but I think I found quite a few typographical errors but it doesn't much affect the standard of the book.As for the extras, I was expecting more than just the interview with Diana Wynne Jones. It's funny yet quite true what she said about girls falling in love with Howl. It just goes to show that this book is very inspirational. Thank you, Diana Wynne Jones for this amazing novel."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"This goes along with the other book, \\"Castle in the Air\\". Really incredibly fun. I loved these 2 books. Good for any age !"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Sophie is the first-born daughter of a deceased hatter. She makes hats in the shop, now run by her step-mother, resigned to her fate of being a homebody when the Witch of the Waste, for reasons of her own which she is not sharing, changes Sophie into an old woman. Fearing rejection Sophie makes her way out into the wide world and finds herself housekeeper to the dread wizard Howl. As you might guess adventures and self-discovery abound in this enchanting book for young readers, and not so young readers like me.Diana Wynne Jones has managed to weave a wonderful new fairy tale with everything the old fairytales have that make them so timeless and wonderful! The prose is beautiful and very intelligent, but simple enough that readers as young as third or fourth grade can easily follow it. There is nothing predicable about this tale and you will find yourself turning the pages quickly wanting immerse yourself deeper in this world where wizards and witches are business people and the distance between the mundane and the miraculous is as close as the nose on your face."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Diana Wynne Jones is very in tune with her young audience. The story flowed well, the characters were well-developed, and the enjoyment factor was higher than expected. I'd highly recommend this book for pre-teens and for people (like myself) who enjoy quick, entertaining little reads from time to time."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"This is a delightful book whose characters will live with you for a long time after you have closed the book,down-to -earth Sophie, who has the gift of being able to talk life into inanimate objects,feisty fire-demon Calcifer, Sophie's exuberent family and above all, the charming Welsh [his real name is Howell Jenkins and he once played Rugby for Wales]wizard HowlHowl is a bundle of paradoxes,a vain philanderer,who falls for every pretty girl he meets,only disappear as soon as they fall for him but putting his own life on the line in a random act of kindness, so cowardly that he has built his moving castle with the sole purpose of running away from trouble but capable of acts of great bravery [provided that he can can convince himself that he is not really doing it ]he is a delightful rogue and you can't help loving him, as Sophie does ,in spite of herself.The great Hayao Miyazaki, has made a film based on this book using the same characters and the basic premise [young girl magically turned into an old woman ]That film ,too, is totally enchanting but don't expect it to be a carbon copy of the book,I loved them both equally but they are very different."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I got this book because I love the movie. As I have learned in the past when there are questions in a movie that aren't answered, usually those questions will be answered in the book. I enjoyed the book, but be prepared (if you have seen the movie first) they are very different. At first I was disappointed that they were so different. But at the end I realized that I loved each of them for different reasons. They are both amazingly fun stories that take you someplace else. I was sorry that the story ended."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I'm glad that I finally discovered Diana Wynne-Jones through Amazon. Howl's Moving Castle has all the ingredients of an entertaining and enthralling fantasy. I couldn't put it down. Jones has woven her plot in such a way that you won't know what will happen until it does. What is particularly alluring about the book is her sensitive portrayal of her characters and their relationships. The novel is packed with emotion, humour and drama centered around human frailties. I found myself falling in love and identifying with Sophie, Howl and Calcifer. Even the minor characters have their own interesting peculiarities.A thoroughly satisfying read that people of all ages will enjoy."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Sophie Hatter is the oldest of three daughters, and because of this, it means she has no \\"fortune\\" to look forward to. Instead, she's given the hat shop. One day, the Witch of the Wastes come in. Sophie insults her, and in turn, the witch turns Sophie into a crone. Upset by this, she ventures out to the moving castle, which is owned by Howl. Howl is a wizard that is feared in Sophie's town of Ingary due to stories of him capturing pretty young girls and devouring their hearts.After she arrives at the castle, Sophie meets Howl's apprentice, and Calcifer the fire demon. Her and Calcifer make a bargain that if she finds a way to break the contract Howl and Calcifer have, Calcifer will break the spell that is put on Sophie. She agrees, and becomes the cleaning lady for the castle.While in the beginning of the story, Sophie is a relatively boring character, after she's turned into a crone, she becomes very lively and witty. She constantly annoys Howl, and bosses Calcifer around.You soon find out that Howl is not the evil wizard that the town believes him to be. He's a self-absorbed man that throws fits over things like a mix-up of hair dye. Sophie also finds that the door of the castle leads to different places, including modern Wales.Over all, this is a really good book that's full of humor. The reader will fall for Howl, just like Sophie does."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Sophie is sure that her life is meant to come to nothing, because where she lives the eldest child is always ill-fated. So when times get tough for her family she is content to stay home and work in the family hat shop while her two younger sisters go off to bright futures working in a bakery and learning magic. But when the Witch of the Waste comes into her shop one day and casts a spell on Sophie, making her appear old, she decides to set off into the wider world where she knows no one.When her old bones become tired at the end of her first day of wandering, she finds herself at the edge of the wizard Howl's castle. The castle is enchanted; it moves and blows puffs of smoke constantly. Although Sophie is afraid of Howl because she heard he eats young girls' souls, in the guise of an old woman she thinks she will be safe. With thoughts of finding a warm fireside and a comfy chair, Sophie goes into the castle.She finds Howl's assistant Michael, and his fire demon, Calcifer, but Howl is not in. As Sophie makes herself useful and becomes a part of the castle life, she begins to learn more and more about Howl, Calcifer and Michael. Gradually, as she gets to know them, they become like a second family to her. But can she keep Howl from being taken by the Witch of the Waste? And can she break a magical spell that binds Calcifer to Howl, so the spell on her can be broken as well?Howl's Moving Castle brings up issues of creating family for yourself and seeing people for who they truly are, despite the masks they put up to keep others at a distance. It's about finding love and acceptance, and not being afraid to look for the magic in small moments. The castle itself is fascinating, with its door leading to different villages depending on which colored-button is facing down, its ability to move its location and its permanent window looking onto a sunny port town. Our mother-daughter book club members thought the ending felt a bit rushed, but otherwise we all enjoyed reading it and talking about Sophie, Howl and all the characters. I recommend it for book clubs with daughters aged 13 and up."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"This book is the best fantasy book I've ever read. It has very well developed characters and a unique plot that spins the reader into a vortex of imagination, humor, and fun. It has unlikely characters that you can watch develop while the story line twists and turns that keeps you from looking past the next bend. The ending was surprising and the book was very neatly wrapped up. A thoroughly enjoyable read that made me laugh and cry along with the characters. You honestly feel like you're inside the book, alongside the characters with their conflicts. Diana Wynne Jones has done a wonderful accomplishment creating such a fantastic book, a page turner that is the best book I've read in a long time.It begins with an eldest daughter named Sophie, stuck into thinking that the eldest daughters have the dullest lives. She works in her family's hat shop, making beautiful and popular hats for the local women. Then,adventure comes when she angers the Witch of the Waste, and gets cursed to be an old woman.So the adventure starts, with Sophie meeting the wizard Howl, and finding plenty of mystery and adventure inside his castle, including striking a deal with a fire demon, fleeing from a scarecrow, and meeting the Witch of the Waste, while discovering her own magic.A tale of romance and self-discovery, this book is highly recommended. The best book by D.W.J. yet."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"This book is like a cool summer breeze. So refreshing that when you are finished with it, you'll sit back and sigh.This story is wonderful: filled with wit, humor, quirkiness, magic, and of course, love. It is such a wonderful adventure that when it finally ends you will find yourself back on page 1. It is definitely worth \\"exploiting.\\"I won't tell you anything more about this story than to encourage you to read it. This book is an adventure--one that tickles all your fancies; besides, isn't that what any fantastical journey is supposed to do?"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"This was an absolutely great book! I first saw the movie, then later heard from friend that there was a book. And who knows what you can find in a book.I loved the author Dianne Wynne Jones, from just this novel, I want to read her other many novels, particularly Castle in the Sky (Sequel to Howl's Moving Castle). The venacular she uses is a tad confusing for those who are not familiar with briticism, but nonetheless, it was interesting!As most movies based on books, things normally get left out. And boy, was it worth reading this. The movie's story is different from the book, as there are more characters that contribute to the very broad story in the novel. By reading the book, you learn more about the world of Ingary and the characters that make up that world .I found that seeing Howl mature from a spoiled and self-centered child to a man who really cares about everyone and their well-beings. And then comes Sophie. Her character was rather perplexing at times and I would sometimes not understand her decisions, but as the story later goes on, she becomes able to express herself better. Overall, I think the novel's character development was great and I found each and every character special in their own ways.I would definitely recommend those who have seen the movie to take a gander at what the novel has to offer. That means alot. So go read it!"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I absolutely loved this book! I fell in love with Howl and was hopelessly lost in the story - it even creeped into my dreams! Diana Wynne Jones writes an amazing, refreshing, and charming love story with masterful character development. I was thoroughly captivated by Howl as he matured and became a man/wizard capable of a true love relationship. And Sophie's character was so complex that the unwinding of her personality, with it's twists and turns was a delight to experience with her. All the characters in this book were well-developed and a joy to meet. This book was so much better than the movie, that I find myself wondering why the movie took such a departure from an almost perfect story."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Before Hayao Miyazaki made \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" into a feature length animated film in 2006 (2004 if you saw it in Japan), it was a book written by Diana Wynne Jones in 1986. Due to the inherent difficulties of creating an animated film, Miyazaki greatly abridged and adjusted the plot of the novel for his movie. I happened to enjoy both film and novel but after reading the book I realized that the plot is extremely different in the novel--enough that the book and movie become completely different viewing experiences.Anyway, that's all I'm going to say about the movie. On to the discussion of the book:Sophie lives \\"in the land of Ingary, where such things as seven-league boots and cloaks of invisibility exist.\\" In other words, all of the traditional fairy tale stories are real. Not so bad, except that Sophie Hatter is the eldest of three sisters, which everyone knows means Sophie is doomed to failure should she ever set out to seek her fortunes. Sophie is resigned to her fate--living obscurely, and less than successfully, working in the family hat shop. Except that this is not a traditional fairy tale and events soon intervene to set Sophie on a very unexpected course indeed for an eldest daughter.It all starts in the hat shop after some interesting things begin to happen when Sophie talks to the hats she trims. Interesting enough to attract the attention of the dangerous Witch of the Waste. When her encounter with the Witch of the Waste leaves Sophie cursed in the body of an old woman, she has no choice but to go out and seek her fortune in hopes of breaking the curse (even if she is an eldest daughter).Along the way, Sophie comes upon a mysterious moving castle that has taken up in the hill's of Ingary. The castle belongs to Wizard Howl \\"who was known to amuse himselv by collection young girls and sucking the souls from them. Or some people said he ate their hearts.\\" Either way, he was not anyone Sophie expected to ever meet let alone move in with. Until she does. Adventure ensues as Sophie tries to break the curse and help Howl with his own uniquely magical problems.In terms of fantasy novels, \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" is one of my favorites. The world Jones creates is fully realized without ever getting boring or limiting the reader's imagination. The tone of her narrative is also spot on. Readers of Jane Austen's novels or the \\"Sorcery and Cecelia\\" series will notice a similar narrative voice. Although this novel is largely timeless, the prose has a charmingly Victorian tone--taking its time to arrive at the action, the better to familiarize readers with the characters involved and show the readers just how fantastic they (and the story) really are.I also adore this story because it is romantic, thrilling, and completely absorbing. Even at 329 pages, the novel is far too short. Happily, Diana Wynne Jones follows up \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" with \\"Castle in the Air\\" (1990) and a brand new book featuring Sophie and Howl (\\"House of Many Ways\\") is due out in May of 2008."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I learned about this book after watching the movie directed by Miyazaki, and I finally purchased a copy. It was a very fun read, I enjoyed the story very much! It was fun to compare the differences between the movie and the book, and it's nice how although the versions were very different, they still made very good stories. Like even though they were very different in the twists and stuff, the audience could still enjoy them because the story-telling is beautiful, unlike most book-turned-movies. I recommend this very much!"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I absolutely loved the movie and when i saw in the credits that it was based on this novel i immediately bought this book. I was so happy to find that this book had more story lines than the movie.I loved that the movie had changed some small elements and i loved that story. But the book had so much more that made the story much richer and helped me to understand some of the holes in the movie plot.As far as the story itself, i fell that this is a good alternative to the Harry Potter set of adolescent readers. It has a good moral and there aren't any super scary parts. I especially loved the relationship between Howl and Sophie. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I saw the movie and adored it. But then I read the book and realized just how much the movie left out....nuances, complexities of characters and emotion. The book is truly wondrous and tickles the imagination in ways you wouldn't believe. Not to be missed, especially if you enjoyed the movie. For all ages."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"First, let me my inform you, you being whomever is reading this, that I originally watched the movie before reading the book. I watched Howl's Moving Castle film a countless number of times so I finally picked up the book. I realize now that my confusion about the different portals in the castle was cut drastically because the movie visually explained it so well. When I recommended it to my mother she said she was completely confused about the different portals. I tried to explain and didn't explain it well. I decided it was time for her to the watch the movie. While we were watching the movie I saw a light bulb go on above her head. Therefore, I recommend watching the movie first.I thoroughly enjoyed reading the book and read it through in under 24 hours although, I kind of had to push thorough the first pages, which was mostly expository writing.These two different medias in which the story is published can both stand alone because both have individual merit. I recommend both, but you don't have to and I can guarantee you will enjoy both either individually or together."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Howl's Moving Castle is an excellent book. I love the characters, the setting, and just about everything in the book. In fact, they even made the book into a movie. Diana Wynn Jones has certainly written a fine novel, and she is one of my favorite authors.The story starts out with Sophie, the eldest girl in a family of three daughters. In the land of Ingary, however, that is considered bad luck. When her father dies, her two younger sisters are given apprenticeships and Sophie is resigned to taking over her family's hat shop. However, the story takes a turn when the Witch of the Waste comes into the shop. Unfortunately for Sophie, she offended the Witch and was turned into an old woman.In shock, she just left the shop. She moves in with the Wizard Howl (who has acquired a nasty repuation including a hobby of collecting young girls' souls) and becomes his cleaning lady, after striking a bargain with a fire demon. Sophie would break the contract the demon and Howl had made, and Calcifer, the demon, would remove the Witch's curse. However, like her own curse, the contract prevented Calcifer from telling her about the nature of the contract.Sophie soon befriends Michael, Howl's apprentice, who he took in after finding him orphaned and alone upon his doorstep. While trying to help Michael with a spell, she learns about the curse on Howl. It was cast by none other than the Witch of the Waste. When the Witch and her own fire demon find where Howl was, they hurriedly move away, moving into Sophie's own hat shop which was sold after she left.Meanwhile, Howl courts Miss Angorian, a school-teacher in England, where Howl originally came from. When the Witch kidnaps Lily Angorian, Sophie sets out to rescue the poor woman. Things come to a head when a certain scarecrow that had been following her (rather stalkingly) and a dog-man under a spell are revealed to be the mix of the pieces of Prince Justin and Wizard Suliman who had gone missing months before, and Lily Angorian is revealed to actually be the Witch's fire demon.And at that moment, the Witch's fire demon is at Howl's castle, seeking to find a new human to sustain her life after her witch dies. But to do that, she would have to kill Calcifer, and Sophie would never be free of her curse. Ever."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"This is not to be missed. As an adult who loves fantasy of all sorts, Diana Wynne Jones and all she has written are top of my list. (Higher than Harry Potter) I could give you story details, but that would not begin to convey the delight that is in store for you if you read Ms Jones. No matter what your age you'll be enchanted and amazed by her writing. Be good to yourself, give yourself a treat and read this book."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I am a reader of many fantasy books, and Diana Wynne Jones is one of my favorites because of her mysterious aspect of fantasy. One of the things I found so interesting and refreshing in this lovely tale, was the strong sense of irony I felt for the main character. All throughtout the book, she hobbles and cackles as an old woman of 70 or so. What a brilliant and hillarious idea! This book is definitely a fantasy classic."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Amazing story. I love and enjoy the movie but the book has so much deeper story. It is a very great read."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"As I neared the end of this book I was really considering giving it 3 stars. The book started off great, I really enjoyed the sense of being I got from Sophie and her home in Market Chipping. As it went on, she struggled through a curse and finding her way into a new life, leaving behind the one she knew before. It struck me odd when I was reading it that Sophie took the curse in stride. She didn't have any mental struggles with the curse, she just trudged along.But, the great thing about this book is the author's ability to weave mystery in, without you even knowing it. When the end of the book came about and the mysteries were revealed I sat back and thought &#34;huh, that is pretty neat.&#34;There wasn't much adventure. Sophie seems to sit around the castle getting into mischief pretty frequently, and often she wants to leave the place, only to be detained somehow. In fact, this constant &#34;I am leaving because I am upset! Oh wait, something happened and I can't,&#34; happens so often I almost put the book down. Seriously I think it happens 4 or 5 times. But, even without the adventure, there are magical battles and let me just say, they are pretty extraordinary. I would have thought hurling lightning and fireballs, but that doesn't really happen, it is more mind bending.Overall, I would rate the entire book a 3, if it weren't for the end. The ending was . . . perfect. It has to be, since the ending alone secured a 4 star rating. Overall, I will not read the book again (that is saved for such engrossing works as Harry Potter and David Eddings) but I can look back on this book pleasantly."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"The movie leaded me to this book, it's a great story with charm! However, it also left me an unsatisfying feeling which is not a good after taste for sure. Not like that I'm not loving this book but it was just... not up to my expectation. It's definitely well developed in the first 2/3, but suddenly came to the end with only a brief touch of all these characters the author had put into the story. The relationship between Howl and Sophie was not quite convincing to me (not like the very interesting \\"friendship\\" between Shopie & Calcifer). Lovely characters and very potential plot I could only hope the story had been longer, with more magic, and details. Besides, I fall hard for Calcifer!!!"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Who doesn't love Ms. Jones? She is a great story teller, her humor and way of writing keeps you enthralled. And this in and of itself is a classic."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Howl's Moving Castle is hilarious while being deep and complex. It's truly children's literature at its best.While I was reading the book, I wondered how I would have reacted to it if I read it when younger. I'm quite certain I would have liked it, but the messages I took from it would have been very different. When I read it this time, fresh off a course on literature from the French enlightenment, I read it through the lens of \\"l'tre ou le paratre\\". These words roughly translate to \\"essence\\" and \\"appearance.\\" French writers were obsessed with exploring what happened when someone's appearance did not match his or her being. In Howl's Moving Castle, Diana Wynne Jones is preoccupied with the same question. What is true? How we look? Or how we are inside? Although we're told from birth that it's \\"what's inside that counts,\\" it's a profound question, and I was surprised by how deeply Jones investigated this question under the guise of writing a flashy and fun children's book.The book resembles a fairytale, so I found some character motivations a bit weak. The villain of the novel is purely evil for evil's sake; unfortunately, there's not much complexity to her actions. I also became intermittently confused. The novel is frantic and hectic, which makes it difficult to follow occasionally.In spite of these reservations, I enjoyed Howl's Moving Castle immensely. Delightful characters, an inventive world, a surprising romance, charming humor, and an exploration of profound questions: this book has it all."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"My daughter saw this on TV and realized She HAD to have it.

I thought like in the movie, sophie would turn back in some instances, but she didn't. I also thought the idea of putting in the modern world was cool too. I didn't think it would be exactly the same as the movie. But the book is good in it's on way."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"In the ongoing battle over which is better: the book or the movie, I'm usually on the book side. However, Howl's Moving Castle is a special case: the book is fantastic and so is the movie--but they are almost completely different stories.The setup is the same: The main character, 18-year-old, Sophie is the eldest of three sisters so she knows according to the fairy tale rules of her world she won't be having any adventures. But after she runs afoul of the Witch of the Waste who casts a spell on her to make her old, Sophie decides he might as well strike out to find her fortune anyway. Along the way she finds a strange castle with four doors that open on different worlds, a fire demon, and the mysterious, vain, tantrum throwing, wizard Howl.But that's where the similarity ends. The movie by Hayao Miyazaki is very much focused on war with Sophie discovering Howl playing a role in an ongoing, very destructive battles among countries. (If you haven't discovered the great animator/storyteller Miyazaki yet, do yourself a favor and rent his movies, all of them. My personal favorites are Spirited Away, Ponyo, and of course, Howl.)I came at this backwards and saw the movie first. I loved it and thought the book would be even better as books usually are. But it is hard to compare the two because the book focuses more on a personal level. Sophie discovers her true nature, and Howl's, through the curse that is laid on her. The plot is incredibly complex with a lot of mysteries that Jones deftly ties up into a fabulous ending that left me smiling for days.So should you see the movie or read the book? My answer is: both in whichever order you want. Read it. See it. You'll thank me later.(This review can also be found on my blog: YA Fantastic Book Review)"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I daw the movie first and the book is very good.

The world she creates is fantastic, the characters are unique, believable, and entertaining, the plot has so many twists and turns it'll make your head spin, and it's just an overall unbelievably good book by an unbelievably talented author. I would not suggest this book for really young kids simply because my younger sister did not enjoy it at 12 because she couldn't keep up with the confusing plot twists. Also, if you've heard of or watched the Anime movie, be prepared that this is nothing like the movie (they are both awesome, but completely different)."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"A ltitle more juvenile than I would want but still interesting.

Worth the read."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Sophie is oldest child in her family and this means that she is doomed to a crummy fate. The superstition comes alive when she is turned into an old woman by the jealous witch of the waste. She runs from her little hat shop to find her fortune, but she is now old and doesn't get around so well. She meets the mysterious and vain wizard, Howl. She becomes a member of his strange little household in a castle that is enchanted and moves around the countryside.The book was amusing at times and at others frustrating because it was full of details, but the story never really went anywhere. Jealousy and romance in a fantasy setting are the prevailing thems. Howl is the typical pretty boy that no one ever wants to get involved with. All of the characters were completely unique and well thought out. The ending was satisfying but sudden. The book was entertaining at times, but was difficult to get fully interested in."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Could you ever imagine a world of magic, talking fire, wizards, moving castles, witches and much, much more? Well, if you can't imagine that you should read this book. It has magic, talking fire (hard to believe), wizards, moving castles, and witches. This book is called Howl's Moving Castle and Diana Wynne Jones is responsible for writing this book.This book is mainly about Sophie getting to be young and Calfifer being free. Sophie wants to be young again because The Witch of the Waste was not pleased with the bonnet that she wanted and turned Sophie into an old lady. Sophie goes to a moving castle and pretends to be a maid. In the castle she finds a young wizard in his twenties, his name is Howl. Sophie also spots a fire demon, Calcifer. Calcifer and Sophie promise each other that Sophie would break his contract and free him. Calcifer promises Sophie that he will change her back.*I you want to find out if Sophie breaks the spell, you should read this book. I won't give away the ending, but in the end there is a lot of people apologizing and asking to be their wife or girlfriend."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"The book is totally different from the movie. I liked both stories."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I watched the movie first and was later prompted to read the novel since the movie had unanswered questions here and there. To my surprise, there are a lot of parts in the book that were not in the movie. The book did not mention a war and Sophie was more bitter. However, it did clear up any misunderstandinds from the movie which is why I bought the book in the first place."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"No matter your age, this book is a gem. Not only is it completely hilarious, but the characters are some of the most full-fleshed and wonderful to make an appearance in ANY genre of literature. Sophie is strong and prematurely cantankerous, Howl is dizzyingly unpredictable, and Calcifer has more personality than one would ever expect from a fire demon. And to top it off, the book takes place in multiple worlds, from the realm of fairy tales to our own, and handles each one with verve and subtle wit. Jones's style of writing is appealing to both the younger and the older set of readers alike, and both will take something different from the experience.Admittedly, the plot is sometimes impossible to follow. A common trait of Diana Wynne Jones's writing is her tendency to assume that the reader understands what she is trying to say, when in fact the reader hasn't a clue.Nonetheless, this book is packed with magic, humor, and loveable characters. What more can a reader of fantasy ask for?"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Sophie, the eldest of three sisters, is turned into an old woman by the Wicked Witch of the Waste, who is jealous of her abilities. She takes off and moves into Howl's moving castle. Howl is a magician, and his fire demon is managing to keep the castle in a number of places at the same time.The book was fairly well written, without any glaring failures in plot. The ending felt rushed, cluttered and it was the only time that I had to re-read sentences in order to keep up with what was happening. Overall, a fairly pleasant, but rather mindless experience. The characters were developed up to a point, but there was nothing really original here, just a lot of flippant remarks. The story had little depth to it, and it seemed that the author wanted to 'keep it light' in the sense of this is just a little fun story, don't take it seriously, wink-wink, let's have some tea now. But the humour wasn't worth more than a smile and the story, while not grating, was nothing more than the equivalent of bland tea on a breezy afternoon."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Although i have not yet read this book, i have read previous diana books and thought they were excellent.But this is a sort of response to a certain kids review down below, although he may not have liked the book, he did not give it a very good chance. When u expect to read a book like harry potter and get let down, u let down yourself because every author is different. Diana is not like a certain JK Rowling and hopefully will never be the EXACT same thing.What is most delightful about her books u will never know what happens next.I have read the Dalemark Quartet, and it is excellent, it kepps u guessing although u know the ultimate goal of the books. Which i am sure is demenstrated in most of Diana's books, so if this one does not get your fancy try out with one of her other books u may be surprised about how much u like it."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Good read by a good author of fantasy. BUT, this book's storyline, characters & plot is not the same as the famous animae movie \\"Howl's Castle.\\" I bought the book thinking it was a novel version of the movie's story and I was disappointed. Jones has invented a new kind of Cindarella fantasy wizard-type story. Though the storyline meanders, a few of the characters, especially the secondary characters, are vague, the book was worth reading. Believe me, the settings, storyline, characters, plot, etc., are beautifully & fully fleshed out in the animae movie version. Hayao Miyazaki is a genius!"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"The reason why I wanted to read this book is because Hayao Miyazaki is going to turn Howl's Moving Castle into an anime movie. And Hayao Miyazaki is a genius when it comes to animation. He surpasses Walt Disney in imagination in his animation.Howl's Moving Castle is great by all means, the story is wonderful, the characters are very well developed, and there are some twists and turns that are just hilarious when it does happen. This is a book where you can root for the characters.The one flaw I found reading this book is the author's inability to flow one paragraph to another. There is a 60% execution rate where the author can link one paragraph to another. But sometimes the author has problems. For example, when I was reading the book, (I'll try to avoid giving out spoilers) there was some parts where nothing much happens or the story is very slow, then all of a sudden it takes a turn where you say, \\"What just happened, that paragraph doesn't correlate at all to the previous paragraph of the story, It doesnt even match.\\" So most of the time, you wonder to yourself, what is going on, I'm lost, I'm confused.Another flaw I found is that the author tried to rush the story. The story felt rushed, especially during the end. I kept reading the book, and all of a sudden I finished reading the book, and I wondered to myself, what happened to the climax. I somewhat read it, is that it? Is that the climax?Some people will argue, the best way to understand some of the stuff I missed is to read it over again. Let me tell those people that a good book can explain it all clearly in one read-through. The only people that would read it twice or 3 times or more are the people that really loved the book.In the end, Hayao Miyazaki will convert this book into something else. He turns books that have a lot of flaws into animated movies that are 100 times better than the book."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Why is this not a review but a preview? Because I hove not read this book. So why am I doing this? Easy, I want everyone else who may be wary of reading this book to know this fact: Howl's Moving Castle WILL DEFINIATELY be made into a movie by the master of fantastic animation, Hayao Miyazaki, in 2004. Yes, Miyazaki-San has decided to use yet another of Dianne Wynne Jones tales of fantasy and creativity as the basis for his 2004 movie project, the previous book was Castle In The Sky: Laputa. Whether this will be the second release to debut in both Japan and American is unknown at this point, but rumors as surfacing after the already Oscar hopeful animated film \\"Tokyo Godfathers\\" (Dir. Satoshi Kon, sonypictures.com/movies/tokyogodfathers/) is set to be released in both Japan AND American on December 29, 2003. I can already tell you that the man who brought you such brillent pieces of cinema such as My Neighbor Totoro, Castle In The Sky, Princess Mononoke, and the Oscar winning Spirited Away and who is one of the top selling authors of ALL TIME with his gut-renching and utterly beautiful masterpiece, Nausicaa; Valley of the Wind, it's a sure thing that this will be one the things that, like in the past, whenever he places his hands upon it will become instant gold. A brief preview for Howl's Moving Castle is already being circulated throughout the internet on both Japanese and English language websites, so please do check it out. Oh yea, go see Tokyo Godfathers as well, trust me...."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Being one who knows only 1.05 languages, American English and a little bit of Japanese, it was difficult for me to read through the thick Brittish English that was in this book. The language and word choice tried to throw me off at times, but for the majority of the read the language made perfect sense and caused me to laugh out loud.Howl's Moving Castle is an excelent novel, and I can see why Hayao Miyazaki chose to animate it, as its story fits in quite well with his other works (unexpected situations and/or twists in the story). The characters are awesome, and the description is beautiful.This is a story unlike any other. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I wouldn't have encountered this novel if Hayao Miyazaki had not made it an animation film in Japan. But the story flows differently between the original story and the film. In the book you can expect a frightful but reassuring tale unfolded. Really a good yarn!At the very start of this story, Sophie Hatter is transformed into a 90 years old lady by the witch of the Waste. I couldn't understand why. This is really a good hook to lead the readers into the Diana Wynne Jones world of the sorcerers. But the real world is also woven into the story and connected with the Howl's castle. In the real world, Howl is Howell Jenkins, and the Howl's nephews are playing video games! I was really flabbergasted by this passage because I believed that the Howl's moving castle was drifting over the feudal world of kings and farmers in the Middle Ages.Howl is considered as a wicked sorcerer, but the reality is yet to be determined by reading the sequel of this book: A Castle in the Air!"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Sophie Hatter is the eldest of her sisters and in the land of Ingary, if you were born first, you would be destined to fail first. One day, Sophie's mother decides that she would have to settle all of her three daughters in apprentichip somewhere since there father had died and they were running low on money. She set's up Martha with the local witch to learn magic because Martha is the youngest and her fortune will most likely be grander if she learns from a witch. She than sets up Lettie in a bakery where she would be bound to \\"meet handsome young apprentices and live happily every after\\". That leaves Sophie, the eldest and least likely to succeed. Mother decides to take Sophie in as her own apprentice for her Hat Shop. At first, Sophie tries to make herself happy by puting all her energy in making and decorating hats but soon, she begins to feel very depressed at how dull her life is looking. She believes that she will never leave the hatshop and will grow old and withered without having any adventures of her own. She begins talking to the hats she makes and as the days pass, she becomes more and more of a recluse. However, one day, a powerful witch enters her Hat Shop and for some reason or other curses her and she becomes an old lady. This event sets Sophie on a new path, in which she encounters more magic and adventure than she thought an eldest daughter could ever have.Diana Wynne Jones writes out the very funny, odd, magical adventure of Sophie as she determines to seek out her fortune and break the curse before it is too late. This book was a startlingly interesting read for me, as I thought this book would be boring since it seemed to be written for a younger reader. However, I found this book surprisingly and uniquely fun and I throughly enjoyed Sophie's wonderfully entertaining adventure. I especially liked the character of Calcifer and Howl, and there strange bargain of a relationship. I definitely recommend this book, to readers everwhere. If I couldn't help but read the book at in one sitting, it must be pretty enthralling. So read it!"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Howl's Moving Castle has been my favorite book for quite some time. The book is a delightful combination of memorable characters, convoluted plot, and sharp humor. Younger children should have no trouble keeping up, and adult readers will catch new details at every turn. Diana Wynne Jones is among my best-loved authors, and this book is largely responsible.Howl's Moving Castle casts Sophie, the meek hatter's daughter, as our unlikely heroine. Sophie goes through a bit of a transformation, and stumps off into the heather of Ingary to seek her fortune. She encounters all kinds of characters, every one believably written and amusing. The plotline of Sophie's adventure is much more complicated than it seems. There are numerous references to characters that we may have discounted earlier, and subtle passages that warrant a second or third read. Howl's Moving Castle remains the book that I have read more times than any other, and that's not without good reason. I wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone willing to give it a chance."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Howl's Moving Castle is an excellent fantasy story. It deals with Sophie, the oldest of three sisters. She believes, as the oldest of the three, she is doomed to a bad fate. One day her father, a hat seller, dies and leaves the girls with their step-mother. The youngest goes to live with a witch to learn magic. The second sister goes to work at a bakery. Sophie is stuck with the hat shop. One day, an evil witch, the Witch of the Waste, comes in and without explanation turns Sophie into an old woman. Sophie decides to leave the hat shop and find her own destiny. After leaving the town, she runs into a huge moving castle. This castle belongs to Wizard Howl who is know to steal the souls and eat the hearts of young girls. Believing herself to be too old for Howl's morbid tastes, she decides to enter the castle. Perhaps Wizard Howl can lift the spell she is under. This begins Sophie's adventure.For fans of fantasy, this is an excellent book. Diana Wynne Jones is an excellent storyteller. Also, for fans of Japanese animation, Hayao Miyazaki's next film will be based on this book. Be sure to read this before watching the movie. I'm sure you'll love reading it as much as I did."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I first read Howl when I was thirteen, and it left such an impression on me that I am still reading it at twenty. The story of a girl who is turned into an old woman and who has to endure many strange ordeals - like green slime and weed-killer! - while seeking her fortune, \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" turns the fairy-tale world wonderfully upside down. Sophie is a completely human protagonist, and Howl is an impossible but endearing male lead (like Chrestomanci but rather more prone to hysteria). All the supporting characters, from Calcifer to Fanny, are drawn with such individuality that one almost feels books should be written about them as well!The book is funny, complex, fast-paced, and filled with some of the most memorable characters of children's literature. More subtle and sophisticated than Harry Potter, it treats themes such as death and lonliness realistically while remaining unforced and relentlessly cheerful. An added bonus is the clever use of John Donne's \\"Song\\" as a central plot device."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"This book, in a word, is fun. It's charming, funny, and has great characters. If you want a book that's really fast-paced and full of action,though,don't pick this one. It's not a story about magic with big, impressive magical battles and that type of stuff, it's a story about people that happen to use magic. This, I think, is one of my favorite things about it. Instead of focusing on how much power the characters have and how much different they are from everyone else, DWJ focuses on how human the characters are. They do the same things everyone does and they aren't perfect. I think it's the only fantasy I've ever read in which the title characer complains about his hair color and gets a hangover. But hey, it makes him seem more human and that's a good thing.If you like to laugh and you want a fantasy that isn't dark and heavy, but that doesn't seem like it was written for 7 year olds, then read this. You will find it quite enjoyable."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"When I first picked up Howl's Moving Castle, Diana Wynne Jones was already one of my favorite authors. I had torn through her Chrestomanci and Dalemark books, as well as Dogsbody and The Dark Lord of Derkholm. However, I just couldn't begin this book. I tried harder to start it. Then I realized how absolutely incredible it is!The characters in the story are very realistic and have great personalities. Howl is arrogant and conceited, Michael is quiet, and Calcifer is ... Calcifer. The story jumps to different dimensions, like the worlds of Chrestomanci (it doesn't take place there, though.) Howl's Moving Castle is now my #1 favorite book, and if I had to name the worst part of it, I would say it was when it ended. I reccommend this book to all fans of the fantasy genre."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Howl's moving castle is probably one of my favorite books.

Don't ask why- just read it. I'm always rereading this book again and again cause it's too good! And I always notice something new. This book is set in a world of fantasy where the words &quot;WElsh Rugby&quot; seem mysterious. A curse is made up of John Donne's lovely poem, SONG (Go and catch a falling star), as the wizard Howl, despite living in an imaginary world, comes from ours. THere are wizards, witches, kings, spells, castles, fire demons, invisible cloaks, seven-league boots, and much, much more! This book is not the least bit boring and while kids enjoy it (as i did) so do adults (me again!)"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"This book has already managed to become one of my favorites; and I'm planning on reading more from the amazing Mrs Jones as soon as I get the chance."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Let me start out by saying I love the movie version I have watched it over 100 times. Upon seeing the reviews about the book I decided to give it a try and I am happy I did. Reading the book after the movie gave me a chance to see the how amazing Hayao Miyazaki's imagination is.The book was also well written kept me interested and I liked the character of Sophie in the book she had more to her that you didn't see in the movie. This was a quick read that I really enjoyed if you love the movie I would recommend taking a look at the book :)"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I first heard of Howl's Moving Castle when I saw the trailer for the movie. Of course, me being a child at heart, I went out and got the movie. What a wonderful and beautiful adventure! So when I found out it was based on a book, I had to read it. I don't regret it at all. The film has several plot differences from the book. But the basic plot is still the same. Howl's Moving Castle is about a girl, Sophie, who gets cursed by The Witch of the Waste. The curse turns her into an old woman. Refusing to let her family see her as old and ugly she runs away hoping to find her fortune and maybe even break the curse. While traveling she sees Howl's moving castle. Everyone knows that Howl eats the hearts of young beautiful girls. But Sophie isn't worried because she is old woman now. So she lets herself in the castle. She ends up working as Howl's cleaning lady after making a deal with the fire demon, Calcifer, that powers the castle. Calcifer wants Sophie to help him break the contract he made with Howl in return he will break the curse on Sophie. However, Calcifer cannot discuss the terms of the contract so he has to drop Sophie hints, which she never catches. Likewise, the Witch of the Waste made it impossible for Sophie to tell anyone that she is under a curse. Howl doesn't seem to care for Sophie and her cleaning but he puts up with her, letting her live in the castle. Howl and his apprentice, Michael, make simple spells and charms for people of several towns. They are always in the moving castle but the door to the outside is like a portal allowing them access to several places. Howl is being pursued by the King to find his brother as well as the Wizard Suliman who disappeared. Howl doesn't want responsibility or commitment, therefore he tries his best to sully his name/reputation in town and with the king. However, with the Witch of the Waste wanting him for her own, Howl is constantly on the run, dragging Sophie, Michael and Calcifer with him.I adored this book. I loved the movie and was so happy to find the book a bit different. It was so much fun to read! It was like going on an adventure. At the beginning of the story, Sophie is working as an apprentice in her family's hat shop. She has no backbone and is overly shy and quiet, spending more time talking to the hats she makes then to people. One day the Witch of the Waste comes into the store and curses her, making her into an old woman. As the story progresses, Sophie's personality matures and changes, she becomes more aggressive. Instead of feeling that her fate has been decided for her she goes out and makes it how she wants.Howl hates being tied down to one place. His character was so interesting. He is a natural coward, yet brave when he has to be. He is also such a drama king! He's like a spoiled kid obsessed with vanity. It made for some very hilarious situations. Throughout the book he is constantly nagging at Sophie and blaming her for everything bad that happens. Howl hates Sophie cleaning and messing up all his stuff-but he never kicks her out. Underneath the surface he is kind and compassionate-very deep under the surface. These two traits come out very rarely and only for an instant at a time. He is always begging for attention. It's quite funny. One of the funniest scenes was when Howl got a cold. I reread it several times and laughed out loud each and every time. Calcifer was awesome. He is a fire demon who made a contract with Howl and because of that is stuck inside the castle until the contract is broken. He is so funny. I would love to have a friend like Calcifer, even if he is a bit scary looking.The whole book was beautifully written. The world was interesting. It takes place in Ingary, which is like another dimension, where magic exists. The ending is suspenseful and sweet. There is no cliffhanger. It has a HEA ending but I would still love to see more of Sophie, Howl, and Calcifer. Hopefully they show up in the next books. Without trying to give anything away I will say that there is a little bit of romance, very little. It is sweet and very PG. The other stuff, not so much. I wish there was more romance BUT, it is still worth it! I loved every minute of it! I wish I could read it again. Actually I'd recommend reading it twice so that once you discovered everything by the end you can go back and see the reasons behind certain things, and pick up on Calcifer's hints-which even I had some trouble picking up. Overall, it was a VERY unique and imaginative book. It was charming and engrossing. I enjoyed every minute of it."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"This book is a great read for nearly any age. Written before the movie, it has elements of fantasy & magic while still addressing personal relationships and has a great ending. It would make a nice family read at bedtime."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I first heard of this from the Miyazaki movie. When wandering around my local bookstore, I saw this and since I loved the movie I decided to buy this book as well. I am very glad that I did, this book was fantastic.CharactersThe story centers on three main characters, Sophie, Howl, and Michael. While the book is written in an omniscient viewpoint, it focuses mostly on Sophie. Sophie is a wonderful character who gets through her problems often through sheer persistence. Howl is a bit of a slacker who tries to avoid doing any work that he can avoid and has a wonderfully sarcastic attitude towards the world. Michael is Howl's apprentice who helps Sophie adjust to living with the wizard.SettingThe name of the world is never given, but the world is a typical medieval world with wizards running around changing things. The most interesting thing about the setting is Howl's castle. As per the title of the book, his castle moves on it's own. This is interesting and plays an interesting part in the story.PlotSophie is the oldest of three sisters and she works in a hat shop. After her father dies, her two sisters are sent off to apprentice with a baker and a wizard while Sophie stays at the hat shop. After working at the shop for some time, Sophie gets frustrated and takes it out on a customer, who happens to be the Witch of the Waste. This doesn't bode well for Sophie as the Witch curses her and makes her age so that she is closer to 90 years old. After this she sets out to get away from her old life and ends up living with Howl and Michael.EnjoymentAlthough it's never really fair to compare the book to the movie, in this case, both are excellent. The first half of the book and movie are essentially the same, but while they differ from there they are both excellent. I loved this book and read it in one day, I didn't want to put it down.Overall GradeI loved this book, and for that matter, I loved the movie as well. They're both excellent and I highly suggest both. But this review is for the book, which is what this score is for.10/10All of my reviews are available on my blog. Check out my profile for the info."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I very much liked this book. It was fun and imaginative.

When listening to it, I think it sounds exactly how it sounds in my head when I read the actual book myself. I can't complain with the audio version of the book, I'm only disappointed that there isn't a regular kindle version of the book itself, without the audio."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Once I started reading this book, I got so immersed in it, that I dovoured it in two days. The book is easy to read and easy to comprehend, has captivating plot and funny characters that you are going to enjoy much.If your choice to read this book is based on seeing Miyazaki's film adaptation, which is my case, then please note that the book and the film have not much in common except of main characters (Sophie, Howl, his apprentice)and begining of the story, when Sophie is transformed into an old lady by the Witch of the Waste.The story of the book is far more complex and captivating than a film adaptation could ever be.Spending money on this book is not a waste."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Diana Wynne Jones is now forever engraved in my mind as the epitome of a fantasy writer.Is it Howl's cavalier personality, or Sophie's practicality that keeps me reading? Perhaps it's Howl's resident fire demon, Calcifer, or the fact that Howl's castle door is actually a portal that opens onto four different places? It's everything and more. The tongue-in-cheek pokes at fairy tale clich&eacute;s are funny. Sophie doesn't expect anything exciting to happen to her as she's the eldest (and as we all know in fairy tales exciting things only happen to the youngest.)And being the eldest is certainly turned on its heels when Sophie ends up offending the Witch of the Waste who literally turns her into an old lady.The odd and magical thing is that after this transformation is when Sophie finally starts learning about herself and becoming an awesome heroine. Before she was shy and led a tedious life in a hat shop, but once she aged she really didn't care what people thought of her. Howl is deliciously her opposite, where she is practical he is nonsensical, shallow and vain. Of course in the most likable way. Each character balances the other. This book takes you through such a fun adventurous journey. One everyone should take at least once."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Wow! What a ride. From the start, Howl's Moving Castle grabs you and takes you on a wild ride of magic, adventure, mystery and love.At the beginning of the story, we meet Sophie, a plain young hat-maker. For some reason, the Witch of the Waste casts a spell on her and Sophie is instantaneously an old woman. She can't tell anyone about the spell and ironically sees the spell as an opportunity to set out on her own.Tired and weary from a day of walking, Sophie must seek refuge in Howl's moving castle. Inside, she finds an unholy mess. She then meets the fire demon Calcifer, Howl's apprentice Michael, and eventually Howl.Despite his reputation for evil-doing, Howl is not one to turn out someone in need. When Sophie tells him that she is the new cleaning lady, he allows her to be that and she sets to the task (barring a few limits which Howl has placed upon her cleaning.) The ragtag team of people in this 'household' become close.Sophie learns about the ties that bind Howl and Calcifer. She learns much of the magic of the house and even comes to find out she has some magic herself. To no avail, she tries to help Howl elude the responsibility of finding the Prince and the Wizard of Suliman. She roots for Howl in his fight with the Witch of the Waste but she is still concerned over his womanizing and the inevitable heartbreak which will befall her sister Lettie.So much happens in so many interesting places, I would do a disservice to say that this is a summary of the book. Suffice it to say, that I recommend that you read this book. It's a fun-filled adventure that will leave you breathless."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"REGARDING THE MOVIE: Howl's Moving Castle (director Hayao Miyazaki) just came out in U.S. movie theatres June 2005. I saw the very first showing that came out at Loews theatre, NYC. The movie is as magical as you know to expect from Miyazaki, but remember not to expect it to match the book. You will be disappointed, because DWJ's books are a different sort of magical; they are not ostentatious in the same way as the movie, but rather practical, actually.REGARDING HOWL AND DIANA WYNNE JONES: In fact, the main character of this story, Sophie, is so down to earth that she fulfills every expectation of a dull eldest sister that she possibly can. Which isn't much, not with the Witch of the Waste after her, and Howl eating up hearts under her very roof. You could say that the book is about turning the fairy tale stereotypes upside down and inside out, so that the dullest, most crotchety sister gets her day, and it would be true. But DWJ always, always stays true to a certain logic of fairy tales, so that you're seeing the right side up view on top of the inside out view, or rather, the other way around. Expect tantrums, vanity, jealousy, neglect, misunderstandings, and all the difficulty of cleaning a moving castle. All you clean freaks out there, you know what a nightmare this can be. Oh yes, and a spectacular show of magic. As with catching a falling star, this book and many of DWJ's others as well, offer a pleasure all their own that you can't quite explain away.SEE ALSO: \\"Castle in the Air\\" is the sequel to this book. It has a different cast of main characters, with a few overlapping appearances. \\"The Lives of Christopher Chant\\" is DWJ's most popular book, I think, and with reason. \\"Wilkin's Tooth\\" is quite similar in style to these, and one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"One of the best things about this book is the complete and wonderful randomness of the homour found within! Dianne Wynne Jones is really a genius! This book is really a sparkling gem amongst all books! I had to read it again and again!!!!This story is about Sophie Hatter, a young girl who works in a hatshop, and is convinced that, since she is the eldest of three sisters, she will fail at everything, just like in all the fairy tales. When she is enchanted to be an old woman, she seeks refuge in the sinister castle of the \\"evil\\" Wizard Howl, hoping to find a way to break the curse.From enchanted \\"dogs\\" to fire demons, from cream cakes to green slime- This is one of the very best books you will ever read!!!!"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Too bad I can only give 5 stars to Howl's Moving Castle; it deserves far more. I'm a voracious reader, with 20 or 30 shelves full of books, and Howl's Moving Castle is my favorite of all of them. What makes it so great? For starters, the vivid characters are wonderful. They have such strong personalities that they almost become caricatures, but then Ms. Jones tosses in a little detail that makes them human. I especially love Howl, the outrageously foppish, over-dramatic, slitherer-outer of a wizard. Another thing that is wonderful about Howl's Moving Castle is all the tiny references to fairy-tale conventions, other works, the modern world (specifically in Wales), and even old poetry. A third thing to love about Howl's Moving Castle is the sheer amount of levels. I would estimate that I've read it 50 or 60 times, and I always catch something new each time I read it. It's hilarious and sweet. Even fantasy-haters that I made read this book loved it. It's seriously for everyone. I love Howl's Moving Castle; now the wait is on for the 2004 or 2005 animated movie by world-famous animation studio Studio Ghibli!"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"This book is absolutely fantastic! I read it after feeling depressed about having finished all of the author's Chrestomanci series, and it cheered me up. Sophie Hatter worked in her parents' hat shop in the small town of Market Chipping in a fantasy world. Her whole life revolved around her fears of the notorious Witch of the Waste and Wizard Howl, and her fear of failing because she is the eldest of three sisters. Then, the Witch of the Waste came into the hat shop and turned Sophie from a pretty young woman into an old lady. Feeling she had nothing to lose, Sophie goes to work as a cleaning lady in Howl's moving castle. There she meets Howl's apprentice, Michael, and his fire demon, Calcifer. Calcifer realizes that Sophie is under a spell, and offers to break it if she could break his contract with Howl. Sophie soon discovers that Howl, although vain and selfish, isn't evil, and is actually fighting against the Witch of the Waste. It all rolls together to make a wildly entertaining story. The plot, which basically defies classic fairy tale motif, is one of the most original, fresh stories out there. The characters are intelligent, funny, and uniquely memorable. Anybody who hasn't read this book yet should. It's highly reccomended for the advanced young reader craving a story that's more on their level of thinking and wondering than other books."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I picked up the novel this month because I enjoyed Miyazaki's film of it so much. I had read somewhere that the film didn't follow the novel exactly, so I wanted to see where the differences lay.As it turns out, I loved the differences in the novel (and the fleshing out of Sophie and her family situation). Each-film and novel--offer something a bit different, but essentially, it's the story of a cursed Sophie (the Witch of the Waste, beautiful in the novel, a strange and fat big-headed creature in the film), who is turned into an old woman by the jealous witch. Sophie wanders off, liberated by her new old body, and encounters Howl's castle, which, in fact, IS mobile, as well as able to open out to different parts of the land at the turn of a knob. Multi-locatory?The novel (like the film based upon it) is full of people who are under some sort of curse/spell--Sophie, Howl, Calcifer, the scarecrow. But the novel adds other characters, and in so doing, becomes more complex and more interesting for it.Eventually, as in all good fairy tales, things get sorted out. It's in caring about imperfect characters and the outcome of their trials that one has delight. Diana Wynne Jones employs a sort of blithe, even tongue-in-cheeky voice that is a delight to read. All age groups can enjoy this novel. (For concerned parents, no cussing or naughtiness, so it's a safe read.)One thing the movie had that the book doesn't--and that I actually really enjoyed in the movie--is the \\"beast\\" aspect for Howl (in the novel, he doesn't turn into a weird flying monster), and the \\"love thy enemies\\" and compassion that is bestowed on the Witch of the Waste. Wynne Jones doesn't turn the Witch soft and senile. So, as I said, there are merits to the anime interpretation, which allows for transformation of the more extreme sort and a kinder message of forgiveness.In the novel, family problems play a larger role, and so does the apprentice. Romance definitely colors the air. And Howl and Sophie both have growing up to do.It's a fine novel and a fine film, and both should give you great enjoyment. I recommend you get/watch/read both.Mir"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"In Howl's Moving Castle, a heroic tale by Diana Wynne Jones, begins with a portrait of the boring life of Sophie, a hat-maker and the eldest daughter of three. Considered bad luck to be the oldest of three, Sophie is expected to fail if the sisters go to seek their respective fortunes. With this knowledge, and an apathetic outlook on the world, Sophie resigns herself to live the mundane life of a hat-maker. Then, after one astounding moment, her whole outlook on life changes. Only later will she realize it was changed for the better.In the land of Ingary, such things as wizards, moving castles, and magic really exist. Thus, it should have been no surprise that when the evil Witch of the Waste came into the hat shop, a horrible spell was cast upon Sophie. Under a spell that makes her suddenly change her from young to old, she realizes that she would not be able to stay at the hat shop for fear her family would not recognize her. In this pivotal moment, Sophie decides to seek out her fortune despite the expectation of failure. Once embarked on this accidental adventure, Sophie inadvertently ends up at Howl's Moving Castle. There she meets the fire-demon, Calcifer, the wizard apprentice, Michael, and the heartless, vain wizard himself, Howl.It is not until this moment that Sophie's true purpose is revealed. Once Sophie decides to enter the castle, she recognizes that she will have to rationalize her sudden appearance if she hopes to stay. Sophie creates an alternate identity as a cleaning lady. Needing to psychologically assert control after her life's upheaval, she falls victim to an obsession with cleanliness. Sophie also enters into an unholy alliance with Calcifer, whereby each will remove the others' curse and set each other free. Calcifer asks \\"How about making a bargain with me? I'll break your spell if you agree to break this contract I am under\\" and in response, Sophie reluctantly agrees (Jones 47). This pact signifies story development, and opens the gates of character conflict. With a curse to remove, a knack for making things come alive, and all odds stacked against her, Sophie fights the Witch of the Waste, and in the process, she must free not only Howl's heart, but everyone.The major strengths of Jones's novel stem from her descriptions of characters. The development of relationships and dynamics, sarcastic writing tone, unique story and surprising sequencing of the plot make Jones's story truly enjoyable. For example, after Sophie spends the night in the castle, Michael asks, \\"Your still here? Is something the matter?\\" Sophie cleverly replies, \\"I'm old\\" (Jones 53). While not everyone fully appreciates sarcasm and blunt statements, Jones sets the tone in a way that makes readers look beyond the obvious and enjoy the game of witty banter. A profound and heartwarming novel, it has no apparent weakness. Howl's Moving Castle aptly creates a fantasy-filled adventure, straddling the genres of accidental adventure and accidental hero. Sophie sets of f to find her fortune, but she accomplishes so much more. With the plot's distinctive twists and turns, sense of adventure, and the unique storyline, I give this book not only a strong recommendation, but challenge anyone to read the book and not like it."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"This book had a very interesting premise: a flying castle. Who has ever heard of such a thing? I certaintly haven't. I wasn't really expecting much when I picked it up at the library, but it turned out to be a very humorous and origional fairytale.It starts out when Sophie, the oldest of three sisters (so nothing good or exciting can happen to her) is starting her apprenticeship at the hat-making trade. She is very bored and talks to her hats (hah!) about what kind of people will wear them. Soon these predictions start to come true!One day a beautiful woman sweeps into the shop and turns Sophie into and old woman without so much as a by-your-leave. Sophie reacts by calmly deciding to leave, although her reasons aren't really explained. Meanwhile, a flying castle, said to house a wizard who lures girls in and eats their hearts, is floating around the countryside. Sophie feels less timid as an old woman and walks right into the castle, where she meets the Wizard Howl's apprentice, Michael and a fire demon named Calcifer. Calcifer immediately asks her to break a contract involving himself and the wizard, but he can't tell her what it is about.After this, things get a lot more complicated. Sophie finally meets Howl, who is not evil at all, though rather vain and a heartbreaker. The castle has one door that opens onto four different places, one in modern day Wales! A scarecrow appears to be chasing Sophie and the King's brother Justin has dissappeared. Sophie stays on at the castle, cleaning, and soon Howl asks her to visit the king to try to beg off searching for Justin. Howl and Michael also get mixed up with Sophie's sisters and they make a trip to Wales, where Sophie sees amazing things and meets Ms Angorian, a school teacher. There is also a dog/man under a spell, and other puzzles to be unriddled.Sophie stays an old woman until the end of the book, when she breaks the bond between Calcifer (who is really a fallen star) and Howl, and the Witch is defeated. Then everything is explained and everyone has a happy ending. Sophie and Howl finally get together and are ready for a happy-ever-after that will be \\"...a good deal more eventful than any story made it sound...\\".On the whole a very funny and origional story that turns fairytale conventions on its head. Fans of The Enchanted Forest Chronicles by Wrede might want to give this one a try. Very enjoyable!"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Well then. Since you are reading this review, I can only assume that you are on the book's page. My advice to you is: Scroll up, add it to you cart, and buy immediately! I got it at the library a couple of days ago, along with Castle in the Air, knowing by now that it's best to get any Diana series all at once or you will be itching for the next one as soon as you're done with the first. I swear to you, I have not laughed so hard or read so avidly over a book in a LONG time. The humour is perfectly placed to make you give a shriek of laughter at just the right moments. My family was looking at me rather strangely by the time I had finished. I liked the atmosphere of Howl's Moving Castle, and the characters just seemed to mesh so well with the surroundings and plot that if it weren't for the regrettable nessecities of meals and sleeping, it's quite probable that any reader would jump into the book headfirst and not come up until it's over. Anyone who liked Charmed Life or any other of the Chrestomanci books will love this and the sequel!"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"_Howl's Moving Castle_ is a whimsical and funny fantasy about the adventures of Sophie, a girl who is transformed into an old woman by the wicked Witch of the Waste. She goes to the magical moving castle of Howl, a wizard rumored to eat the hearts of young girls, to be a cleaning woman. There is much misunderstanding, tantrum-throwing, seven league traveling, and wizardry; Howl and Sophie are endearing protagonists, and Calcifer the fire demon is my favorite sulky supporting character."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I'm one of the volunteer library moms at my sons' elementary school. I like to read the books that we have for the kids and the kids' books at the public library. I picked up this book at the public library because the cover looked interesting. Little did I know I was going to be pulled into one of the most fascinating fantasy worlds ever.Other reviewers have commented that this is a book to read over and over. Boy are they right! I'm on my third time through (this is the second time I'm reading it to my youngest son)Ms Jones has created an intriguing world that mixes fantasy and reality in just the right proportions. Her characters are believable and likable. (And yes, I'm in love with Howl, too). The story line is complex without being confusing. The plot twists are exciting and never seem contrived.I highly recommend this novel and it's sequel, Castle in the Air, for upper el. and Jr. Hi libraries."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Honestly it's a bit different from the movie, but it makes more sense.

I absolutely loved the movie, and I soon learned it was based off of a book. I didn't have much motive to find a copy at the time, but it was just yesterday when I purchased the book.I was truly impressed! Jones creates such a fantastic world in this novel, one of wizards, witches, and magic. If you enjoy Tolkien' s novels, then you will fall in love with Howl's Moving Castle.One of the most enjoyable things I found about this book was the characters. Every character effected the book in some way and all had such great personalities. Sophie 's antics constantly humored me, while Howl, I found, was very dashing and witty (I was afraid he would eat my heart, too!).I highly recommend this book for anyone, and I cannot wait to read the sequel."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Way better than the movie!

The characters are super quickly and interesting, and the arguments between Sophie and Howl are really entertaining. My only complaint is that the various worlds are pretty confusing, but I managed to figure out what was going on in the story despite that. It may have just been my own fault... :P All in all, a very enjoyable read!"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Mine has been a faithful and fervent love spanning nigh on ten years. I have read and reread this childhood gem over a dozen times, and that is no exaggeration. Every single time I read Howl's Moving Castle, I notice something new, a minor detail about the cake Sophie devours visiting Martha or a crinkle in the craggy, turnip face of the scarecrow. I will always love this book, its world, and its characters. That said, this is only a glowing review of Howl's Moving Castle. Unfortunately, I cannot say I enjoyed the sequels as much, and the movie, while fantastically animated, is not faithful to the book."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I love this story.

If you are not familiar with the story, it is more of a young adult read, and filled with fantasy, magic and good humor. The main character, Sophie, is well-played out in the book, as are Howl and the other characters. I really appreciated the imagination put into this, that included the seven-league boots, and the door that you could use to go to one of four different places.

I finished in within a week of getting it in the mail. It is such a timeless classic. IF you want to compare the cartoon and the book, don't even bother. the movie was adapted from the book, I think the book is way better by all means. the cartoon though is adorable in it's own way and I own that too. I could read this book over and over again. It's got love, adventure, a vain but kind wizard, a fire demon and a young woman cursed to be old by the witch of the waste. IT's a great book about their journey together and how the wizard and the cursed woman fall in love. No swearing, no sex and no horrible violence. It's a great book for adults and kids. It's family friendly to be sure."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"A bit different than the movie, which I loved, but excellent book.

Some of the magic of the book was lost for me when that happened.Overall, a delightful read. Lighthearted and fun spirited!"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I enjoy Dianna Wynn Jones novels immensely. This book, like all of her work, was wonderful. It was fun, light, and at the same time had a good theme about love and loss. Not to mention, as always, it was very funny."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I started searching for this book because Hayao Miyazaki is releasing his new animation based on it. After reading some of the reviews from this website I decided to give a try and bought the book. Before I open the book, I only thought of it as a guide for the movie that I want to see. But after reading the first chapter, I couldn't put the book down and finished it in one day. Jones is a wonderful story teller that gave her characters life and personality within the story. The characters are far more interesting than the Harry Potter series and they made me laugh so hard while reading it. It's easy reading aiming at the teen group, but as an adult myself, it's a great short reading to escape from the busy reality. However, I do agree that the ending is a bit abrupt."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"This is such a charming little book. I purposely didn't read the back blurb and as such wasn't sure what to expect when I began the book (just had some vague memory of positive comments about the story) and I was continually surprised by the plot twists and turns. It's been far too long since I've read something that was pleasant through and through. I enjoyed Sophie's go with the flow attitude (can't say as I'd be nearly as accepting and pleasant as she initially was with her transformation!) and her quirky sense of humor. Howl, the cad, was a great character. Very selfish and self-centered and almost childishly funny at times, he managed to worm his way into my good graces by giving Michael & Sophie a home without conditions or questions."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Sophie Hatter lived in Market Chipping with her two sisters.

I obviously need to read more of Jones' books."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Even a short study of fairy tales will show that in any family of 3 siblings, the youngest will make his or her fortune, but the eldest will come off worst - Beauty and the Beast, Cinderella, and Puss in Boots, to name three - and Sophie Hatter, eldest of the three Hatter sisters, has been very well educated indeed; so much so that upon her father's death, the sisters discover that he was deep in debt over their school fees. Sophie has always backed up Fanny, her stepmother, in working to make sure that Martha, the youngest, is prepared to make her way in the world; it's no surprise that Fanny has arranged for Martha to study with Mrs. Fairfax (a good witch), Lettie to be apprenticed in a pastry shop, and Sophie in the family hat shop.Sophie gets very lonely trimming hats, being set apart as the boss' daughter, and throws herself too much into her work - although she pays attention to customers' gossip about Wizard Howl, who's said to steal the souls of young girls and eat their hearts. On May Day, Sophie finally ventures out to visit Lettie at the pastry shop - but Lettie and Martha have swapped places on the sly. *Lettie's* the one who wants to go on learning, while Martha wants to socialize, settle down, and raise a big family. They're both worried about Sophie having hypnotized herself with the theory that she can't amount to anything, being the eldest. :)Before Sophie makes up her mind to rebel, her future takes a new turn: the Witch of the Waste comes to call at the hat shop, looking for the upstart 'Miss Hatter' - and curses Sophie, aging her from her twenties to her eighties, with the added touch that Sophie can't speak of the spell to anyone who doesn't know it already. Sophie faces up to the challenge - 'of course I shall have to do for her when I get the chance' - and walks out of the hat shop on the spot to seek her fortune. With no clear destination in mind, she seeks out Howl's castle just outside town.Being old is the making of Sophie; she doesn't care anymore about being embarrassed, and is a *very* outspoken old woman indeed, and bossy - not at all the downtrodden mouse she was becoming in the hat shop. She bullies her way past Michael, Howl's young apprentice, and takes a seat by the hearth, claiming to be waiting for Howl (after all, he's only interested in young girls). Calcifer, the fire demon under contract to Howl, can see the Witch's spell, and offers her a deal - if she'll stay and find a way to break his contract, he'll figure out how to break the spell. And how will she make an excuse for staying? Well, Howl may be a wizard, but this *is* a bachelor household. 'I'm your new cleaning lady, of course.' :) (What better excuse for searching the place - and just generally being nosy?)Nice touch: 'heartless Howl' isn't *evil*, and he only devours the hearts of young girls in a manner of speaking. As Michael says, 'We've had lawsuits, and suitors with swords, and mothers with rolling pins, and fathers and uncles with cudgels. And aunts. Aunts are terrible. They go for you with hatpins.' Howl cultivates a bad reputation professionally mainly to keep customers from imposing on him, but it's not working..."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"&#65533;Howl&#65533;s Moving Castle&#65533; by: Diana Wynne JonesWould you like to read a book with wizards, witches, spells, and fire demons?

The open ending also allows for the reader to make his/her own assumptions about what will happen to Sophie/Howl.Even though this may not be the best book you'll ever read, it is a highly entertaining piece of light reading for in between weightier works.

I recommend it for anybody that wants to have a good time, because you will have a good time."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Possibly reissued to capitalize on the Harry Potter frenzy, this story will certainly appeal to many of his fans. Sophie is doomed to learning the family hatter trade while her two younger sisters go off to have adventures. Sophie is afraid to even visit them as a strange castle which moves through the air has appeared in the kingdom. Supposedly the owner, Wizard Howl, likes to suck out the souls of young girls. Then one day a wicked witch turns Sophie into an old woman and she ends up taking refuge in Howl's castle. The characters are delightful, especially the fire demon who lives in Howl's fireplace. The different puzzles the plot presents - like who exactly is Howl and why is the fire demon bound to him and why was Sophie enchanted - keep the reader turning pages. Humorous situations constantly arise which would make this a good read-aloud for upper elementary students, also. The magic doesn't feel contrived as a tactic for moving the story along. It seems perfectly reasonable for a pair of seven league boots or an invisibility cloak to appear when needed. The ending may require a second reading as things moved along rather quickly at that point as the pieces of the puzzle came together. The book was designated by the American Library Association as a \\"Best of the Best in Young Adult Literature, 1966-1992.\\" The primary audience would be middle school/junior high, although high schoolers and adults will also find it a quick, entertaining read."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Hands down this is one of my favourite books. The first time I read it was two years ago, most of it while sitting in my high-school library laughing out loud and disturbing the peace. It's just so hilarious and completely absorbing. I fell in love with Howl. I re-read it just now, and I've decided Howl is the epitomy of what I want a guy to be like. I'm quite enthralled with his and Sophie's relationship. There are so many precious moments in the novel, namely the green slime, Howl cathing a cold, and the scarecrow. It's so imaginative and original, yet familiar. You can picture everything, and yet it's not at all over-descriptive. It even has a clever little allusion to a Hamlet. I rarely re-read books unless they're very special to me, as is this one. And I discovered a lot of little things I missed the first time around. In fact, you don't even need to like fantasy to like this book. I think it has a little something for everyone in it. And it has one of the most beautiful, non-cheesy, non-cliched romances I've ever read."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"There was only one thing about this book that I thought could improve. It took a little while until the story got tremendously suspenseful. Bul it was never the slightes bit boring. I highly disagree about the age group of this book. This book is the kind of book that can be highly interesting to both kids and adults. I would recomend this book to everyone. Diana's books are so much better than \\"Harry Potter\\". This was probbably the most suspensful book I'v ever read! I hope she makes another sequel besides \\"Castle in the air\\". (that book was even better!)"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Once again Diana manages to write a captivating and suspensful novel. Throughout the duration of the story,I found myself hoping for sophie to be restored to her normal self. Diana is rather wicked, though, in the way she ends her novels. I always want to know what happens to the beautifully developed characters next, like for example in charmed life what happens to cat or Gwendolen?"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Sophie Hatter is the eldest of three daughters, and lives in a fairytale world. She knows quite well what happens to most elder children: they have the worst luck in the world. When a wicked witch transforms her into an old lady, she goes on a journey and meets the Wizard Howl, his apprentice Michael, and the fire demon Calcifer... and adventure and hilarity ensues!This is the third time I've read Howl's Moving Castle. Every time I read it, I see something new... and I always have a great time. Jones knows how to write a fun narrative!Every character is hilarious, well-rounded, and interesting to read about. The dialogue is snappy, clever, and funny. The prose is generally quite simple, yet well constructed and intelligently written. The plot is the only thing that gets bogged down in the end, but as a general rule, this book is marvelous. Every time I pick it up, I read along at a quick pace, delightedly devouring this book from cover to cover. This is from somebody who generally reads the first few pages of a book and drops it immediately!Like I said earlier, there's only one bad thing about this book, and that is its plot. The spontaneity that makes it delightful also sometimes gets the better of it. I think that Ms. Jones is probably the kind of writer who flashes along while writing, pouring out a first draft very quickly and then going back to edit. To me, the story reads like a little-changed quickly-written narrative -- because it's full of awkward bits, things that should make sense and don't (such as the final realization about the location of two important missing persons), and plot devices that are either too vague or overly complicated (or both at once).(SPOILERS FOLLOW. I have tried to keep it vague, but read at your own risk.)Take the dimension through the black-blob door, for example. It breaks the magic of the story. I'm not sure whether this is because the reader becomes aware that his/her own world is utterly bereft of real magic, or whether that dimension simply isn't interesting.Another example: the curse is confusing. What is the curse supposed to DO, really? Just return Howl to the castle? That's not frightening at all, as he can hold his own with the villain within it (see Porthaven). Furthermore, why on earth is it important for said curse to fulfill all of the subjects... why so complicated and silly? Why not, \\"When you see this ONE SIGN, then you return!\\" Let's just say that the curse seemed to be tacked on, overly complex, and awkward.Furthermore, why is it that one supernatural being can do so much more than its identical counterpart, ESPECIALLY if it is weaker from old age?(SPOILERS END)But these are small concerns in the end. This is a wholly enjoyable book in every considerable respect. It's great for everyone from kids to adults, and regardless of your age, will leave you with a grin stretching from ear to ear."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"This was a very entertaining book, I didn't put it down until I finished it."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Being the eldest of three daughters, Sophie has made up her mind that she will never amount to anything in life. But when she is cursed by the Witch of the Waste Sophie is forced to set out to seek her fortune. Along the way she meets the cowardly and womanizing Wizard Howl and is taken into his castle. Sophie is tumbled headlong into a whiling adventure of magic and self discovery.I was inspired to read this book by my intense love of Hayao Miyazaki's animated adaption of Howl's Moving Castle. After experiencing both I can honestly say that I enjoyed both despite their differences. Both deviations of the plot boast magic, intrigue, originality and romance. Sophie is a strong spirited heroine with issues in confidence that many girls can relate to. Though Howl is a \\"slitherer-outer\\" as well as a womanizer his faults become endearing.Jones is a tolerably good writer though her novels are meant to be for young adult readers and as such are reasonably simple. Still, she manages vivid descriptions and a compelling plot obviously born of a tremendously creative imagination. Howl's Moving Castle is no typical fantasy novel about witches and wizards.If you enjoyed the movie or are simply looking for a good book I would definitely recommend Howl's Moving Castle!"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"This is one of my favorite books by Ms. Jones, though many of them are great reads. \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" has a fun, busy plot with creative writing and memorable characters. A must-read for lovers of fantasy and magic."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Being a huge fan of the anime, I jumped at the chance to read the book. Normally, people automatically like what they experienced first, but I really loved it. While the movie and the book have their differences, I adore both of them as complimentary to one another.With all the Harry Potter rage, I realize that most fantasy fiction aimed at YA audiences will inevitably be compared to the works of J.K. Rowling, but to be honest, watching those movies never compelled me to read her books. Just not interested...I knew that the anime based on this book would leave out many details--as movies are apt to do--but I was enchanted enough by it to find out the rest. I'm so glad that I did.The Howl and Sophie from the book are so much more fleshed out and flawed than in the movie--Sophie being more of a pain in Howl's butt and vice-versa. In my opinion, this makes them even more relatable. If you think you love the anime Howl, you haven't seen anything yet. The book Howl is way more charming in his sarcastic and shady way--if you have ever found yourself completely enamoured of someone whom you were simultaneously distrustful of, you'll get what I mean. The book Howl is that gorgeous and charming guy that you try to hate but can't say no to, written in a PG way. And let me tell you, I'm not normally the kind of reader with very much patience with overly PG books. This, however was a very imaginable, witty, and all-around enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I too got turned on to Diana Wynne Jones after the Howl's Moving Castle anime. I read her Chrestomanci series first and now I finally read this book. Many reviews have already done a decent summary, Sophie, the eldest of 3 sisters is resigned to the fate of the fairy-tale trope 'eldest child' who stays home and isn't successful. Even from the beginning however, DWJ shows that she's bent on turning tropes on their heads. The step-mom is young, pretty and kind to Sophie. The step-sisters love each other, the most beautiful and beloved sister isn't the main character but one of the other sisters, etc.The main problem I had with the story is that a lot of 'obvious' things weren't obvious at all, especially Calcifer's clues. Even though I knew from the anime what the 'contract' was supposed to be, his hints were so vague that I ONLY knew they were hints because i had knowledge before-hand.Near the ending, a million characters come out of nowhere and it's frustrating when all the readers want to see is Sophie and Howl have their moment with 20 people interrupting and pulling at their sleeves.Howl wasn't a very enticing character and I really wasn't rooting for a romance while reading the book, the 'moment' at the end was super rushed as if DWJ was saying 'Oh yeah, here's the obligatory fairy-tale romance at the end.'All in all i think it was one of DWJ's best efforts. I'd recommend watching the anime first because DWJ is not very descriptive at all, the story is very action-oriented."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"This is an excellent book!

Howl is a wizard who cares a lot about his looks and likes to have several girlfriends. Even though this book is called \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" it's not only about him. It is also about a teenage girl called Sophie who goes in seek of her fortune and ends up in the castle. This book is funny, adventurous, and I give it too thumbs up. Diana Wynne gives full descriptions of what is happening. This book is one of the most lovely book you'll ever read.

It gives so many details along the way, and you really get into the story. This has been my favorit book yet. I would reccomend it to any young reader. I read it faster than any other book yet! I just can't give it enough applause. Sophie is well characterized so you can actually relate to the character, which I like in the book. It is very much a fantasy book, yet you would still enjoy it if you don't like fantasy. All I can say is WOW!"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I first read this book when I was 13 and I still have a battered paperback copy next to my bed! Sophie and Howl are my all-time favorite characters! Mystery, comedy, mistaken identities, magic, and romance all in one. If you like JK Rowling, read DW Jones and find perfection!"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"THis is one of my favorite books! This is one of Dianna Wynne Jones' best. I mean it. The characters are hilariously funny. I love Sophie and Howl. Howl's tantrums, and the way he is so not like an ordinary wizard. Sophie is definitely not a failure. She is great! Calcifer is loveable. With his blue hair, and Howl's coal lump of a heart. This book was just amazing. I've read it four times, and the characters and plot never bore me!"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Every time I read this book I suddenly realize how more of the details are strongly related to the plot.

For sure a lot better than the movie, in a way after reading the book the movie is not that great. Well written. I will repeat myself: Wonderful!!!! :)"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I absolutely LOVED this book.I saw the film first and fell in love with it. I then read the book and fell in love with it too. The book has slight differences but I though both were as good as each other.Howl is an fantastic character, he has so many (as donkey from Shrek would say) layers. He is funny, charming, annoying, vain and many, many other things. You can't help but love him, along with Calcifer.The storyline is very cleaver, and different to anything I have ever read before. Diana Wynne Jones must have an incredible imagination. Even though the storyline is amazing, it is the characters I fell in love with first - always a sign of a good book.This book is classified as child fiction, but I am a 29 year old female and can't rave about it enough.Highly recommended! I am now going to read her other books."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Before I read this book I watched the movie with I fell in love with it.

Perfect for those Harry Potter fans looking for a good read."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"My brother introduced me to the Howl's Moving Castle movie by Miyazaki a few months ago. I loved the movie so much i watched it atleast 2 or 3 times in the same week and still watch it about once a week now. All my fascination with it led me to purchase the book a few weeks later. I'm not a big reader at all but Diana Wynne Jones knows how to keep it interesting. The book has so much more to the story then the movie portrayed. It had more twists and surprises that kept you wanting to continue reading. I finished the book in 3 days... which for me... is a huge success story. I enjoy the characters so much and relate so much to Sohpie's personality. I definantly would suggest anyone and everyone to read this tale."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I absolutely loved this book more than anything else I've ever read. Reading it was actually just a floop. When I heard that Hayao Miyazaki was coming out with a movie based on a book I had decided to read it and was completely blown away. It was beautiful and funny and the characters were just magical. There was nothing about this that I could say I hated.Here's to the sweetest fairytail like coupling I've seen in ages! Go Howl and Sophie!"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I bought this book after watching Hayao Miyazaki's animated version, and I absolutely adore it! Each character is distinct and likeable, and the plot offers a very different twist to a modern-day fantasy tale. After reading other (what I would call) flat fantasy series like 'Lemony Snicket' and 'Narnia' (both of which I don't find compare to the charm of 'Harry Potter'), 'Howl's Moving Castle' is a welcome relief that offers substance with its story - the magic itself lies in the wonderful characters. I only wish there was more!After reading 'Howl's Moving Castle' I am definately going to pick up any and all other books by this author. Here's hoping to Sophie & Howl popping up in future novels."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"This was a really good book, and I think its obvious why such a talent as Miyazaki would be attracted to it. It did remind me of his films, especially with its subtlety. Ok, it's not deep reading for adults, but the characters really stick with you. I am in graduate school right now, and I can honestly say this is probably the most fun I've had reading in months."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Exciting, funny, and poignant in turn, this book is consistently charming - and there's never a dull moment.Sophie Hatter lives in the town of Market Chipping. She is the eldest of three daughters, and feels that this circumstance is certain to result in a boring life for her. How wrong she was! A curse is placed on Sophie by the Witch of the Waste, changing her from an eighteen year old girl to an old lady. Feeling that she has nothing to lose now, Sophie slips away from her hat shop and heads off to seek her fortune. Outside Market Chipping, she encounters a dog, a scarecrow . . . and Howl's castle. Howl is a mysterious wizard whose castle drifts about the hills outside the town. He is much feared by the peeople of Market Chipping, not least because he is said to devour the hearts of young girls. Sophie enters the castle and meets Howl's fire demon, Calcifer. Calcifer recognises that Sophie is under a curse, and offers to lift it from her if she finds a way to break his contract with Howl. Sophie agrees, and stays in the castle as Howl's cleaning lady so she can hunt for the information she needs. Then Sophie meets Howl . . . and gets drawn deeper and deeper into the lives of Howl, Calcifer, and Michael, Howl's apprentice. Howl, too, is under a curse from the Witch of the Waste. Can he avoid the curse? And what will happen to him and the kingdom of Ingary if the Witch cannot be defeated?The characters in Howl's Moving Castle are wonderful. Howl is vain and cowardly, a slob and a \\"slitherer-outer\\" - but as the book continues, we learn that he is far from being the evil wizard he would like everyone to believe he is. Much of the poignancy of the story comes from learning just why Howl is the way he is. Sophie is brave, determined, and kind, but capable of being very fierce. She is far from stupid, but she is rather naive at times. Her realisation of the freedom that being an old lady offers her is delightful. The lesser characters are all distinctive, and very enjoyable, particularly Calcifer.I found the setting very well done, with enough detail to allow you to imagine it all satisfactorily, but never getting bogged down in description. The plot is a lot of fun, though it may be too subtle in some parts for younger readers to appreciate fully. It is highly imaginative, and moves along at a good pace. It is far from predictable, too; but by the end, everything is resolved satisfactorily. The problems of Sophie and her sisters, Howl, Calcifer, the dog, the scarecrow, and the kingdom, are all solved, and I felt really happy for the characters that they were.If this book is not already considered a classic, it deserves to be - and it's just as much fun for adults as it is for children."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I watched the movie before reading the book.

Howl's Moving Castle follows the tale of a young woman named Sophie Hatter. Or, at least she used to be young, until one day the wicked Witch of the Waste pays a call at that Sophie's family's hat shop. Before Sophie knows what has happened, she finds that she is a ninety-year-old woman who is setting off to seek her fortune (despite being the eldest of three girls, and, therefore, doomed to failure). Nothing turns out as Sophie expects, not in the least, as she finds herself the cleaning lady to the wizard Howl. She is confronted with dubiously-labeled spells in the bathroom, green slime and a fire that is much more than it seems. Not even his castle is straight-forward, as it moves across the country and has a door that leads to four different places.Diana Wynne Jones is a science-fiction and fantasy writer who has been publishing novels for over thirty years. Jones specializes in creating worlds rife with magic and adventure. She appeals to readers not just by writing exciting stories, but she manages to master the difficult craft of making her books witty without lowering the tone of the book. Jones also creates captivating characters that readers of all ages can fall in love with.I have lost track of how many times I've read Howl's Moving Castle, but I think it's safe to say that the number is in the double digits. What drew me in the first time I read Howl's Moving Castle was the refreshing take on a fantasy-adventure story. I think it's safe to say that in the last decade there has been a flood of fantasy stories available, and many of them involve wizards going to school. And that can get quite dull. I was delighted at how original this book was. What has kept me coming back has been the fact that every time I read Howl's Moving Castle, I find myself laughing. And even though I know quite well how the book is going to turn out, I am always excited to get to the next part and honestly can't put it down. As a matter of fact, I'm going to have to cut this review short, because I'm almost to one of the most exciting parts now!"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"This book is very cleverly written.

It sort of combines medieval life with magic so that it is a fantasy novel, and it is a historical fiction novel. Of course, you find out later in the book that it is certainly fiction, and certainly fantasy, but it is definitely not historical. The characters are funny, especially Sophie, who even as an old person doesn't let life get her down. I think this a good book for anyone who likes a good plot with magic and humorous characters. The vocabulary is not too complicated, so it is a good kid's gift, but if you are giving it as a gift, then include the sequel, Castle in the Air.

A lucky find at a booksale (50c, can't beat the price), it's the story of Sophie, the eldest of three daughters and thus, she assumes, born to screw up. Everyone knows the eldest is the one to make mistakes so the youngest can win the prince and prize. She is cursed by a witch to become an old woman (from 18 to 75 in the blink of an eye), and makes her way to the moving castle of the disreputable wizard Howl. Sophie is a wonderful character, I thought she was funny and intelligent and aware of her shortcomings, which was nice. I really didn't want to finish this book, I wanted to be with the characters more and see what happens. All ends well, as might be suspected, and you will have a guaranteed good time reading it."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Have you ever wanted to own a hat shop? No, probably not, seems a little dull. Well, how about trade bodies with your sister? Or, Be a maid for a wizard? Maybe, make a deal with a fire demon? Walk in seven league boots?

Well, the best answer I can supply is that it has a sort of rare, spunky quality that makes it a fairytale, just twisted around so you can relate to it. I have never met anyone who has not enjoyed this book. In fact, most people, like me, love it.The tale can be a bit confusing, which is why it turns out all the more satisfying. This also gives it its re-read factor. I guarantee you will not pick up everything the first time you read, but after that you will discover little clues and portions you wouldn't have noticed otherwise. It also suits readers of all ages.The storyline is bold and new, though it has the familiarity of an old fairytale. It will not bore you with never-ending descriptions of things you don't care about. You will want to know what happens to the characters, particularly Howl and Sophie, since they have such strong personalities.All of this authors books are great, with a unique writing style that is humorous and vivid.The only thing I can say is, if you haven't already picked up Howl's moving castle, go! Now! You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"The only reason I don't give this five stars is because it's abridged.

To others who have seen the anime prior to reading the book: the book is quite different in all but basics (yes, it's still about a highly relatable girl named Sophie who is turned into an old woman, and becomes the housekeeper of a vain, histrionic, but entirely lovable wizard), there are many differences, such as Sophie's sister's playing a much larger role, minus the vague backdrop of war, and numerous delightful twists. But the biggest difference is this: clich&eacute; as it sounds, the book is BETTER!I realize that it is a teen/tween book, but it has an enormous appeal for adults as well, on top of weaving fabulously complex, engaging characters into a highly exciting plot, it's also immensely funny, humor ranging from laugh-out-loud comedy, to subtle, almost Austen-esque wit sure to keep you smirking all throughout.

I thought the book itself would be no where near as good as the movie. After reading it, I really have to say that the book surpasses the movie by a long shot. It is written extremely well, it is easy to keep up with and really holds your attention. The characters are a bit different in the book compared to the movie, and you also get so much to each of the characters.If you loved or even liked the Miyazaki production, I would highly recommend reading this book! If you haven't watched the movie but would like to, I'd suggest watching the movie first. Even if you read it first, the story lines are relatively different, as well as some of the characters, so you'll be surprised to see how they are different, especially if you watched the movie first. :)"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Sophie Hatter, being the youngest of three sisters, has resigned to her fate of a boring life- because as fairytale rules normally go, eldest siblings rarely ever do anything worth writing about(especially when they aren't even the daughters of poor woodcutters, which might have given some chance of success). Then one night, she unknowingly crosses paths with the fearsome Witch of the Waste, who places a terrible curse on Sophie.....she makes Sophie old.Emboldened by her new outlook on life (because old people be can quite mean and get away with it), Sophie decides at last to set out and seek her fortune....and that's only the beginning of this wonderful book.I had never heard of this book until a long time after the movie had come out. Being a fan of Miyazaki (like everyone else familiar with his name), I had been in a constant state of excitement to see his new movie- which had such an interesting title. There was only one problem: after seeing the movie, I found I didn't like it much at all. Then, months or even a year after seeing the movie, I found the book.It's lovely.It has the kind of humor that you can't help but laugh audibly at. Just thinking about it brings a smile to my lips.Even with my habit to re-read my most beloved books, there is no other book that I've read more times than this.There are a couple of chapters that drag a little in the late middle, but not unnecessarily.It's a book for everyone, full of humor, and fun, and good characters.

Yes, it is different than Hayao Miyazaki's film adaptation, but both are great, in my opinion. Plus, right now the Kindle version is only $2.00!

The book explores so many great themes that I can discuss with my kids: duty vs. personal fulfillment, youth and beauty vs. age, perception vs. reality, gender roles and their reversals. I have re-read and re-heard this story many times, and each time I notice some new detail that makes the story's complex plot hold together even more tightly.

But all in all a funny lovable book and once your done check out the movie you'll see why I'm a bit disappointed in the book."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I have been a fan of Diana Wynne Jones for such a long time, I cannot even remember when I picked up my first book by her (though I can remember that book was The Year of the Griffin). So when I saw a commercial years ago for Miyazaki's version of Howl's Moving Castle I almost fainted, as I was obsessed with him at the time, the same time I considered Wynne my ultimate favourite author. Of course at the time I hadn't actually gotten to reading Howl's Moving Castle (Wynne has written a lot of books), but because of the movie, the idea of reading it got planted in my head.When I eventually first read the book I was blown away by just how good it was, just how much better it was than the movie (although I love that as well), to the point where the magic of the movie just doesn't hit me, because the book has it amplified. So when I had a chance to actually purchase a copy of the book, I jumped.I began to reread this book this time around because none of the books I had on hand were good before bed. To begin with I love Wynne's prose style, it is the epitome of comfort read for me, and a joy to read out loud to others. Sophie as a character is very sensible, in fact she's too sensible, so sensible it gets her into trouble, because she lets herself get trapped into situations that she could easily get out of. She is the eldest sister so all lore tells her she shall make nothing of herself is she tries to make for her fortune, but then she is forced to do just that when the Witch of the West comes around for some reason and curses Sophie with an old woman's body.As soon as she leaves she ends up with the wicked Howl and that's where things of course get good. Being an old woman gives Sophie a burst of confidence to show her true personality (instead of just being sensible) and she bullies her way into the hearts of the characters who live with Howl. These characters are also a joy. Having read the Chrestomanci books now, Howl reminds me a lot of flamboyant Christopher Chant, and the connection between worlds also seems like an echo of that idea.The plot is also so layered and complicated, yet is told so simply that it boggles my mind and is a show to Wynne's genius.--If you loved the Miyazaki's movie, you need to read this book. It has the magic of the book multiplied by about a hundred. If you love prose in the style of Diana Wynne Jones or Patricia C. Wrede, you need to pick up this book because it is just in that style while being a masterful fantasy story"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Originally published in 1986 Howl's Moving Castle tells the story of Sophie Hatter, a young woman working in a hat shop in the little town of Market Chipping, in the magical kingdom of Ingary. Early on in the story Sophie is transformed into an old crone by a powerful witch, and as a result leaves the town, ultimately becoming the cleaning lady for the notorious wizard Howl in his moving / hovering castle, where she meets not only Howl, but also Michael, his apprentice and Calcifer, his fire demon with whom Sophie makes an important pact.What's good about it:The book contains superb creations of imagination: the moving castle itself with its portals to other words, the fire demon Calcifer, seven-league boots, invisibility cloaks, living scarecrows, talking animals, and spells which can go comically wrong among other things all combine to make the book an entertaining read.Diana Wynne Jones used the portal to modern Wales in a way that reminded me of the wizard-world hidden among everyday muggles in Harry Potter, and I liked it for the same reason. It explores the idea that there is more than what we, in our world, can see and experience. Maybe it's possible that there are magical worlds out there that we are completely unaware of and if we just opened our eyes we could be introduced to wonders we had never imagined. It's an idea I loved and dreamed about constantly as a child, as an adult I can reconnect with those feelings through books such as this one.The writing flows well and is easy to read and understand. She doesn't use excessive amounts of description, which I think allows readers to use their own imaginations, something that can only be a good thing in a children's book!What's not so good about it:I found the behaviour and motives of some of the characters - Sophie in particular, to be unrealistic. She seems to be completely ok with the fact that she has just been aged about 50 years in a couple of minutes and makes few attempts to change or to be changed back. Her personality also deteriorates as she is aged and she becomes almost a stereotypical grumpy old woman who hits things with her walking stick and mutters to herself about her housemates (Sophie does reflect herself on her personality change so I assume that it was a part of the spell, however, regardless of that I didn't enjoy Sophie as an old woman as much as I did Sophie as a young woman).All in all:A good read, entertaining and amusing, although not laugh-out-loud funny. This was the first book of Diana Wynne Jones's which I have read and it did encourage me to go looking for more of her works."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I've been avoiding reading this because I really dislike Studio Ghibli's art (not their stories, just the art.) Well, after one more glowing review flitted through my life, I finally ordered it from the library.Frankly, I would have read it in one sitting were it not for out of town company this weekend.While the characters were all engaging, and had their own lives and voices, it was the crafting of the story that blew my hair back. Nothing was left behind, nothing was unresolved and NOTHING WAS OBVIOUS. I'm 48, I can see a church by daylight. It's true, I did spent sometime trying to second guess the author, but the story telling here is so tidy I can only express my awe with speechless gaping. Kudos to Mrs Wynne Jones!The scary bits were actually scary, the romantic bits left me smiling and the adventure was non-stop. I've put it on my next book order so I can read it again and again."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I like Diana Wynne Jones' sense of humor and her characters. She is endlessly inventive in a very satisfying way. (A lot of her work reminds me of Terry Pratchett, another favorite.)But, this book is intricate, complex and at times exhaustingly complex. That's OK, but be warned that this book demands a high level of patience and application, which may or may not be consistent with your reader's skills and aptitudes. On the other hand, this is certainly a big step up from the usual middle grade read, so it is a great next step for a growing reader."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Sophie Hatter is certain she is doomed to a boring life. As the eldest child, she is bound to fail while her younger sisters go on to happiness. This inevitability seems to come to fruition when their father dies. Lettie, her middle sister is sent to apprentice at the town's bakery where she is likely to catch a fine husband, and Martha, the youngest, is sent to Mrs. Fairfax to apprentice the witch and learn her spells and power. Sophie, fatefully enough, is stuck managing the family hat shop with her step-mother. Resigned to her woeful inheritance, Sophie breaths life into her work, creating hats of beauty that bring in business from all corners. Intrigued in her skills, The Witch of the Waste pays a visit to the shop, where she ends up cursing Sophie with old age, while ensuring that she won't be able to tell a soul. Sophie determines that there's little point in staying around, and decides to strike out and seek her fortune. As her fortune would have it, she ends up at Howl's door.This book. I loved this book. It was so much fun, full of fantasy and wonder, I honestly don't have a bad word to say about it. This is the kind of book that makes me cry over not having read it as a child, and I want to push it into the hands of anyone and everyone I know who loves middle grade and fantasy, no matter their age. Diana Wynne Jones's writing is so very whimsical and smart. I love middle grade authors that are so utterly intelligent. I feel like too many times the age group gets written down to, but not in this case. In fact, the characters in Howl's Moving Castle aren't even middle grade themselves! Sophie is eighteen (or about 90, respectively), Howl is in his 20s; in my mind Howl's Moving Castle brilliantly includes characters of all ages, managing to write them faithfully to their differences and similarities.Sophie is timid, and lacks confidence as a young woman, but almost instantly upon becoming 90, she sheds the uncertainties and delicacies of youth. She doesn't have to be self-conscious of the things a teenager does, and so Sophie allows herself to be the hardened, nosey, insistent woman she really is. I love it. I love that Sophie is constantly doing things she knows will upset Howl, but she never lies about them when he confronts her, she just owns up. Howl, of course, is a wonderful character. What he appears to be on the surface, and what he really is underneath don't quite line up, but yet he manages to be completely himself at all times. They're both rather saucy really.The other characters in the castle, Michael and Calcifer, are equally wonderful. Michael is the 15 year old apprentice boy, and Calcifer is the fire-demon who helps to power Howl's moving castle. Calcifer entreats Sophie to stay (and she very much wants to, because honestly, where else would she go?) and break the contract locking him and Howl together. Michael, obviously annoyed with Sophie initially, quickly softens and begins to take to her. So many of the characters in this book seem to have such large hearts, despite their appearances (and possibly their intentions).The story of Howl's Moving Castle is full of magic, whimsy, and spectacle. I loved that while the story stayed strictly tacked on to Sophie, it was very clear that everyone else was having marvelous adventures as well. I find it enchanting that we get to know this, to glimpse these other stories, without really being privy to the details. Also, I found Howl's Moving Castle to be pleasantly unpredictable. I was never sure quite which way the story was going, and I loved that Sophie and the others seemed to figure things out before I did. I hate always being the first to know! I really couldn't recommend Howl's Moving Castle more, and I'm certain I'll be reading it again in years to come."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Howl's Moving Castle is an enthralling yet slow read so you must be patient with it. The story starts in a small village called Market Chipping and the lead character is Sophie. She is one of three girls and once their father is gone they are left with their step-mother Fanny. Fanny has \\"big plans\\" for the girls and divides them off to occupations she believe best suits them. Sophie is stuck making hats at her parent's shop.As the story twists on Sophie finds she can magically enchant the hats and make them do whatever she pleases for the people who wear them. However, there is a Magic Castle that moves about the border of Market Chipping that is said to house a Wizard by the name of Howl. The story proceed and after Sophie gets turned into an old woman by a witch she takes the initiative to hunt down Howl and get him to change her back.The story continues and Sophie and Howl have the basic \\"frenemy\\" relationship as she resides in his castle as his cleaning lady. He puts on constant tempter tantrum and is a man who loves the chase in the game of love. There is a romantic twist at the end to surprise all readers.The age group of this read seems to be targeted more to young adults due to of the amount of romantic altercations. However, the novel instills valuable lessons and is great for young children as well because of the friendly ways that it teaches life-long values.The tale proves that inner beauty is truly what counts at the end of the day and that a person should never judge a book by it's cover."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Howl's Moving Castle has been one of my favorite books. Its characters are intriguing, and I feel that I always want to learn more about them. The main character, Sophie, works in a hat shop, and considers herself unlucky because she is the eldest of three sisters. She watches her sisters settle into apprenticeships while she stays behind to run the hat shop. By mistake she insults an evil witch and is transformed into an elderly lady. She flees into the wastelands beyond her town, searching for a way to break the spell. There she comes upon a moving castle that introduces her to a magical world. The book doesn't contain a strong plot; it focuses more on developing fascinating characters. One of my favorite characters is a fire demon named Calcifer, who, surprisingly, decides to help Sophie if, in return, she helps him. The world that the author creates is a wonderful book choice for people who have a love for magic, and would like to imagine a new kind of world."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Howl's moving castle by Diana Wynne Jones.Review by Sadie.Sophie Hatter is a young woman with two younger sisters. This book really plays with fantasy and fairytale stereotypes; Sophie thinks she is set up for failure because she is the eldest. The book follows Sophie through her adventure of meeting the evil wizard Howl and making a deal with his fire demon.This book is more character driven and less action packed, but that does not mean it is bad. Howl's fire demon -Calcifer- is my favorite character. He's funny-in my opinion- and in a kind of a weird way kind-hearted, although at first Calcifer seems callous. The only problem I had-no joke it was my ONLY problem with this book- was that the Witch of the Waste was just kind of there; she didn't do that much. This book is slow paced book so if you don't like that kind of book you might struggle."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I think that Howl's Moving Castle was a very fluffy book.There is not much dark stuff in it.

I will check back later in hopes that it reappears."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"in a sentence or so: Sophie, the eldest of three girls, is transformed into an old lady by the Witch of the Waste. while out and about trying to figure out what to do about this predicament, she comes upon the wizard Howl's castle. he has a reputation for eating the souls of young girls, which isn't a big deal to her now that she's an old biddy. after moving in to the castle, however, Sophie finds her fate is more intertwined with the wizard's than she could have possibly known.Sophie Hatter is the stereotypical oldest child - responsible, expert at breaking up fights between her two sisters, and the natural choice as the apprentice for the family hat business when her dad dies and leaves the business to her stepmother. it turns out that Sophie has quite a knack for the hat business, and her responsibilities increase as the popularity of her unique hats increases.Sophie has heard rumors of the Witch of the Waste roaming around her town, but wizards and witches aren't anything unusual for Sophie. her sister was sent as a magical apprentice, and who hasn't heard the stories of the wizard Howl and his devouring of girl's souls? this knowledge, however, was not enough to prevent Sophie from getting quite a nasty spell placed on her after she unknowingly offended the witch. Sophie, in addition to being an old lady now, has a touch of cabin fever from the excessive hours in the hat shop and decides to stretch her geriatric limbs. it is on this stroll she forces her way into Howl's moving castle.Sophie meets Michael, the apprentice of Howl, and he reluctantly lets her stay and warm herself by the fire and rest a bit. no ordinary fire greets Sophie, but rather a fire demon by the name of Calcipher. Calcipher is in an agreement with Howl that he immediately asks Sophie's help breaking so he can gain his freedom. she's not so sure about all this magical business, and she's especially not sure of Howl - who turns out to be an even greater handful than she anticipated. she talks her way into staying in the castle by cleaning and helping with some mending of clothes here and there. Sophie soon finds her place in the castle, but also finds that her fate is tied into Howl and the Witch of the Waste.this was just meh for me. the plot alternated between cleverly revealed and plopped in your lap. the mythology was obviously thought out, but the way it was translated to the reader was not consistent. Sophie alternated between empowered and thoughtful with immature and annoying. i liked the overall idea of the story, the world Jones created, and the idea of the characters...but it just fell flat for the most part. there were some twists or plot points that gave the read some significant bumps on the interest scale, but that definitely ebbed and flowed with clunky parts.fave quote: \\"'Dead?' said Sophie. She had a silly impulse to add, But she was alive an hour ago! And she stopped herself, because death is like that; people are alive until they die.\\" (pg 253)fix er up: some consistency with Sophie's character and the plot would have made a HUGE difference."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I never even knew this book existed before Hayao Miyazaki made his film based on it. That movie is truly one of my favorites.....that being said, after I saw the movie and found out it was based on a book by DWJ, I had to read it. I absolutely loved the book.....and after thinking it over, I realized I loved the book more than the film. You get insight into the characters so much more, and Howl's character is so much more lovable and humorous in the book. I also love the different dimensions that were not included into the movie. The thing is, you have to realize that the book and movie are two completely different things; wonderful on their own levels. DWJ's writing is amazingly smooth and witty, for adults and children. I would recommend this book and the sequels very very highly!! I know I will being reading this book and the others to my children one day."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"In the land of Ingary, it is considered a great misfortune to be born the eldest of three. It means that you are destined to fail, no matter what you do, and Sophie Hatter, a meek little hat shop owner's daughter, firmly believes in this. She herself is the oldest of three in the town of Market Chipping, and her younger sisters are considered far more pretty and talented than she. But Sophie's miserable little world is turned upside down when she is transformed into an old hag by a woman known as the Witch of the Waste, and she leaves the hat shop to seek her fortune in the world. On the way, Sophie encounters a vicious dog stuck in a hedge, a scarecrow she accidentally brings to life, and most importantly, a huge moving castle owned by a wizard named Howl, who has many different rumors floating around the place about him. In the castle, she discovers a fire demon named Calcifer, who is bound to Howl by a contract he cannot tell Sophie about. Calcifer offers to free Sophie from her curse though, and return her to her normal form, if she breaks the contract between him and Howl. Sophie starts to get used to her life in the castle, including Howl's hopeless apprentice Micheal, the odd business the castle runs, and Howl himself and his peculiar little quirks. But the more times goes on, and the more Sophie grows to almost enjoy her time here, she starts to worry...will she ever be able to free Calcifer, and therefore, herself? And more importantly...does she even want to?I found this book absolutely amazing, and I think it is honestly one of the best books I ever read. It definitely kept my attention throughout the whole novel, and I absolutely could not put it down after I started reading it. I believe that anyone who likes fantasy with a more humorous twist should definitely pick this one up.-Jenn"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I would like to say that I enjoyed this book greatly. It is very well written, in rich but comprehensible language. The caracters are interesting, manyfold and very much alive. Howl in the book resembles Howl of Hauru no ugoku shiro. But what I found particularly thrilling was that there are many situations in the book, not included in the movie. I won't tell you what they are, of course, but I guarantee that they are totally worth reading the book and finding out. If you liked the movie, this is definitely the book for you, no matter how old you are. Its atmosphere is incredible, magical. And with just the right amount of romance in it. All in all, it was a wonderful read worth every penny. I've read it once and am going to reread it right now. So, sorry, but I gotta go. Read. Bye."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Like many others I first watched the animated movie of Howl's Moving Castle and was immediately inspired to seek out the book. Although the book is a bit different from the movie I did like both of them equally well.Howl's Moving Castle is the story of Sophie the eldest daughter of a Hatter. Being the eldest, Sophie knows that she has no chance of seeking out any fortune for herself outside of inheriting the hat shop. One day the wicked Witch of the Waste comes into her shop and curses Sophie to become an old maid. Sophie seemingly accepts this fate rather well and decides to seek out her fortune although she believes it to be a doomed endeavor because of her oldest sibling status. Soon Sophie finds herself the cleaning lady of the infamous Wizard Howl in his moving castle. Sophie finds herself making a bargin with the fire demon who moves the castle for Howl, break the demon's contract with Howl, and the demon will remove the Witch of the Waste's curse upon Sophie. Thus Sophie embarks upon a series of adventures which reveal that many of her preconceived notions about the people around her may not be entirely accurate, including those about Wizard Howl and Sophie herself.I found Howl's moving castle to be a delightful read. I am glad to have seen the movie first for although the movie's storyline was different from the book, the similarities were enough that I was able to follow the book with less confusion than I may have otherwise.I believe that anyone who has enjoyed The Wizard of Oz stories, or anyone who enjoys fantasy in general, should definately read Howl's Moving Castle."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Diana Wynne Jones created another great fantasy story.

Sofie is strong, and able to make her way, some days better than others, amidst the machinations and resentments of others. She is one of the most engaging personalities that Jones has created.This is one book that I give as a gift to both teens and adults.

WOW. it's like getting a whole new story. this book has so much to offer readers young and old alike. it's fun and full of whimsical adventure. i highly reccomend this book."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I love this book. I don't think I've ever read something quite so unique. The cast of characters is not one you've likely seen before. It includes a girl with a curse upon her that's made her an 80-year-old woman, a fire demon, a spoiled sorcerer, and his apprentice, so there's no shortage of variety.The characters are truly what brought this story alive for me. They are not without flaws - in fact, Howl would be downright intolerable to live with, and Sophie too at times - but that's what makes them so charming. Much of this story's whimsy comes from its sense of humour. I probably looked like a lunatic, laughing on my own as I read about Howl's bewitched jacket that had grown so large it trailed behind him all the way down the hall. The image of him tugging yard after yard of fabric into the bathroom was hysterical. That said, I've never met a character quite like him. He's vain, fickle and extremely high maintenance, but then he does something small that surprises you, and you wonder if maybe he's a lot more than that beneath it all.The magic of the castle had me pretty enamoured with this world - I would love a house with a door that changed locations so I could visit friends in far away countries if I wanted. That sort of home-made portal is fascinating. The story itself is a meandering sort - you aren't always entirely sure where it's going to lead you. I found it really appealing, like reading a book for children that's actually written by someone whose really well-connected with their inner child. Overall, there's very little I didn't like about it and I'd love to read it again and again."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I loved this book! I loved the the plot, the world of Ingary, the characters and their relationships. Sophie and Howl are such lovable characters. After watching the movie, I decided to try reading the book.

Awesome book."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I had originally seen the movie by Hayao Miyazaki and hadn't even realized that there was a book. I stumbled across it quite by accident and of course had to read it. I have to say, I was pretty pleased with it. Even with my preconceived notions from the movie, I still enjoyed the plot and all the characters in the book.Sophie is the oldest of three girls, and in her world, that means she's due to live an uneventful unlucky life. When a tough break with a witch leaves her looking like an old woman, she leaves the hat shop where she works and wanders, eventually coming upon Howl's Moving Castle. While she's heard horrible things about Howl and young women, she figures since she is old now she should be safe.While staying with Howl she learns some of his secrets and makes friends with Calcifer, a fire demon who is bound to Howl and runs the castle. Along with Michael, his apprentice, Howl has turned this castle into quite the wondrous place. Sophie agrees to help Calcifer in return for his help and becomes Howl's cleaning lady. But will Sophie be able to get back to normal and help Howl with his own problems? There is an evil witch after him and the King wants his help in finding his brother; he may not have the time to return Sophie to normal.The characters in this novel are pretty delightful. I especially love Calcifer. Even though he may just be fire, he's got quite the personality. Sophie and Howl have interesting interactions and its easy to see that despite their annoyances, they like bantering with each other. Even the side characters show some interesting traits; after all, this is a world that accepts magic.The writing, since this is technically a kid's book is on the side of easier to understand. There's not a lot of hard language or concepts in the book. I will say that towards the end of the book the writing gets rushed and hard to follow. I had really enjoyed the book up until that part but I found myself reading in patches near the end just so I could try to make sense of what was going on. I think if Jones had just slowed down and detailed a bit more it would have vastly improved it. Despite the confusion at the end, I'm sure this would make a great book to read to a child.Such a wondrous imaginative book though. I did enjoy it for the most part. I know Jones has some other novels out that have been made into movies and I'll probably look into reading them since I enjoyed this one.Howl's Moving CastleCopyright 1986212 pages"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect from this book, but I loved it. I had a hard time putting it down to go to sleep."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I enjoyed the movie adaptation of this story when I saw it a year ago or so and as is usually the case, the book is better. In fact, they're almost two entirely different stories. The movie maintains the basic characterization and some of the plot points, but it changes other things fairly dramatically. I really enjoyed this story even though I kept hearing the actors' voices from the movie, which I don't think are necessarily fitting for the characters as they exist in the book.I found the characters well drawn and believable even though they remained basically static through most of the story. I also loved the idea of the moving castle and what that would enable those who lived in it to do.This was the first of Jones' novels that I've read and I am definitely open to reading others."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I read this book when I was 10 and loved it,after seeing the movie I was curious to see if the book was as wOnderful as I remembered it.

Howl's Moving Castle is not dark or edgy or complex. It's about a steady young woman and a sorcerer who can be a bit of a diva but is good at heart. There's magic, adventure, battles and plenty of humor. And it teaches that love can prevail- a good lesson for kids to learn these days."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Generally speaking, I love to ready Diana Wynne Jones's books. The characters come to life on the page, and it was a very entertaining read. The concept behind the castle was awesome, and so was Howl and Calcifier. If it wasn't for the fact I liked the characters and the writing style, I wouldn't have rated this so high.Some parts of the book kind of fell a little flat, but that might be because I've read it so many times. I really liked the storyline since it had a lot of action in it. I find this book to be more enjoyable than Harry Potter to be honest, but I have to admit that I love both book series."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"For me, Howl's Moving Castle is without doubt one of the best books on earth - by one of the best authors.Not only does it include one of Diana Wynne Jones' most intriguing and imaginative plots, some of her best hilarious, witty humour, AND a whole new brilliant parallel world, it ALSO has one of history's most attractive males,who can only be likened in terms of desirability to Aragorn or Faramir in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, which is saying something. Howl becomes even more gorgeous everytime I read the book, of which I become more fond on each re-reading. Without giving any plot away, two people in this book I think can only be compared in their enduring popularity to Elizabeth and Darcy!The action is fast,the supporting charecters are great and strangely familiar, the heroine you can really relate to, and Calcifer a charecter not to be missed.Anyone with a sense of humour please read this endearing multi-faceted novel.Please excuse all my gush gush and silly vocabulary, but it really is a great book!"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I must've been 14 years old at the time I discovered this book, quite by accident, in my high school's library. I'd always loved fantasy novels, but when I'd cracked this book open at home that night, I was sucked into an entirely different world (I got in trouble for reading the book instead of doing my homework.). It's been high on my list of favorites ever since, going on 12 years now.It mixed all the best elements of fantasy and fairy tails with something I'd never been exposed to at the time, humor. I've always been a sucker for magic and romance and this combines both in spades. I'll admit, I was intrigued by doorways from one world to another. Add in a self-declared cowardly wizard who really wasn't and a young woman in a old woman's body as the main characters were a perfect match!I'm looking forward to introducing this story to my nephews, and renew my own aquaintence with these engaging characters (I just discovered that there's a sequel!).Like I said, read this book, even if you are an adult. This is an enchanting, engaging book for both youngsters and adults alike."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"The first book I read by Diana Wynne Jones was 'Dogsbody'. I picked it up at a local bookstore, thinking it sounded &quot;okay&quot;. This was a HUGE understatement. Immediately when I was finished,I logged on to &quot;amazon&quot; serching for more of her books. When I began 'Howl's Moving Castle', I thought,&quot;oh boy, a story about the eldest child of three. wow, she sells hats,how exciting. This book doesn't hold a candle to 'Dogsbody'.&quot; I've never been more wrong in my life!! A day or so later, you couldn't pry me away from this book with a crowbar! The characters are all so different, it gives the story a wonderous flair. It is about Sophie, the eldest child, who is cursed by the Witch of the Waste. She enters the moving castle, meeting a slightly timid apprentice, the powerful sorcerer Howl, and, my favorite character, Calcifer a fire demon. Many other characters enter the story, but I will not give away another word of the story.

The characters are so different and interesting that just reading about them will be enough to want more. And the plot is interesting too. Sophie, the main character is changed into an old lady when the horrible &quot;Witch of the Waste&quot; decides that she is &quot;in the way&quot;. Accepting, without too much regret, her new shape, Sophie travels to seek her fortune but instead stumbles upon Howl's moving castle, the home of the &quot;evil&quot; wizard Howl who, rumor had it, would steal and eat young girls' hearts. Being old and thus free of danger from this &quot;terrible&quot; wizard Sophie enters the castle and the adventures begin. My favorite part of the book is Howl's character--how he's so vain, but kind, despite his efforts to hide it, and how his bad temper sometimes gets away with him--which leads to better reading. Read it. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"When I first purchased this Kindle book, it had serious formatting problems. However, all the problems seem to be fixed now, so i'm re-purchasing the book and changing my review.This is a great book.

When you get to the end, you may find yourself surprised, despite the many clues that the author sprinkles along the way.Sadly i found out about Diana Wynne Jones only after she passed away, but I have read several of her books since, and will read many more. Happily, she left us much.If you like Howl (and you will), real also \\"The Castle in the Clouds\\" and \\"The House of Many Ways.\\"-------------------------------Here's my old review, just to provide context for the comments below:This review is for the Kindle version only. Howl's Moving Castle is a great book, but something went wrong with the Kindle version, making it barely readable. The line breaks are all wrong. Paragraphs run together, phrases are cut in the middle. There is no separation of chapters. No table of contents. No cover. It looks like an unedited scan or perhaps unedited conversion from a PDF. I hope the publisher can fix it. Meanwhile, i'm returning my order. If they fix it, i will purchase it again.I recommend you try a sample first before you purchase."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"You may be reading this because you've recently watched the Miyazaki interpretation of Howl's Moving Castle. If you're wondering whether or not you should bother to read the book, the answer is YES!! This is an excellent book, one of my favourites. Miyazaki only skimmed the surface of its depths. He also altered the story and some of the characters so read with an open mind and prepare to fall in love with Sophie, Howl, Calcifer (who, by the way is blue not orange), Michael (not Markl and actually a teenager), and all the magic that goes with them.Diana Wynne Jones is much more subtle with her lessons in the book than Miyazaki is in the movie so don't expect the &quot;war is bad&quot; and &quot;love is good&quot; lessons to be thrown in your face. In fact, there isn't even a war in the book! That was something that was added in the jump from page to screen.Quick, go read the book! (The sequel is Castle in the Air... also very good and ironically the title of another very different Miyazaki film.)"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I'm about halfway through this book, and I love the story. For the content, I would definitely give 4 or 5 stars. However, I feel that people should be aware that there are multiple errors and typos with this Kindle version. I for is, Moth for Both, etc. They don't make the book unreadable, but there have been a few times when I had to reread a sentence to try to figure out what it should say because a typo was making it really confusing."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I, like a great many other people out there, was introduced to this most engaging of novels through the recent release of the Howl's Moving Castle movie. But while I am new to Ms. Jones work, it is something that I will keep close for a long, long time. As a future elementary teacher, this is a book that I plan to read to every class I have in my career, a book I plan to share with my young nephew, and hopefully my own children. As it has proven already, this is a book for ages, years, decades down the line. The story is charming and timeless, the message of honesty and love is elegant, and the characters are unforgettable."},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Before the film made by Miyazaki, (or by his student of some sort, whatever) I've never heard of this book, but since the film wasn't very understandable, I bought this book as a guide to the film. It turns out it's pretty different, a very different sort of fun.In the fantasy land of Ingary, Sophie Hatter is born the eldest of three, which means there you are absolutely unlikely to end up with any sort of fortune. Sophie is then stuck in a hat shop the late Mr. Hatter opened. One day the notorious Witch of the Waste barges into the shop and Sophie, not recognizing this villain, lost her temper on the witch, and got turned into an old woman! She cannot stay, thus begins her weird beyond weird adventure.She goes into Wizard Howl's Moving Castle. The owner of the frightful castle is known to eat up young girls' hearts or souls but Sophie is too tired to care. On the first day she made a deal with Howl's fire demon Calcifer who makes the castle move, for he is has a contract with Howl that will do neither of them any good, and if Sophie breaks the contract Calcifer will in return put an end to Sophie's curse. But since Calcifer can't tell Sophie what the contract is, Sophie has to stay inside the castle.She meets Howl, Michael, and gradually as we read the book, the structure of the characters become obvious: Howl is the rebel-playboy (but isn't he supposed to be, like, the HERO?!), Michael is his nice apprentice, in love with Sophie's sister. Sophie has to cope with her inconvenience being an old woman, the danger outside that involves a likely war between the Witch of the Waste and the King, and the developement of her feelings for Howl.This book is charming, it has wit, and it reminds you of plenty of things you might have encountered on you own before. It's a nice entertainment to pull you out of this world for a moment. Sometimes some things have nothing to do with the plot but are mentioned in good detail and that kind of annoys me, and sometimes the pase suddenly picks up too quickly for you to follow, but you've got to have this book! It's very outrageous, and unbelivable!!!"},{"Title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"A wonderfully crafted fantasy filled with nuance and surprises. No one is quite who or what they seem (sometimes literally), the bad guys have glimmers of humanity and the good guys are packed full of faults. As soon as you finish reading it once, read it through again to pick up everything that you missed.Sophie is the oldest, and therefore unluckiest, of the three daughters of a perfectly respectable hattmaker in a nice little villiage. When her father dies, she resigns herself to a life of toil and stays in the hat shop to learn the trade. Until, that is, a wicked witch puts a curse on her and she must go out into the world to seek her fortune. Almost immediately, she runs into the moving castle of the very wicked Wizard Howl and decides that he can help her if no one else can.If you saw the movie, be forewarned that this is a very different book. Many of the characters are quite different, their motivations differ, even Sophie's curse is a little different. The movie and the book are each very good in their own way, but try to come to the book with an open mind instead of expecting certain things to happen.Diana Wynne Jones has been my very favorite author for the past 15 or so years (ever since I randomly picked up a copy of Charmed Life because the girl on the cover had a pretty dress), but she is just so prolific that I occassionally come across books of hers that I've never read. This, I'm sorry to say, is one of them. It is certainly one of my new favorites, and I recomend it to anyone who enjoys good fantasy writing and/or fairy tales turned on their heads."},{"Title":"Sports Illustrated Special Collector's Edition - Nextel Cup 2005 - NASCAR","review":"........... this mag is a must for any Tony Stewart fan.

Gave personal information. Glad that I made this purchase."},{"Title":"Ancient Iraq","review":"For those who seek a broad view of the history of Mesopotamia, this book is a very good start. Mr. Roux has a deep knowledge of the region, having lived there for many years, and his descriptions of the past makes you desire to be there, walking among the \\"tells\\". The amount of literature he cites and the extensive notes are scholarly. I have read books on the subject by archeologists and assyriologists, and most have been disappointing. This is not the case with this book. I really learned a lot from it.The book begins with an overview of the geography of the land and its climate. Then Mr. Roux describes pre-historical archeological sites, the ceramic styles that give name to the several periods, and successfully introduces the main hypothesis on the development of urban centers, the role of religion, commerce, and so on. The historical period is described with a balanced mix of archeology and text (this is no small feat: most scholars I've read either focus almost exclusively on archeology or on texts). There is a nice introduction to the myths, and Mr. Roux managed to make me want to read cuneiform translations and try to feel how the ancient Mesopotamians felt and lived."},{"Title":"Ancient Iraq","review":"Although it is fairly well known that ancient Mesopotamia was the birthplace of civilization, writing, education, etc., it has received little treatment in terms of accessible books compared to ancient Egypt, Greece, and the Levant; and as a consequence it has a much smaller place in the public imagination, with the negative assessment of Babylon in the Bible being probably the most well-known account of ancient Iraq. Roux's style makes the very unfamiliar setting of the ancient Near East easier to navigate for the non-specialist. Aside from political history, Roux also details the religious, literary, and scientific aspects of Mesopotamian civilization, their impact on the ancient Greeks who eventually came into close contact with the Mesopotamians and how the Greek approach to science differed sharply from the Oriental. The epilogue gives a very lucid, believable narrative of the gradual and tragic vanishing of Mesopotamian civilization beneath the sands where it remained until the 19th century excavations."},{"Title":"Ancient Iraq","review":"This extensive study gives an overview of Mesopotamia from pre-historic times till Christian era. The main focus is on political history sidestepping into architecture, culture and socio-economics. So be prepared for an endless succession of Sumerian, Akkadian, Kassite, Assyrian, Chaldaean alpha-males waging war to expand empires, defending their turf, erecting buildings and statues to celebrate their grandeur and fragile little egos. To me at times it was a bit too much and too tedious. No problem, I just skipped a few centuries or so!Georges Roux deserves a 5-star rating for his work but I only give the book 4 stars because the publisher and editor should have done a better job balancing out the material. Cutting some of the political material, and expanding on art, literature, science etc. (It would have been a good idea to include more translations of original texts). They also could have provided better graphic and photographic material and organized it in a better way. If they would have done that this would have been a breathtaking classic.Having said that the book gives a thorough account of some 8000 years of history in Iraq. I especially was impressed by the scope of vision and depth Mr. Roux possesses. He is able to provide ample insight in the developments from pre-historic hunter-gatherers to the first empires and their inner workings. Showing an extensive knowledge and control over the material.

This edition is supplemented with an extensize ordering of king-lists and political maps."},{"Title":"Ancient Iraq","review":"_Ancient Iraq_ by Georges Roux is a book covering the entire history and culture of Mesopotamian civilization, all three thousand years of it from its prehistory to the final demise of Mesopotamian civilization in the first century A.D.The term \\"Mesopotamia\\" originated with the Greeks and it means \\"the land between the rivers\\" and does not include all of Iraq and all of what we have come to think of as Mesopotamia. Surprisingly the ancient inhabitants had no name covering the totality of the country in which they lived.Though in many ways the inventors of civilization often little remains for the visitor to see of this once great civilization; \\"[t]he dissolving rain, the sand-bearing winds, the earth-splitting sun conspired to obliterate all remains\\" and these desolate ruins \\"offer perhaps the best lesson in modesty that we shall ever receive from history.\\" Part of the reason for the lack of remains is the nature of the Iraqi environment, as the meandering Tigris and Euphrates rivers occasionally change course, isolating once riverside sites as \\"forlorn ruin-mounds in a desert of silt, several miles from modern waterways.\\" Also these ancient towns were built of nothing but mud as stone was rare. At first made of piled-up mud (pis&eacute;) or adobe, as early as the ninth millennium B.C. clay was mixed with straw, gravel, or potsherds and made into sun-dried or kiln-baked bricks.The very nature of the rivers had a lot to do with the origins of Mesopotamian civilization. As the combined flood periods of the two rivers do not occur when it is best for agriculture, fields must be irrigated. To create these canals and maintain them against silting-up require colossal, unending labor of many people, something that sowed both the seeds of local strife and political unity. The effort to maintain canals and to insure an equitable distribution of water reinforced the authority of the original town chiefs, the high priests, and along with the scarcity of fertile land lead to the concentration of power and wealth in a few hands in a few places, to the creation of cities where further technical and artistic achievements could be made, and the invention of writing to record transactions.In many ways the book can be read as the rise, spread, and then the decline and fall of Mesopotamian civilization. It was amazing just how small Sumeria really was; it was a mere 30,000 square kilometers, a bit smaller than Belgium, a narrow strip of land around the Euphrates from about the latitude of Baghdad stretching to the Gulf, with the average city-state less than 3000 square kilometers and at most 35,000 people. Sargon and his Akkadian successors subdued the fractious Sumerian city-states and also conquered the entire Tigris-Euphrates basin and built the first great Mesopotamian kingdom. Though the Akkadian empire only lasted 200 years, collapsing from the pressure of mountain tribes and internal rebellion, it set an important example, as to reconstruct Mesopotamian unity, to reach what we could call its natural limits \\"became the dream of all subsequent monarchs, and from the middle of the third millennium until the fall of Babylon in 539 B.C. the history of ancient Iraq consists of their attempts, their successes and their failures to achieve this aim.\\" The Akkadians greatly enlarged the geographical horizon of Sumer and Sumero-Akkadian culture, supported by cuneiform writing, was adopted by the people outside of Sumeria. In addition the Akkadians forever blended the two historical populations of Iraq (the non-Semitic Sumerians and the Semites), ringed the death knell for city-states, heralded the advent of large, centralized kingdoms, and eroded the power of the temples.Later as a result of the migration of a very large ethno-linguist group, the \\"Indo-Europeans,\\" young energetic nations emerged in and around Mesopotamia. That, plus the involvement of Egypt in Near Eastern politics from 1600 BC onwards meant that history in ancient Iraq was raised to a truly international scale, with Mesopotamian political fortunes as well as its culture and science influencing (and influenced by) foreign powers from then on.The Assyrians played a huge role, though they don't come off well, as Roux wrote of the greed and ambition of Assyrian kings, of \\"their typical oriental desire to cover themselves with glory, to pose as invincible demigods in front of their subjects,\\" that a combination of religious views and greed lead to \\"brigandry and occasional massacres\\" in their attempts to create an empire, which was an \\"act of gangsterism but also a crusade.\\" Though they did preserve Sumero-Akkadian-Babylonian culture, they left the Near East as a whole impoverished as they took much, gave little, cared little for the advancement of their subjects, and as a result of their wars the rich land of Egypt was forever lost and the Phoenicians lost their rich maritime and colonial empire to the Greeks.After a last flowering under Nebuchadrezzar II and a brilliant but short-lived \\"Neo-Babylonian\\" period Babylon fell without resistance to the Persian conqueror Cyrus. The Persians however did not destroy Babylon or other cities, and there are monuments and inscriptions dating from the Achaemenian, Hellenistic, and Parthian periods testifying to a partial survival of Mesopotamian civilization down to the 1st century AD. Why the slow decline and ultimately vanishing of this civilization? The three main reasons were the absence of any real national Mesopotamian government, the foundation by Alexander and his successors of new cities competing with and eventually superseding the older cities, and more than anything the massive linguistic, ethnic, religious, and cultural changes introduced by waves of Persian, Greek, Aramaean, and pre-Islamic Arab invaders, peoples who could neither be kept at bay nor assimilated. While previous invading peoples such as the Amorites and the Kassites found a young, vigorous culture superior to the own, one which they eventually adopted, later invaders felt that Mesopotamia offered relatively little, that it was a fossilized culture largely perpetuated by a few priests in a few temples; basically, it had died of old age."},{"Title":"Ancient Iraq","review":"With the current problems and recent war in modern Iraq, I wished to find out more about ancient Iraq and the civilisations that have now become ghosts of history.

I highly recommend this book for the serious reader."},{"Title":"Ancient Iraq","review":"Well OK, it was about ten minutes ago.... but that aside here are my initial thoughts at finishing this book.First off Georges Roux seems to have had a very ordered and academic mind (which isn't so surprising when you find out he graduated in Medicine). The amount of effort that went into this work is quite visible. The story of him working for the Iraq Petroleum Company is well known enough not to have to be dwelt on at length here but it seems a serendipitous employment given his fascination with the history of the 'Cradle of Civilisation'.The work itself flows in a scholarly but not too demanding style that assists the non-expert to feel like he is getting to grips with his subject. In fact the book has its genesis in articles he wrote for an educated though non historian audience - the readership of the company magazine Iraq Petroleum. And even today I'd say that this is still the sort of person who will get the most out of it. While it's probably an excellent resource for the person forging a career in academia and something they probably will have had given to them as assigned reading I believe that it is the educated layman, the armchair history buff who has read his Herodotus, Arrian and the like that will get the most out of this great primer.Starting with a necessarily brief though not neglected look at the pre-history of the Iraq region the book then takes the reader on a chronological journey from around 3300BC through to around the year dot. The latter phases of this time - the Seleucid/Sassanian/Parthian are dealt with less fully but given they were a time of stagnation for the cultures the author was mainly treating with that is less of a problem than it may have been.The maps in my edition are very useful as are the chronological comparison lists and the bibliography will provide a lot of value to the academic as it comprises over thirty pages in my copy.This work has been printed and reprinted in versions that have benefited from new discoveries. My copy - somewhat of a relic itself - dates from 1969 and if I get the chance to pick up a later edition cheaply I'll certainly take the opportunity.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Ancient Iraq","review":"For anyone interested in ancient history, look no further. Ancient Iraq is a superb introduction to the first civilized city-states complete with action, adventure and intrigue. Although there are not many plates or maps, I recommend \\"The Cultural Atlas of Mesopotamia and the Ancient Near East\\" as an excellent companion. No Library should be without them."},{"Title":"Ancient Iraq","review":"I have read this book during my engagement on the huge construction project in Iraq.

A good example is Hittite history, if I had read BryceThe Kingdom of the Hittitesbefore I read Macqueen's,The Hittites, Macqueen's book would have been more informative. Roux's coverage of this area is excellent. He knows his subject well and puts it together in a way that is both interesting and extremely knowledgable. I am fully ready for the the Babylonians and the Assryians and know that now I have enough information to move on. I am familiar enough with the Era to know that Georges Roux knows his material. This is a facinating period of history and no one should miss this book. Evelyn Coon"},{"Title":"Ancient Iraq","review":"This book reads very much like textbook. However if you are looking for a beginners book on the history of Iraq, as i was, this is a great book. You may fall asleep while reading it from time to time but you will also learn a lot about the civilizations or early(relative term i guess)Iraq."},{"Title":"Ancient Iraq","review":"No one was more surprised than Georges Roux himself when people worldwide began demanding reprints from his articles in the now-defunct &quot;Iraq Petroleum&quot; magazine. But he shouldn't have been - the literature surrounding ancient Mesopotamia tends either to scholastic obscurity (and textbook expense) or to such a broad scope that oversimplification is necessary just to keep the story within two covers.Not so Roux's wonderful overview. After his retirement from a leading British pharmaceutical company he found the necessary leisure, and access to Parisian university libraries, to compile this volume of history. The first edition was written in the 60's, the second in the 80's after some remarkable finds greatly expanded the continuity of the original, and the third, this volume, in the early 90's. In this, he states that the English version has actually leapfrogged the original version in his native French.The book traces the civilizations of ancient Mesopotamia from the Paleolithic period through Sumer and Akkad, the Assyrian empire, Babylon, the glory of the Old Testament period, and to the final takeover by the Hellenistic Greeks. This sweep of history comprising some six-plus millennia cannot, of course, be dealt with comprehensively within the bounds of a single volume; nevertheless, Roux has managed to spotlight the extant periods without losing the story's overall continuity, a considerable achievement.This is, in this reviewer's opinion, the best single-volume introduction to ancient Mesopotamian history on the market today."},{"Title":"Ancient Iraq","review":"Georges Roux stated that his goal in writing \\"Ancient Iraq\\" was to provide the layman reader with a cohesive introduction to the history of ancient Mesopotamia, incorporating archaeological and historical finds up to 1992. In this regard, I think Roux succeeded splendidly, and he did so by pointing out and explaining general patterns in Mesopotamian history. This book really breathes life into the ancients and allows the reader to see beyond the cold and lifeless sculptures and tablets.Although the book is full of interesting topics, what really struck me was how long the Sumerian culture managed to exist in some form or another despite the successive waves of foreign invaders. To survive 3000 years in such unstable conditions really demonstrates how sophisticated and influential Sumero-Akkadian culture was at that time.As the title suggests, \\"Ancient Iraq\\" deals primarily with ancient civilizations that resided within the confines of modern-day Iraq. As a result, the Sumerians, Babylonians, and Assyrians ae given center stage, while other cultures in the Near East, such as the Egyptians, Hittites, and Persians are only briefly reviewed, despite their interaction with the Mesopotamians.Pictures, maps, and various timelines are also included in the book. Unfortunately, pictures of artifacts are either B&W; photos or simple line drawings, and I felt this presentation really failed to bring forth the beauty inherent in such objects. Many of the same photos are presented in color in another book (\\"The Cultural Atlas of Mesopotamia\\"), and the difference is like night and day. Nevertheless, I should say that Roux's narrative does not suffer at all from this slight shortcoming, and most readers probably will not care about the visual aids.All in all, I found this book to be quite engaging and believe that anybody interested in ancient Mesopotamia should have this book in their personal library. It was a another reviewer's opinion that this was the best book of its kind available on the market today. I wholeheartedly agree."},{"Title":"Ancient Iraq","review":"Roux is the rarest of scholars and academes, he is one who can write. Ancient Iraq is extremely erudite and written clearly and lucidly. Reading it and getting involved in the text is not difficult. Ancient Iraq covers the full spectrum of Iraqi ancient history and prehistory, from the Paleolithic through the Neolithic, the Sumerian civilization, and on to the Assyrian and Persian empires. Despite the wide scope of this book, Roux manages to keep the narrative tightly contained and compact, avoiding digressions and wandering. Highly readable, this book deserves to be owned by anyone with an interest in the region. It is poorly illustrated, but this is a relatively minor flaw. This is a true classic of archaeological literature."},{"Title":"Ancient Iraq","review":"Now in its 3rd edition, Ancient Iraq remains the most complete and readable overview of the history of this cradle of civilization. Interestingly, the word Iraq comes from the name of the Sumerian city state Uruk. There is now a village called Warka near the ruins of the ancient city.The introductory chapters explore the geographical setting, archaeological research and the paleo-, meso- and neolithic periods. Following on, the author discusses the Hassuna, Samarra, Halat, Ubaid, Uruk and Jemdat timeframes, and the ancient trade routes.Next up is the Sumerian civilization, with a study of its origin, religion, history and mythology. The story of Gilgamesh is covered here. There was a Semitic interlude and a final Sumerian renaissance before the torch of history passed to the Semites in the form of the Akkadians and later the Assyrians and Babylonians. The statesman and lawgiver Hammurabbi is thoroughly dealt with.But other peoples played a part too, like the Hurrians, Mitannians and Kassites. Insofar as they impacted upon the history of the area, empires like the Hittite and the Egyptian are also considered. There are detailed narratives on the Assyrian empire, the Chaldean kings and the fall of Nineveh and later of Babylon. After this event, Mesopotamia ceased to be a seat of empire and passed from the Persians to the Greeks, the Parthians, the Sassanids and ultimately to the Arabs.In the Epilogue, we learn of the heritage of this civilization, such as enduring religious symbols like the Maltese cross, the tree of life an the crescent. Some words have come down to us, like \\"alcohol\\" (guhlu in Akkadian), \\"myrrh\\" (murru) and \\"naphta\\" (naptu), \\"abyss\\" (abzu in Sumerian). Some Sumerian words still live in Hebrew, like Egal (great house) = Heikal = Temple and the personal name Eitan (Etana).The book contains plates with photographs and illustrations, and concludes with bibliographic notes, comparative history tables, various interesting maps and indices of names and subjects. For those interested in the paleolithic origins of civilization, I recommend Lost Civilizations Of The Stone Age by Richard Rudgley. If you have a taste for alternative history, the book Ramses II And His Time by Immanuel Velikovsky has much to say about Babylon and the Chaldeans. And finally, Empires Of The Word: A Language History Of The World by Nicholas Ostler, deals extensively with ancient Mesopotamia, its languages, culture and empires."},{"Title":"Ancient Iraq","review":"I was looking for a book which would provide the history of ancient Mesopotamia and bought this book after reading the reviews of other customers. It is a well written book and easy to read, covering the history of Mesopotamia from the earliest times up the end of the ancient world. Its main focus is from the early dynasties up to the conquest of Babylonia by Cyrus the Great, with the last chapter (out of 25) and a short Epilogue summarizing the events of the area after that.Chapters 1 to 4 chapters survey the geography, and the prehistory of Mesopotamia. Chapters 5 to 24 details the known political, military, economic, and societal events of each of the main periods of Mesopotamian history, with separate chapters on the Gods of Sumer, and the Age of Heroes which discuss the stories of the Flood, Gilgamesh, and other heroes of that age.The book provides extensive notes and bibliography for further reading on a chapter by chapter basis which I found most useful in helping my understanding. It also has a detailed chronology on all of the known major dynasties of the period which is about the most complete I have seen. There are 20 of plates (black and white) many of which I have seen in other books, and some 21 detailed illustrations , as well as several maps which I found to be quite helpful, but certainly not the best I have seen.Up to now, the books I have read on this area were on rather more specific periods or topics, such as \\"Babylon\\" by Joan Oates;. \\"Treasures of Darkness\\" by Thorkild Jacobsen on Mesopotamian religion, and a number of books on the Hittites and the eastern Mediterranean. I was therefore looking for other books which would fill the gaps in my knowledge. I had ordered this book along with Wolfram von Soden's \\"The Ancient Orient\\", which describes itself as an introduction to the study of the Ancient Near East, which it certainly is. I found \\"Ancient Iraq\\" to be an excellent follow up book.The most informative sections for me were the chapters on the Sumerians, the \\"Time of Confusion\\" (c 1300BC to 900BC), and those on the Assyrian Empire. These are all periods which I want to know more about; - the Sumerians for how their civilization developed from small settlements along the \\"Land of the Two Rivers\\" to the development of the city and national states of the second half of the 3rd millennium; - The Time of Confusion, because to the general lack of archaeological information about the Dark Age which seems to have occurred in most of the ancient Near East; - the Assyrians because I really didn't know very much about them except for some of their later kings from the references in the Bible.I was happy to see that in general, the author does not attempt to take sides into the details of the various differences of scholarly opinion about what happened during this period, which suited me fine, since I was looking for a historical survey rather than a discussion of the competing theories. So as far as chronology is concerned, this book follows the generally accepted dating systems. I was also happy to see included a number of translations of the texts from the original sources as well as the inclusion of a large number of Sumerian and Akkadian wordsIn summary, the book is an excellent complement to my growing library of other books on the ancient Near East, and helpful in its descriptions of the relationships of the Mesopotamian states with the neighbouring states in Asia Minor, Syria, Palestine, Israel, Egypt to the west, and Iran to the east. It therefore met my expectations, and I would recommend it to any student who is interested in developing a detailed knowledge about the history of ancient Mesopotamia."},{"Title":"Ancient Iraq","review":"I am a lay reader, with very little if any knowledge of ancient history. I stumbled upon this book quite by chance, and am proud to say that I am astounding my friends and acquaintances with all I know about it now.After years of study, Roux is still clearly in love with his favorite subject, and it makes Ancient Iraq a fascinating and compelling read. I was absolutely stunned by what all the Sumerians, Assyrians, and Babylonians are responsible for when laying the foundations of our present civilization. The chapters on government and law are especially enlightening, when compared to present day domestic and foreign policy.I learned so much from this book: it is an excellent summarization from what is years and years of study and research. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Ancient Iraq","review":"Iraq is not a fashionable topic these days, but ancient Iraq is something else. This is one of the only books available in print describing ancient Mesopotamia in toto, including not only the southern region (Sumeria) and the middle regions (Babylonia), but also Assyria in the north. Information on Assyria is particularly hard to come by for the nonspecialist. The author is not a trained archeologist; as a physician he worked as a medical officer for the Iraq Petroleum Co. for nine years in the '50s, and his series of articles in the company publication &quot;Iraq Petroleum&quot; formed the basis for this book. He is now a respected scholar in this field. Distinct from the three dozen or so other works in ancient history I have read, this one takes pains to describe how various facts are gathered, and how their reliability may be assessed. The whole work has the flavor of someone who has taken trouble to learn something, and wants eagerly to share it with his readers. I strongly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Ancient Iraq","review":"Any general reader should also consider Michael Roaf'sThe Cultural Atlas of Mesopotamia and the Ancient Near EastRoux's work definitely has its strengths, which include 428 pages of detailed text, frequent citations and 66 pages of footnotes. Its weaknesses include that the last edition is now 17 years old (as of 2009) and the illustrations are very mediocre, but I think its greatest failing is its maps. Except for 1 or 2 small maps in the text, the only maps are 4 two page maps in the back following the footnotes. Roux constantly refers to cities, regions and geographical features throughout the book, so if one does not know the geography of Mesopotamia and the surrounding area extremely well, including both ancient and modern names, then a huge amount of time is spent searching the 4 maps, which are rather small in the paperback edition, or putting down the book to do an online search.Michael Roaf'sThe Cultural Atlas of Mesopotamia and the Ancient Near Eastis naturally filled with maps specific to the topic being discussed, and has vastly better illustrations. Its text is as good as Roux's, if somewhat less detailed and without the citations. Most importantly, the maps and illustrations provide visual reference points which I found very helpful when reading about 3,000+ years of history. Roux's book is 99.9% text so that king after king, city after city and battle after battle can turn into quite a blur.If I were in college writing a paper of the king by king and battle by battle sort, I would use Roux as a valuable resource and starting point for its thousands of citations. However, the general reader who wants to learn more than a Wikipedia article's worth about Sumer, Babylon and Assyria will likely do better with Michael Roaf's excellent work that strikes a great balance between the visual and the textual."},{"Title":"Ancient Iraq","review":"After taking this book up with considerable enthusiasm, I'm putting it aside in considerable frustration.I emphatically agree with the reviewer who complains about the lack of maps in this book. The many, many place names cited are often difficult or impossible to find on the small maps included in the back of the book. I used Google Maps to plot out some ancient trade routes based on the names, and what I saw was tremendously helpful to understand what was going on. But I hadn't the time to do this for everything.Likewise, illustrations are lacking. A lot of time is spent reviewing the pottery of different eras, and yet we don't see it.Details abound to the point where one is fatigued and is searching desparately for an overview. I realize that to some degree this brings us to the problem of Mesopotamia -- unlike Greece and Rome, we have a million details but no continuous historial record. And yet I believe I will have to search for some other book on the subject.Anyway, not to disrespect what is here: there is a LOT of information here, and if you can patiently slog through it, you get something out of it."},{"Title":"Ancient Iraq","review":"I appreciated Georges Roux's book on \\"Ancient Iraq\\" very much. At over 400 pages, it is hard to call the book a survey, but it is. The problem is that the topic itself is enormous, spanning over 3000 years and encompassing multiple, complex civilizations. Additionally, since the topic itself is so old, predating the rise of \\"classical\\" Greece, information upon which the book is based is almost always incomplete and frequently of questionable veracity. So when an author like Roux overcomes these problems and still manages to create a truly fun book to read, you can appreciate his accomplishment all the more.The book starts off with a very nice and relatively thorough description of ancient Iraqi geography and Iraqi civilizations predating the Uruk period, which began roughly 3500 BC and is considered the first \\"historic\\" period--where a written language was used. After that, the book delves into the better-known Sumerian civilizations, Akkad, Third Dynasty Ur, Babylon, etc. I especially appreciated his sections on the Aramaens, Urartians, Kassites, and other less well-written-about civilizations. I'm sure Roux could have written entire books on \\"Neo-Assyria\\" or \\"Neo-Babylon\\", but the overview he provides did enough to get me interested.I was occasionally concerned that the book was outdated because, in its origins, it started out as a compilation of essays Roux wrote between 1956 and 1960 for a now defunct magazine called Iraqi Petroleum. Admittedly, the book was re-edited in 1991 and is now in its third edition, but I just didn't get the feeling it was thoroughly updated except for one small section. On the other hand, the constant fighting in the country since the last edition has probably hindered and prevented much work on the topic, so you can make an argument that the state of the art hasn't advanced much since the book was written, except for scholarship taking place outside of current day Iraq.Unfortunately, the book is also severely lacking in images. Roux offers only 15 black and white glossy pictures inserted in a bundle in the middle of the book. There are perhaps 10 basic drawing diagrams scattered throughout as well. Could have been better. You can try Googling for images.Nevertheless and regardless of all the above, the book itself is very well written and scholarly. Roux has an enormous enthusiasm for the topic, and I had a hard time putting the book down. I wanted to give the book a 5-star rating, but after going over what I just wrote, it's got to be a 4."},{"Title":"Ancient Iraq","review":"Good, concrete and short survey of middle east antiquity, which was very complex.

But the plains of Mesopotamia are a fairly hostile environment; the best land is located in the hills where timber, game and clean water are available. The logical conclusion is that the flatlanders were forced there, expelled from the hills, and that they grouped in cities for defensive purposes. This grouping behavior is universal among prey species. McNeill: \\"Man is to man as predator is to prey.\\"It was organization that allowed the ancient cities to prevail. Strong central governments arose, backed by a robust religious establishment, sustained and protected by their military.Sounds familiar, doesn't it? America's military absorbs a lot of our treasure and our religious establishment is a central element in our strong central government -- our presidents swear their oath on a bible.After 5000 years we can still relate to the peoples of ancient Iraq and appreciate their problems. We're living them today.How this story came to light is itself another great story, the history of archeology in the area. All this is nicely summarized by the author. MyThe Cultural Atlas of Mesopotamia and the Ancient Near East (Cultural Atlas of)complemented my library text of the 1964 edition which had arcane marginalia and maps razored out.I try not to think of tank battles out in the desert, using the ancient mounds as defilade against armor-piercing rounds.

The majority of the discussed techniques are familiar; however, the real value of the book is the way that those techniques are made accessible to the user. The majority of books of this nature never take theory through to practical use ... but this book certainly does. Real, understandable, accessible customer situations are worked through in a a manner that the reader can absorb and apply for their own organisation."},{"Title":"How to Win Customers in the Digital World: Total Action or Fatal Inaction","review":"I don't write a lot of book reviews, not because I don't read a lot of books but because so few of them are worth reviewing. This week I'm going to make an exception since this is a very good book. The book is called \\"How to Win Customers in the Digital World\\", subtitled \\"Total Action or Fatal Inaction\\". The title and subtitle have been flipped since I saw the book in draft form a year or so ago. The authors are Al Dunn and his partner Peter Vervest. Al is based in London, and has spent most of his working life advising European telecommunications suppliers and carriers as well as other apparently slow-moving organisations on how to improve their customer service. As you can imagine, this is a difficult and thankless task. But he and Peter Vervest, plug away, spending a lot of time with companies like Finland's Nokia and Dutch and German and Swiss PTTs on change management and customer relations. (PTT is a peculiarly European acronym for \\"Post, Telephone and Telegraph\\", which indicates the term's long history. Despite being overtaken by technology and other events, it is still used to describe the major European telecommunications companies, many of which are still government owned or which behave as if they are). Al has been talking about the importance of the customer ever since I have known him, which is the best part of twenty years. Just about every organisation says that its customers are important, but a surprisingly small amount actually believe it, and even fewer adopt a customer focus as the cornerstone of their business philosophy. Common sense tells us that the customer is paramount, because they are after all the people who buy our products. But it is not just the computer industry that very often pays more attention to its products than to the people who buy them. We see it everywhere in business, and in life, and suppliers have to be constantly reminded that they are in business only because people want what they sell, are prepared to pay for it, and are happy to remain loyal if the service is good enough. This has always been true, and it always will be true. But now, with the growth of the Internet and electronic commerce, business practices are changing very quickly, and the nature of the relationship between supplier and customer is evolving accordingly. In the digital world the skills involved in attracting and retaining customers are different enough to warrant comment, hence the book. The authors make a major distinction between \\"total action\\" - which is roughly defined as \\"squeezing out\\" every activity that is not specifically important to the customer - and \\"fatal inaction\\" - intense activities that have no relationship to an organisation's performance with that customer. \\"These departments develop around themselves highly complex and rigid processes and systems. In due course they begin to perceive themselves as businesses in their own right, an error today's \`business unit focus simply magnifies. \\"Such organisations often become dysfunctional. Their people, usually intelligent and competent, have become trapped in corporate autism, a serious handicap inherited from task-oriented production-line forbears. They become inward-facing internal markets for themselves, with rules and behavioural standards that are far too rigid for the digital business world.\\" Sound familiar? The object becomes the process itself, rather than the end result of that process. Now, the Internet has vastly altered these processes and their capabilities for redefining customer interaction. \\"Digital technology, as best exemplified by the Internet, allows us to easily bring together vast amounts of related information. This information can be located anywhere in the world, but it can be presented with amazing clarity and relevance to provide links to all the sources from which the information has come. This fundamentally changes business. \\"This gives the customer the ability to transparently look into an organisation's operations, and make decisions with much more information and much more quickly than was previously the case. This, and the vastly improved access of the Internet, makes it much easier for customers to change their supplier. And that is death in the digital age.\\" I recommend this book to you. \\"How to Win Customers in the Digital World\\" will remind you of the most important people in your life and how to deal with them"},{"Title":"How to Win Customers in the Digital World: Total Action or Fatal Inaction","review":"This book has been written as a management book; the book is about a concept that has been worked out quite thouroughly and is illustrated by a number of good examples. Because i was quite familiar with the concepts, i could easily understand the content of this book; however i think that managers who are not too familiar with concepts like this will feel it hard to really use the material in their real life practice. They will probably understand that they have to start moving, but will have to read the examples probably twice to really understand the steps to undertake. The book gives good insight in the global steps to undertake, but could have been worked out in more detail to really deliver a management agenda.Overall i am quite satisfied with this book and would recommend this book to others, especially managers in brick and mortar companies."},{"Title":"The End of Privacy: How Total Surveillance is Becoming a Reality (Back to Basics)","review":"I save a lot of money using coupons, I always fill out and return warranty cards. I have found myself the recipient of mail I did not solicit and offers that seem to exhibit more about me than I am comfortable with. It seems almost like rape. What amazes me is that Mr. Whitaker (is this a guy thing?) seems to believe it will all be okay-that we won't end up like Winston Smith in 1984, because the power of government is &quot;de-centralizing and power is shifting to the &quot;market&quot;. Well, I never get invited to the Whitehouse, and Presidents don't take vacations in my home, or play golf with my husband (Art-my husband-is a scratch golfer-I'd like to see that actually). I don't like what is happening, I cannot answer for anyone else. It is frightening to have Mr. Whitaker state that this seems to be an issue of little concern. I beg to differ. Maybe I'm no Claire Wolfe but I can sure tell my friends to read this book and see what they think. I bet they feel like I do. I'll be telling them to check out Jerry Furland's &quot;Transfer&quot; too."},{"Title":"The End of Privacy: How Total Surveillance is Becoming a Reality (Back to Basics)","review":"&quot;The End of Privacy&quot; is profound. This is a non-judgemental, clear-eyed view of modern culture woven into a rich tapestry depicting a continuum of both governance and commerce over time. For the inhabitants of the modern technological ant hill, the &quot;End of Privacy&quot; is an indictment as well as an apologia for the human condition. Surprisingly, for Americans who live a myth of individualism the author argues that individual privacy-the right to be left alone-as a political issue is a non-starter. Inclusion and exclusion, yin and yang outcomes that will affect all of humanity eventually, in fact must be apportioned to satisfy numerous risk aversive objectives in both private (for profit) and public (for governance and control) agendas.We are what we are. Claiming otherwise would be disingenuous at best. This is a deeply troubling book. Explore for yourself how we are manipulated and ultimately controlled. Having done so, one may ask if we are even able to define what freedom is. Perhaps we have lost everything we once held sacred without even holding a debate.Jerry Furland, author of &quot;Transfer-the end of the beginning&quot;"},{"Title":"The End of Privacy: How Total Surveillance is Becoming a Reality (Back to Basics)","review":"I bought this book because an author I have read who was recommended on a online news site also recommended Reg Whitaker.

While we have for a long while had access to recipe collections and representations of the cuisine of various nationalities and popular restaurants, recently there has been a growing library of culinary tomes that give us the skills for producing creations of our own minds. Titles such as Sauces by James Peterson, the 1-2-3 series by Roxanne Gold, Culinary Artistry, Great Wine Made Simple, and now this book provide us with the information about tastes and combinations of flavors and textures to deconstruct, reconstruct, and just plain construct familiar and novel dishes.The Elements of Taste provides a brief introduction to the authors' theory of flavor. They broadly group flavors into four categories based on the purpose they serve in a dish. Thus, Tastes That Push represent the well-known seasonings that we use to balance sauces, for example: Salty, Sweet, and Picante. Tastes That Pull represent those taste elements that highlight underlying flavors. The authors include here Tangy, Vinted, Floral/Herbal, Spiced Aromatic, Funky (pungents or musky flavors), and Bulby (what have commonly been called Aromatics such as onions and garlic). Taste Platforms represent the textures upon which dishes are built. These include Garden Platforms, Starchy ones, Oceanic ones, and Meaty ones (what the Japanese call umami). Finally, the fourth category is Tastes That Punctuate, basically bitters that stop tastes and cleanse the palate.This model is very useful one. The authors seem not to have done their research in examining precursors to this model, and make little reference to other cuisines than the one they constructed for this book. They neglect to include several important items, especially in the Platforms section (breads, pastries, soy products, seitan, and mushrooms as a basis for other flavors, for example). There are similar, usually less complex models, already in the literature. Kunz and Kaminsky's model is more extensive than most, however. Surprisingly, they give little space in the book to theory. The majority of pages is devoted to recipes that demonstrate their combining philosophy. The authors do not describe how they took the elements of taste and mixed them to concoct these dishes. (A reader must refer to Culinary Artistry for such guidelines.) They do, however, provide tasting notes after each recipe that dissect the elements used in the dish.The recipes are very complex, involving multiple steps and sub-recipes. Even a cook enjoying kitchen challenges would be hard pressed to prepare a full meal using this book alone-- one would run out of burners and pans before the dishes were complete. For example, the Honey Glazed Celeriac involves making the glaze, which is a reduction of wine and acids with sauteed aromatics sieved and kept warm, plus Celeriac slices baked and then broiled, plus a garnish of sauteed zucchini with chives, plus Ginger Curry Sauce, a mayonnaise of reduced wine and aromatics whisked with other ingredients.The writing is an interesting, not entirely successful juxtaposition of aw-shucks, down-home attitude, sophisticated epicurean philosophy, and fancy foods. The recipes are heavy on the Meaty and Oceanic food platforms, making this definitely a carnivore's cookbook. Produce usually stands as garnish and accompaniment to the flesh. In the end, the most special part of the book represent a few precious pages and is underdeveloped. Perhaps a follow-up volume will expound on this interesting culinary model."},{"Title":"The Elements of Taste","review":"Not only is it full of WONDERFUL recipes, it is also full of a lot of taste commentary and other information that will help you to design your own wonderful recipes. If you like to cook, or like to eat, this is the book for you!!!!This is an especially great book for meat-eaters, who have over 70 amazing recipes to choose from. It's not so great for vegetarians (25 recipes), pretty poor for vegans (9 or 10 recipes), and downright bad for \\"no-honey\\" vegans (5 recipes). Still, the book is about more than just recipes: it is about taste, and the factors of taste.Please note that the recipe count above does NOT include items in the chef's larder: a section filled with 43 recipes for things used to make other things, such as ginger confit, bourbon mustard brine, floral herbal aioli, tomato fennel broth, almond milk broth, bulby citrus butter topping, orange spice mix, cranberry glaze, and crispy rice flake breading.All in all, an excellent book. One of the things I dig about it most is that it considers TEXTURE as a part of taste, and this is apparent in the recipes. The very first recipe in the book, PAN ROASTED SALMON WITH AROMATIC SALTED HERBS, had me convinced. The thing that really says something about this particular recipe is that both my father and I like it. My father adores salmon; I can't stand the stuff, but I like this. Seriously: try the recipe even if you don't like salmon, and especially if you do; it's easier than it looks and tastier than it sounds. Either way, I believe you will be pleasantly suprised.Each recipe includes a section on taste, called \\"taste notes\\". These help you to hone in on the different tastes in the mix, and why they taste the way they do together."},{"Title":"The Elements of Taste","review":"The concept is interesting, but I have to say that the recipes could have used a bit more testing and/or proofreading. Almost everyone I've tried has been delicious (5 good to 1 bad), almost all have needed some tweaking in quantities.The strawberry soup with champagne ice is fantastic, but makes more than twice as much ice as is needed.The Italian Sausage with Lager Sauce and Apple Bouillon is delicious, but the Lager Sauce has the same consistency as the Bouillon (next time I'll be drastically reducing the amount of lager in the sauce).One recipe description talks about how the flavor of the almonds interact with the other ingredients but there are no almonds in the recipe!None of these problems are insurmountable, and I love the complexity of flavor that he layers into the dishes, but a little more testing would have removed a fair amount of frustration.But it was really worth the price just for that strawberry soup..."},{"Title":"The Elements of Taste","review":"i have been frustrated when trying to learn more about, i have to say it, the elements of taste. what makes a dish taste good? what ingredients compliment each other, which do not? i am a novice cook but i have reached the point where i want to be able to understand why i am cooking something the way the recipe calls. or why i am using certain ingredients. i am shocked at the lack of books out there about this topic. if you want to learn to appreciate and develop your taste buds, this is a prefect starting point.the book discusses the many elements of taste. it then delves into recipes specific to those aspects of taste. and then, the best part, it sums up what you should look for when eating the dish (salty taste at first, giving way to sweetness from the aroma of caramelized onions, the texture, etc. etc., then the finish).this book explains taste, allows you to create a dish, then explains what the dish does to your mouth. i am very satisfied with the book and believe this is an excellent launching pad for me to learn to create my own dishes.i would also recommend &quot;culinary artistry&quot;. it is more textbook-like, however, it has a HUGE appendix telling you what foods compliment one another."},{"Title":"The Elements of Taste","review":"I was excited to first see this book, because there is so little in the way of serious yet readable analysis of taste and flavor experiences.Unfortunately, this turned out - against my expectations - to be long on recipes and short on analysis. Mostly, it's a book of recipes with an interesting organizational twist.Kunz's classification of taste is just that, a classification, and little more. I don't feel that he has unearthed any new principles or theories that help chefs create new dishes, because it offers only superficial &quot;rules&quot; about what flavor combinations do or do not work. Beyond being a clever filing system, it offers little more than a language for discussing food, and not a very good one at that.If you want a book of interesting recipes, this is a reasonable source. However, my kitchen is full of such books, and I don't find recipes very useful. If you want new food ideas, check out Charlie Trotter's series, which is more imaginative, has fabulous photographs, and is filled with detailed and evocative writing that is probably more valuable than what you'll find here."},{"Title":"The Elements of Taste","review":"I've read the reviews to date and beg to differ: this &quot;home cook&quot; likes the book; it is not just for &quot;foodies&quot;. This book is like &quot;adult education&quot;--the teacher may not be perfect but there is much to learn and to think about and to react to in &quot;Elements of Taste.&quot; The authors teach some basic principles for balancing flavors, for adding texture and an undaunting amount of complexity, using some very interesting sample dishes to illustrate their points.Readers who just like fine dining can use the book's approach to step up their appreciation of good restaurant food. Home cooks like me, who may be ready to improvise on &quot;set&quot; recipes can find a way to think about adding flavor to a dish when &quot;something seems to be missing.&quot; If you have ever thought that you liked the basic ingredients in a dish but...&quot;I want to do it my way,&quot; this book can extend your ability to change recipes to suit your liking. Just the idea of thinking about and looking for layers of flavors is an important step forward for many of us and this book makes a very useful beginning for that.Cooks who don't like to think about ingredients might do better to look elsewhere since they are not really looking for inspiration or extension of technique. If you are ready to reach out a bit; just want to produce a &quot;different&quot; dish for your family or for a holiday or for a dining group of friends, many of these recipes will do very well. The book represents good value, giving more than its price would indicate."},{"Title":"The Elements of Taste","review":"There have not been many books that have thoughtfully approached the subject of creating flavors. Dornenburg and Page's Culinary Artistry (published in 1996) is an extraordinary book on this topic, but The Elements of Taste by Kunz and Kaminsky is a welcome and thought-provoking addition to the few available books in this genre. One can only hope there will be more to come!"},{"Title":"The Elements of Taste","review":"Magnificent book about cooking. Instead of fancy recipes nobody can cook, it discusses the different flavours we can distinguish. Similar to component tasting in wine, Kunz and Kaminsky introduce a system to classify food in a mouthwatering fashion."},{"Title":"The Elements of Taste","review":"This is a must have in your cookbook collection! This is not just an ordinary cook book, it explains the flavors profiles. I love how Chef Kunz categorized the flavors into limited categories. That way it won't be too confusing."},{"Title":"The Elements of Taste","review":"It's a very interesting way to consider taste and how to create a truely great taste experience in a dish, and I think one can learn a lot. The elements of flavor are defined up front, then the recipes have tasting notes to see how the flavors build and combine. However, the recipes are complicated multi-step processes involving specific and unusual ingredients, and while I'd like to eat them and compare the tasting notes, I really cannot imagine finding all the ingredients and spending all the time and care (obviously if you subsitute or take short cuts it's not going to be the same)."},{"Title":"The Elements of Taste","review":"The thousands of typographical errors in the electronic version of this book render it virtually unintelligible. Do not waste your money on this."},{"Title":"The Elements of Taste","review":"I am a huge fan of Gray Kunz and was worried at first that many of these recipes would take days to prepare - but not at all. The first recipe I tried was the oven-crisped chicken with maple vinegar sauce and it is by far my favorite chicken dish i've even tasted or made (followed closely by Cook's Illustrated's fried chicken). I also love to read cookbooks and, if you do as well, you will see that Kunz actually has quite a sense of humor. The title of this book is perfect given that his recipes have so many flavor profiles and textures. I am also a sucker for showing pictures of the finished dish next to the recipe (a la Barefoot Contessa) and he has provided beautiful pictures. He also gives recipes for sauces and glazes that you can use in your own recipes. I highly recommend this book - you won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"The Elements of Taste","review":"Gray Kunz &amp; Peter Kaminsky have crafted not just another book of recipes, they have formated a new way of analyzing taste.

However, after reading it, I've concluded it doesn't really deserve such recognition. While the story is sad and moving-- a family of four children try to cope with the murder of their father by their mother-- and the characters are for the most part believable, the author goes astray.First, there are far too many tangents in the book. Right when something pivotal has happened, the narrator will go into some recollection about his father beating him or his sister yelling at him. I wanted to know about the present, not always the past. The flashbacks were at times awkward and unnecessary.Second, the narrator, Harley, isn't exactly likeable. The back of the book describes him as &quot;heartbreaking, hilarious, and lovable,&quot; and I would say he only matches the first description. He's mildly funny, at times, but in a sick and twisted way, and definitely not lovable. Did I feel bad for him? Sure. Did I love him? No, not at all. He has far too many daydreams about bashing people's brains in to love him.Lastly, there were too many loose ends at the end of the novel. The story starts and ends with Harley talking about his friend Skip, and it seems at first that Skip will be a major character, but he's really not. We never even meet him. Not only that, but I was left wondering what the hell Skip even meant to him. Why did the author even include him in the story? The narrator never really articulates what effect Skip has had on his life. And some of the other characters, like Harley, are hardly likeable. The only character I could really sympathize with was Jody, his six year old sister, who seems to be the only truly innocent character in the book.That being said, it was still worth the read. The story itself is sad and tragic, and the writing is very truthful."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I felt like being on a runaway train the first hundred pages. Pieces of things kept popping up and you know they will be back to haunt you. A stunning debut for Ms. O'Dell."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"Tawni O'Dell has written a tale of The Great American Nightmare. Undoubtedly, the story is a tragedy and, just as an occasional person might not appreciate Shakespeare's tragedies, this work may lose a sensitive reader. But the realism of the work with descriptions that are PERTINENT, makes the reader feel, smell, hear, and taste becoming one with the book. Harley is a victim of circumstance. His family has splintered from the whole of society with the death of his father and he becomes burdened as an individual to bear premature responsibilities. The story becomes a tale of children with misdirected passions brought into a harsh, cruel world too soon. And sadly enough, the work stings of believability. After reading this novel, one begins to ponder the workings of our society upon those who merely seek to just survive. Ms. O'Dell has done an outstanding job on her first book. And until Tawni O'Dell has her next novel in print, I will simply keep rereading this one."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I have worked with Emotionally Disturbed teenagers as an English teacher for 10 years. In that time, I have heard stories of abuse that are so disturbing, I thought nothing could shock me. This book shocked me. I didn't know what I was getting into when I picked it up. The front and back covers are very misleading. I feel, after reading this, that I know now exactly what Holden Caulfield was trying to protect kids from. Many times during reading this book I thought of putting it down and not finishing it. It was written in such a way, though, that I felt compelled to finish it. In fact, I read the last 100 pages in one sitting. I am warning the faint of heart, the weak of stomach, the prudes out there who don't want to hear about things that make people uncomfortable: Don't buy this book. For the rest of you, be open-minded, read it, and think about ways to make this world a better, safer place for those who need it most."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"It's a shame how some of these reviews lack the proper critque. Calling a book &quot;A waste of time&quot; just because you didn't like it displays a sophomoric attitude simply because you were displeased with the book. Saying that, I feel one must take into consideration that this was written from a teenager's perspective, thus this could be why some people did not like the book. It has many vulgar scenes with Harley masturbating,cursing,shooting,etc.,but this is all apart of the life of a dysfunctional family. It would have been bad writing if the author wrapped up all the plots with a happy ending and replaced the word &quot;F--ck&quot; for the word &quot;Fudge&quot;. Bottom line is if you cannot take explicit content then don't read the book.This isn't a white suburban fairy-tale. It's a poor white trash fairy-tale--deal with it.The storyline was SIMPLE, which is what made this book such a tale to absorb. It was about Harley raising his younger sisters because his mother decided to take a [gun]shot at her husband. But as the reader continues on in the book, he finds himself fooled by the clever set up O'Dell displayed and makes u start despising the character(s) just when you started to like them.As far as the characters go they were all written to perfection(especially Harley..DAYUUUM). Each character had a flaw that was manipulated to the author's benefit in order for her to set down the twists. Personally, I did not like the main character because he was a PUNK. But I had felt sorry for him because he was faced with raising three girls. The character I liked most was the mother of two and Harley's &quot;DREAM GIRL&quot;. To me, she was the link to the entire novel even though she wasn't the central focus. She affected Harley's train of thought with her passion for famous paintings and of course just being &quot;HERSELF&quot;. The many sexual scenes were RELEVANT because each time Harley gained a new perspective on his life. For example, when the mother had left him out in the woods after their second or third sexual encounter, he realizes that someone out there actually cares about him(because she left him some food and a flashlight). Plus the mother(apart from the psychologist) was the only character that kept Harley sane.Perhaps one of the most scary factors was the fact that Harley had misplaced thoughts about killing his family members. However, the reader could relate; to the extent that he too day dreamed about killing someone(not necessarily his family members).This book keeps the reader in suspense from beginning to end, speaking of which the ending is somewhat debatable because some might oppose to what happened to Harley and his demented sister(s). The bottom line is, if you like the harshness of reality then snatch this book down of the shelf. But if you are into the half-baked type novels where the character is supposed to have a rough edge, but the only word he knows how to say is &quot;Darn&quot; and his idea of being dirty minded is fantasizing about a girl in grandma dresses then this book is not for you."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"My goodness! Finally a well-written book with some depth and meaning. Most of the novels I read are self-indulgent attempts of authors trying to prove to themselves they can write. This book is moving, yet flows. It operates on the multiple levels of Harley's personality. Expressing his views of the world without truly understanding what influences are working on him. I never once felt the presence of the author, only the narrator. Fabulous book that is moving yet does not clobber your emotions to death. The author should be commended for not following the literary crowd."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I am shocked to read negative reviews of this book. I am guessing the people who did not like it are sheltered and fearful and probably found it difficult to read something so REAL. Harley's character is complex and intricate, which makes you love him and hate him at the same time. He is truly a product of his environment. This was the best book I have read in years. I couldn't put it down and hope to reread it again because there are so many interpretations and aspects of the characters that are easy to miss the first time when you are caught up in such a fast moving plot. Take a risk and read something worthwhile...a story that tells the truth about abused children."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"This was a great book, I couldn't put it down!

This book was right up my alley and I rushed out to buy it. Read it fast, too. It had a lot of potential, but was murky in the character development, I thought. I had trouble bonding with any of the characters (the only one I liked was the 6 year old little sister). I think that would have helped me care about the outcome of the characters more. The incest storyline seemed thrown in to me and could have either been left out or written to make more sense.

It is definitely not a \\"feel good\\" book.For me, however, it made several indelible points; closure is a crock, people often behave the way they do because circumstances place them in situations where they must behave the way they do in order to survive, and there is no limit to the complexity of human sexuality and the fragility of the human psyche.O'Dell's fiction may be limited geographically and by the socio-economic strata with which she is familiar, but her knowledge of the human heart is infinite.I recommend this book highly."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"O'Dell's story captures all the facets of an extremely dysfunctional family with raw, shocking realism - outright physical and verbal abuse, insinuated sexual abuse, incest and murder. As the novel unfolds, it becomes obvious that the male narrator is mentally disturbed but it's nearly impossible not to sympathize with his situation. O'Dell also does an excellent job of portraying his sexual frustrations, not to mention the overall confusion and desperation of a young man who has had too much responsibility thrust upon him. I highly recommend this novel. It is compulsively readable and well written."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"Amazingly written book with well developed charaters.

About halfway, i it dawned upon me that the book took place 20 minutes from where i lived. NOT IN THE DEEP SOUTH LIKE ONE OF THE PREVIOUS REVEIWERS SAID. sorry that annoyed me a little bit when i saw that. we are north of the mason dixon line. First thoughts were that he was a middle class holden caulfield(sic). But this book seemed to be a little bit easier to relate to. in the beginning at least. the thing about catcher in the rye that bothered me was that it was all about a rich kid whining about his life. always hated that about people, try being on the other end of the spectrum and hating your life. anyways. overall the book took some expected turns, knew what was going to happen in the end. but overall the book was an interesting read. i am sorry if some people were disturbed by the language and visuals that were presented, but you know what? get over it, that is what life is like for some people. not everything is peachy keen for some people and things like this do happen in the world. i will be looking for more books from this author."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I enjoyed Back Roads, and while I was reading it, I found I could barely put it down. Tawni O'Dell tells the story of a troubled young man forced to be an adult too soon. Though disturbed by his violent fantasies (which contributed to the suspense of the book), I found I like the character and even laughed out loud at some of his views of the world. (Asking to the talk to the bank, for instance, was very clever.) I don't know if this book will stand out in my mind over the next few months or years, but it definitely kept me enthralled while I was reading it."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I have made it a point to read all of Oprah's selections since she has introduced the joy of reading to the public. This is one of her selections and it's one of the few that I had a hard time getting into. For one thing, it is very dark and depressing. I wish someone had warned me of that when I bought this book. It is also extremely violent ~~ which I have a hard time grasping. There is enough violence in this world, I know, but this book just rubbed me raw.Harley, the main character of this book, is a young man stuck with the responsibilty of raising his younger sisters since his mom went to jail for murdering his dad. This book is mostly flashbacks of Harley's life and the present-day. Struggling to keep food on the table and the roof over his head, Harley shows a lot of resentment for such a heavy responsibilty. He refuses to visit his mom in jail. He tends to defend his father who is abusive. He resents his sisters for being young and not working. He fights to keep his sisters together even when they ignore what he wants. He also falls in love with a beautiful housewife who appears to have it all. Then it all explodes into a mass confusion and stark truth. It leaves Harley (and the reader) reeling with shock and confusion.This is an interesting book ~~ but too dark and violent for my personal taste. I usually buy books to escape into ~~ not to escape from! O'Dell definitely showed the darker side of human nature in this book ~~ and dysfunctional family takes on a new whole meaning as well. If you are into dark reading, this book is perfect for you. It's well-written with doses of black humor and despair. If it's a lighter read you are looking for, don't get this one.7-7-03"},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I started reading this book as soon as I received it and found that I liked the characters in it so much that I couldn't put it down. I had to see what was going to happen with them next! I felt as though the personality of the middle daughter, Misty, was not explored as much as that of Amber and Jodi, though, so I didn't feel as though I &quot;knew&quot; Misty or cared all that much about what was going on with her throughout the story. Jodi definitely leaves an impression on my mind and heart, though!I devoured the book in one day, and did enjoy it very much, but I hated the end. It felt to me as though the author got tired of her characters and started writing more and more vaguely, until, finally, she ended the book with a surprise that I just didn't feel fit with the entire rest of the story.The parallels between what Harley ultimately ended up doing, and what his mother had done could have been explored more. It just seemed that the realistic tone that was felt throughout the story was gone by the end and it was a vague, euphemistic conclusion.All in all, I did like the book, and will definitely read the next book that Tawni O'dell writes."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"If you like the book Catcher in the Rye, you will like this book."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I bought this book for two main reasons: first, Oprah recommended it and I have thoroughly enjoyed the other books on her list; second, I am from the same area of Western Pennsylvania as the main character Harley and the author are from.

I was very upset with the way it portrayed Western PA. I do not know anyone whose life has been at all like Harley's. I think Ms. O'Dell is giving a bad impression of this area through all the talk of murder, incest, adultery, etc. She is obviously enjoying her new life in Illinois!

But this one, what happened to Oprah's tastes? I initially bought the book because it took place in SW Pennsylvania, which is where I spend the first 26 years of my life. Plus, the fact it was listed on Oprah's Book Club, was added bonus. I was extremely disappointed in the plot because I was waiting for the characters to achieve some depth. I guessed the ending even before all the characters were introduced. The editing left something to be desired given the numerous spelling and grammatical errors towards the end of the book.

I felt as though I was reading in cicles, not ever getting anywhere..just ending up right back where I started. I will not recommend this book to anyone and most certainly will not permit any child's or teenage hands to turn the pages.

In it, Harley, a 19-year-old boy, must take care of and provide for his three younger sisters, one of which is a [mean] 16 year old who has sex with every guy in their small town. Harley's past is tainted by the abuse of his father and the murder committed by his mother. Not being a child of abuse myself, I don't know what kind of pain is experienced by these children, but I have never met ANY 19-year-old (man OR woman) who cries as much as Harley does in this novel. I found the book to be depressing, but truthful. It's certainly not for the weak-stomached. The book's ending was strange to say the least, I'm not sure incest was a necessary factor in a story that already included [so much else] but Hey, that's just me. THe book is quick-paced but ultimately dissapointing. I would reccomend this book for someone who usually likes Oprah's picks, it follows her typical themes of depression and abuse in families. Still, I have to saym if your going to read an Oprah book about families, I enjoyed THE RAPTURE OF CANAAN much more(it's also about a teenager in a bad situation).

I think it is a great book. I would recommend it to almost anyone,except the little ones. This book is very expressive and descriptive. It does show the reality of life and what some people in the world go through. This shows how many kinds of different people there are in the world. Harley, the main character, happens to be a strong person for what he has went through. Harley has had his downpoints which was about everyday, but he stuck through. His sisters also did give him a hard time also. He loved them a lot, but that was one thing he was afraid of was love. Love because his father was very abusive and no one was ever there for him emotionally so he just feels a little threatened. His sisters are very young and were not to understand. At least in my opinion. They lived in a smaller town so everyone knew everything that went on in that family. I feel bad because if you think about it everyone in society today judge everyone by what they hear, what people look like, it is very hard to fit in to the higher class these days.

Harley hates his sisters so much that he constantly imagines killing them. At the end, he &quot;redeems&quot; himself by taking the blame for one of their actions. Oh please. The characters are unbelieveable and very unlikeable. Then, the author puts in a discussion page at the end of her book asking why Harley did this or why his sisters did that.

Back Roads tells a story that is really very simple.....what happens when a human mother doesn't do what comes naturally to every other animal God put on earth.....Protect her young!...This is a story of what happens to the kids...how young minds are warped......how abuse can mix emotions to the point that terrible things seem normal....and accepted. I read the book in one sitting...couldn't put it down....the words flow, the characters are real, I am looking forward to more from Tawni O'Dell.

This story of 19 year old Harley who is suddenly the head of a family caught in the middle of murder, incest, poverty and dysfunction (to put it midly) is dark and riveting. As other customer reviewers have indicated, Back Roads is a difficult book to put down. O'Dell does an excellent job of writing in a male first person voice - something that I think takes a particular talent for writers depicting characters of the opposite sex. However, the continuous trauma suffered by the children in this family only results in more pain. Just when you think there is a flicker of normalcy for them, the candle once again blows out. As the end of the novel drew near, I was looking forward to some redemption, some promise, some hope - and found none. O'Dell has an eviable way with words in her descriptions and dialogue. I look forward to giving her next effort another try."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I picked up Back Roads because I am from Western Pennsylvania. At first it looked like it would be a good read. Wrong. I am sure O'Dell struggled Mightily to create this work and for that she should be congratulated. However, I found her protagonist, Harley, to be weakly written. I also think she may have been better served writing in the third person while keeping the flavor of Harley's point of view intact for most of the story. My hunch is she didn't have the guts to attempt third person narrative. We get to know Harley, although he is not quite believable. O'Dell tries to make him an enigma, but he just doesn't seem real.S.E. Hinton dealt with teen turmoil better when she wrote The Outsiders (maybe it was because she was closer to the age of the characters). If you want to read about real sexual confusion, addiction, abuse and loss, read Jim Carroll's Basketball Diaries (but DON'T see the movie!). Carroll's prose is so real it will make you forget attempts like Back Roads.The subjects of abuse, murder and incest didn't bother me. I am a big boy. But I did start to wonder if the stamp on the front of the book was for the Oprah Book Club or the Jerry Springer Book Club."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I realized recently that I automatically assume that when Oprah picks a book for his reading group that there is a pretty good chance that it is going to be a bad novel. In all honesty, however, I had never read any of the books she had plucked out of obscurity, so I decided to challenge my own expectations and read one of her selections. I chose something that I considered to be primary Oprah: that is, something that was brought to the public's attention specifically because of her book group. Writers like Toni Morrison and Joyce Carol Oates seem to me to be secondary Oprah: they have existences outside of the reading group.If &quot;Back Roads&quot; is a typical example of Oprah's tastes, then my bias has proven itself more than just. What a bad book. This is the tale of a poor young man in rural Pennsylvania who is forced to take charge of his three younger sisters after his mother is sent to jail for murdering her father. We start out firmly ensconced in the neo-rural grotesque, but this novel ultimately degenerates into a twisted morass of dark family secrets so gothic it would make Ann Radcliffe blush. Now, the subject matter in itself could be fine, but the fact is that O'Dell is not nearly deft enough a writer to handle her material. Her wise but ignorant first person narrative lacks even the most remote shred of credibility. Harley's bouts with madness are forced and utterly unbelievable, and since the novel's conclusion hinges on them, they cause the entire structure to collapse.The bottom line is that O'Dell has a tin ear for language. Her dialogue is stiff, and her use of ALL CAPITAL LETTERS for EMPHASIS comes across as nothing but AMATEURISH. On top of that, the all-to-often used device of the sickly sweet misspellings of the protagonists baby sister made me feel like I needed a shower. Perhaps most distressing, however, were the sudden revelations that force the climax, where characters just remember (gasp!) the family secrets that have haunted them and that they have repressed. Goodness me!Although this book represents but one fairly random sample, it seems to me indicative of the bad reading habits encouraged by Oprah and her reading group. Why does this novel have value for her ilk? Probably because it deals with &quot;real&quot; issues like abuse and incest, and it is &quot;truthful&quot; in its depiction of human suffering. Sure, incest, abuse and familial trauma are worth writing and reading about, but the ability of a reader to see his or her suffering in the pages does not make a novel great. It may make it satisfying, but it hardly is the mark of good fiction. If anything, good fiction is about make what is foreign and unknown seem familiar. Sadly, the most familiar thing about &quot;Back Roads&quot; is its substandard writing, its cartoonish characters and its unsatisfying revelations."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"The twisted storyline in this book threw me for a bit of a loop, and the intensity of the characters is riveting. I couldn't put it down. It's a very quick read - esp for the length of it. I was left feeling a bit shocked by the graphic details and twisted thoughts/actions, but in a good way. It's amazing when a book can get under your skin and creep you out a bit, but draw you in to wonder about a world in which such things can exist so easily. I would definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"This is the story of 19 year old Harley ... an average lower-middle class child of parents who married in the seventies because his Mom was pregnant with him. His parents did the &quot;right thing&quot;, then had three more children, all girls. They lived their lives as best they could ... with little money, a small tar-paper shack they rented, and lots of abuse.Fast forward to when Mom ends up in jail for life for the shooting death of Dad and Harley is left to raise his three younger sisters. What a struggle.I was immediately drawn to the story line as well as the characters in it. I was also very disturbed by it. I have by no means been sheltered, but this story still made my soul hurt.Many reviewers said it was &quot;funny&quot;... perhaps I don't have a good sense of humor because I didn't find anything about this story funny. I found it very sad, very memorable, and very worth reading."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"O'dell's book is raw and edgy. The main character,Harley,is such a very sad person and you can hardly believe he hasn't lost his mind with all the atrocities he has seen in his short life. Yet he is a survivor at heart and along with the drive to care for and protect what is left of his family, that is his three sisters, he also longs to live the life of a regular nineteen year old. Basically to be with a woman and drink beer as much as he wants. As you read and the horror of the actual truth unfolds, you just want to rescue him and allow him to not have to deal with such horrible truths anymore. A young man his age just cannot possibly withstand the pressure he is under. All in all, BACK ROADS is an eye-opening novel for the typical sheltered American (myself included) who cannot imagine the terrible things underprivileged families experience day-to-day. My emotions went from hope to despair to deep sympathy. I hope someday I can meet a child like Harley and adopt him."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"Back Roads by Tawni O'Dell is a virtual tornado that rips through the strip malls and drive-throughs of lowerclass America. The main character, Harley, is less of a individual that a post-modern summation of all that is flagrantly and despicably pawned off as &quot;white trash.&quot; Even the name Harley (Davidson? Get it?) connotes the anger and violence of biker gangs and rednecks all across this country. O'Dell is not really telling a linear structured story here. Instead she wraps up all that American society has tossed off as the sins of the lower class (i.e. incest, domestic violence, shoplifting, cow tipping) and ably demonstrates that these flawed and angry people remain the backbone of this great country. O'Dell has a message here and she's screaming it from the tops of trailer parks everywhere: God Bless America, warts and all."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"&quot;Back Roads&quot; has to be one of the best books I ever read! (And I read a lot of books! ) Harley is thrown into manhood much too early in this debut novel by Tawni O'Dell. If losing his father too early by murder wasn't hard enough, he has to deal with raising his three younger sisters after his mother goes to jail. Each girl has her own distinctive personality, and it's a wonder they didn't kill each other living in that house together. Harley finds out the truth about his father's death and his whole world goes downhill fast. He falls for a young mother of two and things start to go really wrong after his sister finds out about them. Harley wonders about from day to day, drinking beer and not sleeping. This is a book you need to start on a Friday night so you can stay up all weekend reading it!

Back Roads is not just a gripping story, it is also beautifully written, and the character is completely engaging. The author has captured an endearingly honest (and humorous) voice in Harley. To put the book down felt like hanging up on a friend in need, so I had to keep reading. I look forward to more works by the author."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"In this incredible novel, I was introduced to four children whose lives are destroyed after their mother murdered their abusive father. Their mother was incarcerated, and Harley, the oldest of the four kids and only male in the family, gave up his childhood in order to provide for his sisters.The darkness of the book is illustrated by the cynical and scarred Harley. Sometimes he is not a very likeable character, but the cynicism and anger in his tone is understandable. He becomes obsessed with Carlie Mercer, a young wife and mother he met by way of his younger sister. He subconsciously sees her as some sort of mother figure; the sex scenes between the two characters are rather strange. Harley's sisters are equally messed up. There's Amber: the oldest of the three, a depressed Lolita who finds acceptance in the arms of a man. There's Misty: the mysterious one of the three, the secretive one. And then there's Jody: the innocent and youngest one, the only hope in the family. There are many twists and turns in the story, including murders, obsessions, and incest.This is one of the best novels I have recently read. But I hate the ending -- it is a vivid reminder that life isn't fair."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"O'Dell does an excellent job of portraying how the cycle of abuse can go beyond those obvious instances where an abuse victim does unto someone else the same acts of abuse done unto them. This depiction of the cycle of abuse expands from the physical abuse of a parent to his children to the sexual abuse of the children to each other. The fact that O'Dell writes about the children's abuse of each other in a way that allows you to \\"see the love\\" is indicative of a skilled novelist with superb insight to the psychological working of the mind at various stages of development. Her use of the sexual abuse as an allegory for the emptiness and despair caused by emotional abuse as a child is handled with a precision and care that allows the reader to better understand the circumstances and not focus so much on the nature of the act. Added to this story line is a murder plot that spins with all the elements of a good mystery. The novel is perfected with wonderful characters that are loveable in one chapter, pitied in the next, despised later on. A very well done first novel worthy of your time."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"Such a tragic story, but beautifully written.

This book had it all: 2 murders, sibling molestation, adultry, two family members in jail, one in a mental facility, dog to a &quot;foster&quot; home, one child forced to live with an uncle because the rest of the family self destructed! Oprah didn't miss anything this time. I gave the book five stars because it was well written and kept me turning pages. It was really an &quot;easy&quot; read. Sort of like looking at a car wreck- you know you'll see devistation at every angle, but you have to look - to know.

We meet Harley, a 19 year old young man forced by circumstances to care for his three younger sisters. Their lives are difficult. His mom is in prison for murdering his child-beating dad, Harley works two jobs, his best friend has left for college and he really doesn't know how to raise his two younger sisters or how to handle his wild, 16 year old sister. It's a great story and I really enjoyed reading it. Harley becomes involved with the 33 year old mom of one of his sister's playmates. All of a sudden, though in the middle of the novel, the plot starts taking all of these preposterous twists and turns which I found totally unbelievable and, frankly, unnecessary. Ms. O'Dell is a terrific writer and could have relied on the simple story she was telling, without going for the shock value of these plot twists. Despite these far-fetched twists, her writing drove me to read on and kept me up late reading. Ms. O'Dell clearly has a lot of talent and I will definitely read her next work.

Instead, the back cover blurb calls him &quot;wonderfully touching.&quot; Oh, please.Thank heaven Tawni O'Dell is a much better writer than her blurbist, because Harley Altmeyer is the least likable hero I've run across since Michael Moorcock decided an anorexic albino with a big black sword sounded like a good idea. Note I didn't say antihero there; Harley Altmeyer is certainly the hero of this book in that, while O'Dell keeps him so unlikable he gets nauseating at times, we never stop feeling sympathy for him.Altmeyer is on the brink of his twentieth birthday, and as we open he's sitting in the box in the local police station being grilled by three cops for killing his girlfriend-- who just happens to be the thirty-four-year-old wife of the next-door neighbor. Not terribly surprising, the cops muse, given his roots; Harley's mother was convicted of killing his father a couple years previous, and is now sitting in prison in Indiana, PA (I point this out because for the first hundred fifty pages I wondered how they could drive from Pennsylvania to Indiana in two hours-- and I spent over half my life living less than an hour from Indiana, PA. Obviously a truly memorable place). Harley spends about two hundred fifty pages spinning out his tale, and it's a doozy. After his mom iced his dad, he was dead and she was in jail, and the task of raising his three younger sisters fell squarely on his shoulders. Nineteen, saddled with all the bills, working two jobs, and having to raise three sisters, ranging in age from six to sixteen. It's not exactly a Frank Capra film. And Harley, whose love/hate relationship with all women borders on the psychotic, is in no way going to be mistaken for Jimmy Stewart (actually, I saw Giovanni Ribisi, circa his memorable X-Files appearance, playing this guy).If you've got half a brain and have read enough books along these lines, you've probably got half of it figured before you open the front cover. But O'Dell's writing is so thoroughly disingenuous, and Harley (the very essence of the unreliable narrator!) is so straightforward and quasi-logical that he's completely believable. And so, despite the general predictability of the plot points, they still hit with a roundhouse.The tendency, of course, is to compare this with the other novels in the Oprah stable, but it pulls me in a different direction; there's more here that invites comparison with Ian McEwan's weepingly good first novel, The Cement Garden (and not just the overall plot, either). While McEwan has turned into something of a washed-out pansy since he hit us over the head with that particular cement block, I still have high hopes for O'Dell. This is stark, simple, minimal, easy to read, compelling, with some of the strongest characterization I've come across in years, and somehow the revelations that just kind of wander through the last fifty pages (no big emotional revelatory scenes here) still manage to surprise, not to mention tug at the heartstrings.Oprah found a good'un here, that's for sure. Let's just hope O'Dell doesn't end up a washed-out pansy who moves to England for the sole purpose of getting short-listed for the Booker Prize. *** 1/2"},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"This was one of the worst books I've ever read.

My problem with the book was toward the end, when the story suddenly becomes disappointingly melodramatic. All along I felt the book's strength was in its wonderful characters and Harley having to come to terms with family tragedy, with the mundaneness of life and responsibility, of observing his fierce love and loyalty to his sisters, even in the face of deep family dysfunctions.

So, if you are a mystery lover, this review is probably relevant to you. If you aren't, then this may not be the best review to help you decide if you want to read the book.)Our book club's book for October was BACK ROADS, by Tawni O'Dell. We came to this title in a strange way (then again, we often choose our books in strange ways). We started wondering why Oprah never chooses mysteries for her books, since everyone seems to enjoy them (or almost every one). So we decided to look through her complete list and see if we could find one. We weren't able to, but BACK ROADS seemed like the closest option. But it was quite a while ago: 2000 to be exact. Still, we thought we'd give it a try.BACK ROADS is the story of an orphaned family led by 19-year old Harley Altmeyer, who is taking care of three sisters: ages 16, 12, and 6. Their mother is sitting in jail for killing their father, and when the book opens, Harley is in the police station being accused of killing a woman. We don't know who that woman is until much later in the book, so much of the story is a flashback.There really is mystery here as Harley tries to uncover what happened the day his father was shot; there's also the mystery, too, of the woman Harley is accused of killing. But mostly this is a trenchant story of a family in crisis, I guess what you'd call \\"a real Oprah book.\\" Harley's oldest sister, with whom he has a contentious relationship, is acting out sexually. His middle sister is oddly precocious, passive, even distant. His baby sister is just as cute as anything but even she is starting to have some problems with her unorthodox family. Meanwhile, Harley works two jobs just to make ends meet and provide for his sisters, all the while remembering his father's physical abuse of him and his sisters.This is an intense book with a few turns that took us by surprise, including a few scenes that made some of us uncomfortable because they violate a few taboos. We didn't think this was done luridly, but rather to serve the interests of the story, but it still is not for the sensitive or easily offended. Harley is a well-conceived character, tender and violent by turns, and we thought the author did a nice job of capturing his conflicts and stresses. One of the central revelations packs quite a hard punch (can't say what it is without a spoiler), and many of us (especially the women in the group) were almost physically affected by it. The writing is good even if the plot does wander sometimes.We found some things to criticize, too. The author (a woman) writes in first-person narrative as a 19-year-old male, and many of us (especially the men in the group) didn't believe she really captured the male voice; some felt Harley was too much of a man written by a woman, rather than a \\"real\\" man. Harley's in state-forced counseling with a well-meaning therapist named Betty, and a lot of the book read like THE PRINCE OF TIDES, with Harley working through his issues with a therapist before having his central revelations and closure. Like I said earlier, there are some disturbing things going on in the Altmeyer house, and you need a pretty strong stomach to get through some of them--as well as the book's ending.Overall I think we had very mixed feelings about the book. Some people loved it and said it was one of the best books they'd ever read. Some dismissed it as \\"Oprah schlock\\" (but they did finish it and give it a fair shake) while others felt the central concept was good but the execution clunky.On another note, we were thinking about pressuring Oprah to choose a mystery for her book club at some point in the future. We've read a lot of really great books by people who aren't necessarily households names and thought that Oprah could do the world a favor by bringing some of them to the reading public's attention.

I have seen first hand the effect of abuse and neglect on children. I found this book to be very disturbing, but most of it rings very true to life for many children in this country.The children in this story are trying to survive in the only way that they have been taught. They seek love, acceptance and pleasure and unfortunately they have been taught horrible ways of acquiring these basic needs. Many readers have voiced their repulsion of the graphic detail in which this author describes the actions of these children. I found these descriptions to be very disturbing, but necessary to show the long term detremental effects to abused children.As a mother of four children, I found the behavior of the mother to be the most disturbing. The father was a mean and horribly abusive man who deserved to be shot, but the mother was also involved by letting the abuse happen. The story does reveal that she had been saving money to leave her husband, but I am very doubtful that she had planned to take the children away with her. She seems to be content with her life in prison where she does not have to care for her children. Neglect and indifference is sometimes just as harmful to children as physical abuse.I found myself thoroughly engrossed in this book and unable to put it down. It wanted to step into the lives of these children and help them to survive. I am the oldest of four sisters and am still very protective of my younger siblings, especially the youngest. I will remember this story for many years and would encourage everyone to pick this book as a must read."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"This book started out pretty fast, and I enjoyed the author's storytelling technique. However the unrelenting bleakness of the story just wore me down. One of the reviews on the cover said : &quot;A page turner, gritty...funny,... sexy,. It was a definite page turner, but it was like watching a train wreck and not being able to turn away. It was gritty enough for me to feel like I needed to bathe after reading it. I do not find anything funny or sexy about murder, sexual and physical abuse, not to mention incest and insanity. If you enjoy reading books that are bleak, sad, sorrowful and with no happy ending in sight, this is the book for you. Although I don't believe every book should have a happy ending, I read mostly for entertainment, and this book was not at all enjoyable for me."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"This book is not the typical book you might expect. It's a story about a young man who is suddenly thrust into the position as head of the household when his mother is taken to prison for killing his father. The entire book is written from the point of view of Harley Altmeyer, the protagonist.I would never have expected a woman to be able to get into the mind of a man, but Tawni O'Dell has written this book exceedingly well. She portrays Harley as a troubled teen on the verge of adulthood who has had to grow up too fast.Ms. O'Dell's descriptions of how Harley blanked out his early life with his mother and father, only to remember it in snippets during his sessions with a psychiatrist and during stressful times is intriguing. You feel as though you can see into this young man's mind as he's remembering things.There are several things that caught my interest--his relationship to Jody, the baby sister, his sister Amber and his sister Misty. Amber and Misty have unique personalities that comes out in the shocking ending.I was not able to put this book down for the last 3-4 chapters. I absolutely HAD to finish it, it was that compelling."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"Kudos to Tawni O'Dell!...this is an excellent book. I have to admit that I finished the book all in one day...I could not put it down...you get so involved in the lives of these poor, vagabond children who are survivors...forced to survive and try to cope amongst almost impossible odds. The story is real and gripping and yes sometimes a bit disturbing but that makes it that more exciting...I grew up in Southwest PA so it was great to see how Tawni really brought to life the area and the people that make it up. I highly recommend this novel to anyone and Ms. Dell...you have a lifelong fan in me!"},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"This is a story of a truly dysfunctional family. A mother in prison for the murder of a husband that physically and emotionally abused her children. Four children left in the world to fend for themselves. The effects of the abuse lingered on long after the murder of the father. Harley is the oldest, left to care for his three sisters. In addition to the normal &quot;troubles&quot; of a nineteen year old boy, Harley had to deal with poverty, thoughts of violence, poverty and mental illness. Two of the sisters have problems and secrets of their own. The youngest is the only light in Harley's world. This story is depressing throughout. You would hope for a light at the end of the tunnel for this family but there is only more of the same. It has a dissapointing ending that leaves you with a lingering feeling of sadness. It was an interesting book but I found the foul language and violence unsettling. It could have been written well without it."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"This is one of the best books I have read in a long time. The story is wonderful, but the best part is the story-teller. Tawni O'Dell is a straight-forward writer, and spins a wonderful tale of angst, anger, frustration, hope, and human resilience. I read the entire book in 24 hours. I couldn't put it down! It is a must read."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"What a slippery demarcation between reality and non-reality exists in this surprising book! That old classic conflict of good vs. evil is equally as elusive... i.e. who IS the good guy anyway?? Of course, Harley can't dream when he's asleep. He's kept busy picking himself up from the constant dream assaults that occur when he's awake. The reader frequently has to reassess her perspective, as more and more of the events Harley struggles with, push their way up from the unthinkable to the probable. This book is hard to put down and you have to love that the author has this wonderful name, maybe a name that a traumatized 20 year old boy would select."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"My sister recommended this book, and I have to admit that I was skeptical at first; it looked dull. Boy, was I wrong!Harley is the perfect anti-hero: angry, cynical and disturbed. Well, you would be too if you experience what Harley experienced. His mother is in jail -- she (supposedly) murdered her husband. Also, his younger sisters cope with the trauma by doing unspeakable things, especially Amber. This book is disturbing, dark and sinister, which makes it great. This is a book that should be devoured. It rules!"},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"This book will stay with its readers for a very long time. Just when you think your compassion for this family of children has reached its limits, you will find you'll need more. It truly touches your heart to read about the struggle merely to survive and the responsibilities of a very young man to deal with the complexities he encounters. You will undoubtedly wonder about a system that would allow totally dysfunctional parents to wreak so much grief on their children in so many ways without interference. Every adult in their lives has abandoned these children. The end is devastating and, in retrospect, predictable."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I bought this book for my mom for Mother's Day. After receiving the book, I started thumbing through it and was a little concerned with the amount of reference to sex I found in just the few pages I read over. I didn't want to give my mom a book that would be embarrassing. Not being much of a reader, I decided to just go ahead and read some of it and decide if it was a good gift for her. Well, let me tell you, I read all 338 pages of the book in less that 24 hours. I thouroughly enjoyed the book and feel anyone with compassion will also find it interesting."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"Tawni O'Dell is tough and gritty and poignant and quick. She hits hard and creates characters that live with you. I couldn't put this book down, waiting to see what Harley would do next, hurting for him, wanting to be him, anxiously hoping he would survive. With a cup of fine vanilla coffee, a little rain, the New York Night and my favorite reading music (John McArthur's, &quot;HIDDEN&quot;) I started Back Roads and didn't finishe until the story was done. Buy this book."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"This was everything a good book should be.

Definitely a writer to watch - and definitely an audio to listen to"},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"This book is a masterpiece. Tawni O'Dell has created the darkest, most disturbing, yet insanely fascinating story I may have ever read. Now that the father is dead and the mother is in prison for killing him, 19-year-old Harley finds himself with too much on his plate. He's suddenly thrown into a new home life where he is the boss, moneymaker, bill-payer and legal guardian of his three younger sisters. Such a big responsibility for someone who can't get a grip on reality. Ms. O'Dell takes us into the mind of a teenager who has had to grow up too fast. She writes with fury and ease, making Harley both frightening and loveable.Back Roads is an incredible story with lots of twists and turns that leave you breathless, anxious and sick to your stomach. Tawni O'Dell creates scenes that are horrific and terrifying, but something about the flow in which she writes keeps you going, poised on the edge of your seat, until the very end. Very witty and funny for such a sad, depressing book. Must read."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"What a wonderfully written book this is! The author, a woman, writes from the point of view of a young man so brilliantly, so honestly, you would never ever guess it was written by a woman, she did a truly exceptional job getting into Harley's mind. The story is devastating, this poor boy from an abusive dysfunctional home is trying to shoulder the burden of caring for his three sisters, to be the man his disgusting dead father never was. He works two jobs in a nowhere town, gets nothing but grief from his sisters, is riddled with grief and bitterness and hormones. Their house is falling apart, they are eating garbage-y junk food, and there is very little help for any of them. I could sense tragedy, if not a massive nervous breakdown, coming from the very start. This is not a pleasant book. We sit and laugh at the Jerry Springer people on TV but this is the sort of hopeless, ignorant, mind-numbing background they come from, and more people should be aware of it. Because violence, ignorance, and poverty do not produce nice polite happy people. Tawni Wells, major congratulations to you for capturing Harley's voice and world so pefectly. You made me cry, and I can only hope this pathetic family (what's left of it) will survive and someday be in a happier place."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"My Michigan reading pal wrote me an e-mail to RUN to the bookstore to get Back Roads, the premiere novel by Tawni O'Dell. She's never steered me wrong so I did - and then spent every spare minute in the next two days with my nose in it. Ms. O'Dell writes very convincingly as Harley, the male 19 year old protagonist of this Greek Tragedy.This book is not for everyone and I applaud Oprah's courage for choosing it. The subject matter is gruesome and disturbing. This is the kind of story that most of us want to run from. But Ms. O'Dell's narrative is too gripping and to REAL to turn from. I will be in the front of the line to purchase her next offering."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I have to say that I'm very impressed with this first novel. Harley Altmeyer is a character with incredible depth that actually stays with you long after the last page. He's a confused and troubled young man trying to keep his family together after his mother murders his father. He works two jobs to keep their lives together but slowly begins to unravel after he mets the older, Callie whom he loses his virginity to and after he starts uncovering the shocking truth behind his family.Many people might find the subject matter to be a little offensive. I think the book was done in a way that was able to take you beyond the disturbing to the truth. This stuff happens and whether we like to admit or not, it happens every day. Tawni takes you into this boy's life and sucks you in with the thoughts and feelings of this kid who is in trouble.Highly sexual, beautifully written, I loved this book. However, if one is offended easily, this isn't for you. Read it with an open mind and open heart. A truly brilliant piece of work!"},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"After Daughter of Fortune, (HATED IT) I was hesitant to follow Oprah's advice on another book. I am glad I did. Back Roads is a wonderful book, full of thought-provoking images and detail. It is not a book you'd want to pick to pass time because you'll read it in a day... it's a page turner. I laughed at one page and cried at the next. It causes you to pause and wonder what you'd do in Harley's situation and then thank God you're not in Harley's situation. Sadly, 'Harley's situation' happens to more kids than we'd like to admit."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"As a college student who doesn't have the time or energy to read for pleasure, I didn't expect to finish this book. However, when I picked it up on a Friday, I couldn't put it down and had it finished by Sunday! I was disappointed to know that this was Tawni O'Dell's only novel - I can't wait to read the next one. There's never a dull moment in this one and I may just read it again. I laughed out loud and cried at the end!"},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"This book is not for the faint of heart. The summary inside the dust cover gives absolutely no indication of what kind of ride this book will take you on. But, this is good because everything that happens will surprise you. It will also likely shock you. But if you do read it, you will love it.This book is narrarated by a troubled boy, Harley, the eldest in a highly disorganized and dysfunctional family. He is just barely out of high school, but must raise his younger sisters alone after his abusive father is killed and his mother sent to prison for the murder. Harley is amazingly insightful as well as slightly delusional. However, the things Harley experiences at 19 and 20-years-old, with relatively little experience, will rally you to his side. Harley will make you chuckle, he may terribly disgust you, but he will definitely teach you the meaning of honesty and truth. And... I haven't remembered being so satisfied with the ending of a book in a long time."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"If there's any theme to the books Oprah chooses, it would have to be dysfunctional families. Don't get me wrong-she's made some interesting and daring picks, and has probably done more to promote decent literature than anyone else since who knows when-and here's another choice on that theme. It reminded me of earlier choice &quot;White Oleander,&quot; and like that novel, &quot;Back Roads&quot; is memorable and worth reading.The family in this book is probably the most out-of-whack in any in the Oprah oeuvre. After his mother kills his father and is sentenced to life in prison, nineteen-year-old Harley Altmeyer is given two choices. As he puts it: &quot;I could be an ADULT with DEPENDENTS, or an ORPHAN with NOTHING.&quot; Harley has chosen the former, and questions his choice every morning he sets off to work two full-time jobs, coming home to three younger sisters. Harley is a tremendously appealing character, funny and wry, who knows he's got way too much on his plate. His life, his home, and his sisters are a mess, and he's not getting much help in the small mining town he lives in. It's no wonder that he falls in love with the first person who seems to see beyond the chaos surrounding him, and this is a terrible choice.Tawni O'Dell has done a remarkable thing. She's written a book filled with despair and shocking revelations, which is peopled by likeable and believable characters. &quot;Back Roads&quot; speaks to people's resilience in even the most extreme circumstances. It deserves to be read."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"This is my review over the book Backroads. I think it is a great book. I would recommend it to almost anyone,except the little ones. This book is very expressive and descriptive. It does show the reality of life and what some people in the world go through. This shows how many kinds of different people there are in the world. Harley, the main character, happens to be a strong person for what he has went through. Harley has had his downpoints which was about everyday, but he stuck through. His sisters also did give him a hard time also. He loved them a lot, but that was one thing he was afraid of was love. Love because his father was very abusive and no one was ever there for him emotionally so he just feels a little threatened. His sisters are very young and were not to understand. At least in my opinion. They lived in a smaller town so everyone knew everything that went on in that family. I feel bad because if you think about it everyone in society today judge everyone by what they hear, what people look like, it is very hard to fit in to the higher class these days. Harley tried his best and just lives every day as best as he can."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I found this book hard to put down, BUT it truly disturbed me. I read it w/in 3 days. Maybe I just needed to get through it and I was searching for a light at the end of the tunnel. But Oprah has done it again. She has found something disturbing to that will shake the human core. The synopsis is misleading. Go to your local bookstore, read the first chapter, and get a cup of coffee or tea before you buy the book. I gave it a 2 because the author has potential but the context was WAY to disturbing and we don't need that.*** Warning *** She's a great writer but the context is disturbing.

The character Harley was interesting and likable, and Jody was adorable, but the story itself left me asking &quot;what's the point here?&quot; The twist at the end felt like a Hollywood ending, just trying to shock the reader in order to impress."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"Back Roads is the quirky tale of Harley Altmeyer, a twenty-year-old, deep-thinking, virgin, Pennsylvania hillbilly who's raising his three young sisters--the oldest of whom is a bit slutty--in his mother's stead, since she's in prison for the murder of her abusive husband. Harley, a neo-classical tortured soul, rectifies his virgin status with an older, drunken, married, hotty neighbor. Then things get weird in this literary soap opera. Very weird. But this is not a Jerry Springer Show script. It is a thoughtful novel.The book stands out from the pack for several reasons. Tawni O'Dell takes on a daunting and unusual task: female authoring of a male protagonist in first person narrative. And does a good job. The style is colloquial, age-appropriate, and rich with dark wit and understatement. She paints a clear and seemingly accurate picture of Pennsylvania coal country for out-of-state readers. We are drawn into the story not so much out of affection or connection with Harley, but by morbid curiosity. How bad does it get? At several points I thought the dysfunction was over done. But no, real life gets this bad and worse.I met Tawni O'Dell at a booksigning at the Ruminator (nee Hungry Mind) in St. Paul a few weeks before Back Roads became an Oprah pick. I asked whether she had written other books. Yes, six earlier ones, none of which will ever sell. This fact is illustrative. No one spends the time to write six failed novels and tackle a seventh without a passion for the craft. The product is Back Roads. She's now a polished and courageous writer. Congratulations from Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"Having been born and grown up in western PA around the same time as Tawni O'Dell (though I didn't know her), she painted the perfect picture of the area and the people. I laughed so many times at just how she made me remember.The plot, though peppered with humor, is a sad story. However, it could easily be true which, to me, makes a good novel. It's a \\"depressed\\" area with little to offer culturally or socially and unfortunately, I can imagine reading a story of this kind in the weekly-published, local newspaper. It isn't beyond belief. This family could easily be your next door neighbor in the \\"back roads\\" of Pennsylvania.Her style of writing is easy to follow and it has a little of everything to offer - humor, twists, suspense, invokes emotion.Overall, I would recommend this book."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"This book was well-written, but I was completely mislead by the back cover. It implied that it was a kind of fun-loving story of struggle and &quot;bumbling heroics&quot;. Uh-uh. It was funny at times, but also dark, sad, shocking, and upsetting. Do not think this is a happy book. It is different, but also very traumatizing, even to those of us who have read loads of very traumatizing material. I'm looking forward to her next book."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"As other reviewers have mentioned this story starts out strongly but falters as it progresses. The author is able to convincingly develop the character of Harley and he has a distinctive voice.I enjoyed the initial parts of the book, but the subsequent developments were completely unbelievable. I'm unwilling to accept the reality of a story that has two members of one family separately committing murders. The plot does not tie together and is ultimately very disappointing."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"Reviews often tell too much of a book, so I'll only say that I go to the library each week, find about 10 books with possibilities, then go home and start on them. Two pages and you know if the person can write well. Ten pages and you know if there is a story and a character you care about. This week Tawni O'Dell's Back Roads was the only book that made it past page 10. A woman writing from a 19 year-old boy's perspective, and I care about him, and believe him, even like him. Harley is confused, eruptive, tender, hormonal, dark, and hurting. All of this while he takes care of his three sisters after their mother kills their father. Ms. O'Dell takes us through Harley's mind and backwoods world. There are a lot of books that let us escape into the dangers of the outer world. But here we are taken into the inner world of Harley's thoughts. The book arcs leisurely, like real life, letting us descend into the tangles of this young man's head. And we might be surprised to find some of our own thoughts there. This is a fine book. I recommend it, and thank Ms. O'Dell for writing it."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"Let me first say that this book was one of the most emotionally grueling I've read concerning the circumstances of the main characters. O'dell does an insanely good job constructing a story that is so wrought in severe psychological pain.Then there's Harley. The parallels from Harley to Salinger's Holden are very noticeable. Harley is a less refined, more violent, angry, and sexually depraved character than Holden. Then again, his situation is more extreme. Yet Harley is also more loving than Holden. Harley's narration, voice, tone, and mood is very similar to that of Holden's, which made Back Roads a very compelling read.I won't even get into the horrific scenes that take place here. All I can say is that I was so engrossed in the story that I was annoyed when I had to put the book down.Highly recommended-but not for those who are offended by very vulgar and violent scenes. Also beware, you are reading the mind of a 20 year old boy who was severely abused, both mentally and physically and has responsibilities that are beyond comprehension."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I thought that the writing was good, but the story was awful. It was just an absolutely depressing story about someone whose had EVERYTHING go wrong it his life. The way it ended was annoying and extremely depressing. It was not \\"funny\\" at all as the back cover boasts."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"This book, while vivid and well-written, was just too brutal for my taste. I am usually a fan of dark fiction, but this was simply too devastating.

Granted, my family isn't nearly as bad as this. There's no incest nor is there murder. But I can understand the threat.Also, I'd like to warn you, this review does contain spoilers for the story, so if you don't want to be spoiled, stop right here and go on to the next review. Oh, and speaking of this, be careful reading any reviews before reading the book. I read some before I read it and I got spoiled for the ending which totally took the impact of the twist away. So, ye be warned.I absolutely love how Tawni painted Harvey. Here's a 19 year old boy who's struggling with the death of his abusive father, the incarceration of his mother, and having to raise his three younger sisters. Jody's a sweetheart, but he fears her being in this environment will make her end up like her two older sisters. Misty is a psycho. Understandable? Yes. And everything points back to their father. But she's pretty screwed in the head. And Amber's a little tramp, pulling a kind of Cruel Intentions and going after the one person she can't have.I loved the dark twistedness of this story. Here Harvey was, having sex with a married woman with two young children, trying not to let Amber take advantage of him, and trying to stay sane as he works two or three (not sure which) full time jobs so they can barely scrape by.By the end, I feel so bad for him. After going through everything, he finds his peace by being locked up? Especially for admitting to a crime his skank of a sister committed and for her finally taking advantage of him. That just sucks. But the characters are written in a way to where even though they do horrible things, the reasons behind them are very realistic and make you feel sorry for them.I definitely recommend this book. If you're a sucker for a story that doesn't have a happy ending and is pretty much as realistic as it gets, then this is the story for you."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"The characters in this book remind me of some charachters that were in the movie \\"Deliverance\\" The writing is good but sometimes hard to follow when the main character Harley has flashbacks of bits and pieces of childhood memories. It was hard for me to figure out if there was child abuse the author gives you hints but it's very vague. There are some disturbing themes in this book which doesn't surprise me given the title,setting and family history. The ending could have been better."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"O'Dell's story captures all the facets of an extremely dysfunctional family with raw, shocking realism - outright physical and verbal abuse, insinuated sexual abuse, incest and murder. As the novel unfolds, it becomes obvious that the male narrator is mentally disturbed but it's nearly impossible not to sympathize with his situation. O'Dell also does an excellent job of portraying his sexual frustrations, not to mention the overall confusion and desperation of a young man who has had too much responsibility thrust upon him. I highly recommend this novel. It is compulsively readable and well written."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"\\"Back Roads\\" will not leave anyone untouched. Judging from the majority of customer reviews of this novel here on amazon.com, and from my own experience of reading it, you will either love it or hate it. There is just no way you would finish this book, put it aside and think \\"Oh, well...\\". While I was reading \\"Back Roads\\", there were times when I just wished it could be over, because I didn't know if I could take one more chapter of Harley Altmyer's truly crappy life. But still, I couldn't stop turning the pages. This is an amazing novel, and you will be glad you read it. Yes, there will be moments when you'll wish you hadn't, but if you're ready for a truly gripping and emotional experience, do not pass on this one."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I loved how the characters past experiences were explained while they lived and struggled day to day. Tawni writes in a way that flows like a river, not confusing at all. You love the characters and identify with their UNIQUE struggles in coming to terms with their situation the best they can. It's real and raw and a joy to read."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"This is a dark tale about hardship, family, and all of the things nobody ever likes to talk about. Once I started reading this book, I couldn't put it down. I thought the characters were well developed and I absolutely loved the writing style. The author created a world using minimal description, she never got too involved with the details and chose instead, to stick with telling the story and letting readers use their own imaginations. The writing was simplistic but it was a perfect fit for the tone of the novel. This is one of those novels that sticks with you for days after you read it. I hope Mrs. O'dell will write something new soon!"},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I read this in one day. Just could not put it down. Gorgeous writing - Ms O'Dell is some author. Can't wait to read her next book. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I found this book to be very sad...not sad in a weepy way, but sad in a pity way. The life that was left for these kids to lead was so hard, it's no surprise the book ended the way it did.Harley is a nineteen year old kid whose forced to take care of his three sisters (Amber-16, Misty-12, and Jody-5) after their mother kills their father and is sentenced to life in prison. Life is not easy for these kids who live in the back woods of an old Pennsylvania coal mining town. Harley's working two crappy jobs, trying to pay the bills and put food on the table, and dealing with a whole mess of problems at the same time.Faced with a family of three sisters who don't seem to appreciate anything he does, one sister who keeps making incestuous advances towards him, another sister who seems to be encouraging her to do so, a married neighbor who starts having an affair with him, and in the end, a murder, it's no surprise that Harley starts to lose his mind.I won't go into it anymore, but this was a hard book to put down. Just when you think you knew everything that was going on, another (sometime disturbing) surprise is thrown at you. While I personally enjoyed 'Coal Run' (Ms. O' Dells second novel) a little more, this book was definitely not a disappointment. Some pretty heavy stuff, but a very good book."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"This book was spectacular! This is the kind of stuff that happens to people in everyday life. With a little less of the drama. It really puts the reader in Harley's shoes. The ending is not what you would hope.. but thats what makes it great!"},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"Wow! This book was not at all what I was expecting. I thought it was going to be about Harley, who was going through hard times trying to raise his other 3 sisters after their mother shot and killed their father. It was about a lot more than that.This book is kind of a look into the lives of children who have suffered abuses at the hands of their parents- emotional, physical or sexual. This families life was completely screwed up! I'm quite used to graphic writing, but even I was surprised at some of the violent thoughts in this book. Which is why I have a hard time with everyone calling Harley a hero- I don't see that.It's really a sad story. You keep wishing for things to get better for this little family, but it just seems to get worse and worse. I do agree with some of the other readers- this book is a bit flawed. I just feel like the resolution and ending was not quite worth it. And the character development wasn't up to par. I think it could have been improved. Or maybe it was that I was just looking for a happy ending. Be warned, this book is often hard to read, it's a sobering subject. But maybe it's a story that needed to be told."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"This recent novel, a novel and Oprah Pick by Tawni O'Dell, gives us a fascinating protaginist in Harley. Harley is a nineteen year old with far too many responsibilities. His father is dead, and his mother in prison for his murder, leaving Harley in charge of his three younger sisters, and working two minimum-wage jobs in a rural Pennsylvania town to support them. Harley is still trying to grow up himself. With state-provided therapy, Harley begins working through his family dynamics, to ultimately bring him to realizations about his life and family, perhaps that he doesn't want to have.Back Roads is ultimatly a story of violation. Parents violate their children's trust, a teenager violates a neighbor's body, and ultimately there is a violation of the social order and law. This isn't an easy book to read - I often found myself flinching at the violence and darkness in the pages of the book. And, the resolution may be ultimately unbelievable. That said, it is worthwhile book in its look at rural poverty and child abuse."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"Back Roads is an OK written, interesting book. Yes it's disturbing but the bigger flaw is that it a little over the top with all that happens to this little &quot;family&quot;. That and the evolution of Harley's relationship with Callie Mercer was not believable.There are moments of clever prose and humor but otherwise, everything that goes on in the story is too busy and the author fails to weave this story into something realistic. The story stays interesting due to the shock value of events rather than digging deeper into the thoughts of Harley, other characters, or even Harley's perceptions of other characters. With this book, I just thought that all the characters in the book didn't have all their marbles thus their odd, unusual behavior. Case in point, the fact that Callie had a failing marriage just didn't convince me that she would have a sexual affair with a pimply faced, awkward 19 year old while he's bleeding due to a severe injury.Lastly, I do agree the description of the book on the book is misleading. I don't know why it's described as &quot;sexy&quot; and &quot;funny&quot; when the subject matter was so dark. I also did not think Harley was all that likable... another overstatement in the description of the book."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I bought this book without knowing a thing about it. When I saw the &quot;oprah&quot; selection on it, I almost took it back... I wasn't interested in a smarmy, uplifting book. I was looking for something snappy and a bit dark. After reading one page though I knew I had made the right decision. The book was gripping, I couldn't stop once I started, but I didn't want it to end. It was brilliant, and oh so painful to read. You just want to go into the book and help those kids in some way, yet you know their world is so ugly and so intimate, there would be no room for strangers. Three cheers to Tawni O'Dell on this book, and to her publishers for putting it out. I recommend this book highly, but only to people who can deal with the harsh, ugly realities of life. This isn't a book for kids. And it isn't a book for light reading. I finished the book several weeks ago, and still have to pick it up to read the ending over and over because I couldn't remember it. The entire story is what sticks in your mind, not the outcome."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I'm not sure if I liked this book, but it impacted me and caused me to think about it after I was done reading it. Sometimes we come across things like that. Its dark and violent and many people will not like this book for that reason. It is moving and leaves an impression, but not a positive one. Any book that makes me think about it and discuss it with others I believe is good because it does just that. I don't think this book was written for enjoyment but, to provoke thought and think about situations that might be strange in our lives, but also very real for others."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"This story is disturbing and mesmerizing at the same time. All of the characters are very complicated and true understanding probably isn't possible with just one reading. Harley is one of the most fascinating characters I've ever come across. He is so human and vulnerable it's difficult to believe he is a figment of the author's imagination. The smart humor interjected at critical points in the story saves it from being depressing. There is a lot in this book to ponder and I don't think that I will soon forget it."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"From what I've gathered, people either really love this book or really hate this book. It is very smartly written and I think can almost compare to &quot;Catcher in the Rye,&quot; in that Harley's quest is as surreal and heartbreaking and truthful as that of Holden Caulfield. This book is shocking. It is written VERY truthfully and does not gloss over real-world issues. I wouldn't recommend this book for the squeamish, or those readers who read to forget the world and feel good at the end. But if you like eye-opening literature with no holds barred, this is a book for you!"},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"Backroads is about what dysfunction can do to a family.It's about a system that doesn't work.It's about a mother who allows her husband to beat the [stuffing] out of her and her kids.It's about generational patterns.It's about a father who will not change.It's about how innocence can transform into immoral, ugly behavior.******Tawni O'dell has hit the nail on the head with her male narrator...How did she do that so well!Harley is sooo teenagery male that I wonder if O'dell had lots of brothers (or something.)I love Harley. I know Harley. I have gone out with many a Harley. He is a bad boy dying to be good. He is just a kid who happens to have dysfunctional parents and grandparents. He is a brother who because of circumstance, becomes a parent himself.So here it is...Harley's mom ends up in prison and he ends up taking care of his three younger sisters. This is no small task for a nineteen year old. Especially since one of them is going through hormonal stuff herself, experimenting (Alot) with sex, boys, her independence. On top of that...she is [upset] as heck that he is stuck watching them in the first place. Harley works two jobs and still can't put food on the table (an abundance of hot dogs) is about as good as it gets.It's not fair. Life isn't fair. Harley lets the reader know this right off the bat. Harley doesn't hold back anything.He meets Cally in the super market (A mother figure who happens to have a fantastic figure.) She is a 32 year old miserable house-wife. Guess what happens after that? Virginal Harley gets what he has been dreaming, thinking, and praying for. I hate 32 year old women like that! She should be put in jail.This book is full of tenderness, wit,humor, magnificent dialouge, and what not to do as parents!!!!!!!I loved it.And I pray that all of the Harley's out there will come out of their \\"Bad Boy Shells\\" and reveal the \\"Good Boy\\" who has been waiting to free himself (even if their parents were jerks)."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"This is not a feel good book.The story, hopefully,takes you places you've never been.

I believe that is why the one person responded negatively."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I enjoyed reading the book all the way through. A young boy is left to take care of his 3 younger sisters.They came from an unhappy home where the mother finally kills the father and she is sent to prison.Books that touch the emotions are my favorite and this one does that very well. It is a great story and you will love it."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"This book is incredible. What may be surprising is there are really people out there who function similarly to Harley and his younger sister's. That is why it is believable as shocking as it may seem. What is also impressive is how Tawni writes of a male character in first person. You would have to think she has known or lived with someone who shares characteristics of the characters. Harley, a character almost like Holden Caufield, struggles with his feelings of anger, forgiveness, restraint, and so on. All I can say is it is a must read. One of my favorites, definitely."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"First, I did like the writing in this book. Tawni O'dell has a great future. Someday she may shudder when she rethinks Back Roads' contrived plot twists and pirated themes (Sexy older woman seduces virgin lad as in The Graduate, Summer of 42, etc). Inside the dust jacket the reader is told the main character (Harley) is a &quot;loveable...endearing hero...who in the end with his bumbling heroics, redeems them all&quot;. And who, I ask, was &quot;redeemed&quot;? Each character was portayed as a loser and remained a loser in the end. There was nothing &quot;uplifting&quot; or humorous about the situation. It's about denial, adolescent selfishness, blame shifting, adultery, patricide, incest. About as far from loveable and endearing as you can get but perhaps that reviewer didn't actually read the entire book. The end of the book ends really creepy which was a big disappointment. I could see it coming about 3/4th the way through but kept hoping O'Dell would maintain control of the story and not let it evaporate into a mindless spray of melodrama. Unfortunately, the final scenes were way over-the-top and the entire story lost credibility. I would like to read more of Tawni O'Dell's writings because she is a talented writer. I hope her plot developments mature and are more original."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"one word, AMAZING! Not only did i comprehend the novel on a standard reading level, but also on a much deeper psychological manner. All the cahracters were so uniue yet led similar lifes. It was beautiful written, and had me turning page after page until none were left to turn. The twisted ending left me irritated and stupid because i htought for sure the book ended in a different way. ALso, i can alwasy tell the ending of a book. Howevr, with this novel i had no idea what would happen next. Eventualy, i just stopped trying to guess, and just read what happened next. The interchanging pattern from the pschological views to the actions happening right then and there made the book very captivating. I hope that O'Dell continues to write amazing books like this novel."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"Tawni O'Dell's Back Roads presents a portrait of a family falling apart. The cover would lead one to believe that this is simply a small town coming of age story but the plot goes much deeper. This is a story ripe with incest, murder and family disfunction to rival anything in today's tabloids.The story's protagonist is 20 year old Harley Altmyer. He is the sole provider for his family of three younger sisters after the the murder of his father. The problem is that Harley's life is falling apart.While the book does give one an interesting read the ending is extremely contrived and leaves something to be desired. While I would recommend it in general, it is not one of the best books that I have read this year."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"If you feel that you must read it because it appears on Oprah's list then at least do yourself the favor of purchasing the paperback.

For, in my *OWN* opionion, I do not belive they were referring to the &quot;themes portrayed&quot;...but to Harely, the main character, for his **wittyness, and sharpness.**I certainly do not, believe that the reveiwers were sitting there saying...&quot;....family abused..haha..father killed....hahaha..that's funny&quot;If you got that impression. I'm very sorry that you missed some very great moments from Harely."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"The story line is action-packed and filled with angst from start to finish as the strong characters generate feelings from the audience not often seen in a family drama. The story line is fast-paced, filled with amusing moments, and loaded with tidbits that anchor the time and place without slowing the plot one iota. Tawni O'Dell's hero, Harley Altmeyer, is spry, keen, and independent with a mind as sharp as ever.BACK ROADS is an exciting and realistic novel that never slows down for even a page. The story line works because the characters seem so believable and the Pennsylvania landscape adds a degree of freshness not often seen in a Keystone State contemporary. The delightful lead characters and a strong secondary mix leaves the audience with a powerfully entertaining Tawni O'Dell novel to savor. With BACK ROADS she scores big as she turns the multi-layered plot into one of the author's greatest triumphs.Lurdane Blurber"},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I had to laugh when one of the other reveiwers wrote, &quot;... ignore Oprah's abused-protagonist-of-the-month-club.&quot; All the books I've read on her list are exactly that!

As these things (murder, incest, child abuse) are brought forward to his conscious mind by a court appointed psychiatrist, he finally breaks down completely and has to be institutionalized. Now that all the secrets are out, maybe the family will be able to heal and move forward. You can only hope that their mother will be released from prison and the girls will get the help they need.

Highest recommendation."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"Author is a really good story-teller. The several twists were different for a change. Many reviews said you you really feel for the protagonist but I usually disliked the way he thought of, and treated others.

I certainly would not recommend it for younger readers. Being older than dirt myself, I was able to handle it and rather enjoyed it and in fact could sort of relate to it. Of course I could always relate to Holden too, so....Anyway, I would recommend digging into it, with the that it is a bit rough in places and some could well find it offensive. It is well worth the time though."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"Back Roads, by Tawni O'Dell, was a great book. I thought that Harvey, the main character, was the best character I have read about in a long time. Harvey has so much responsibility on him, and although he always does the right thing on the outside, it is interesting to hear his thoughts on the inside. He is full of disdain and almost hatred for everyone around him, and is often fuming with rage. Although the book dabbles in such dark topics as incest, murder, and insanity, the characters still come across as very normal. The way it was written made me feel close to all of the characters, and it made me feel like any of these terrible things could happen to me. There was also a lot of imagery in the book. O'Dell has a talent for setting the scene, allowing the reader to see lots of details most writers would overlook. Overall, Back Roads was an excellent read and I would highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"This book has a lot of depth to it.

The main character, Harley, is forced to grow up &amp; take care of his three sisters when his mother is in jail for shooting his father. There are so many stories that unwind &amp; secrets that unlock in this book. This book is about reality &amp; its cruelty. I do not recommend it for the weak-stomached."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"This book is fabulous.

But as I read further, I found the content of the book to degenerate and become highly disturbing, especially the incest theme that threads through the novel. When the father is posthumously found not guilty of incest with his daughter, the reader discovers (and has seen all along) that Harley and Amber have an incestuous attraction or need, and this turned my stomach. I was particularly repulsed to discover Harley and Amber having sex after Harley discovers Callie's dead body--and to top it off, he knows his sister is the culprit. Is this at all realistic? I am interested to know whether sibling incest is a characteristic of parental abuse--I highly doubt it. I found the story outrageous and overly dysfunctional. This book sickens rather than intrigues."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I was not impressed with Tawni Odells syle of writing, I did not like how she introducted the characters.

Hope Tawni does better with her next book."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"Ms. O'Dell has taken the TV show and transported and transformed it from upscale San Fran to poverty stricken Pennsylvania. (Although it could be any &quot;hick town nearest you&quot;) I guess I owe the book one star as I read it to the bitter end. What a disturbing novel! It is written pornograhy at it's peak. I don't exactly feel enlightened by the twisted incest, adultry, child murderers and detailed descriptions of a 20 yr. old male phyco's mastrubation.

WHAT BOOK IS THAT--I want to read it. The characters were interesting at first, but the author took them down a very dark road to the point that you are not interested in any of them (though I did enjoy Callie until her ugly end).I think I am through with Oprah books--I've read a few and they are mostly dark and depressing.

You don't have to be a follower of Oprah's Book Club to enjoy this one. From the first page on, I was completely hooked. You know a book is good when you don't want to stop reading it to do anything else, like sleep or eat.Harley may seem to some as an unsympathetic and down right negative character, but he is mostly justified in his feelings and actions. He is in a horrible situation, his family life is atrocious, his mental health seems to be in question, and everything seems to be working against him. Yet he seems to give it all the best he's got, even when that isn't so great.The writing is fast-paced and engrossing; you just can't stop wondering what is going to happen next. I didn't figure out the ending ahead of time, so it wasn't written too obviously, yet the conclusion was satisfying and didn't seem too absurd (as some endings so often are).

The main character Harley finds himself caught in a situation where he is suddenly the legal guardian of his three little sisters. The three of which have their own unique personalities and who all contribute to the overall flavor of the book. Harley, just like anyone who grew up with little brothers and sisters obviously loves and cares for his siblings. Nonetheless that doesn't stop him from fantisizing about inflicting serious injury on them at times. You love him, then hate him, then love him some more. I found Jody to be so lovable, Amber at times unbearable,and Misty downright frightening. A must read to you book affectionados."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I read this book in 3 days! The title character, Harley takes you through his life in the backwoods of Pennsylvania. It's a little explicit but justifiable for the story. You want to take Harley and his siblings home with you and shield them from the world. You won't be disapointed in this book!"},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"While I was disappointed in the ending, this is an enjoyable, compelling read. O'Dell has written characters with some depth, that one can't help but care for. I look forward to her next book."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"As I read this book, I kept asking myself &quot;Why did Oprah recommend this?&quot; Why is there such a need to write such explicit sex scenes and filth to get your point across. I felt very uncomfortable reading this book. If this was Tawni O'Dell's intent, then she succeded.I did not find it 'funny' at all.I would not allow my teenage children to read this book or recommend it to anyone I know. Will Mrs O'Dell let her children read it and will they feel the same about her afterwards? The insightfulness of Harley was the only positive thing about this book and Jody was a sweet child. Don't waste your money."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"The author writes well and can create strong images and convey powerful emotions. But, the good news ends here. It is no accident that Oprah selected this book. It contains the familiar message of the abuse culture: everything evil we do is really the responsibility of someone else who has treated us badly. Murder is OK, if someone (not necessarily even the murder victim) beat you. This is just dressed up talk show trash. It gives you a jolt when you read it - but it's cheaper to go stick your hand in a light socket."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I really expected to like this book as it started off with vivid descriptions of locales and characters. But it slowly and inexorably descended into a mixture of foul dialogue, foul situations, and some not-to-be-believed character interactions. The climax and ending are totally depressing and left me with a bad taste in my mouth. This book is headed for the trash."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"SIMPLY PUT , I WILL NOT WRITE WHAT THE BOOK WAS ABOUT BECAUSE THERE IS ENOUGH OF THAT ON HERE , AND IT DEFEATS THE PURPOSE OF READING THE BOOK. BUT I HAVE TO SAY .. ITS A TWISTED BOOK , BUT THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ AND I READ ALOT OF BOOKS. I PASS THIS ON TO EVERYONE .. AND YES YOU SHOULD READ IT TOO !!"},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"It was hard to know how to feel about this Tawni O'Dell novel, and it still is to some degree. It may be an Oprah pick, but I have to admit that I don't understand why. It's smutty, classless, disgusting, the language is vulgar, and...well, (grinning as I write this) these are all the ingredients of an addictive read, even if that's so. In fact, that's what keeps you turning the pages!Wow, this book has everything: murder, familial abuse, incest, alcoholism, etc. Anyone would want to read a novel like this as opposed to boring classics like Brideshead Revisited (God, I couldn't even finish that so-called controversial swill!). The problem? There isn't one character in this book you feel any empathy or sympathy for, and if you do, it doesn't last long because O'Dell loves to make them do things that rip the feeling out of you like a twelve inch blade being torn out of your abdomen.Harley is an angry drunk who boinks toilet paper doll covers (actually, that made me laugh out loud) and old ladies and fantasizes about killing his sisters. Amber is the most unlikable little ho-bag with a filthy mouth, and if she were my charge talking to me like that, I would knock every single one of her teeth out. I actually cheered when Harley burned the couch she had sex on with a random boy from school! Who'd want to sit on it after that? I hope he burned the bed after he did her himself as well. Misty is a stupid tomboy who is virtually lacking in any emotion, which was very creepy, and little sister Jodi is annoying as hell, misspelling words no kid her age should be getting wrong. Then again, these kids are white trailor trash, and they go to public school, so I guess I have to find that believable if nothing else in this overdramatic novel is.My favorite thing about this book is that all the wrong people go to jail to protect the innocent murderers. LOL--the only innocent person in this book is Jodi, and you want her to go because she's an illiterate moron for her age. Makes me think of that old Tears for Fears song with slightly different lyrics: \\"Everybody Wants to Go to Jail.\\" Yeah, right, and if you believe that, I'd like to sell you a bridge. Then again, it's the shock value and the incredulity of it all that makes this book entertaining. It's a great, guilty pleasure that ranks up there with the likes of Jacqueline Suzanne's Valley of the Dolls. I recommend it simply because it is entertaining trash, and I'll pick that over boring dreck any day!"},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"This was one of those books that I could not put down. It portrays some brutal truth as to how some families have to live. In this case, Harley steps up to the plate to take care of his 3 younger sisters because his father is dead and his mother is in prison. He's having a hard time dealing with what his life is dishing out to him. He is young and torn between what he wants in life and obligations. It's hard to explain ANYTHING about this book without giving something away. There is always something happening in every chapter. There are a few sexual scenes that could be on the light side of graphic. And a few other situations that could leave you shocked. It is not for the weak of heart or for someone looking for a sweet story of a family. If you begin to read this book and think \\" OH MY GOSH\\" then put it down and step away.I really enjoyed this book. I think that the author did an excellent job telling the story. It should be made into a movie. It's got some twists."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I recently read this book, and I was dissapointed. I saw that is was part of Oprah's book club, so i took a chance and decided to read it. What i got was a book overflowing with over-the-top dirty and disturbing content. Normally, I find one or two disturbing twists exciting, but there are so many in this book that after you finish it you feel nauseous. The character was not likeable, the ending was terrible, and the book is innapropiete for people under 18. I would only recommend it as a book to scare you... and not the good healthy kind."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I just wanted to take a moment to say that I really enjoyed this book. I have just now been getting into the Oprah Book Club. When I read this book I really came to feel for Harley. In the end I came to feel for him more. It seems to me that I really takes so much for some one to get everything together. It's just to bad that I sometimes ends in sorrow. But other than that, the book was excellent!"},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I finished this book 2 days ago, and then lent it to a friend...I'm already itching to get it back so I can read it again!I feel like I need to go back to the beginning and catch up with all the wild twists and turns.I'm afraid the only drawback to me reading this book at the beginning of my summer, is that NONE of my other summer reading will even come close to the quality of this novel. The characters are still with me, and I think they will be for a very long time. Harley is of those characters that you either want to give a hug, or smack and that's an awesome combination! He's a young man in an utterly impossible situation and all you want is for things to get better for him....but they never do, and it leaves you with an ache that's both profound and heartbreaking.I only wish that I could make every person that's ever abused their child read this book. Maybe if people could see what it does to their children and the possible ramifications, they wouldn't be so damned heartless."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I loved this book. I felted that at first the brother Harley did the best he could raising his sisters but i also liked how she the author explained how things went on inside Harley's head."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I couldn't put it down. I was fascinated with Harley. A very unique and well done, dark story."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"Harley's father abused him and his three younger sisters for as long as he can remember. It was a tough way to grow up. Even tougher, though, is his life now. His mother is in jail for murdering his father, and Harley is nineteen and working two jobs to scrape together the money to support himself and his sisters. He is drowning in his life, constantly on edge, and resentful of the mother who put him in this situation.There is one bright spot in Harley's life--his new relationship with the mother of his youngest sister's friend. It isn't ideal. Callie is married and they have to hide their love affair from her husband. It is the only thing keeping Harley sane, though, and only just barely.When Harley starts to piece together bits of the tragedy that landed him in this position, he finds that sometimes the truth is simply more than he can bear.The basic premise of this story is interesting, but I found the characters dull and depressing. Harley doesn't have anything in his life that gives him pleasure except sex with Callie, and even that is tinged with darkness. His sisters seem constantly on the verge of something horrible, but when the truth comes out, it wasn't a huge surprise. It was only surprising that Harley failed to recognize it for so long."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"Twisted and damaged, but I couldn't put it down. Haunting story of family secrets. Great book."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"Beautiful and elegant descriptions, I loved reading this book a second time. A great story with an even better ending."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"One of the most amazing aspects of O'Dell's writing is that she leads you to draw one conclusion about a character, and then slowly feeds you evidence that you've misjudged. I think that's what I enjoyed most about this story, the slow reveal leading to the ultimate conclusion. And then I'm left hating the people I respected, and respecting the people I hated. Awesome writing!I can't stop thinking about the story, or the author. She actually grew up in Indiana PA, where this novel is based. As a writer who grew up in a gritty place, I've wondered how to write about the amazing stories I accumulated there. O'Dell has done it, and she's writing another one. I respect her for that.I gave Back Roads 4 stars because of VERY strong 3-dimensional characters, dramatic tension and suspense, a hero I could root for - although anti-hero might be the better term - and a satisfying conclusion. I respected the way the author was able to show Harley, the main character, falling apart under the strain. His internal dialogue revealed such incredibly violent tendencies (which he never acted out - another major victory for this pathetically heroic young man), and those tendencies were backstory! He didn't get that way from the inciting incident. He and his sisters grew up in this situation, and they all reacted to it in different ways.I always like to hunt for themes in a story I enjoy, and in this one I saw the theme of responsibility accepted and shirked. Too much or too little taken on, and the results of that decision. Another theme was the question of Stockholm Syndrome - did Harley have it or not? Did his mom? Who was the tormentor, and who the tormented, in Callie's marriage?All in all, an amazing book. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"This book was like an addictive drug for me. The torture Harley had to endure just trudging through his everyday life hooked me and made me want to root for him even as he entertained his violent fantasies in his daydreams. As an author, I wish I had the talent for creating mood through landscape and metaphor that O'Dell does. I would recommend this and all her books to anyone."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"This seems to be a popular title for both movies and novels. This one is about to become a major motion picture though I have doubts that even the author will recognize it when Hollywood is finished with it. In my library for a decade before I got around to reading it I will admit to its being sensational enough to carry one along intently to its crushing conclusion. This is not a feel-good kind of story. One is moved to feel empathy for Harley's plight realizing the while that he is hopelessly in over his head and that the outcome is not likely to be a good one. Along the way we are thrown several plot twists and unexpected turns of events that keep it interesting. What this book brings home to us most vividly is the woeful state of our social work system with its overworked and under-paid employees and the fact that justice is what can be proved in a court of law, not necessarily truth."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"Hurley Altmyer is a 19-year-old who has taken on the responsibility for his three younger sisters after their mother has been convicted and sentenced to life in prison for shooting their father. He is hanging on by his fingernails - working two low-paying jobs in an effort to keep their house and the family together. But he is clearly at the breaking point, totally unable to cope or even to face the truth of what has happened and is happening.This is a dark psychological story of a family caught in a cyclone of dysfunction. It is violent and crass in places. I was caught up in Harley's life - in his skewed view of the world, and in the downward spiral he is caught in.I did think the book was rather unrelenting in its psychosis. Yes, O'Dell includes some scenes of tenderness, even a few of humor, but it is a powerful and dark vortex in which the Altmyer family (and the reader) is caught. Not a book for the faint of heart."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"While Oprah and her benevolent book-club sticker shed an appropriate spotlight on this masterpiece for a millisecond, it quickly faded into obscurity, as Ms. O soldiered on to conquer the rest of the literary world. Now, as a movie version of this gem (not to be confused with the 1981 rom-com flick of the same name) is supposedly in the works, we are lapping up the chance to revisit it a while.I must tell you, the title implies an appropriate level of Deliverance-style, hillbilly ickyness. However, it fails to foreshadow the uncomfortable alliance the reader quickly forms with the novel's gloomy hero, Harley Altmeyer, as he steps up to take care of his three little sisters, while his disconnected mom rots away in prison for shooting their father like he was a Thanksgiving Day turkey. Some more appropriate titles might be \\"What's a Guy Like You Doing in a Town Like This?\\" or \\"What the Hell Happened to Harley?\\" As one might guess from my cleverly obvious titles, Harley is a bit of a weirdly emo heart-throb (without the eyeliner, of course). Think a dark and damaged James Dean. If you're feeling a little Mrs. Robinson for having a crush on our 19-year old protagonist, don't distress--you're not alone. Harley already has his eye on a local cougar all his own.Off-beat though it is, this novel is seriously well-written, and it sucks you in from page one. You won't want to tear yourself away from the emotional and psychological hairpin turns of Harley's journey."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I loved this book.Although the story was kind of sketchy and disjointed in places... and the ending wasn't one of the best, O'Dell's writing had me captivated. It's very sparse and gritty. So incredibly full of character.I love how she draws her characters. Each one of them is odd in her own sort of way. So much so that you can't help but find them endearing.I had the pleasure of interviewing O'Dell several years back, right after she became an Oprah pick, and I found her to be lovely. Very talented, well spoken and down to earth."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this book. Reading its summary, I thought it wouldn't really be for me. But the writing was so good and the characters compelling. I cannot quite explain why this novel touched me, yet it did. Enough that i'm writing this review years after I read it..."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"Let me say first, I really liked this book. HOWEVER, it is extremely disturbing and intense. How about I put it this way...there's murder, child abuse, adultery and even worse things (that I can't say because it will spoil the book). So, if you have a weak constitution when it comes to the dark side of human nature - skip this book. Otherwise, I think it is a gripping novel that is definitely worth reading.I really liked Harley, the flawed narrator, despite the fact that he's not exactly sane nor a necessarily good person (others in a group did not have such a favorable opinion of him). I loved the fact that the reader discovers the twists and turns in the plot as Harley does. I think that is why I felt so much sympathy for his character - we were going through this shocking experience together.I read this book in two sittings as it is quite the page turner. Family secrets, hidden truths, sexual impulses and the Altmyer family legacy of violence converge into an explosive ending. If you can handle a really dark book - I highly recommend Back Roads."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I found this book to be exceptional I read it in 3 days.Was outstanding & what family will do to protect others in there family.Including jail time.Was just a great read our book club had to read it for this month."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"In a word...Heartstopping. The anguish and pain Harley Altmeyer succumbs to is by no means humorous as the hard cover jacket would have you believe. Immediately, I interpreted his vivid descriptions as his slow decent into mental illness. My heart ached for the poor boy. Responsiblity and adulthood are prematurely forced upon him as a result of a murder of passion. The consequences and TRUTHS revealed in the wake of the murder are disturbing enough to send any adult to an asylum! Non-stop reading."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I just finished this book.

Hopefully this is a first of many novels for this author."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"Another dysfuntional mesmorizing family told from the perspective of the son left to care for his siblings (sounds like Staggering Work but is not). The family is multilayered and psychologically complex. At every turn there is another &quot;incident&quot; that left me gasp. This book is a modern american tragedy. Ms. O'Dell does a masterful job telling this story which is heart wrenching. At the end you will find yourself empathizing with all of the characters...the good, the bad and the ugly. Though I do not expect it, I would love a sequel to find out what happens to the characters. Enjoy. This book is hard to put down."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"This is a well-written book. The most amazing thing about it is that a thirty something year old mother of two i.e. the author Tawni O'Dell can write such a convincing story whose protagonist is a 20 year old man who is taking care of his 3 sisters and faces the usual trials and tribulations of growing up male. She was right on in her character development. There goes the theory that you can only write about what you know. A good author should be a magician with words and be able to succeed in transporting the reader along with the story. I think Ms. O'Dell succeeded in doing that very well here. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that right from the beginning of the book, I was waiting for something to happen, but it seemed to take a bit too long for the big payoff to occur. A few of the parts in the middle dragged a bit for me, but the conclusion was satisfying."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"What an amazing first novel.
