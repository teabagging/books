However, while occassionally we may stop to marvel at the complexity, spohistication, or elegance of her language it is more often than not the philosophical depths with she is able to illuminate in her most simple phrases and candid characters. The characters in Middlemarch, specifically, are indeed well developed but they are not complex-- rather they play off each other to illustrate to the reader a human composite. Each one seems to have a dominant theme about them that when combined with each other draws a picture of true humanity-- complete with its contradictions and dichotomies. This is the beauty of the novel and why we reread certain sections-- Eliot makes us care about everyone in the piece and all their stories as all are essential in determining our own instrinsic emotional reaction.Middlemarch is not a page turner-- it does require an emotional committment. . .however, it is worth all a reader's energy."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"I have enjoyed this book. I'll save everyone the time and not comment on the characters, (although intriguing and realistic) or the themes and situations (all of which impact the reader). I would only add that the language and rhetoric George Eliot uses is consummate. Truly I didn't know anyone could write THIS WELL until I read THIS BOOK. Others come close in style - Dickens perhaps, but only George Eliot offers clever descriptions and beautiful language which add to the flow of this book. Coming from an 18 year old male, I wasn't sure I would like this book. However, George Eliot offered me a new love for Victorian Literature, and presented characters who are timeless.&quot;Our deeds still travel with us from afar, And what we have been makes us what we are.&quot;&quot;Even if a man has been acquitted by a jury, they'll talk, and nod and wink - and as far as the world goes, a man might often as well be guilty as not.&quot;&quot;Scenes which make vittal changes in our neighbours' lot are but the background of our own, yet, like a particular aspect of the fields and trees, they become associated for us with the epochs of our own history, and make a part of that unity which lies in the selection of our keenest consciousness.&quot;"},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"The BBC miniseries was my first exposure to the world of Middlemarch; then, of course, the novel had to be read. The author was a woman, Mary Ann Evans, writing under a man's penname. And sure, the language is very archaic - this was written in the mid-1800's! At times the density of the prose tried my patience, and the many references to old literature/quotes quite puzzling. But I'm glad I stayed with this Classic (sometimes skipping over very obscure-to-me passages) - why? Because the characterizations and \\"asides\\" made me laugh aloud. The insights are just too jewel-like, sprinkled throughout this tale of the complex (and the simple) people of Middlemarch, their friends and mentors, enemies, losses and gains, marriages; their various Loves.The sort-of Epilogue was very satisfying also, to see what \\"ends\\" our beloved Middlemarchers come to in the course of their lives - some happy, some not so happy. The last line, describing Dorothea, is a poignant statement of all those who \\"live hidden lives\\" - outwardly insignificant, perhaps, but nonetheless as worthy as gold."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"Can't complain about the price--it's free--but the formatting could be better, and there are a lot of typos (or scannos, assuming they're from a scanner)."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"Middlemarch is not an \\"easy\\" read as it requires attention to the footnotes, and is 800 pages. It is an excellent study of women's places in British society in the 19th century. It made me grateful to live in modern times, and not be subject to the control of a autocratic husband. The long sections on politics did not interest me much, but I found it necessary to follow them in order to fully understand the story.

After that happens, it is impossible to put down this wonderful book. It's an in-depth discovery of the lives of several people in Middlemarch -- small town rural England during the time of reforms being planned in the 1880s. A time not altogether too different than our own, except for the predicament of women.Dorothea is a fascinating woman, and a window into the lives of the women of those times, and -- through the various men who intersect with her, comes a picture of life as it was, the politics as they were, and the classes as they existed.The talent of this author blazes across the many pages, bringing character after character which is beautifully developed and worked in among the various happenings, all wrapped around an epic design that, time after time, take one's breath. The (female) author chose the name George Eliot with the intention she be taken seriously as a writer. Even with the passage of time and changing of styles, it is impossible not to take seriously this amazing, wonderful book and its creator.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"One of the joys of reading great works of literature, indeed of reading in general, is RE-READING, seeing all the wonderful things you missed the first time around. _Middlemarch_ is such a book, so much so that I have been astounded upon rereading it. I was assigned this book twice in college, and while I can certainly understand why this book would be studied in literature courses because of the value it contributed to the form of novel writing in general, I firmly believe this book can only be appreciated fully by someone with a little more experience under their belt than the average college co-ed. So, if you remember trudging through this large tome in the early morning hours of your college days, finding it unbearable, give it another go once you're 30 or 40 -- I think you'll be more than pleasantly surprised. I can honestly say this is one of the books that is closest to my heart now. Truly moving."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"Middlemarch is probably the best example of nineteenth century British literature. I felt the first book called &quot;Miss Brooke&quot; was long and laborious to read, however after the setting was established and the characters were thoroughly introduced, I had trouble putting the book down! I am a graduate student and I was able to read the novel in 4 nights. George Eliot shows all degrees of human nature and circumstances in this tale. Love does not always beget love and vice versa. Love does not always conquer all. This book will keep you interested from cover to cover with a vast array of characters and situations and you will swear you know some of the people involved! I highly recommend this book for anyone who loves nineteenth century literature!"},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"The most important thing to remember about Middlemarch is that marriage is a noose! Seriously, Eliot engages the problem of marriage in Victorian England, namely that marriage can be a trap and yet humans have a need for marriage-type relationships. (Can't live with 'em--can't live without 'em attitude) Eliot determines that often the reasons for entering into marriage usually determine the success or failure of it. For example Dorthea Brooke marries a man old enough to be her father in a misguided attempt to do something important with her life. Mr. Casaubon, Dorothea's husband, is a religious scholar who's in the process of writing a great religious treatise. The problem is, however, that Mr. Casaubon doesn't think he needs a woman's help (this is Victorian England, after all) and Dorothea's marriage soon becomes a living hell. Another character, the spoiled yet charming Rosamund marries the local doctor in an attempt to escape her father's house. The problem here is that the doctor doesn't quite make as much money as Rosamund's father and can't keep her in the style that she's been accustomed to. Rosamund's relationship with her husband deteriorates rapidly as her frustration with their income level drives her to torment him. However, a few successful marriages are balanced against this view of domestic torture. Mary and Fred, the two local sweethearts, court for the entire novel, marrying in the last chapter. They work out their differences before their marriage and seem to be fairly happy. After Dorothea's husband mercifully dies, she remarries a man nearer her age and they are fairly happy as well.This novel tends to be a bit melodramatic in places, but ends with an optimistic outlook overall. I recommend this book for anyone who's interested in the Victorian period, women's issues, or human relationships. This is a great book to curl up with next to a fireplace! Other books dealing with similar issues are &quot;The Mill on the Floss&quot; by George Eliot, &quot;A Vindication of the Rights of Woman&quot; by Mary Wollstonecraft, and &quot;Persuasion&quot; by Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"What to say about a book like \\"Middlemarch\\"? It is needless to say, at 800+ pages, a little heavy, and might very well try the casual reader's patience. I fancy myself a fairly quick and discerning reader - but; this took me over two weeks to read, and I found my interest waning in and out for most of the novel. It is therefor, not something I would quickly recommend to just anyone.However; I adress this to the student of Victorian literature,the student of history, and the aspiring novelist. To you, \\"Middlemarch\\" is a goldmine. The subtitle:\\"A study of provincial life\\" says it all. George Eliott touches on Religion, politics, Business dealings, and above all marriage; all set in the late 1820's early 1830's, before the Reform bill. Though it encompasses the lives of several families and individuals in the Middlemarch county, it centers around two in particular: Dorothea Brooke, the idealist woman, who traps herself in a loveless marriage; and Lydgate, an ambitious young doctor, who finds his marriage to a selfish and vain woman, the chief factor that causes the loss of his medical ambitions and his financial and personal ruin. It is the study of human nature, and emphasizes the role that chance plays in everyone's lives. It is also valuable to the aspiring novelist, to study for the characteration, and plot twists alone. And though it is a rather thick book, and at times can become a little dry by the long pages of narrative rambling, it is a great example of the intellectual depth of one of the great woman novelists of the nineteenth century."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"I've written a review on this somewhere under another edition, but I wanted to comment on the Barnes and Noble Classic Series edition. It's very nice with an introduction by someone scholarly, and footnotes that are included at the very end, but the cover has that filmy stuff over it that tends to start curling off pretty quickly.The story itself is wonderful."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"I am in awe of George Eliot. She has constructed a narrative that is uncommonly perceptive and literate about both the subtle and quirky level of individual motivation and the larger forces of society which form the arena in which human lives play themselves out. Middlemarch is a provincial English town during Victorian times and Eliot selects a broad range of characters from every level of society to illustrate her themes. Prominent among these themes are the way in which the ambitions of potentially extraordinary achievers can be constrained by a poor choice of affiliation, most notably bad marraiges. She also addresses the role of women, the way that wealthy landowners determine the quality of life for the poor, and presents insightful portraits of a number of personality types. It is often a very funny book as well, as she exposes the foibles of the pompous and self-deluded with subtle and unerring accuracy.This is not a light read. This is a long, dense novel, but I found something fascinating on nearly every page."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"I remember finding this conservative and space-efficient paperback on the shelves at Waldenbooks and deciding to give it a try since I had heard of it through a copy of Anna Karenina. The essay had compared the two, but didn't say that George Eliot acheived five times more with this book than Tolstoy did with Anna. I have never read such superb writing or been lead through such a meaningful story. Everything in this book is absolutely neccessary to Eliot's main idea. The realistic and honestly depicted characters' babbling even holds weight in her plot. This book shows so many different plots and how they parallel eachother, that it is almost mosaic (except every little piece is as splendid and brilliant as the other). Eliot teaches us through her characters and the dilemas she so craftily places them in, about reverance for life and community. If you pay attention to the narrative of this sage, you will find yourself believing &quot;no man is an island&quot;, if you already don't, and your sense of responsibility and duty will become ven more apparent to you. This is the book that remains closest to my heart; this is the author who, time after time, I have never been disappointed in. I won't give a single thing away. If you enjoy a good intellectual novel, then you won't be disappointed. I promise, you will be amazed 6 chapters through the book and astounded at the end. There aren't any notes for this book; you'll enjoy it uninterrupted. Reward yourself with this book or any other by George Eliot ( the Mill on the Floss is almost as good)."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"This is not for the faint of heart. I'll be the first to admit that Eliot is no day-in-the-park author. She's regal, she's massive, she's intense. She's the Titanic, the way it was meant to be. The upside of all this is that you enter a world of literature so engrossing and pungent, it will be hard to pick up a less involved book afterwards. Eliot is an aquired taste for some, but, oh, what a taste! I began her books with Middlemarch and it has been my ultimate favorite ever since. It even surpasses Pride and Prejudice in my estimation, no small concession.Middlemarch isn't a glamourous town, but it *is* full of strangely fascinating normal people. They're deliciously human, understandably flawed, and believably redeemed. Love, life, and death are not sugar-coated, but shown in all their respective glory and shabbiness. The characters, however minor, are honestly portrayed, making you feel like one of them. Idealistic Dorothea could have lived in any age, in any place. Lydgate is another. They are mirrored by the sad realism of the Bulstrode and Casaubon among others. All the other Middlemarchers fall in between these common extremes. With as broad a brush as Eliot paints with (covering religion, provincial politics, social mores, business, romance), there are also many (relevant) commentaries that have her wielding as fine as brush as an ivory-painter (intricacies of human nature, society, and the ironies of life). Eliot was an unabashed intellectual, but persuasive and logical, making it a pleasure to delve into her mind. Her works are diamonds in English Lit - captivating from afar as they are breathtaking up close. Read her for the fun plots, as well as the brilliant insights.The characters are true, the settings are used to perfection, and the complexity is amazing. The characters may not endear themselves to you on paper, but they become so lifelike through details that they will compel feelings through reason - reaching your heart through your brain. Not a likely arrangement, but one that Eliot pulls off uncannily.Eliot made a masterpiece of town life with Middlemarch. The same is done for pastoral life with Mill on the Floss and Adam Bede. For a shorter, sweeter story, read Silas Marner. And never lump her with Dickens, who gracelessly and grotesquely inflates life in order to make a point."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"I can do little but agree with all of the positive comments from previous posters. George Eliot puts human lives under a microscope and examines them with wisdom and compassion. The town of Middlemarch, with all of its human drama, could be any community at any time, and its people are just like our friends and neighbors. But we get to know Eliot's characters so much better than we ever get to know our friends and neighbors. These characters are some of the most fully formed in all of literature -- Dorothea Brooke, the idealistic young woman who marries the wrong man for the best of reasons; Tertius Lydgate, the young physician who sets out to change the world but finds his own weakness his biggest obstacle; Caleb Garth, the humble man who knows when and how to take a stand; Nicholas Bulstrode, the prosperous businessman whose reputation is endangered by some questionable past dealings. No situation is trivialized and no character is or decision is portrayed as one-dimensionally &quot;good&quot; or &quot;evil&quot; -- Eliot does each character justice, showing us their thought processes and letting us understand exactly why they do what they do. I entitled my review &quot;perhaps the best novel ever written,&quot; but I know of none better. I urge you to jump into the world that George Eliot creates and enjoy her intelligence, wit and wisdom."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"One of the things that strikes me again and again when I read &quot;literature&quot; of past centuries is how men and women are so much the same today as they were then.Basically, &quot;Middlemarch&quot; is a novel about making bad choices, enduring those choices (OK, that is where it departs from modernity: today, people would probably entice Dorothea to divorce Causabon), and managing to live despite tragedy and sadness.This is one of the few books I have ever read where I laughed out loud at some passages, and yet started to cry at others (particularly affecting is the one where, after saying goodby to Will for what she thinks is the last time, Dorothea takes a miniature portrait of his grandmother and cradles it in her hand).This book is utterly amazing. It is not for the drenched-in-modernity people who want a quick, direct read - there are lots of characters to follow and many digressions. It's not a quick read. Yes, parts of it do drag. But the parts that don't, speak to the heart. You can think of Middle march as life in miniature: there are heartbreaking times, amusing times, good times, bad times, times you simply have to endure. And you learn from it, too.I think a lot of negative reviews of classic novels come from people who were made to read them in school. I, too, complained about some of the books I had to read. But try them again - when you have time to savor them, or when greater maturity makes them more accessible to you. I know I would not have enjoyed Middlemarch at 16; I was too callow and had no understanding of the real pain people go through when they make the wrong decisions in life. Now, at 30, and having made some bad decisions, the book is deeply meaningful to me."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"I missed the chance to read this in college, but enjoyed it greatly now (in middle age). Eliot is so intelligent and insightful about how adults make choices with unintended consequences. Everyone considering marriage should read this book. The setting may be out of date but her understanding of the human heart is timeless."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"Having been slightly bored by \\"Silas Marner,\\" I was not expecting much gratification from this massive tome. But I had heard good things about \\"Middlemarch\\" from others, so I steeled myself and dug in. I was quite figuratively blown-away by the quality of writing.It is not just that Eliot is an excellent satirist, but that she makes penetrating psychological insights and crafts very well-developed, imminently human characters, who are sympathetic despite their faults. She also exhibits a brilliant mastery of the English language, describing both internal and external scenes in the most beautiful of terms.\\"Middlemarch\\" is not an easy read; there are multiple characters with complex relationships to one another, and the threads of their singular lives are eventually thoroughly tied up into one another. I found that keeping note cards on the family trees of the various characters was of assistance when reading. But once you have established who everyone is, the complexity of the novel is no longer a hindrance, and it may be read as lightly and quickly as any work of fiction.The plot line is interesting enough, but it is the personalities of the characters that are truly gripping. I cannot recall a single novel that has stimulated my intellect as deeply, or drawn upon my emotions as expertly, or commanded my respect as fully as \\"Middlemarch.\\" I cannot issue a higher recommendation."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"A real pleasure to recently discover this classic for the first time, \\"Middlemarch\\" is a fine example of the English style of writing from that period, a long book of almost 900 pages, with a large cast of characters and several main plot lines, novels like this are a reminder of the richness of the English language. This is a soap opera set in the fictional town of Middlemarch with descriptions of every walk of life, George Eliot's perceptions of human nature make this a timeless piece of fiction, though there is no doubt that she describes a way of life gone forever.A main theme in this novel would seem to be possessing Utopian visions and the difficulty of putting them into practice in reality. One of the main characters is Dorothea, a young woman with great social ideals, she \\"thinks too much for a woman\\" and is under constant pressure from well-meaning realtives who want her to marry safely and give up her goals of saving the world. Dr. Lydgate is someone else we come to know quite well, another individual who has lofty ideas but trouble coping with the real world because he tries to ignore it. Mr. Brooke and Bulstrode also have certain visions of themselves not shared by an informed public.Some reviewers seem to feel this book is too long, that the story could have been told in half the words, but I would not change one bit of this, the beautiful use of words helps me to escape into the world of Middlemarch when life was slower moving and people had more time for reflection."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"I had to read \\"Middlemarch\\" for a Victorian literature course, and I approached it with certain trepidation: it's a tome, for a start, and by the time I braved it, I'd heard pretty much everyone in the class muttering about how dense and difficult it was. I had that reaction, too, for about 100, or even 200 pages. But I fell in love with it slowly. You have to almost re-learn how to read when you approach a novel like Middlemarch; it was not written to cater to short, wandering attention spans. But the brilliance of this book gradually reveals itself. Eliot is subtle and serious, but she is also witty and very humane, and in \\"Middlemarch\\" she tackles so much: science, art, religion, politics, love, morality.I noticed by the end of the course that everyone who had previously been whining about this book had come to feel a certain sense of awe toward it. \\"Middlemarch\\" certainly demands a lot of time and thought to fully appreciate, but it's not difficult to understand why this is considered the great Victorian novel."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"Considered Eliot's masterpiece, Middlemarch is an extremely well-written slice of Victorian life in a fictious English town. The story is well-woven, and characters are very believable. Brilliant.However the book is lengthy and, like Eliot's other novels, the first half is slow-moving. Not for the impatient."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"This book is an epic for the common people. It sheds the tradition of typical epic characters but keeps the epic form. This is a major work, and while I would be hard pressed to find any stylitically inferior passage, I still feel that it is too long. This is what will drive away many potential readers, and that's a shame. The book is a realist character study and an ethical treatise. It's hard for me to think of a superior stylist to Eliot. The story is a collage of characters, their ambitions, loves, and disappointments. It is the story of provincial British life. I have always had a problem with artificial literary beautification of plain things, but I think Eliot makes a good case for common characters - not merely simple but kind people, but people who might have been great if not for the extraneous factors surrounding their lives and clashing with their aspirations."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"While I wouldn't place Middlemarch on a level with Jane Eryre or Tess of the Durbervilles as far as gut wrenching goes, it is well worth the effort. (and it was an effort!) I would suggest reading this as an adult when time, experience & patience will make the Victorian gems of wisdom and beauty within this novel more readily appreciated and understood. The characters are well developed and as I neared the end i could not put it down. Eliot's insights into humanity are timeless as well as convicting at times and I promise you'll have plenty of quotes to jot down in your journals for further reference & reflection.And of course the penguin hardback version is worth buying if only to adorn your bookshelf. Mine did wear a bit from over handling but it's still beautiful with its apparent use."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"Middlemarch is one of my favourite books but the experience of reading it on Kindle is marred by poor formatting. When looking at the sample on the Amazon store the bad formatting is not obvious. Why is it the kindle editions of books give no contents pages. I am uncertain whether I want to buy an edition of this book because I cannot tell if the formatting will be any more worth it in the paid for editions. If I did not know the book really well I am not sure if I would be able to follow it with the often confusing format.

Overall, I thought it excellent. The author portrays the innermost thoughts and reasonings of the characters very well. The 19th century writing style made it a little hard at first to become absorbed, and just when I was getting involved in the lives of Dorothea and Casaubon, part one ends and different characters are suddenly given center stage, with Dorothea and Casaubon seemingly left behind. This annoyed me at first, making it difficult to get into the characters of Rosamond and Lydgate. It felt like I was starting a new book. However, I slowly became absorbed again and was rewarded with the previous characters being woven back into the story. It all comes together, resulting in many times not wanting to put the book down. I'm glad I chose this as my first Kindle book and, after finishing it, I think I might want to read more from \\"George Eliot.\\""},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"Masterpiece? Greatest English novel? Well, I don't know about that -- it's very good, but it's not perfect. But it is funny, and it's a page-turner. Our heroine, Dorothea, is an intellectual stuck in a very provincial town, and she just wants someone she can have an intelligent conversation with, and whom she can help do some kind of serious work. A very marriageble but not especially bright gentleman courts her, and brings her a puppy as a present. Dorothea doesn't _mean_ to be rude, but she speaks her mind, that she doesn't approve of having pets just to pet them -- she thinks dogs are happiest when they have some serious work to do. I laughed out loud at this point, as at so many others. I know just how she feels! And I also understand the sighs that her friends sighed as they rolled their eyes. That's our Dorothea! The gentleman caller eventually marries Dorothea's sister, and they (and the puppy) live happily ever after. Dorothea lives happily ever after, too, but only after being very, very serious about things for several hundred pages. You'll love her, and you'll laugh all the way."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"I bought the Penguin Classics edition (1994 version) because of the copious notes explaining language and references likely unfamiliar to reader's of today. These notes made reading Middlemarch a little more cumbersome, since they are at the end, but the added understanding made it worth the effort. Those interested in researching George Eliot's life and her other works should consider finding a copy of the Oxford Reader's Companion to George Eliot, John Rignall ed., Oxford University Press.Middlemarch, recommended by a friend who knew that I enjoyed reading 18th and 19th century literature, was a difficult book to put down. I had just finished Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre, and prior to that all of Jane Austen's work. In comparison, Middlemarch seems to hold a middle ground between Bronte and Austin in terms of style. Where Jane Austen's text tends to be light and simple, Bronte's a bit heavy and complex, Eliot's Middlemarch is also complex but it flows like Austen's best works. Middlemarch isn't perfect - Eliot actually revised the ending because it contradicted earlier assertions. But it is definitely a great read and worthy of being on everyone's bookshelf.Whether or not her depiction of early 19th century England is accurate I don't know. What I do know is that her characters are endearing in spite, or perhaps because, of all their faults, misunderstandings, and sometimes downright childish behavior. Eliot try's not to judge the actions of her characters by occasionally halting the story line and explaining them in what seems to be a neutral \\"scientific\\" manner; and I often found those explanations insightful and worth remembering (if only my memory would cooperate). Middlemarch, for me, stands with Jane Austin's work as one of the best novels I have read in a very long time."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"Eliot really delves deeply into her characters' psyches, and this makes her writings so powerful. She presents more realism than most modern readers are used to; and, I'm personally grateful for the little appendix of notes at the end of my book.. they helped me understand the social/political climate of the day, and some of Eliot's historical references (which would otherwise be over the heads of the avg. American). Sadly, she lacks the hopefulness that comes across in Dickens' works, or in C. Bronte's Jane Eyre. Still, this is a brilliant work which deserves it's place among the greats of English literature."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"For its cutting insight into her character's minds and her ability to keep true to each of their personalities, George Eliot's Middlemarch is unmatched. She gets to the heart of the matter with such sensitivity to the myriad ways her characters come to know themselves, their restrictions and their admissions both painful and happy, that it is often breathtaking for the reader. Maybe the first novel I've read whose characters are so engaging you wish you could meet each in person-- a novel which I don't want to end. I very much recommend it."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"I have just started reading Middlemarch and have finished the first 200 pages. It is a wonderful book, and Eliot is a superb writer. Every sentence contains such depth of insight and imagery. I am reading the book for pleasure but with the insight of a lover of literature. I have found that Middlemarch has to be read at least twice: once to appreciate the story of Dorothea, Lydgate, Rosamond, etc and another to truly appreciate Eliot's poetic prose."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"I would like to refer the reader from Boston to Isaiah 3:16 &quot;Moreover the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet.&quot; Whether Eliot was racist I cannot say, although I suspect no more than any of her culture or time.

I was truly surprised and enthused when I read Middlemarch by Eliot/Evans. Her style of writing makes it easy to read all 800 pages. I can't wait to find the PBS movie to compare the book too. This is a book that I would recommend to anyone!!"},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"Middlemarch is a superior example of that overused superlative, page turner. You absolutely do not want to put it down. What will Dorothea decide? What will happen to the doctor? Will people find out the secrets of one of the town's most prominent citizens? The beauty of the book is the &quot;dark side&quot; that it shows of English country life, the side that is coyly hinted at in all the beloved Jane Austen novels. Indeed, Middlemarch is the work that best highlights the place that Eliot occupies between Austen and the pull-no-punches cynicism of Edith Wharton."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"You know how there are those movies based on books that just don't measure up to the original? This is not one of them.Middlemarch is a novel that can better be appreciated upon watching the superlative BBC production from PBS. After makinga date with my TV set for eight weeks in a row, never missing an episode, I enjoyed the series so much that I made my fatherbuy me the specific Modern Library edition of Middlemarch. It was only this edition that had the actors' pictures on the coverand they were characters I had come to know. I fear that I would not have been able to get through the gargantuan length of thisclassic if it had not been for the wonderful series; I doubt I would have been able to keep all the characters straight. Havingalready known the story and the characters, I was better able to concentrate on George Eliot's mastery of languageand atmosphere. As Virginia Woolfe noted, with Middlemarch, George Eliot was the first writer to acknowledge that characters thinkas well as feel. Dorothea is a far cry from the emotional excesses of heroines like Catherine of Wuthering Heights. Sensible,concerned, and possesing a deep heart, Dorothea is a character to which the reader can more easily relate than a histrionic consumptivelike Catherine and so many other contemporary literary heroines. Yet she is not the overiding character of the novel, and instead of astory revolving around one character, all the many characters of Middlemarch revolve around a story. A story of forgiveness, retribution,true love, career goals - in short, a story about the eternal questions and concerns of all humanity."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"This review is of the 2011 edition published by Simon & Brown. I got this edition from Amazon and was completely shocked at the atrocious editing. There are numerous typos and transpositions, so numerous and egregious that they are completely distracting and make the book unreadable. Furthermore, the chapter headings are completely mangled. Eliot began each chapter with a quotation or poem, or piece of a poem (many of which she wrote herself), and in this edition, the lines of poetry are all run together so you don't even know it's a poem! I ask you! Avoid, avoid, avoid. Wonderful novel, read it in ANY OTHER edition. Edition to avoid is:Middlemarch"},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"George Eliot (Mary Ann Evans)ranksin the top rungs of Victorian and world literature. This brilliant woman has written a flawless masterpiece in Middlemarch (1871), The novel is amicroscopic detailed examination of life in a midlands towncaught in the transition from a rural to an industrial age.The characters are memorable and all too human in their complexity. There are three major love stories:1. Dorthea who weds the cold ineffective scholar Causobon onlyto fall in love with his cousin the artistic newspaper editorWill Ladislaw. One of the great love stories told in English.2. Dr. Tertius Lydgate who weds the belle of the village Rosamund Vincy. They are poorly matched with Lydgate being a reforming doctor and Rosamund a materialistic and shallow person.3. Fred Vincy and Mary Garth. Fred is a young man who drops out of school, gambles and is reformed by his love for Mary who comes from yeoman stock.Along the way you will become involved in local politics; small town prejudices and how life was lived in England justprior to the Reform Act of 1832. Eliot knew rural life and herpen is a beautiful crayon of color as she draws with aplomb theEnglish countryside in all its seasonal glory. There is even a mystery tale concerning the supposedly pious banker Bulstrode.This is one of the greatest if not the greatest of all Englishnovels. I concur with Virginia Woolf it said it is one of the few Victorian novels written for adults.I have read the book four times and watched the excellent PBSminiseries on \\"Middlemarch.\\" Each time I have gained new insights into the \\"web of humanity\\" masterfully drawn by GeorgeEliot.This classic work deserves to be read, appreciated and savored by anyone who loves a good story, beautiful languageand psychological insight."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"It's easy to see why Middlemarch is a classic. The theme of reality not living up to one's ideals is a thread that runs through the lives of most of the major characters, and is instantly recognizable and relevant nearly a century and a half after the book was written.Idealism is most evident in Dorothea Brooke. She wants to lead a learned life of service to others, but Casaubon is not interested in teaching her much, and the great work she initially believes he is writing is an irrelevant, disorganized bunch of notes. Tertius Lydate is also an idealist whose ambition is to make contributions to the medical field. Before he marries Rosamund Vincy, he sees her as the feminine ideal, a woman who will provide unquestioning support and an emotional haven. Instead, she turns out to be a self-centered spendthrift who ennervates him. He ends up with no money or energy for his research, and must concentrate on making enough money to support his wife's extravagance. Interestingly, the characters who end up the happiest, Mary Garth and Fred Vincy, lack such lofty ideals.One of Eliot's strengths is her sympathy and compassion for her characters, despite their faults. However, she is no stylist, and I found her prose to be awkward and stilted. The reader needs to be patient with this book, because Eliot's style makes it somewhat difficult to get through."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"&quot;Middlemarch,&quot; George Eliot's magnum opus, is a work that should have had the firm hand of an editor. Coming in at 838 pages, it is really about a 450 page work. Heavily padded with the author's observations and philosophizing, and interminable detail on sometimes minor characters,it reminds me of slogging through a rain-soaked, ploughed field until the final one-third of the novel.One main plot thread is that of the fatally flawed Nicholas Bulstrode who, though drawn to Christian religious sentiment, has feet of clay that ultimately destroy his plans for fame and honor. It is the destruction of Bulstrode that provides the most interesting story line in the novel. Bulstrode has, in his nefarious past, deeply wronged Will Ladislaw who comes to the town in the form of a cousin to the man, the Reverend Edward Casaubon, who will become Dorothea's first husband. Dorothea Brooke, the other main plot thread, is a super virtuous, moderately wealthy woman of puritan values and a naive zeal for service to some great cause. unfortunately,Dorothea's zeal overcomes her good sense, in spite of considerable advice from friends, and she marries Casaubon who she sees as a man with a mission. Unfortunately, Casaubon has not the ability to carry out the mission that he has chosen but he will be resolutely supported by the virtuous Dorothea in spite of her recognition of his short-comings. Fortunately, the Reverend dies early in the story, leaving Dorothea rather impressive wealth to carry out good intentions. Unfortunately, the Reverend puts a poison pill in his will that seems at first to thwart the virtuous Dorothea's desire to take the also virtuous Will Ladislaw for her second husband. Fortunately, Dorothea's virtue has no bounds and the Reverend's poison pill will have little ultimate effect.Mingled with these threads and bulking up the novel, not always to its benefit, are a number of other threads of miscellaneous colors. There is the young physician, Dr. Lydgate, who is newly arrived and thus jealously regarded by the established physicians of the town. Lydgate is of good character but poor judgement and so is deservedly punished by becoming inextricably snarled in the destruction of Bulstrode, giving the virtuous Dorothea a chance to demonstrate her virtue by saving Lydgate from total destruction. There is the Vincy family which has produced a son, Fred, and daughter, Rosamond (who marries Lydgate in the course of the novel), of imperfect character who thus impact other persons in the story to their detriment. Again the virtuous Dorothea rides to the rescue by demonstrating to Rosamond what the true character of a wife should be. An almost entirely separate story is that of Caleb Garth and his family who represent the Victorian ideal, hard-working, pastoral people of the earth whose morality exceeds that of the wealthy (except, of course, for the virtuous Dorothea.) Caleb and his daughter, Mary, demonstrate that pastoral virtue by saving Fred Vincy from himself. There is the struggling parson, Mr Farebrother, supporting his sister, mother and aunt who resorts to penny-ante gambling to eke out his finances; the virtuous Dorothea saves him from himself. There are many other minor characters, one of which is instrumental in the downfall of Bulstrode, but the ones discussed above represent the bulk of the story lines in the novel.Eliot chose to write her novel as the omniscient observer, giving her the chance to comment on anything she chose to and this is probably the weakness of the novel and the cause of its excessive length. She gives her readers little chance to form their own judgements, carefully analyzing her characters' faults and mistakes in judgements and adding extensive philosophical commentary. Take for example her description of Mr Farebrother's reaction to another man of the cloth who has bested him in getting a position which would have greatly reduced Mr Farebrother's need for outside income:&quot;But Mr Farebrother met him with the same friendliness as before. The character of the publican and sinner is not always practically incompatible with that of the modern Pharisee, for the majority of us scarcely see more distinctly the faultiness of our own conduct than the faultiness of our own arguments or the dulness of our own jokes. But the Vicar of St Botolph's had certainly escaped the slightest tincture of the Pharisee, and by dint of admitting to himself that he was too much as other men were, he had become remarkably unlike them in this - that he could escuse others for thinking slightly of him, and could judge impartially of their conduct even when it told against him.&quot;Eliot has to some extent defeated her own moralizing in this novel. Although Dorothea is a viruous woman, in the end it is always the fact that she has wealth that enables her to carry out solutions to problems.Eliot had not the ability of her contemporary, Charles Dickens, to draw memorable characters such as Fagin and the Artful Dodger but she included a much wider social swath and intensity of emotion than that of her predecessor, Jane Austen. Jane Austen, however, gave her readers more room for their own judgements and could write with an intoxicating style - for days after reading &quot;Emma&quot; I caught myself thinking in Austen's modality and tempo. Although Harold Bloom has included Eliot in his Western Canon, I could not bring myself to give her that status on the basis of &quot;Middlemarch&quot; as he seems to do. In my opinion, a reader would spend time to better effect by reading two or three of Eliot's shorter works such as &quot;Adam Bede&quot; and &quot;Silas Marner.&quot;"},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"This is my all time favorite novel.

Luckily I was forced to read this giant in about a week or so. However, I must admit that I lost track of a few of the characters throughout the book, which is why a family tree is helpful. But I suppose it just takes a matter of getting used to something and then it becomes second nature.I felt the same way about shows like Lost and Heroes. I was a little turned off by how many characters there were. However, the more I watched the show, the easier it became for me to figure out each of the characters back stories and how they were connected. Middlemarch should be given the same chance and learning curve. It takes time. Overall, it's a good read if you are into a long book.

It's been noted that Middlemarch contains some of the finest scenes of married life written. Criticism serves to place this work with the greatest of classics. In that perspective I only felt Middlemarch short of Shakespearean omnicience and less sweeping and broad in power than some of the Russian stuff. Elliot's machine gun intellect, present in every word, sentence and page, requires intense concentration reducing a little my ability to reflect and enjoy as I read.

This one took much patience on my behalf. I don't feel that the story has any true purpose or direction until chapter 15. This novel is about many things, perhaps too many: love, marriage, debt, character, the common good, a changing society. The three main stories which articulate the author's ideas are of varying degrees of interest and some characters are 'built' in better ways than others. My particular favorites are the Garths, Lydgate and Mr. Farebrother. The main character, Dorothea, is interesting but a bit too perfect-she's compared to the Virgn Mary, so that may give you an idea of how morally superior she is. The character of Fred Vincy annoyed me so much that I felt the many pages devoted to him were almost wasteful.The novel has wonderful aspects, the best being an attention to the moral and intellectual concerns of everyday people. The pages where Lydgate's innner turmoil about his debt are desrcibed showhow little things change.What is frustrating to me about this book is the intrusive voice of the narrator; I dislike being told things in a novel that should be shown instead. Plus, there is a long-winded style to Eliot's writing that I did not find in two of her books that I truly loved: The Mill on the Floss and Silas Marner.This book will appeal to you most if you want to read about marriage and the tolls it can take on men and women, especially men and women who think. The scenes between Lydgate and Dorothea are fantastic and chapter 81 between Rosamund and Dorothea is a rare thing in fiction: an honest scene between women."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"I have been reading Dickens, Austen, Blackmore, Maugham, James and others and have enjoyed their works. To read more classics I ordered Middlemarch after seeing so many 5-star reviews. Although a majority of reviewers claimed to have sensed some profound depth in the book, the only thing I sensed was that it is a driveling tale. I forced myself to finish the book to make sure I wouldn't miss where the supposed depth was, but even with a whopping 800 + pages, I found it to be nonexistent.First of all, Eliot is too literary for my taste. She goes off on philosophical tangents and ends up speaking to the clouds instead of to her readers--more a display, in my opinion, of self-gratification with fancy words than of fine storytelling. Many people revel on her splendid philosophical allusions written in what they describe as fine, stylized prose. I don't appreciate her style at all. Her long-winded passages describing characters' thoughts through a maze of literary, historical and mythological references hijacked the storyline instead of adding to it. The result was too much baggage that gets lost on the average reader like me. If you want a gripping story written in poignant but down-to-earth language, read 'Of Human Bondage' by Maugham.Originally, Eliot had started two separate novels: one about Dorothea and the other about Lydgate. Then she heaped these two characters together with a plethora of others into one hodgepodge that ended up as the over-rated Middlemarch. The pasting together of bits from the two proposed novels is evident in Middlemarch, as the story comes out choppy, jumping from persons to places to episodes to where you wonder what business they have being bound between the covers of a single book. For example, the prologue, which talks of St. Theresa, is something she wrote for the Dorothea-based novel but kept it needlessly intact. We obviously relate Dorothea, who is portrayed as (and assumed to be at the book's beginning) the main character. After the first 100 pages or so Eliot attaches her Lydgate-based story and adds a myriad of other characters thereby shoving aside Dorothea. She ends up with such a cumbersome congregation that we are distracted from the solid storyline she was building around Dorothea. So I ask, what business does the St. Theresa part have to do with Lydgate, Rosamond, Bulstrode, etc. anyway?Eliot's characters seem fake in many respects, as I could not relate to them as people who could ever exist in our real world. One example out of many is the whiny, boneless Fred Vincy, a spoiled, spoon-feed grown-man who never ended up at the school of hard knocks. Everybody coddled him and made excuses for him; and yes, he was a nice guy, but real people wouldn't have come out totally unscathed as Fred did.The beginning of the novel held my interest, and I started to enjoy it when Eliot was describing the growing tension, despair and suffering--all the harsh realities of married life--that are building while Dorothea was on her honeymoon trip to Rome. Later, however, I became totally frustrated, as Eliot has Dorothea continually treat her dysfunctional marriage as if it were a lovely tea party. Dorothea's passivity, civility and subservience in her marriage started off as frustrating to me, but that was the character that Eliot created so I accepted it at first. After a while, though, the same monotonous tone of continuous passivity and subservience started to grate on my nerves until it finally transcended into the absurd: nobody would act like that in real life.Eliot never included any heated disputes between Dorothea and her husband. We were spoon-fed a few milquetoast disagreements between them: you know, everything was all so very prim and proper but of course, but oh so unnatural too. And also, Dorothea and her husband's atypical and stoic inter-actions and dialogue as a couple were more becoming of lifeless stick figures (think of Gumby dolls) in a silent-movie melodrama. Eliot wrote paragraphs infinitum of philosophical mishmash in lieu of writing normal and human drama depicting real behavior, real conversations, and real reactions between the couple. In other words, she leaves out all the good stuff that makes an intense novel. Lacking this, Eliot's story is neither credible nor a page-turner, differing completely from Henry James' \\"Portrait of a Lady\\" that has a similar theme but which is so brilliantly handled it creates a much more realistic and engrossing story.In the end, I just don't get it in terms of all the fuss about this book. What I do get is that Middlemarch by no means merits 'classic' status in my opinion. Adding further superlative praises about Eliot's writing sounds to me like getting onboard the bandwagon of literary snobbery, and although I am in the minority here, I will pass on getting onboard Eliot's bandwagon. I instead will seek much more enjoyable reading elsewhere; it does abound if you read the right authors, a couple of whom I have previously mentioned."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"Middlemarch is treated as a classic: it shouldn't be. While it has some amusing stock characters and portrays some of the great disappointments of life, its moralizing is overt and its plot is boring.The characterization is thorough and and frequently good.

One can see the ending a mile off, and one begins to shift in one's seat after only 200 pages.However, one hopes that the end would have some twist that would dispell the reader's suspicions of a transparent march to an inexorable ending.

Unfortunately, that is not the case. Compared to a typical free edition (Project Gutenberg, for instance) this edition has the advantage of an introduction and chapter links. However, the typography has amateurish mistakes. The font size changes from chapter to chapter (it appears than when verse is quoted, there is a tendency for the typeface to change size permanently). The text is sometimes justified, sometimes not. I have noted these irregularities both on a Kindle device and on the Kindle for PC program. The edition seems to be free errors in the text itself, and the formatting irregularities are a relatively minor distraction.Given the resources that Amazon has at its disposal, I still find it surprising that formatting of Kindle editions is generally so awkward and inconsistent."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"This is a rich reading experience -- from a time when the written word was the only word.

One woman said that her mom complained that reading it was like \\"jogging through Jello.\\" I thought that this was a very apt description because even though I really got into the story there were times when I felt overwhelmed by the many ideas and the excessive words. I even considered giving you a sample sentence (page 137) but didn't want to scare anyone off because basically it's such an interesting take on 19th-century rural life in England. I was so amused by the conversations among the simple folk--the gossip, the trivialities. But more importantly, I was so moved by some of the scenes--I cried buckets! And not just at love scenes. There is an interaction between two women which is extremely moving. I have noticed before that in Eliot's novels the characters show incredible forgiveness and compassion in some of their relationships.I had gathered from the reviews that there were no happy endings. This is not true. They weren't fairy-tale endings, but they were realistic which, to me, is better. The descriptions of the people, both their insides and outsides, are done so beautifully. I really felt as though I knew these people, and I wanted the best for them. Dorothea, I thought, was a perfect angel! Rosamond, on the other hand, seemed like a spoiled child. Lydgate and Ladislaw were both interesting characters and admirable in their own ways. I like Eliot because her characters almost always have something to recommend them--the main characters are rarely evil through and through. She shows her compassion for them in the way she describes their inner souls. She doesn't seem to completely condemn anyone. She sees the humanity in her characters and so we do too.I did feel like giving Rosamond a scolding and also the townspeople en masse are mean and you'll want to give them all a good slap, but they made me aware of the comments so many of us make behind others' backs without thinking about the harm we are causing.This book made me chuckle and cry, but it also made me yawn--hence four stars rather than five. If you have the time, try to jog (actually slog) through the Jello and then there will come a time when you know that you're in it for the duration--that you really want to know what happens to these characters and this to me is the hallmark of good writing."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"This is such a classic novel, fascinating characters, interesting story lines!

First, the book is written in a most convoluted and roundabout style, with long elaborate sentences conveying the simplest of meanings and emotions. Second, the plot and characters of the book have found themselves copied and pasted shamelessly by some many modern best-selling romance authors that the book no longer retains the striking originality and depth it had when it was first published. Third, the world that the book describes and lives in -- the provincial mindset, the unbreakable sanctity of marriage life, the honor code, the gentleman's conduct -- are no longer ironclad ways of life, and thus difficult for us to fully appreciate the emotional lives of the major characters. Then there is the length and pace of the book -- at almost 800 pages the book's plot does not start moving until two-thirds into the book, trying the patience of the reader who breathes and lives with his smartphone.George Eliot's most famous book (although I think \\"Daniel Deronda\\" to be her masterpiece) concerns itself with resolving three love stories. There is Dorothea, a young wealthy orphan who has her sights on making a significant moral and intellectual contribution to humanity and who thought she has found the perfect mate in her pursuing her idealism in a wealthy preacher twice her age and already at death's door, as everyone around her is quick to remark. There is Tertius Lydgate, a young doctor whose pride and idealism are just as burdensome as his name and as his modern medical education, but who is actually fell by his marriage to a spoilt princess determined to crush her husband's pride the way no one else could. And finally there is Fred Vincy, born into a wealthy family but who suffers from what the British nobility considers the worst affliction: laziness. The book drifts back and forth among these three characters, and it does so in a lazy and haphazard manner so that we fail to see what connects the three, and what the book's ultimate themes are. Indeed, there are many themes in this book, but none really lack the substance and integrity to stand out; inter-generational struggle (how the elders are determined to bind the young to their wishes and plans) and the hypocrisy of a provincial life (when a banker is discovered to have come to his wealth through ill-gotten means the entire town turns on him even though many in the town have benefited from the banker's wealth, and so much of the sanctimonious religious piety of Middlemarch has been in fact been bankrolled by ill-gotten wealth) must readily stand out, but even these two themes aren't strong enough to sate us with a shallow understanding of the book. What messages are we supposed to leave the book with? \\"Watch who you marry\\"? \\"It's better to be rich than to be poor\\"? \\"The young will make mistakes that they'll regret for the rest of their lives\\"?What interested me most about this book (and what probably interests most readers) are the love stories in this book, particularly Dorothea's story, and it is in her story and in her character that I found most wanting. Her character isn't fully developed, and there's a crass simplicity to her idealism. The book wants us to believe that in pursuing noble goals all of Dorothea's thoughts and actions are noble, and that's simply not credible to believe in a twenty-one year old. Dorothea's simple-minded idealism makes it difficult for us to sympathize with her, but what makes it nearly impossible is her ideal circumstances. Yes, she does marry a man twice her age, but this man also happens to be kind and generous if pseudo-intellectual and aloof -- he makes no demands of Dorothea, which she finds annoying but which also makes her comfortable. And when he departs he leaves her a fortune, making her instantly the matriarch of Middlemarch, and allowing her to conjure up the wildest schemes to spend her vast fortune. And all this while she is pursued by good noble men, and is doted on by the all the people around her. If Middlemarch had a longer time frame in which Dorothea is forced to suffer some loneliness for her bad choices then this would be a stronger, more compelling book."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"I've read so many great reviews of Middlemarch that I can't really hope to compete but I have to say something. I had watched the mini series on NetFlix a while back and decided that I had to read this book. I bought the dead tree version and couldn't quite get through it even though I knew and loved the characters from the mini series. I recently purchased this as an audiobook and can't put it down. Middlemarch is easily the best novel ever written for its complexity of characters and sheer simplicity of every day life and struggles. As has been mentioned many times, this is not a tale of high drama, but the characters and what they go through are very accessible. Even though this book was written in the language of the time which I can imagine many readers will struggle with, keep reading anyway. I liked the audio version better for that reason. Although I know how it ends, I just don't want to finish it. I want to keep all of these characters with all of their flaws with me forever. This is not Gothic fiction, and Wuthering Heights still stirs me much more on an emotional and passionate level, but if we're just talking quality in literature and in painting the human portrait this is it, no question. Although I wouldn't rank this as my all time favorite book, I have nothing but respect, admiration and a great sense of awe for the writing ability of George Eliot and the intimate stories told within the pages of this book. Anyone who is literate and lives as an adult with all of the day to day decisions and struggles should absolutely read this book. Ms. Eliot was a true literary genius, few artists of any interpretation have succeeded in doing what she did so adroitly. This book is almost like a painting-a vast lush landscape where the characters make their lives. I think the author basically captured TV almost 100 years before it was invented, this book certainly puts our modern day reality shows to shame. With that being stated, there is a voyeuristic element to this novel that I think compels many many people to read it. Same thing that drives many folks now to watch the reality shows. We're all observers in Middlemarch and you probably won't come away from this book any more intelligent nor stupid than you were at the beginning, but you will have experienced the true power of literary genius and have found yourself entertained along the extensive, winding, intersecting journey."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"Any reader can see why \`Middlemarch' is regarded as one of the greatest works of fiction in English Literature. The mere thickness of the book tells (and warns) the reader not to expect a simple, light, and cheerful view of Victorian life (not that there are many Victorian novels out there that are \`cheerful' or \`light'). And while the book turned a corner-stone for English fiction, it is by no means without faults. I was really impressed and fascinated with \`Middlemarch', but I cannot say that it cast the same spell over me as other Victorian novels like \`Wuthering Heights' or \`Jane Eyre'.First published in 1872, \`Middlemarch' takes place in the fictional town of the same name (based on Coventry, where Eliot lived as a young woman) during the late 1820's and early 1830's. It was during this period that numerous political and social changes were taking place in England, which led to the First Reform Bill: clearing society from Romanticism and paving the way for the Victorian period.There are several major characters in the novel: Dorothea Brooke, who makes a disastrous marriage to the ice-cold scholar Casaubon; his unsteady cousin, Will Ladislaw, who becomes greatly attracted to Dorothea; Lydgate, an inspiring doctor who fells in love with Rosamond, a beautiful but vain woman; her undisciplined brother Fred and his struggles with money, making it more and more difficult for him to win the heart and respect of his childhood friend, Mary Garth. These are just a few of the book's population; numerous other personages occur and interact with the main characters. As their stories become connected with each other, the political uncertainties in the background change their outlook on life, and leave them with feelings of both hope and despair. One of the major themes that they all face can be put in a question: what does the future hold in store for them and their destinies?I felt that the biggest fault in Middlemarch was its huge cast of characters: there really are just too many people in the book. Some of them say one or two lines, and then just disappear for several chapters; others are mentioned, but never make their appearance. Of course, it is important to have minor characters in any novel and play, but to have so many at such an extent as in \`Middlemarch' can simply baffle the reader. I really felt that the minor characters needed to play bigger roles in order to succeed more and confuse less.The second (and only other) flaw with the book lies with Eliot's intellect: personally I think that she was just too \`intelligent'. Her ideas for this novel are brilliant, but at the same time she tries to say just too many things at once. \`Middlemarch' is one of the most important works of Realism, and clearly the \`real life' portrayed in the book is thoroughly convincing and well executed. But at the same time, Eliot makes numerous references to other historical and literary aspects, some of which are set decades before the story's events. Most of these references are important to the novel's themes, but they are as numerous as the characters. I strongly recommend an annotated edition of the book, such as those published by Oxford and Penguin, to fully understand these references and how they fit into the context of the story.A year ago, I had seen the whole BBC adaptation of \`Middlemarch', made in 1994. It is a great and faithful adaptation. However, I regret seeing it due to the fact that most of the time I prefer reading a book first before seeing an adaptation of it. On the other hand, the series greatly helped me to understand some of the numerous characters a bit better. So it's a win-lose situation on all grounds.However, there are many great parts from start to finish. \`Middlemarch' is truly a remarkable book, written in a beautiful and compelling style. While it is a novel that you can't skim through (you'll have to read each sentence slowly and carefully), Eliot's use of language is superb, and keeps her hold on the reader, even if there are some parts that come across as dull.For most of the time, the plot moves on in a fast and thrilling pace. True, it frequently comes to a pause and gives the reader time to reflect over the events. Also, the political themes in the book are not the most exciting ones, but they play an important role, and give an interesting insight into how the views of English society changed with the Reform Bill.Despite the monstrous cast, all of the characters are masterfully crafted and drawn. Probably the most striking technique used with the characters is Eliot's psychological insight into their minds and feelings. This allows readers to love some of the people, pity the rest, and get downright infuriated by others. Eliot also makes use of this to allow her characters to develop to their full potential. It is undoubtedly one of the book's greatest strengths.\`Middlemarch' is by no means an easy read, nor is it faultless. But I do not hesitate in saying that it was one of the best books I've read this year, and at the same time it is one of the greatest and most important novels in the English language. It truly deserves to be ranked as the most ambitious novel that George Eliot ever wrote, and is a must-read for students and enthusiasts of Victorian Literature."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"I have read Middlemarch three times before using a paperback copy. (The first time I read it was for a class at the University of Chicago. I finished reading it and I was so impressed with it, I immediately started reading it again!!). However when I started reading it the 4th time my paperback edition was so full of my previous notes that I decided to buy a hardcopy edition.This edition is very good. The margins allow enough room for notes, and there is a helpful Introduction and Explanatory Notes however, they are not nearly as strong at the Oxford paperback edition with D. Carroll and F. Bonaparte doing the Introduction, etc.I have spent over 45 years reading and rereading novels (among a lot of other types of works) but after reading George Eliot's Middlemarch I think she is the greatest author who ever lived and I consider Middlemarch the best book I have ever read.Although the pictures I have seen of G.E. would not indicate the below, this is what Henry James had to say about her,&#34;She had a low forehead, a dull grey eye, a vast pendulous nose, a huge mouth full of uneven teeth and a chin and jawbone 'qui n'en finissent pas'... Now in this vast ugliness resides a most powerful beauty which, in a very few minutes, steals forth and charms the mind, so that you end, as I ended, in falling in love with her. Yes, behold me in love with this great horse-faced bluestocking&#34;. Henry James, in a letter to his father, published in Edel, Leon (ed.) Henry James: Selected Letters (1990)&#34; (I took this from the Wikipedia entry for G.E.)The below is a quote from the Introduction to the Oxford edition. &#34;She could speak with authority on history, music, art, theology, anthropology, philosophy, sociology, psychology,.....; she was an excellent mathematician and had a love of all the sciences, especially physics, geology, chemistry, and astronomy; entomology and biology....Literature was her deepest love, the literature of many countries, and having made herself proficient, by the end of her life, in eight tongues (English, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Hebrew, Latin and Greek), she knew a good deal of Western literature in its original languages.&#34;If you would like to see one aspect of her abilities in another area, Amazon has for sale her translation of David Strauss's Life of Jesus Critically Examined translated from the German. I am quite sure, having read this work, that she had also to know Greek, Hebrew, and Latin in order to do this translation. Oh- by the way. From what I can tell she did this translation when she was 25 years old!!!One last note. For those of you who are interested in philosophy she was an Editor of the Westminster Review. This publication was the first publication to awaken Europe to Arthur Schopenhauer the great philosopher. I have purchased many books by Schopenhauer on Amazon and after studying many many philosophers over decades I have found him to be the greatest.Hope this has been helpful."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"What makes one of the best books ever written even better?

It took awhile to get into it because there's a great deal of expository writing at the beginning, but stick with it and you'll be introduced to some fascinating characters in the town of Middlemarch.Dorothea Brooke is a young woman about to take a much older husband, determined to find purpose in her life by assisting him with his life's work, a book which is to a definitive guide to all the mythologies of the world. When she begins to suspect her husband's work is little more than empty piffle, how will she find her way?Mr. Lydgate is a hotshot young physician determined to do great works from the small town of Middlemarch. Thwarted by small town suspicion and politics, and increasingly saddled by debt incurred by a pretty young wife, how will he cope as his life's dream slips away?Fred Vincy is the son of a town merchant determined to see him made a gentleman. He's paid for Fred to recieve a gentleman's education at Oxford with the intention that Fred will join the Church. Fred knows the Church isn't for him, but isn't sure what else to do, nor how to tell his father his education was for naught.These are just three of a huge cast of characters, all of them fascinating in their own way as their lives intersect. The book feels more like a documentary than a novel, and you grow to feel as if the characters could be your own friends and neighbors. Highly recommended, I know this is going to be one of my favorite books."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"Yes, that is a strong statement, but I believe Middlemarch to be the best novel written in English. And English is a rich language, overflowing with worthy works from both sides of the Atlantic, India and beyond. The only novel as a close contender on my list is Jane Eyre, with its fearsome symmetry and romantic passion.George Eliot has been the bane of students everywhere who suffer reading Silas Marner in high school. But later on, you, like me, may develop a taste for the classics and this book will reward you richly.The story is about Dorothea, a young, idealist woman, born to a good family with a modest fortune of her own. She is a prime catch on the wife market--money, family name, good looks. Her parents are deceased and her friends and uncle seek to pair her up with a local baron as the ideal mate. But Dorothea, bookish, religious and dreamy, has other ideas. She chooses, instead, a superannuated cleric who finally decides to marry as he feels mortality and ill health upon him. Casaubon, the vicar of a nearby rural church is a good match except....he's old, ugly and what the heck is he doing marrying such a young beauty. But Dorothea, who's imagining a sort of superior father figure who could &quot;teach you even Hebrew, if you wished it&quot; wakes up to far less than a reality of marital bliss. And there's an added complication created by her unworthy husband that has dire consequences for the young Dorothea.The subsequent examination of marriage as a partnership in hell is written with stunning modernity. Eliot not only creates the disastrous marriage of Dorothea to Casaubon, but also pairs, as a comparison, Lydgate, a doctor and his frivolous, vain, uncaring wife. The relationship of marriage to society is never more well drawn, but the internal suffering of people trapped in loveless marriage is written with sympathy and cunning insight. Eliot herself had a live-in relationship with Henry Lewes, who could not divorce his wife. She undoubtedly wrote from personal experience. The insight into human nature, such as jealousy, disappointment, recrimination, loss of trust and a feeling of desperation are themes that anyone who has ever been in a relationship will recognize as truth. If you find classic literature hard going, watch the mini-series created based on the book. Then, knowing the general plot, you might enjoy the structure and language of the novel more."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"I have had a copy of this book on my shelf for years without reading it. It was so very thick, the print so small, the pages so thin! It looked dauntingly long and dull.But when I finally picked it up out of a sense of obligation (after all, I majored in English, and it is a highly acclaimed classic) I was amazed to find myself laughing out loud on the very first page!Dorothea, Eliot's heroine, is SO very earnest, SO idealistic and ardent! She would never be so tawdry as to fuss with her hair and dress, or wear (gasp!) jewelry in public! She is interested only in bettering the lives of the poor in their neighborhood (you could visualize her at the fore of a modern anti-war protest). But when her sister draws her into trying on their mother's old jewelry, the pure beauty of an emerald ring inspires her to decisively choose it as her own. And she stubbbornly ignores any inconsistency between that decision and her ideals.But her idealism traps her into marriage with a man who is not at all what she believes. She sees him as a paragon of learning, questing the seas of knowledge with fearless curiousity. In actuality, he turns out to be a cautious and small-minded scholar, drily obsessed with minor points of criticism on others works. Poor Dorothea strives to find ways to hold constant in her love in the face of ugly truth. And when she meets young Will Ladislaw, a man of similar idealism and energy, she fights to stay on her moral high ground. Thank goodness the dry old scholar dies! But even after death, he manages to poison the possibility of Dorothea and Will ever making a life together.Around this couple swarm their relatives and acquaintances, and others quests for their best lives. Each couple and each character is amusing and absorbing in their own way.Eliot's characters are introduced and drawn so very well that each personality is fully believable and real. But beyond that, Eliot looks at all of them, the best and the worst, from a viewpoint of loving and gentle amusement. Her pithy comments are hilarious, but never malicious. She draws the reader into her own frame of mind, and invites us to look at the variety of our fellow humans with compassion and laughter.In spite of its length, and several dizzy plunges into despair, this is a light and lively story, very readable and heartwarming."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"George Eliot, (nom de plume of Mary Ann Evans), wrote a literary masterpiece with \\"Middlemarch.\\" I was forced to read this in school at an age when term papers and grades meant more than absorbing the riches this novel contains. I recently gave it another shot, lured back into 19th century English lit. by easier reads, like Jane Austen, whose work I love, and the Brontes. But I don't want to compare apples and oranges. Let it suffice to say, I got back to \\"Middlemarch\\" 30 years later. And it was/is so worth the re-read!Ms. Eliot created, with this book, an entire community in England in the mid-1800s and called it Middlemarch. She populated this provincial town with people of every station, local squires and their families, tradespeople, the rising middle class, (Middlemarch, right?), & the poor and destitute, ruthless and honest.

It's sort of like watching Cirque du Soleil and thinking, \\"Humans can do *that*? Dang, I sure have been underestimating my potential.

Since this book was written in England in the 1800s, it's shocking how accurately the author captures the experience of today's American 20-somethings. The oppression of women is no more, thank goodness, but the general makeup of our innermost selves apparently is unchanged.Warning:The prose may feel heavy at first, since sentences are longer and more complex than what is considered \\"good writing\\" by today's standards.

When choosing to read a classic novel, it can be very difficult to decide which edition is the best one to read. If you're considering tackling Middlemarch, I'd recommend this edition for several reasons. First, the novel is packaged with a helpful introduction and a chronology of George Eliot's life. There are also endnotes to the text, but, unlike some editions, there aren't too many endnotes--usually about 1 for every couple pages. This will keep you from flipping back to the endnotes every paragraph, which can be very disruptive to a good reading experience. Second, the paperback is well-constructed and can stand up to some rough treatment. This is important for such a long novel that is likely to be part of your life for several weeks at least. This paperback can take a beating without falling apart. Finally, the volume is fairly compact without sacrificing paper quality. The pages are thin in order to keep the size manageable, but they can stand up to underlining and highlighting.

Why did I wait so long?Middlemarch is primarily the story of Dorothea Brooke - a woman who wants to make the world a better place at a time when women were not encouraged to have ideas outside of their own homes. This ardent desire leads her to make some poor choices, and some admirable ones.This book is also a story about marriage. We see how Dorothea's marriage turns out - her sister Celia's marriage (Celia is the typical woman of her day), Rosamund's (the spoiled town beauty) marriage, and the marriage prospects of Mary Garth, a poor working girl.The author helps us to get inside the minds of her characters, which helps us to decide if we like them or not, or if we've made similar choices too. Often I found myself sympathizing with a character I initially disliked, because I was helped to see their emotions.It's very much a grown up book. If I had read this in my teens I would not have gained as much from the reading. There's no \\"and they lived happily ever after\\" here - Eliot keeps the story grounded.If I had to sum up Middlemarch, I'd say Eliot gives us an inside view of the lives of women in her day. There's also quite a bit of political talk, helping us see what it must have been like to live in England while so much was starting to change.For me, this book was just about perfect. One day I'd like to re-read it because I know there are some things I missed this time around.Recommended for those who like classic literature with a lot of depth. Some have called this book \\"Jane Austen for grown-ups\\" and while I love Jane Austen very much, I think I have to agree with that."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"George Eliot's colossal novel \\"Middlemarch\\" is a literary White Pages of a rural town in pre-Victorian England, portraying several of its citizens in all the glories and disgraces (mostly disgraces) regarding their lives, marriages, and personal and professional ambitions, while using the historical and political events of the time as a backdrop. This is one of the finest examples of a character-driven novel, where the plot is customized to the characters, rather than the other way around.A major theme in this novel is marrying wrong. Dorothea Brooke, a girl with ideas of social reform -- one of her occupations is designing cottages for poor villagers -- marries the scholarly but stodgy Edward Casaubon, who is old enough to be her father, because she is attracted to his disciplined, erudite mind. However, Casaubon employs her as a sort of secretary and assistant and becomes increasingly demanding of her. Then there is the seemingly fairy-tale marriage of Tertius Lydgate, a brilliant and promising young physician, to Rosamond Vincy, spoiled daughter of the mayor of Middlemarch, a wealthy manufacturer. Rosamond's expensive tastes endanger their marriage financially and romantically. On the other hand, the marriage of Dorothea's younger sister Celia to the dapper Sir James Chettam is nothing but bubble-headed bliss because they both are too superficial to care for anything deeper than peerage and pulchritude.The novel ties its characters together with a few interrelated plot threads, the most important of which concerns Casaubon's young second cousin, Will Ladislaw. Will and Casaubon have little respect for each other, and when Casaubon suspects that Will and Dorothea are attracted to each other, he places a stipulation in his will denying Dorothea his fortune upon his death if she marries Will. Moreover, Will has been cheated out of his own fortune by Middlemarch banker Nicholas Bulstrode, who finances the hospital that employs Lydgate. Lydgate's association with the dishonest Bulstrode threatens to cause him further disgrace and ostracize him from the town.Meanwhile, Rosamond's brother Fred typifies the irresponsible young man with money problems who manages to reform himself and win the respect of the girl he loves. The irony is that Fred expected a great inheritance from a rich uncle who instead, on his deathbed, offered the money to his servant Mary Garth, who happens to be Fred's beloved. Now, Fred's only options are to join the clergy, which Mary would not approve of, or get a job -- with Mary's father.More serious and intellectual than the works of her immediate forebear Dickens, Eliot's novel seems to strike out bold new territory for British fiction of the time, especially considering the progressive mindsets of characters like Dorothea and Lydgate who act in contrast to tradition-bound grunts like Casaubon and the other town doctors. Her sophisticated prose style of intricately structured sentences and deep psychological penetration appears to have been a huge influence on Henry James. Much more than the sum of its parts, though, \\"Middlemarch\\" leaves its reader with a distinct impression of a time and place and, on reflection, the rewarding feeling of having accepted the challenge of reading it."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"All summaries of its fantastic characterizations & plots aside, reading Middlemarch also made me realize that the power of concentrated and careful observation of human behavior (and the ability to translate that onto the page) that was practiced to perfection by Eliot, and that is the essence of the novel, is a dying art.No one writes books like this anymore because no one observes this carefully anymore. Perhaps that is in part because novels like Eliot's laid the groundwork for a typology of characters that can now be referred to in shorthand. But I think it is also because we no longer find meaning in that kind of contemplation, rather we leap immediately to analyze, ironize, & distance.It is truly an astonishing piece of work and while I have other favorites, I can think of no better writing in English."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"This is a beautiful and romantic novel not to be missed by any fan of classic literature. The thick volume (795 pages) may be an instant put-off for some readers and the story does take a little while to develop, but TRUST ME, once you get past the first 50 pages, you'll be HOOKED and finding it difficult to put down the book.I love George Eliot's style of writing - beautifully and distinctively eloquent and expressive, and with such observance and skills in depicting the depths and complexities of human relations and the demands and passions of the heart. The book also explores the issues of &quot;class&quot; (e.g. in the courtship between gentleman Fred Vincy and working class Mary Garth), &quot;money&quot; (e.g. questions raised over Featherstone's will after the old miser's death), &quot;politics&quot; (on elections and the cause promoted by the 'liberal' Middlemarchers), &quot;scandals&quot; (especially concerning the dark secrets of the respected banker, Mr Bulstrode) and even &quot;murder&quot; - all portrayed brilliantly in high drama and with engrossing suspense.My favourite character is the heroine, the virtuous Dorothea Brooke whose life is made miserable by her marriage to the old, dull, selfish academician, Casaubon. Her later acquaintance with young Will Ladislaw who is Casaubon's cousin (&quot;cousin, not nephew&quot;, as the vain Casaubon always makes a point to clarify, due to the apparent age gap between them) provides Dorothea with the companionship of someone who listens to and respects her views and who brings a ray of sunshine and cheer into her otherwise lonely life. Love soon blossoms between Dorothea and Will but they're forbidden to court/marry even after Casaubon's death due to a nasty clause put in by Casaubon in his will. It was pure heartache to read of the feelings that these two have for each other but aren't able to express due to societal constraints. Will knows rather early on that he loves her; it takes Dorothea longer to realize her true feelings. I got all teary-eyed when I read the part where Dorothea, alone in her room and in a state of inescapable anguish, moans out &quot;Oh, I did love him!&quot; [And to quote]: &quot;... But she lost energy at last even for her loud-whispered cries and moans: she subsided into helpless sobs, and on the cold floor she sobbed herself to sleep&quot;.The other main characters are no less interesting and will easily capture the reader's heart and compassion. There's Dr Lydgate, an ambitious man whose marriage to the vain, beautiful but spoilt Rosamund Vincy turns out to be a most exasperating and expensive affair (you have to read the book to find out just how SO). There's also a love triangle involving Fred Vincy, Mary Garth and Farebrother (the vicar). The other smaller characters such as Bulstrode, his wife, Mr Garth (Mary's father), a blackmailer (Raffles) and others are all well-painted and believable, each with their own story to tell.Unlike some classics, this one provides a most satisfying ending because it discloses in the 'Finale' what happens later to the main characters after the &quot;main story&quot; has ended - e.g. up to what age they live to, if the (new) marriages are successful, how many children each couple has, etc.&quot;Middlemarch&quot; is a truly remarkable classic and a wonderful, wonderful read."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"My comments are related only to the electronic version/aspect of this edition of Middlemarch rather than on the classic story. While this edition is readable it's a huge disappointment. There are so many typos that the reader is easily and regularly disturbed by trying to sort out misspellings, missing periods, or mangled sentences and paragraphs. Very unprofessional of Amazon to offer books that haven't been thoroughly edited. Kindle is a wonderful device - why not make sure the books are perfect? Why should a customer expect less in an e-versions than one does in hard copy?"},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"\\"Middlemarch\\" is such a glorious work that even an audiobook reading that doesn't express all its astonishing fecundity can still be a more satisfying experience than a silent reading. And so it is with Kate Reading's interpretation. She has a pleasant voice and she reads the dialogue very well but obviously doesn't grasp what George Eliot is getting at much of the time. Every sentence has rapier-like point, most of it humorous, and Reading rarely seems to get the joke. She passes obliviously over the words which require the emphasis of a consummate joke-teller; it's like hearing a joke flatly told. You might get it but it needs work on your part.Reading also makes a hash of Eliot's frequent long sentences. She begins them breezily, seems to have them under control, but then starts to labour as the additional clauses make their appearance, and almost sputters to a halt before effortfully spurring them on to the bitter end. To be fair to her, sentences such as these are rarely to be found in any literature under a century old and the tradition of the Epic Sentence has foundered somewhere in Hemingwayville. Still, I think anyone attempting a reading of any work should know precisely what they're reading and not a mere approximation of it. However, I'll point out that Reading is not alone in this sin.Despite these misgivings, I still like this reading because it only requires a bit of extra concentration and inner modification of Reading's delivery to bring Eliot's magnificent novel to life. I can't think of a work that so unequivocally and consistently articulates its ideas: it comes closer to providing an education it itself than any other novel I can think of."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"I bought the Barnes and Noble edition of this book back in 2004. I just got around to reading it. I enjoyed it a lot. It's a rich novel with lots of still-relevant insights regarding life. But the edition! There were spelling mistakes or typos on practically every page. It's jarring to read and it began to drive me crazy towards the end. Hopefully there is a new Barnes and Noble edition of the book and they have since corrected these mistakes."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"Remember the first time you read a classic, expecting it to be hard work: dreary \\"educational\\" stories, and abstruse language? And then you read it and found out to your delight that good writing meant it was easy to read and kept your interest? Middlemarch is simply fun to read. The language is high, and for some readers perhaps \\"wordy,\\" but not the type of wordiness that has too many descriptions of things. It's thoughtful. Middlemarch is really an elevated soap opera, with completely filled out and amusing characters, angst filled situations, and lots of interesting history. If you like to read about the Victorian era, enjoy the repression they live under, and like to long for people to speak their hearts when they feel they can't, then you'll like this book. It is very long, but I always appreciate that when it's a good story, and this is definitely a good story."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"It is an English classic, of course, but it is more than one of those books you only read when you are taking a course in English Literature. This is pleasure reading!My first language is Spanish and I read this at college. It wasn't even mandatory (there was no time left) but I opened it and I couldn't put it down. It is one of my top 5 literature books.Since it is divided in short chapters, and it's a huge book, I decided to read only one or two chapters a day. It was an unforgettable experience. If you love reading, I mean really love good books, then this one is for you.Treat yourself well for a month. Read it.It's George Eliot's best work."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"An astonishing accomplishment by George Eliot. I think what I really enjoy more than anything else in &quot;Middlemarch&quot; are Eliot's piercing insights into the nature of human beings, which she intertwines with the stories of Dorothea and Lydgate. Dorothea and Lydgate are both marvelously developed characters, whose idealism traps them each in marriages which hinder their ability to accomplish what each really wants in life. The metaphor of St. Theresa and Dorothea is carried throughout the book, adding a complex subtext. Finally, although some readers complain at Eliot's sometimes didactic narration, I think Eliot's strong sense of the responsibility of educating while entertaining sets her apart from her contemporaries. And it allows her to create one of the most beautful endings ever written in literature. Like Dorothea, we are all called to do good in our lifetime in the hope that it will influence other people down the road to do the same."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"I love this book (I have read it before) and thought I would get it on Kindle since it is one of my favorites. Unfortunately the Kindle version must have been slapped quickly into digital format via optical character reader or something similar, with no quality check done on it. It is full of typos that would have been easily caught with a simple spellcheck, for example instead of the word \\"call\\" it said \\"cal:\\" There are numerous examples of this and it is very distracting."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"Virginia Woolf once said that &quot;Middlemarch&quot; was the first novel written for adults and she is correct. With the exception of Fielding's &quot;Amelia&quot; this is one of the first books to marry off its heroine before the first 150 pages and to let the audience realize the consequences of not examining the real nature of one's future mate.The book is set in the reform period and all of the main characters are intent of carrying out some measure of reform. Dorothea Brooke wants to make poverty as appealling as wealth, Dr. Lydgate wants to reform medical care to eliminate diseases with the latest methods. Dorthea's uncle Mr. Brooke wants to get elected to parliament on the &quot;reform ticket,&quot; Mr. Casaubon, who later marries Dorothea, wants to reform scholarship by producing something called &quot;The Key to the World's Mythologies.&quot;It probably will not spoil the book by revealing that none of these reforms are realized. All are wrecked by human nature and flaws in the characters themselves. The only person who succeeds is Mary Garth who manages to reform Fred Vincey who begins as a rascal, bellowing for something called a marrow bone for breakfast and then transforms into a likable figure. This I think is key to what is afoot in Middlemarch. Before society can really be reformed, human nature needs to be so regulated as to permit a more general reform of society. Some may dismiss this as a simplistic solution, but it is no more a simplistic approach than those theories that ignore human nature as they build castles in the air, just like the people of Middlemarch.I must confess that I found this book slow going at first. I think that the key to the book is that Eliot does not consider any particular character as the mouthpiece of her ideas (for a while I thought Dorothea was meant to be Eliot herself, but she is too great an artist to make this kind of mistake). No, this is Eliot's best book and rightly so. She does not cheat in the characterization which is one of the strengths of the book. This makes her work shine through nearly 150 years later."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"I really stand in awe of Ms Eliot's tremendous talent. I would not like to be classified among those modern day literary critics who indicate that a certain author's plots aren't worth much, but the books are saved by their wonderfully constructed sentences. But there is no doubt that GE is a master of the language. She is a writer of profound elegance who shows a deep understanding of human psychology. All that said I am pleased to say that she can also write a darn good story.Middlemarch is one of many Victorian novels that presents the plight of women during that period (how many other women were out there with writing talent that were stifled, I wonder). There are three plots in the novel that examine male and female relationships and the role that both sexes play during courting and marriage, and we learn how women were treated with condescension if they voiced an opinion on something. But this is not a gothic romance novel. It is a beautifully written story of the social milieu of English provincial life around 1830.There is a certain law that pertains to Victorian novels: If a character is married early in the novel, then that marriage is doomed to failure. Middlemarch follows the law scrupulously. You must be married in the book's waning pages if you want to live happily ever after. Dorothea is a wealthy young woman who marries a scholastic, elderly clergyman because she wants to gain knowledge at the feet of a master. Unfortunately he is a dried up fig with no ability to communicate wisdom. He dies but leaves Dorothea with a burdensome restriction in the will: she can not marry a man that she also loves. Dr. Lydgate marries a dim and self centered woman who sees a husband solely as a provider of a fine life style. And poor drifting Fred courts a plain, but bright commoner who will continue to reject his advances until he settles down and finds a career for himself.Now maybe that plot outline makes you yawn, but it is the way that George Eliot tells it that makes the difference. She presents a crystal clear picture of these people and their lives and society and even politics. And despite her stately language GE has an engaging, subtle humor to her writing. Mr. Crabbe, the glazier, loved joining the group for gossip, and is described as one \\"who gathered much news and then groped among it dimly.\\"My copy of Middlemarch is the Norton Critical Edition, and I highly recommend it. It contains and extra 150 pages of Ms Eliot's letters about the book; her notes laying out the story; and some interesting contemporary and current reviews and analyses of the novel. Henry James, liked it, but had some criticisms of the lead characters, which I found myself (sort of)agreeing with. It's a great supplement to a great novel."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"Middlemarch by George Eliot. Highly recommended.It seems that it's nearly impossible to talk about Middlemarch without mentioning its breadth and scope. The irony is that the entire novel takes place within the confines of this small community and within the sometimes-small minds of its various citizens.Although a vast number of characters populate Middlemarch and its environs, each who speaks has a distinctive voice, yet does not fall into being mere type only. The horse dealer sounds like a horse dealer-but one with a particular background and perspective. The setting itself represents every type of town, suburb, village, or neighborhood where you'll find the complacent, the critical, the aspiring, the intellectual, the earthy, the wealthy, the poor, and the worker in between. As with many English novels, the setting, in this case Middlemarch, becomes as much a central character as any other, whether it's Dorothea or Lydgate.The tapestry Eliot weaves is complex; one character's actions can affect the lives of others he or she may rarely meet, while the unknown behavior and works of Bulstrode in his youth decades ago eventually touch nearly all.How the characters come together is sometimes obvious, sometimes subtle. Dorothy's interest in Causabon, although a puzzle to her friends and family, is painted in broad strokes to the reader; her later interest in Will Ladislaw, grows somewhat more delicately if based in the same altruistic roots. Mary Garth and Fred Vincy have, in their way, come together in their childhoods; they are still struggling with mutually agreeable terms that will allow both to acknowledge the love and affection that are already there. Lydgate and Rosamond are both more of a puzzle and less of one-a case of two opposed personalities with opposing views, opposing goals, and opposing personalities drawn together by that most capricious of matchmakers, proximity and circumstance, to form a union that will frustrate both and satisfy neither.Against the background of these four sometimes difficult relationships (Dorothea and Causabon with its lack of love or eros, Dorothea and Will with the barriers set by Causabon's will and that of the Middlemarch society who frown on Will and Dorothea's association with him, Fred and Mary with her imposed restrictions to set him on the correct course in life before she can make a commitment to him, and Lydgate and Rosamond with their diametrical oppositions) is the long, happy marriage of Nicholas Bulstrode and his Vincy wife Harriet. Unlike the others, there are no visible barriers to their happiness, and they are happy as a couple-except for the events in Bulstrode's past that haunt him in the back of his mind and then at the front with the appearance of Raffles. The marriage survives the ensuing scandal, but the individuals-Nicholas and Harriet-become poor shadow of their former selves.It is in a town like Middlemarch that a woman like Dorothea will find it impossible to find approbation for her plans and Bulstrode will find the antagonism of those who have come to terms with their own worldly desires. It is in a town like Middlemarch that merely the raving words of a delirium tremens-afflicted Raffles can upset the respectable work of a respectable lifetime. The downfall of Bulstrode validates the town and its modernizing secular culture.Middlemarch is a novel of insight into personality, motivations, social behaviours, and history. In the end, even the happiest characters have failed at most if not all of their youthful aspirations and have become variations on the Middlemarch theme-husbands, wives, fathers, mothers, sons, daughters, day-to-day toilers rather than dreamers and achievers. Middlemarch is Everytown, where you will find an example or two of Everyone-and their dreams or lack thereof.If you intend to glean the utmost from it, begin with an annotated, critical edition; while Eliot enjoyed a high enough level of erudition to reference the current events of 1830s England along with mythology, religion, quotations, and developments in science and medicine, most of us today cannot begin to follow them without assistance. Knowledge of these references will enrich the rich text of a rich mind.Diane L. Schirf, 1 September 2002."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"This novel by Mary Ann Evans - nom de plume, George Eliot - who lived with a man out of wedlock for most of her life and who throughout her adult life was a confirmed nonbeliever - or \\"nullifidian\\" as she would say - proved a difficult one for me to spend a week rereading. I am, no doubt, overly impressionable about literature and oversensitive to the world in which I inhabit whilst in an author's grasp. But I was clinically depressed through, say, the last few hundred pages of the book, and then felt my eyes tear in tender exultation through the final thirty. Those few hundred pages are necessary, I see again now, for making this book into a true work of art rather than a soap opera or soap box speech, but the strain on the reader - or this reader - is well-nigh unbearable. What Ms. Evans does here is to build up a moralistic universe in her provincial Middlemarch filled with humbug and cant and then bring it crashing down around the sometimes tawdry cast of characters which she deftly creates.For, make no mistake, the true heroes of this book are Dorothea (\\"Gift of the gods\\" in Greek) and Ladislaw (an obviously somewhat domesticated version of the poet Shelley). They are the hub of the wheel around which all the other spokes revolve. They are, with their ardent natures and spiritual longings, the characters that linger - at times like guttering candles - in the back of the reader's mind all through this heavy weave of a novel. We are conscious all along of the \\"real\\" life going on as it does in the \\"pallid quaintness\\" of Dorothea's \\"blue-green boudoir\\":\\"Nothing had been outwardly altered there; but while the summer had gradually advanced over the western fields beyond the avenue of the elms, the bare room had gathered within it those memories of an inward life which fill the air as with a cloud of good or bad angels, the invisible yet active forms of our spiritual triumphs or spiritual falls.\\"In the meantime (i.e., through the greater part of the novel) Ms. Evans painfully yet deftly guides us through what she at one point calls \\"the irony of events.\\" So immersed do we become in the tedious banalities of the inward lives of the characters, the human misery and spiritual stolidness of these village worthies that the entire world comes to seem a very washed-out realm indeed. So that when things finally do come around for Dorothea and Ladislaw, the cosmos of Middlemarch is turned upside-down in a wondrous moment:\\"The wind was dashing against the window-panes as if an angry spirit were within it, and behind it was the great swoop of the wind: it was one of those moments in which both the busy and the idle pause with a certain awe.\\"----For Lo! The two soul-mates of the novel have - the ultimate taboo in a world ruled by class, money fears and concerns, petty gossip and scandal that can ruin one - tremblingly, kissed!The reader can have no idea how breathtaking and world-shattering this moment is from this review. It comes after hundreds of pages in which the one has been dragged through the spiritual wasteland of Middlemarch, in which men and women have had their souls and livelihoods crushed by the mundane and quotidian, described by Ms Evans with Inquisitorial detail. One has begun to wonder if love, yes love, exists at all in the world.For, again, it is exalted, Romantic love with which Ms. Evans is primarily concerned, thrown into sublime relief by her detailed, plodding description of the drab world. To lift a phrase from the last sentence in the book, it is for those who have \\"lived faithfully a hidden life\\" - much as Ms. Evans did - which the rest of the world scorns, for whom this book is written."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"My girlfriend recommended we take a class together,and had she not, I most likely would not have ever read this book. I am so glad she did! It is not the easiest read, after years of mainly reading contemporary literature, it took my brain a minute to adjust to the use of language, and also the way the Eliot writes. This is a book about ordinary people, and though nothing \\"major\\" happens ( no hurricane tears the town apart, there are no distinct villians, monsters, or massive catastrophes), the book is full of interesting events. And though it takes place in the 1830's, and the characters must obey the constraints of their time, they are still timeless, and Eliot proves herself to be a master of human behavior. I am still reading, since the class covers a book a week, and I don't want to peek ahead-I am enjoying reading this much in the same way as it was published, as a serial, anticipating each week that I get to dive forward in the story.On a separate note, I ordered 2 copies of this book, one for me and one for my friend. One of copies showed up in a pretty beat up condition. I called Amazon's customer service and they were great-apologized for the condition and gave me a courtesy refund.

However, this edition frequently sapped all the joy I experienced from George Eliot's witty dialogues and colloquies. It is full of misspellings, paragraph indentations that actually interrupt sentences, and even missing words, so that there were points when I could barely come to understand what had been Eliot's original meaning. When I was choosing which edition to buy, I read reviews of several other editions that mentioned poorly edited copies, but this one had no comment on the actual edition itself, just on the content (which I took to mean the path was safe). Nobody will dispute what a great read is Eliot's perception of the inner mind -- this is an early psychological thriller, if you are interested in people living in ambiguity and conflict and if you choose to read it that way. But I wanted to hurl this edition at the wall on numerous occasions. Considering that it was not one of the cheapest on the market, this product is shameless. Come on, Digireads, get a copy editor!

In fact, at its core is the idea of marraige for love and, in several cases, this novel examplifies the need of pushing through trials with your spouse (Lydgate, Garth, and even creepy Bulstrode). No character walks away from their marraige in this novel, and ultimately it has happy endings.What I love most about Dorothea is that she LEARNS throughout the novel. That she changes. In the beginning she is prudish, opinionated, and spurns romance to marry a man under a disillusioned ideal it will broaden her usefulness. At first I didn't care for her, I liked her sister better (who becomes somewhat silly later on). Through her trials, Dorothea softens. She is humbled. She sees the value in others and spurns viscious gossip and judgments.

She doesn't overwhelm with details and descriptions - there is rarely a wasted word - hard to imagine over this many pages. The volume has lots of helpful footnotes.

I am very, very glad I took up the challenge of reading this 890-page story, and I look forward to reading everything else George Eliot has written.Although the inhabitants of the rural English town of Middlemarch live in a time now vanished (the 1830s), their thoughts and feelings are timeless representations of human nature. I was amazed at George Eliot's mastery of observation. She has a way of describing in precise detail complicated human emotions, and the (often irrational) motivations behind them, that I've never encountered in any other writer. Psychologically, she was definitely ahead of her time in her ability to understand and analyze these emotions.It's true that the book is not without heaviness; for instance, I could have enjoyed experiencing the characters' live just as much without the political essays that Eliot weaves throughout the narrative, but these tangents were just a small annoyance and did not at all spoil my enjoyment of her rich descriptions of the many memorable individuals of Middlemarch.On finishing this book, I was most affected by Eliot's observations that the drama of daily life often is not what we perceive (and often is not as bad as we think) and that even if we feel insignificant, this does not mean that our lives have no positive effect on those around us. As she so expertly puts it, &quot;...the growing good of the world is partly dependent on un-historic acts [and is] owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life...&quot;."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"This is an excellent historical novel which has everything. George Elliot's wonderfully expressive prose, excellent character analysis, and insightful observations make this is a book a treasure to read. Her sensitive descriptions of the motivation behind each of the characters actions was incredibly insightful and convincing. I was captivated by the large variety of colorful characters. Each character was well-developed, and I saw myself and others around me in so many of their feelings and motivations that the characters seemed uncannily real, something few authors have been able to achieve.In addition to the character development, George Elliot captured the political and societal tensions and norms of the time. She showed how these tensions and opinions influenced the motivations, aspirations, and decisions of her characters. So much of &quot;who we are&quot; is shaped by the political and societal pressures of the time-period we live in, and George Ell! iot captured this better than any author I have read. Yet she didn't lose track of the fact that every person reacts to these political and societal pressures differently. The spirit and development of the characters was engrossing.This is truly a work of literature.

This is a story about three couples - Fred and Mary, Dorothea and Ladislaw and Rosamund and Lyndgate. These six people live in a town called Middlemarch - and Eliot does not build a vague fictional town here, she details every last little thing down to pages upon pages of motives behind elections, decisions made and fainting spells. Every bit of gossip is laid out and every substantial movement of a main character dissected and looked at from all angles.In short, this was the longest book I've ever read. And I'm sad to say I just did not like it all that much.I often remarked to my family as I was trudging my way through this novel that, at times, it felt as if I was sitting and watching a snail decide which direction to move in. Now, don't get me wrong - the characters were vibrant. They could have sprung off the page, full of life if Eliot (to borrow a Tolkien term here) had not the patience of an Ent. So. Much. Detail. Ugh. I cannot get over how long this book took to read.I loved the Epilogue though (and for more reasons than it just signifying the end!) and I'm proud of myself for sticking it through and for grasping the story and understanding the significance of why she wrote it the way she did. It had to be done that way - the actual \\"action\\" in the book would have been disappointing on its own without all of the build-up. But instead of feeling a triumphant release at the ending I felt more a calm sigh of relief and had a \\"thank God\\" moment (both for it being the end and for getting what I wanted at the end of the book).I would not have read this book if I hadn't been involved in the 1001 Books to Read Before you Die challenge. And honestly, I'm dreading the next George Eliot I pick up, but at least I've armed myself with some knowledge and know how to approach it now. Bits at a time with plenty of action-filled books in between."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"This is an extraordinary novel and I like to refer to many passages over and over again. First, I love the texture of the novel. The way George Eliot describes her characters is bold and delicate at the same time. I like the subject matter immensely as I recall the earliest days of the Women's Liberation era. We called it, Womens' Lib. for short, that is, those of us who supported the cause of equality. With Middlemarch, Eliot gives us a view of love and marriage we moderns are happy to call social history. Written in the nineteenth century, we are introduced to women whose pervasive disadvantage in life was to be brainwashed that they were inferior to men. They were anything but inferior and Eliot captures the mentality of her women with compassion and artistry. She is descriptive without being overly critical. Today we refer to these martyred women with clinical terms; masochistic, depressed, borderline. The idea here is that seeing and accepting a one down position suggests that one's ego and personality are regressed. These may or may not be accurate diagnosis but its not about the label anyway. Its about the humanity Eliot is in touch with. Middlemarch truly is about the metaphysics of morals (Iris Murdoch). This particular version does not provide enough background information or insights into the life and times of Eliot. Since I care about those times from a social and literary standpoint, I plan to order an expanded version on Amazon. What were those factors that influenced Eliot's sensibility and unique style of writing? She was way ahead of her time. I want to know, how come?"},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"I've been buying Norton Critical Editions for years, I guess because I got used to them in college, but this will probably be the last one.The paper is superthin and has too much show-through, making it a strain to read the very small, cramped, long-lined type. The text had a surprising number of typos--not historical misspellings left in because they were in Eliot's original version, but outright stupid mistakes that the proofreader should have caught. The cover stock is soft and flimsy and dogeared instantly; the jacket is ugly.I would have enjoyed reading this excellent book a lot more if the physical object itself had been less disappointing. Treat yourself to a nicer edition (which will probably cost a lot less, anyway), and borrow the library's copy if you want to read the critical articles."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"A vast cast of characters in an English town and its surrounding countryside cope with the challenges of love and marriage, as well as politics, propriety, and money.

The novel itself I would rate a 5-star, and in my humble opinion, the only novel in existence that could be equally compared to Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre. The only slight downside to this MP3 edition is that Nadia May's voice is a bit crackly; well, that's to be expected since she's an old woman.

But why? The dialog and narrative direction are remarkably similar to that of Jane Austin books and neither is especially relevant from anything but a historical perspective. I suspect that apart from those values there are the wonderfully insightful lines such as these:\\"Souls have complexions too: what will suit one will not suit another.\\"\\"A man's mind - what there is of it - has always the advantage of being masculine, - as the smallest birch-tree is of a higher kind than the most soaring palm, - and even his ignorance is of a sounder quality.\\"\\"...when a woman is not contradicted, she has no motive for obstinacy in her absurdities.\\"\\"Pride helps us; and pride is not a bad thing when it only urges us to hide our own hurts - not to hurt others.\\"\\"...the mistakes that we male and female mortals make when we have our own way might fairly raise some wonder that we are so fond of it.\\"\\"The difficult task of knowing another soul is not for young gentlemen whose consciousness is chiefly made up of their own wishes.\\"\\"But Aquinas, now - he was a little too subtle, wasn't he? Does anybody read Aquinas?\\"\\"...it is seldom a medical man has true religious views, - there is too much pride of intellect.\\""},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"Dorothea Brooke is young, beautiful and idealistic. She is also unfashionable, bookish and, much to her younger sister's annoyance, pious and opinionated. Miss Brooke is considered a great catch in the provincial town of Middlemarch. She and her younger sister Celia are orphans, under their uncle's care, and the oldest has a sensible dowry in her favor. She has her choice of suitors, including Sir James Chettam, whom everyone approves of. But it is Mr. Casaubon, a local cleric, who catches Dorothea's eye -- much to Celia's confusion. After all, Mr. Casaubon is old and hideous, not to mention boring! Alas, Miss Brooke, with her romantic impulses, marries her chosen one. She later realizes the error of her ways, of course, and when her husband dies, she later remarries. Another mistake. Mr. Lydgate, a jaded doctor, proves to be worse than the predecessor. And so, with a number of interesting (some even unlikable) characters, and subplots centered on relationships, politics, academia, religion and small town intrigue, Middlemarch is a beautiful and readable book, one of the finest in the English language.George Eliot has once again wowed me. Daniel Deronda was a favorite of mine, but Middlemarch has replaced it in my estimations. There is so much to find here, so many potential book discussions, that I wouldn't be able to talk about it all in one single paragraph. One of those things is, of course, centered on the parallels between Dorothea Brooke and George Elliot herself. Many believe that this character is based on the author. I am sure that real-life experiences had inspired Eliot to write this book. Dorothea also reminds me a great deal of Gwendolen from Daniel Deronda. She, too, is somewhat impulsive and unthinking. Of course, Dorothea is not quite as spoiled or as irritating as Gwendolen. Still, the similarities are there. Anyway, small town intrigue plays a major role here as well, and we get to know the characters as though you were from Middlemarch and they were your neighbors. Another thing that stands out in this book is the psychological aspect of the relationships between the characters, not only with those who are married, but also with those who long for someone/something unobtainable and the heartaches that come with it. Eliot did some deep character study for this novel, and modern-day readers might relate to this book. First published in 1871, but set in 1829 and onward, Middlemarch is one of the biggest and most moving classics. This is the first time I read it, and it definitely won't be the last."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"As young people grew up in England in the 1800s, there was much excitement and interest in their prospects for marriage. In this story, there are several young people on the brink of joining the married population of the town.Dorothea, beautiful and religiously devout, with some money of her own and no parents, is considered quite a catch, and is pursued by the nearby baronet landowner. She feels her life's purpose, though, is to marry the much older religious scholar Casaubon, and dreams that she will help him with his work and gain a deeper understanding of the world.Rosamond, a gorgeous girl accomplished in music and fine manners, has rejected all of the eligible young men in town. She would like a life more glamorous. When a new doctor comes to town, she makes her decision that this will be the husband for her.Fred, a loafer and gambler, would like to settle down with his childhood friend, the dependable Mary. His prospects for independence seem to keep slipping away from him, though, along with the possibility of his winning Mary.I enjoyed reading these varied accounts of love, desire, and marriage, and thought the treatment of the marriages was realistic and well written. Dorothea's marriage was especially painful, as was the continued miscommunication in Rosamond's marriage. Both women came to the difficult realization that what they had imagined and what marriage was actually like were two very different things.I really liked the supplementary characters, too, especially Farebrother, who continues to be honest and true to himself even in the most difficult circumstances. Bulstrode is also a fascinating side character, with a compelling backstory and an interesting role to play in ruining lives in this story.There were enough intertwined plotlines in this story to keep me fascinated with Middlemarch right up until the end."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"This is a wonderfully sophisticated, intelligent book with sharp commentary on multiple social issues of her time.(and ours in certain aspects) All of the characters are wonderfully imperfect, restrained and original and are caught in the intriguing webs of dilemmas but their behviors are very coherent with their characters and subcultures. This author truly deserves our utmost respect."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"George Eliot (pseudonym for Mary Ann Evans) penned a masterpiece when she wrote Middlemarch. This mid-19th century tale of the lives and loves of a variety of British townspeople is skillfully and intricately woven. Perhaps its most compelling character is Dorothea, who is intense in her religious duty and in her deep emotional sensibility; two characteristics that interplay with turmoil as she faces marriage and remarriage. Her first husband, Mr. Casaubon, is an ancient and crusty scholar, who attempts to win her promise of eternal devotion even after his death. Both her marriage and widowhood are complicated by her deep connection to her husband's cousin, the irresistible Mr. Ladislaw, whom she eventually marries at the expense of her late husband's fortune.Rosamond Vincy is a much shallower woman, who, in spite of her outward loveliness, has a soul that is priggish and bent on absolute self-service. She effectively ruins her husband, Dr. Lydgate, both financially and relationally. Mary Garth is perhaps the most admirable woman in the book; she is sensible, steadfast, and self-sacrificing. She will not allow herself to be swayed by romantic whimsy; yet she does retain a deep devotion to her first and only true love, Fred Vincy - an irresponsible but well-meaning young man who eventually, through Mary's love, is able to make something of himself.Numerous other characters people the fascinating landscape of Middlemarch - among them Mr. Bulstrode, a pious but tortured soul, whose transgressions and hypocrisy lead him to a wretched end; Mr. Farebrother, a kindly and faithful rector who helps everyone he can, even when it means giving up his own chance for happiness; Sir James Chettam, Dorothea's suitor and then her sister Celia's husband, and the strongest opponent to both of Dorothea's marriages; Celia herself, who plays a significant role in the early chapters but then fades to not much more than a foil to Dorothea; and Mr. Featherstone, the cantankerous old bachelor who holds sway over his entire extended family by keeping them guessing as to the contents of his will - a will which eventually affects many other aspects of the story as well.How Mary Ann Evans was able to create such a fascinating, intriguing, and moving story, I can only begin to guess. In spite of its dry-at-times (yet undeniably intelligent) political wrangling and references that are now unfamiliar to most readers, the book is filled with literary excellence, a masterful plotline, and vivid characterization. And moreover, it is enlivened, Austen-like, with pungent and poignant little insights into humanity. What is said of Dorothea at the end of the book can be said of the general events of the story itself - \\"Certainly those determining acts of her life were not ideally beautiful... But the effect of her being on those around her was incalculably diffusive: for the growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts.\\"Middlemarch is not an epic; it is not the most world-renowned novel ever written. It is a little religiously sardonic; some have called it humanistic. Yet in its faithful depiction of a set of very real characters and the choices and chances that defined their lives, it can contribute a little something to our understanding of ourselves and of the world. In that way, it is indeed not ideally beautiful; but without a doubt, it can be incalculably diffusive."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"I read this as part of my studies but it is a beautifully set and written piece by Eliot. It is an 800 odd page book but is one that musn't be rushed, it is a book that must be savoured and lingered over as it truly is a work of art in its own right. Even if you are not a fan of literary works, this book is a must because Eliot is a genius of her age and many of her ponderings are things that even we as people of the 21st century can find relevant. I can only say read it because this book is worth the many hours of toiling, even worth the time bearing the ghastly Casaubon."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"This book is better than Pride and Prejudice, Emma, Madame Bovary or even Anna Karennia.

One, it is too long. Two, the author has a tendency to go off on philosophical tangents. Three, the author will sometimes spend several paragraphs on the inner workings of the mind of a very minor character who is hardly pertinent to the story. These flaws aside, I will say that I enjoyed Middlemarch very much. It is easy to get caught up in the lives of Dorthea, Will, Fred, Mary, Dr.Lydgate and Rosamond and many others. George Eliot wrote wonderful dialogue in this book--the conversations between characters are very interesting. I thought Dr. Lydgate was the most compelling person in the book. He had such high hopes and was a good and honorable man. Yet, he let himself be ensnared in a silly marriage and here the author is very insightful in portraying Dr.Lydgates trapped, disappointed existence with Rosamond. What he wants in a wife and marriage and what she wants in a husband and marriage are miles apart and so, in the end, they resign themselves to one another. I also liked the character of Mary. She's a strong woman who knows what she wants. Although Dorthea can be irritating at times, with her insistence that everyone see things the way she does, she is good and goodness is appealing in a central character. Her relationship with Will Ladislaw is portrayed well. Their love for one another was truly believable. While reading Middlemarch, there were a few times in which I felt as if I were slogging through, but there were many more times when I didn't want to put it down. So, all in all, a good read and worth the effort."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"The version of MIDDLEMARCH I read was the Modern Library edition with an introduction by A.S. Byatt. Ms. Byatt mentions that Eliot was the great English novelist of \\"ideas\\", and as such was the progenitor of Proust and Mann. Reading MIDDLEMARCH, I can understand her point. As far as Victorian novelists go, George Eliot was Dickens with a finer sense of wit, and a subtler intelligence.MIDDLEMARCH centers on Dorothea Brooke, a young woman with fervent and noble ideas and ideals, and a hunger for intellectual enrichment. Unfortunately, she lives in a time and place which is not conducive to the attainment of her aspirations, and winds up in an unfulfilling marriage to Casaubon, a sickly cleric much older than herself, a pedantic scholar of theology and antiquity, who wanted an obedient secretary for his life's work as well as a dedicated and subservient wife, more than (as she had hoped) a life partner on the road to discovery. While married to him, she meets his cousin Wil Ladislaw, a young man of keen intellect and a passion for art, but with a dubious past and unsettled future.Another key character is Tertius Lydgate, a young doctor who comes to the provincial town of Middlemarch to do research, make great discoveries for the benefit of mankind, run a hospital and practice that will utilize his knowledge for good more than for personal financial gain. He falls in love with, and marries the mayor's daughter Rosamund Vincy, a very pretty but shallow woman. Related to the Vincys through marriage is Peter Featherstone, a miserly old landowner in failing health whose demise might benefit Rosamund's brother, and Nicholas Bulstrode, a wealthy banker (with an overly pious attitude) and influential member of the town council, who has many important enemies in Middlemarch, as well as an awful secret to hide.MIDDLEMARCH is a novel about relationships and about human aspirations and how society (in this case provincial 18th century English society), conspires to thwart those aspirations. Unlike Dickens, who likes to paint in broad strokes and vivid colors, Eliot is much subtler in her craft. Her characters have complex tones to their personalities. MIDDLEMARCH is a finely wrought study of these characters and of the times that nurtured them, influenced them, and ultimately affected their fortunes.George Eliot is a keen observer of her environment, and beyond the people themselves, of the religious, social, and political factors which complicate interpersonal relationships. All this done with a wit and wisdom as well as a sense of understanding and compassion that exude from every page."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"Rarely have I enjoyed a classic with more surprise than Middlemarch. It looks to be an endless and boring morality tale from the plot summary, but reads like a work of high psychological art.The only other writer who has taken me so convincingly inside the thoughts of so many characters is Shakespeare. A strong compliment, but Eliot shows that she had the goods and somehow weaves an epic and beguilingly entertaining tale out of a quite depressing subject and period.I recall not wanting this book to end; for an 800-pager, that's strong praise indeed.They don't write 'em like this anymore!I love this Penguin edition; they've been doing it right for so long that their versions of the classics have all the right, simple touches.Truly great writing makes you feel ennobled for having read it; Middlemarch is most decidedly one of those books."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"A confession: I'm a bit cynical about classics, and have no particular fondness for 19th century British lit. I was genuinely surprised at how much I loved Middlemarch. The first time I read it, I plowed through it in about 48 hours (my professional editor of an aunt made the mistake of telling me I couldn't do it) - and, actually, while that may sound like a terrible idea, this is a book that would be easy to start and stop and start and stop and give up on because you've forgotten everything. I found myself truly immersed in these character's lives, rooting for them and groaning at them and feeling like I really know them - and you do, because George Eliot was truly a master. While Jane Austen shows human quirks through... less flattering, often irritating means (I confess that I usually find myself driven away by my desire to punch her characters), Eliot observes the characters honestly (\\"study\\" is indeed the right description) but in a way that makes you love them more, not less. And, of course, Eliot's writing is nearly flawless, with countless descriptions and moments that I had to go back and reread out of sheer awe and that History Boys feeling of a hand reaching out and holding yours.You can read Middlemarch without a care about English literature or history (though the latter will help), you can read it if you hate Eliot's contemporaries and have never read a 500+ page book in your life, you can read it if you're a teenager or an adult, optimistic or jaded. It really is one of the best things I've ever read, and I'd recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"This novel doesn't need my praise. But this edition needs censure. I have found over fifty typos and legitimate mistakes, the kind of thing you almost never see except in translations. \\"Unconquerable\\" is rendered \\"conquerable,\\" \\"in\\" becomes \\"is\\" (so you get things like \\"All force is twain is one\\"). You can't read more than a few pages without being distracted.It's embarrassing that this edition slipped by even a single editor."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"I first read this book in a college course about self-deception as a theme in literature. This was by far my favorite of the things we read (we read such other things as Vanity Fair, The Ring and the Book).This is really a long book about ordinary circumstances in a 19th century rural area in England. So why is a book such as this one considered such a classic even though not many particularly grand events happen?The book is the study of the ordinary in many ways. You end up seeing how different people live and deal with different situations and what kinds of people they are. At the same time that the reader comes to judgments about the people in the book, George Eliot manages to portray most of her characters sympathetically. Even the worst people in the book are rounded out in some ways and Eliot tries to imbue a sense of humanity. It portrays an &quot;adult&quot; view of the world instead of the simplistic view of the child. In fact, Dorothea makes a journey during the book from a child with a romanticized view to an adult with a more rich understanding through life experience and wisdom.If you're looking for a book about exciting events, with high drama, with a fast pace, don't bother picking this book up since you'll probably dislike it. This is a book written by a woman and expressing some criticisms of a woman's place in the world of her time. It is also a book that explores a more ordinary setting and viewpoint than perhaps most male authors of the time would write in such depth about. She brings a different experience than most male or female authors of the 19th century. Male authors focused on grander events (their characters often fighting to get somewhere in life) while many female authors showed a romanticized view of life and love. Look at the romances of Jane Austin in which a good marriage seems to be the ultimate goal, or the stormy loves of Emily Bronte in which some strange control/love dynamic becomes magnified to almost heroic proportions. The author is showing something unique, more restrainted, less extreme, more &quot;middle&quot; or ordinary. She manages to pull off a more balanced or &quot;middle&quot; view, also. I noticed some other readers mentioned that it was slow, that they thought events were predictable, or other similar criticisms. These criticisms are valid as far as they go--but they miss the point since these elements aren't really the center of this book.In fact, Middlemarch is really about a somewhat mundane existance that is inhabited by many people in the real world. We aren't immune to a mundane existance today: work; TV; having enough money to get by; domestic squabbles; eating; relating to other people; perhaps dreaming of something grand but not accomplishing it. There are many events of a mostly ordinary nature that gradually lead one way or another in the lives of people (both ourselves and others around us).Really this book is about gradual changes, about good acts and bad acts. It's about coming to some state of acceptance and a kind of enlightenment in life. It's about making the unexceptional life one of meaning even when circumstances prevent many large or great things. It's about a hard-to-define quality called &quot;goodness&quot; even absent huge acts or events.In any case, give this book a read if you like 19th century English literature since it's one of the greats of the period. It's also one of my favorites since I feel as though the author is treating the reader as an adult, without pulling punches, while explaining something about the life that most actual people experience."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"There are several wonderful, astute customer comments below so I will just add one thing. In addition to being an astonishingly well-crafted portrait of society, of marriage, of individual dreams and disappointments, I believe that Eliot wrote Middlemarch as a mirror for the reader to examine his or her own life--somewhere in this vast novel, if we are honest, we can all find someone like ourselves--and to realize that each choice we make, each of our relationships, provides us with the opportunity to affect the lives of those around us in either positive or negative ways. So often readers hold books at arms' length; it is easy to pass judgment on others, whether on characters in a book, or on our neighbors. Few books combine brilliant story-telling with profound moral value. Middlemarch is one such book. Do not hesitate to read it!"},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"It's daunting to dare to attempt a review of one of the world's great classics, but just a few words from an admirer. Middlemarch is the engrossing story of an intellectual woman's marriage to a straight-laced, traditional blue-nose of an English cleric. Poor Dorothea. Eliot captures her mind and feelings, her confusion, her drive to be true to herself, and her dilemma about how to do so, with sensitivity and clarity. Poor Casubon, who hasn't a clue what to do with this headstrong woman. Middlemarch also provides deep insight into small-town English society at mid 19th century. This is not easy reading, but neither is it overwhelming. This is a jewel of a novel that should be savored, worth every minute of the time it takes to appreciate in all its fullness. Definitely a stop and smell the roses sort of experience."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"The author is a mindreader. The book is readable and funny and the descriptions and dialogue and ideas are great. It has all kinds of stories in it, and many different people."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"Most people consider Dickens the greatest English novelist or the greatest Victorian novelist at the very least. While I admire Dickens' abilities, none of his novels that I've read comes close to MIDDLEMARCH in terms of accessibility, wisdom, character development or coherant plotting.This is not to argue that MIDDLEMARCH is a perfect work of literary art, or at least not in the eyes of today's readers. Many a modern reader will be put off by its length, the challenging vocabulary and complex sentences, Eliot's frequent allusions to political, religious, literary, artistic and philosophical esoterica, her characters' hyperbolic fear of \\"scandals\\" (laughable by today's standards), their views on the place of women in society, and Eliot's fussy Victorian \\"not\\" phrases that overflow throughout. (A random turn of the pages yields the following examples: \\"One fine morning a young man whose hair was not immoderately long ....\\" Same paragraph: \\"He was sufficiently absorbed not to notice ....\\" Next paragraph: \\"... a breathing blooming girl whose form, not shamed by ....\\") These begin to NOT thrill the reader before too long.But my litany of minor criticisms aside (and they are minor), Eliot's masterwork certainly challenges GREAT EXPECTATIONS, BLEAK HOUSE and DAVID COPPERFIELD for sheer reading pleasure, and far exceeds Dickens' novels in seriousness of topic and tone. As Virginia Woolf famously observed, MIDDLEMARCH was written for grownups.The one area in which Eliot clearly cannot challenge Dickens is humor. Dickens was a gifted humorist and created many a character simply to make his readers laugh, whereas Eliot appears to have been mostly uninterested in such trivial pursuits. Perhaps serious Victorian grownups weren't supposed to laugh?But fear not, if you give it a chance, you too will be swept up into Eliot's MIDDLEMARCH world, and you will find yourself caring a great deal about the fate of Dorothea Brooke, Tertius Lydgate, Will Ladislaw, Mary Garth, and the rest of her pantheon of characters, all of whom, far more than any of Dickens' creations, seem of flesh and blood rather than caricatures on a page.So, to answer the title question: is MIDDLEMARCH the best Victorian novel? Hard to say, but it gives GREAT EXPECTATIONS an excellent run for the money.High on my lengthy soon-to-read list: Eliot's DANIEL DERONDA, THE MILL ON THE FLOSS and ADAM BEDE."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"I was extremely hesitant about reviewing George Eliot'sMiddlemarch, as it's been ten years or so since I've read it, but inthe end I couldn't resist adding my comments to those of others. Quite simply, it is the greatest novel yet written by an English author: Middlemarch is the fullest realisation of George Eliot's ideas on social philosophy combined with her utterly convincing characterisation and remarkable moral insight.The novel's 'heroine' is Dorothea Brooke, a young woman of excellent virtue who is passionately idealistic about the good that can be achieved in life. The provincial setting of Middlemarch is the environment in which Dorothea's struggle to fulfil her ideals takes place, and the novel's central theme is how the petty politics of provincial 19th century England are largely accountable for her failure. In parallel with Dorothea's story is the story of Lydgate, an intelligent and ambitious doctor who also runs up against the obstructive forces of provincial life and finds them severely restrictive of his goals.Eliot is supremely compassionate, yet never blind to the faults of her characters. Dorothea's ideas of social reform are naive, while her high opinion of Casaubon's work proves to be a major mistake. But Eliot is never cynical when the motives of her characters are pure, and does not censure them for failure. What she is critical of is the narrow minded self-seeking attitude which forces Dorothea and Lydgate to come to terms with the fact that often good does not win out over circumstance. The subtext to this is the fact that the high ideals and sense of responsibility intrinsic in both Dorothea and Lydgate means that there is no question of them ever finding love together. In essence, Middlemarch is simply about life and how things don't always work out, despite our best intentions, but are often the product of negative forces. In other novels Eliot's didacticism can sometimes jar, but it is impossible to ignore the depth of her wisdom in Middlemarch.Middlemarch is the best novel of our greatest novelist - of the major Victorian writers only Tolstoy can really compare with her - and I cannot recommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"Middlemarch is an enduring classic and I will always love it. I know the book is long, but it's one of those books that you will be proud to display on your bookshelf.

I have read the book before without editor's notes and having those explanatory notes really name a big difference. Also, this particular edition was really affordable."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"Virginia Woolf called Middlemarch &quot;one of the few English novels written for grown-up peole&quot;, and I could not agree with her more. In contrast to her male contemporaries such as Dickens or Thackeray with their sentimentality and their clean stories, Eliot comes as close to facing the &quot;boredom, the horror and the glory&quot; as a C19 novelist can.Middlemarch is essentially about how lives can go wrong. It starts out with idealistic Dorothea Brooke wanting to reform the world and young Tertius Lydgate being about to rock the medical world with striking new discoveries. Eliot shows what life does to those two. Or better say, she points out how it is essentially each person himself or herself who is responisble for what happens. &quot;Time will say nothing but I told you so.&quot;No reader can fail to be touched by the wake-up call of this book: We must face what we are about to to with our lives and not take important decisions lightly."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"I began reading Middlemarch to hate it. Although I had enjoyed other period dramas such as Jane Eyre (despite the often ridiculous plot), I couldn't help but feel that any book that was dragged out to over 900 pages was long-winded at best. I am pleased to say that I proved myself wrong, after I had a startling revelation about chapter 10 that I had actually enjoyed the book thus far. The charcters, whilst not all particularly likeable, are no doubt believable &amp;, in some cases, such that we can sympathise &amp; even relate to them. I should think that any reader would judge Dorothea's fascination with Casaubon to be misguided, but George Eliot herself asks us to be sympathetic, as lots of people, even in this day &amp; age, make the same mistakes.I have heard it said that Middlemarch is boring. Far from it. In fact, Middlemarch relates to modern society much in the same way that the Chrisitan principles of the Bible can still be practised. For example, the book says a lot about the nature of marriage &amp; love, as well as politics &amp; even such personal issues as integrity &amp; honour. You simply have to read the book with an open mind.For me, the book was mainly about Dorothea Brooke &amp; Dr Tertius Lydgate, as we follow both characters from courtship, into marriage, and from there, unhappiness. Both marry for the wrong reasons - Dorothea to be some sort of secretary to the father-figure she lacked in her upbringing, and Lydgate because he sees Rosamond as an ornament that looks good with him. In both cases, even if we do not agree with the descisions of the charcters, we can at least take an interest in their lives, as well as sympathise with them, identify with them, and such forth.Whilst I would not recommend Middlemarch to just anyone it is definately a good book, and well worth a read for more than the fact that it is one of the great recognised literary works."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"I realize I'm in the minority, but I can't agree that this is the best, greatest, most wonderful (etc.) novel ever written. It's well-crafted, to say the least, but is it really enjoyable? At over 700 pages, and much of that social commentary, it can take quite a lot of dedication to get through.There's nothing wrong with social commentary in a novel; we could do with more of it. The problem is, it quickly becomes dated. There are entire chapters of &quot;Middlemarch&quot; devoted to discussions of 19th century politics -- which you do need a foundation of knowledge to appreciate. There are other chapters regarding the machinations in selecting a pastor for the new hospital, long rambles about the treatment methods of city and country doctors, and so on. As part of a study of English history, with a knowledgeable instructor to provide background information, this might be interesting... but to the casual reader it's dry, dry, dry.Aside from that, George Eliot goes to great lengths to explain events from everyone's point of view. Hardly a thing goes by without the reader knowing what everyone thinks about it, from the main characters to the people in the local pub. It's fascinating that she was able to flesh out not only her main characters but also the minor characters with whom they come into contact. It can drag on a bit, though.Finally, the main characters themselves: I won't be the first to note that &quot;hearing&quot; everyone extol Dorothea's overabundance of virtue is a chore, but the other characters do have their flaws; they are all too human, and very interesting, as are the relationships between them. The chapters where people interacted with each other and the story progressed were fantastic, but it still took weeks for me to finally put the book down.It's definitely worth reading if you like this type of historical fiction, but I wouldn't think less of anyone who found it not to their taste."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"I jumped into Middlemarch and it became my meaning in life until I closed the book on the final page. Brilliant character development, stunning details (notice the little dog), amusing scenes, and a certain amount of suspense. Considering all that goes on and could go on, the ending is more of a fizzle than a bang, but overall the novel is very satisfying. I won't go on because there are so many reviews here.I read this book along with a friend, and we emailed our impressions and what we thought might happen. If you find the book a bit \\"intense\\" it can be fun to share it with another person and each of you will get insights. Note: Anything by George Eliot is fabulous and everyone should read at least a few of her novels. Middlemarch is often said to be the \\"best\\" perhaps because of its great detail. While it's wonderful I don't agree. I would give that place to Adam Bede or The Mill on the Floss."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"Everyone should read this book before they get married. George Eliot is a master at rendering human character. She is a true sympathizer with the human condition, and merciless at the same time. Beautiful."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"This book is wonderful from start to finish. Eliot deserves rank with the great classic writers. She has created fully realized characters about whom one comes to care. Her writing is pure 19th century--long descriptions and careful, insightful observations. I realize in today's world that we want things presented with &quot;more matter and less art&quot; but to find the art of Eliot, it is well worth wading through the 800-plus pages. This ranks up there with the best books I have ever read."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"There are numerous reasons why you should not read George Eliot's epic novel of 19th century life in England, Middlemarch. First of all the book is quite long--700 plus pages depending on the edition. More significantly, the novel largely deals with the romantic, social, cultural and political life of a small English country town during the three years 1829 to 1832, with particular reference to the efforts to pass a Reform Bill. This subject is not likely to be everyone's cup of tea. Thirdly, the book is, to quote Virginia Woolf, \\"one of the few English novels written for grown up people.\\" It is certainly erudite, but to a large degree it is esoteric as well. The grown up person should also be an English major concentrating on 18th and 19th century British and European literature, with a graduate degree in world history, a familiarity with Greek and Latin literary history, a firm grounding in British 19th century political history, be an expert Trivial Pursuit player and be on intimate terms with at least four George Eliot scholars! The book reads like a college student's term paper in English Lit 101 in which the student tries to impress the professor by using a big word where a small one will do nicely and by using every name and obscure reference the professor alluded to in the lecture in hopes of getting an A. Granted there are footnotes (some 300) in the back of the book to explain the more obscure references, but it is a pain to have to keep flipping back and forth to learn that Tully Veolan is a Perthshire estate in Sir Walter Scott's novel, Waverly, or that Grinling Gibbons was a 17th century sculptor and painter. Finally, given the large cast of characters and the fact that many of them are related to each other it is difficult to keep track of who is who and their relationship to each other. The book would have benefited from a listing of the characters (a practice with many such books of this scope, as for example the works of Dickens).To be fair, the last half of the novel, when Eliot develops the human drama of the story and moves away from the social and political issues foci is gripping and compelling reading. Some people have criticized this part as being too negative, but it is when people are trying to deal with adversity, in real life and in fiction, that we most associate with them.The plot centers around the comings and goings of various characters in the community of Middlemarch, but focuses on two main characters. Dorothea Brooke is a young (19), idealistic, religiously devote girl who chooses to marry the Rev. Edward Casaubon, a much older religious scholar of sorts inspired by the idea of developing mentally under the guidance of her wise husband. But Casaubon is a prig, set in his ways, and ultimately the marriage flounders as he is revealed as a venial and jealous man.The second focus is on Dr. Tertius Lyngate, a young idealist surgeon who comes to Middlemarch and is installed, despite local opposition, as the head of a hospital by a wealthy banker with a dark past which comes back to haunt him. Dr. Lyngate marries Rosamond Vincy, the beautiful daughter of the mayor but that marriage also flounders because of her shallowness and material desires.Sub plots abound: the affairs of Sir James Chettam, a wealthy neighbor of Dorothea who, after being disappointed in seeking her hand, marries her sister Celia; the political aspirations of Dorothea's uncle; the aspirations of Will Ladislaw, a seeming upstart with an attachment to Dorothea; the affairs of Fred Vincy, a likable but profligate young man who loves Mary Garth an unattractive but good hearted girl; the actions of Peter Featherstone, a rich old man whose money and estate many people aspire to, and ultimately the appearance of his mysterious son; the belated appearance of Mr. Raffles, an unscrupulous man with knowledge of the past that affects several of the characters.Money and religion seem to be at the heart of most folks in Middlemarch and small town gossip abounds. If this sort of thing, wrapped in eloquent language, is enjoyable reading for you then Eliot's novel will give you hours of pleasure. But given the comments above, I really cannot give it more than three stars."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"I really enjoyed this very long book, with its intricate plot weavings and army of characters. Even though its language was very old-fashioned, stilted and at times hard to figure out just what were the words saying, still it was all marvelous, and I was sorry to put it down. Lydgate was truly a tragic figure in the best meaning of the word, for the world would have judged him successful. How many authors have turned out such a figure, in just those terms? Rosamund was a hateful creature. The PBS series justified itself in every way, everyone very well cast, especially Mr. Brooke. The theme of disenchantment is seen in the marriages of Dorothea and Lydgate, in Bulstrode and Fred Vincy. All these people were so alive on the pages! The plot details, connecting so many people, was wonderful."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"\\"Middlemarch\\" is, doubtlessly, a brilliant masterpiece. George Eliot shows what a profound and original mind. Her skills in narration and characterization are among the very best of English writers. However, the Modern Library Edition, despite the nice binding and paper quality, is plagued with little errors which ought to be easily resolved by one more round of careful proofreading. These little nuisances tend to get in the way of reading, I find, and I do hope that Modern Library will deliver a proof-read edition sometime in the near future."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"Middlemarch has been described as the one Victorian novel written for grownups. Here, Eliot combines the multiple and interlocking plot lines so beloved by the Victorians with adult characters facing real problems. Particularly engaging is Dorothea Brooke's efforts to find a way to serve, if not achieve, greatness. Rather than undertake some great work herself -- something that Victorian women were not encouraged to do -- she chooses to dedicate herself to supporting a man that she mistakenly believes to be creating a major work. Similarly, Lydgate's slow downfall is realistically portrayed. Unlike many of the works of Dickens, Middlemarch's multiple plots work well together. If you have not read anything by George Eliot, this is the book to begin with."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"I've read stories and books from different ages throughout the years that used language not akin to our own.

Don't waste your time downloading it."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"I struggled through this for a day or two, when I looked more closely at the page behind the cover.

I'm giving this five stars, as you're not allowed to give no stars at all."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"I have persisted for far too long with this dreary, long winded novel and have decided to stop torturing myself in this worthless effort, and closed the book once and for all on page 460 of 896.I still do so reluctantly, as I cannot remember a book so bad that I could not finish it, by one means or another, either by 'skimming' or jumping ahead.For my 'two cents' worth, don't waste your time, unless you have lots and lots to spare and don't mind meandering around with Dorothea (and the provincials) as George Elliot tries to provide a 'study' of Provincial life.In fairness to others, perhaps if it is approached and read as a 'study', it could be bearable, perhaps even an interesting one - I feel sorry for any schoolchild who had this as a set-book!"},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"A surviving photo of George Eliot illustrates why Herbert Spencer expressed the view, apparently to all of Victorian London, that she was \\"too ugly\\" to marry. Her crushes on Spencer and others were unreciprocated, and she eventually went off with a married man in an unconventional arrangement. In Middlemarch she has written a book in which the ugly girl has not one, but two, ardent and faithful lifelong suitors; and the man who marries only for looks and deprecates female intelligence (Lydgate) gets his comeuppance by dying young, a failure, stuck with a wife who doesn't understand him. Moreover, the girl who brushes off her community's disapproval, goes off with a man of uncertain pedigree and willingly gives up her fortune as a result (Dorothea), is presented as an undisputed heroine. The fact that Dorothea manages to do very little with her life of real value to society doesn't matter, while Lydgate gets his comeuppance even though he has substantially contributed to his community. The essentials of this book are George Eliot's personal feminist fantasy. While this is certainly an enjoyable read, it's hard to take this as seriously as do the critics, and comparisons to Tolstoy etc. seem, on the whole, misguided."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"I am an avid reader of many different types of literature, and am used alot of different styles of prose.

All of the characters are flawed (as in real life) which would have been OK if there were any who were sympathetic. But after reading 331 of 771 pages in my edition, I came across the following passage (Chap. 40): &quot;Mr. Farebrother left the house soon after, and seeing Mary in the orchard with Letty, went to say good-bye to her. They made a pretty picture in the western light which brought out the brightness of the apples on the old scant-leaved boughs -- Mary in her lavender gingham and black ribbons holding a basket, while Letty in her well-worn nankin picked up the fallen apples. If you want to know more particularly how Mary looked, ten to one you will see a face like hers in the crowded street to-morrow, if you are there on the watch: she will not be among those daughters of Zion who are haughty, and walk with stretched-out necks and wanton eyes, mincing as they go: let all those pass, and fix your eyes on some small plump brownish person of firm but quiet carriage,....&quot; These words of Eliot's (not of a character) are vile. Who would want to read a book with hateful racial slanders like this, written from the point of view of an author a part of whose moral nature is racial animosity? Any author whose moral frame of reference is so small-minded could not write a book of any real artistic value, all the professors of literature and their hollow praises notwithstanding. Character development and other technical accomplishments do not a work of art make."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"For those who come to MIDDLEMARCH for the first time and wonder what to make up the more than 900 pages of text, they might look at the clue that George Eliot provides both in the subtitle \\"A Study of Provincial Life\\" and in her Prelude. The former suggests indeed a study of life within the narrow confines of middle class life in England before the passage of the Reform Bill of 1832, yet the massive weight of the text implies that it will be a telescoped examination of that life. It is almost as if Eliot wished to place Middlemarch on a microscopic slide and then blow up the image to fit an IMAX screen, from which the reader could see, hear, and feel the images jump off the pages in unforgettably realistic power. In her Prelude, Eliot writes of a hypothetical woman that prefigures Dorothea Brooke: \\"Many Theresas have been born who found for themselves no epic life wherein there was a constant unfolding of far-resonant action; perhaps only a life of mistakes, the offspring of a certain spiritual grandeur ill-matched with the meanness of opportunity.\\" Such a \\"life of mistakes\\" of the book's major and minor characters when combined with the epic sweep vision of a small slice of English society produce the book's essential theme: no one in the book is meant to be seen as heroic or even tragic because Eliot's deterministic philosophy does not allow them to overcome the stifling hand of a vision of life that hints at only the wispy illusion of success but delivers only the inevitability of failure. In such a climate, neither heroes nor tragic figures can thrive.Part of the reason that readers have trouble keeping straight the huge cast of characters is due to Eliot's original means of publishing. MIDDLEMARCH did not start out as a fully-conceived nor finished product. Eliot had planned to write a series of connected novels, beginning with Dorothea Brooke, but after simultaneously writing two of them, she saw that their tightly interlocking themes would complement one another if they were presented as a continuous whole, so she began to publish them as a serial. She was quite successful, so much so that her publisher reminded her that in order not to let her panting public forget who was who, she had to include--or at least mention--each character on a regular basis.Eliot divides the book into four storylines. The first deals with the aspirations of Dorothea Brooke and her disastrous marriage to Edward Casaubon. The second relates the attempt by Dr. Lydgate to establish a successful medical career that also is demolished by an unwise marriage. The third tells of the many travails of Mary Garth. And the final explains the rise and fall of the banker Bulstrode. Each of these main characters represents types of the middle class that made up the social strata with which George Eliot was so familiar. As they interact with each other, Eliot depicts their respective struggles to achieve success or happiness. These attempts usually begin with marriage or high hopes. Dorothea Brooke suffers disillusion with her husband after only a few months. Casaubon, for his part, endures the agony of knowing that his Great Book is truly the piece of trash that Dorothea rightfully suspects it to be. What emerges in the reader after completing the book is a sense of knowledge of the inner lives of the book's characters and of accrued impressions of life on a vast scale, but what is lacking is the realization that no one in MIDDLEMARCH has learned anything of value except perhaps that fate is a game of chance with the deck stacked against humanity. The reader further acknowledges that God has pulled a disappearing act, leaving the residents of Eliot's world to fend for themselves. And since the characters of MIDDLEMARCH do not change, then neither does its readers. The final judgment on MIDDLEMARCH is that it shows in a universe of detail and character delineation the interlocking lives of characters who suffer mightily, but in whose suffering fall short either of heroism or tragedy."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"I spent two months with Middlemarch. It is not a particularly difficult book to read, but it must be read without distractions. It is a very dense novel and requires great concentration to read it because of the tremendous amount of details contained within it. The astonishing ability of Elliot to create both characters and the setting of the book makes it an astonishing work of fiction.In particular, the character of Rosamond Vincy is one of the elegant pieces of dissection of any character in English literature. Her failed relationship with Lydgate is at times almost painful reading as it either reflects either oneself or people you know. Like all good reading, it becomes a commentary on your own life and makes you reconsider your views.I read the Penguin classics version with some commentary and I found the notes to be invaluable as well as the bibliography."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"George Eliot was the greatest sculptor of characters. She could do grand magic with words. Through the words of George Eliot, we know each and everyone of the characters in her novel with intimate details and deep sympathy - we could see their faces up close: now they blushed, or darkened, or twitched, or pouted, or lighted up, or looked bewildered. She expressed the most difficult, the most ambiguous, and the most awkward feelings with precision, charm and force. In Middlemarch, the story had a simple, rambling plot, put together to support the cast of characters Eliot lovingly sculpted. Many argue that Middlemarch is one of the greatest novels of all times. Yes, I agree."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"I'm no smarter than you if your reading this review. I thought MIDDLEMARCH was GREAT. DO NOT be intimidated by a 19'th century 800 page novel, it is very easy to read and the story becomes interesting very quickly. If your common folk like me who likes to read good classics pick this up, you will really enjoy it....and keep me updated!"},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"This classic Victorian novel was on my list of books to read, and I had heard good things about it.This epic novel (880 pages, lots of characters) begins with the story of Dorothea Brooke, a kind-hearted young woman who gets stuck in an unfulfilling marriage. Eventually, she is able to find love. The rest of the story (and there are multiple subplots) is filled by the intricacies of the townspeople of Middlemarch. Here you will wade through stories of gambling debs, family scandal, and various other estate affairs.If this sounds intriguing to you, then have at it. Eliot is wonderful at Victorian prose, and although she was often criticized for being \\"depressing,\\" it's great stuff. If you thought \\"Emma\\" or \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" was a little slow, however, then it is likely you will not be impressed.The main problem I can see with a book like this is that there is something in it for everybody to complain about. Victorian romance novel fans will complain that the book is not happy enough, and that Eliot doesn't talk enough about love. Epic novel fans will complain that there isn't enough going on and some things are only hinted at.This book is notable in that Eliot was trying to write a much more serious novel than other women writers of the day, and in that she succeeded. Readers who are interested in women writers should read this book, and it is important in the history of English literature. I guess I wasn't able to see as much there as others could."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"I have often wanted to read Middlemarch but was intimidated by the length. The first few chapters are tedious and overwritten; I nearly gave up at some points but I always thought, \\"I got this far, I might as well go further.\\" I was generously rewarded: by the end of the book, I was sorry I had finished it and sad that I would no longer read about these characters who had become so intimate to me. That's my measure of a masterpiece. I felt as if I'd lost some friends in the main characters when I closed the book -- friends who taught me some things about life.The main reason I was bored in the first few chapters was because I found Dorothea Brooke so unbelievably \\"good\\" and \\"pious.\\" I could not relate at all to the character who seemed one-dimensional. And I was not surprised or sympathetic when she had deluded herself into marriage with Mr. Causabon, the epitome of \\"ivy tower\\" arrogance. But I believe now that George Eliot's early depiction of Dorothea sets us up to realize that we all often are youthful and idealistic when we are young and believe passionately in \\"saving the world\\" -- and to parents we probably seemed irritatingly naive. Even with the best of intentions, as Eliot shows, we often fall short because of societal restrictions and mistakes we make in life; and then we \\"grow up.\\" In the final analysis, George Eliot makes her point well: we can inspire people and change their lives with one act of kindness and by doing good in our community in our quiet ways. I started out rolling my eyes at Dorothea and ended up wanting to emulate her in my own life.I am surprised that so many people think the story centers around Dorothea. What makes this novel so compelling and fascinating is George Eliot's extraordinary accomplishment in creating an entire village with complex characters so different and yet so similar to each other. I would say this story is as much about Lydgate, Rosamond, the Vincys, Fred and Mary, the Garths, Mr. Causabon, the Chettams, Will Ladislaw et al as it is about Dorothea.In my copy of the book, there is a quote by Virginia Woolfe that says, to paraphrase, that this book is a great English novel written for adults. This is so true! I am a die-hard Jane Austen fan, but the one major flaw I see with Austen is that her novels are about courtship and end at marriage and thus are easier to write (though in my wildest dreams I could never write as brilliantly as Jane Austen). Courtship is often exciting, romantic, and idealistic. But marriage, and any long-term relationship, involves compromise, trials and tribulations, tests of a couple's strength, or the events that reveal the weakness of their bond. This novel examines the full range from courtship through all the peaks and valleys of marriage and the difficulties within all relationships. Along the way, you find yourself sympathizing with each character, even while you realize you loathe what he/she is doing, his/her point of view. What's amazing is that within this complex set of characters lies complexity within each person.There is so much to comment on, but the novel is so rich I can't do it justice so I recommend everyone to read it just once."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"George Eliot hasn't yet gained the modern pop success of Jane Austen or Edith Wharton, but I think its only a matter of time before she catches on in a big way and we see a big. lush movie version of Middlemarch.For now, dont be put off by her novels of great Victorian size. If you are used to the broad comic brushstrokes of Charles Dickens, you will find Eliot a much subtler artist. She paints very subtle shades of emotion and morality.If you have already read Middlemarch, you should seek out Virginia Woolf's essay on Eliot in her book, The Common Reader. Also, Eliot figures highly in Sandra Gilbert's study of Victorian literature, The Madwoman in the Attic."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"I read Middlemarch 30 years ago for a highschool assignment. It was over my young head. Making it through the 900 pages was like climbing a mountain and back. It took me about 600 pages to get into the book, and hundreds of pages were devoted to the politics and goings on of the time - something I had little interest in. A more mature reader would probably have found that fascinating.YET - Of all the books I have read and heard through the years, it is a few sentences in this book that captured my heart more than any other anywhere. See what you think:\\"That element of tragedy which lies in the very fact of frequency, has not yet wrought itself into the coarse emotion of mankind; and perhaps our frames could hardly bear much of it. If we had a keen vision and feeling of all ordinary human life, it would be like hearing the grass grow and the squirrel's heart beat, and we should die of that roar which lies on the other side of silence. As it is, the quickest of us walk about well wadded with stupidity.\\"(Middlemarch, a few paragraphs into Chapter 20.)For writing and insight like that, people make pilgrimages. Eliot's writing has thousands of brilliant paragraphs that are stunning in their eloquence and clarity."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"George Eliot, (nom de plume of Mary Ann Evans), wrote a literary masterpiece with \\"Middlemarch.\\" This Barnes and Noble hard cover edition is a good one, however I would recommend their newer, paperback publication with an Introduction by author and poet Lynn Sharon Schwartz, or the Penguin Classic version. There is also a brief biography of George Eliot included in the B&N; paperback. This superb novel will always rate 5+ Stars for me, but this particular edition is not the best.Ms. Eliot created here, an entire community in England in the mid-1800s and called it Middlemarch. She populated this provincial town with people of every station, local squires and their families, tradespeople, the rising middle class, (Middlemarch, right?), & the poor and destitute, ruthless and honest. She crowded them together, with all their ambitions, dreams and foibles, in this magnificent literary soap opera, and wove a wonderful web of plots and subplots. Ms. Eliot also wrote scathing social commentary and used great wit.The fortunes of Middlemarch are rising in this new era when machines and trains - fast, available transportation - are changing the world, the economy, the politics. Rigid social codes, the British class system, is in danger of being breached. Folks are out to make a quick buck, or a shilling - anything to acquire wealth and enhance social position.Dorothea Brooks lives in Middlemarch. She is an intelligent, sensitive young woman, who wants to dedicate her life to important endeavors. She does not want to settle for a typical marriage and family, but looks toward a more noble cause. As a woman, a professional life is not open to her, nor is the pursuit of intellect, outside of marriage. She weds the elderly Rev. Casaubon, a cold, narcissistic man, thinking that by assisting him with his scholarly research and writing, she will find happiness.Dr. Lydgate comes to Middlemarch to begin his medical practice there. He is an idealist, who has dreams of finding a cure for cholera and opening a free clinic. He meets blonde and beautiful Rosamund Vincie, who fancies him for a spouse...along with a new house, new furniture, an extensive wardrobe, etc.A dashing, romantic Will Ladislaw, nephew of Rev. Casaubon, enters the story, as does Rosie's brother Fred, who wants desperately to marry his Mary, but is out of work and in debt. This cast of richly drawn characters continues to grow with the introduction of Mary's family, the Garths, the banker Bulstrode, friends, relations, and an evil villain or two.This complex novel and portrait of the times, is one of the best reading experiences I have had in a long while. I cannot recommend it highly enough.JANA"},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"It would be interesting to plot a trajectory of women's novels from Austen to Wharton. Austen looks at marriage as the goal, the consummation; Eliot follows it through its problematic stages; and in The House of Mirth its absence fills the novel. The view of marriage darkens with each step. Every marriage in Middlemarch is blighted, except for those that take place at the very end of the book, which seem almost like dreams compared to the unpleasantly realistic situations that have preceded them. Eliot's even, slightly sardonic tone is rarely bitter or bleak; when she steps back and comments on her characters it's always a delight to hear her sane interjections. Yet she is hardly unbiased. She has little sympathy with Rosamond or Casaubon, and a little too much patience with Dorothea, whose piety I found grating, and Will, whose ticklish pride and unwillingness to compromise seem a bit silly. The way she handles Lydgate's irritability, on the other hand, is perfect: &quot;To the last [he] occasionally let slip a bitter speech which was more memorable than the signs he made of his repentance. He once called her his basil plant; and when she asked for a explanation, said the basil was a plant which had flourished wonderfully on a murdered man's brains.&quot;"},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"I used to own a bookstore and when people would ask me my favorite book, I always named \\"Middlemarch.\\" In my opinion, this is the greatest book written. George Eliot was a towering intellect and a masterful observer of humanity. Sure, you have to really focus on this book while you're reading it, but it's worth it. Dickens was a piker compared to Mary Anne Evans (the author's real name). Make the time to read this novel someday (along with Moby Dick, Ulysses and War & Peace)."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"I first read this book as an undergraduate -- and I still pick it up now and again for inspiration. This is Eliot's best novel -- you may go on to read Daniel Deronda, Adam Bede and The Mill on the Floss, but this is the one to start with. It has it all: the love story, the quest for fulfillment, an Italy honeymoon, allusions to John Milton, and financial struggles.Tolstoy, Trollope and Dickens also capture the rich panoramic vision of humanity that Eliot shows -- but her view is so much warmer, so much more optimistic and expresses a strong undercurrent of benevolence. After you read Middlemarch, you will feel renewed and optimistic about the possibility in the world.If you are at all interested in realism or nineteenth century life, you will really enjoy Eliot's portrayals of both Dorothea Brooke and Tertius Lydgate. Dorothea is the quintessential Eliot heroine who seeks to do good and be perfect in an imperfect world. She marries a much older man because he is a scholar -- however, he doesn't understand her spirit or her youthfulness. Tertius Lydgate is the idealistic doctor whose major character flaw is that he falls in love with women who don't see the value of the medical profession. Eliot traces the development of both Dorothea and Lydgate, as well as other characters in the community: Mary Garth and Fred Vincy are just one example.If you are up for a challenge of a mixture of a nineteenth century novel, a mastery of realism, and some unexpected philosophy, you will gain something from reading this work. It may be enjoyed on many levels, but I think the most important one is that it shows portraits of the people who still inhabit our world --- the unsung heroes and the quietly talented."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"I'm a huge fan of George Eliot, and this was the first of her works I read. I actually cried when I turned the last page. The story is truly several stories in one. Perhaps it centers around two motherless sisters who have been raised by their uncle, an estate owner in the habit of turning a blind eye to the concerns of his tenants. Dorothea, his eldest niece, is humble young woman, beautiful and unaware of it, and self-denying to a fault. Her sister is somewhat more trivial but her admonitions to her sister to lighten up and enjoy herself are not without merit. Amidst the vast pool of characters are also the idol youth Fred Vincey, who might just turn right if the woman he loves would give him any encouragement. Mr. Lydgate is a new doctor in town, anxious to introduce new reforms in medicine and hospital management, and he, a sworn bachelor, soon finds himself in the clutches of the adventuring, but all in all well meaning Rosamond Vincey. In the background scandal and conflict are brewing and our dear Mr. Lydgate must keep himself above water. To me, however, the story is about Dorothea. Her self denying ways land her in an unhappy marriage to a man who will not be pleased (the self-important prig.) In the mean time, she becomes acquainted with his young nephew and they form a rather intense friendship. When the husband dies, and he wills away all of her inheritance should she form any kind of alliance with Mr. Ladislaw, it seems she is doomed never to find happiness, despite her enduring endeavours to be a good influence to all around her.This book, to me, is a testament to the power of good influences. Dorothea is quite possibly my favourite heroine of all time."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"REALITY:It took me probably 5 months to slog through the first 442 pages. So much detail. Stuff about the local politics that I didn't understand. Booor-ing. But because everyone, including my best friend, said this was such a great book, I persevered. After page 442, the pace picked up. Once Raffles entered the picture and the truth about Mr. Bulstrode came to light, then everything suddenly came together into a spell-binding last 250 pages that I whipped through in 2 days.If you can somehow force yourself through the first 2/3 of the book, you will be rewarded with what turns out to be one of the finest stories ever written (in my opinion).ESPECIALLY LIKED:I appreciated the realism shown in the romances and marriages of the young couples. How many stories portray marriage as the most wonderful institution on earth instead of what it more often is, the most difficult, particularly in the beginning? I was comforted to see what really went on behind the scenes.There was nothing contrived or flakey about the characters. Even the worst of them was believable and acted in ways that were consistent with expectations.The development and twists and turns of Dorothea's romance with Ladislaw was exquisitely portrayed. It all seemed completely impossible, and it was completely impossible, but somehow it all worked out in the end.WHY? WHY? WHY?In these old novels, so many times the young beautiful girl marries some louse or jerk and is miserable. The author dreams up a convenient way to remove him. The girl then gets a second chance at happiness with someone who is wild about her, and they live happily ever after. How many people wish their lives could be rewritten so easily? Well, it is nice to escape into a fantasy world where everything turns out well. Then we put down the book and resume our wacky lives of hardship and never resolved problems."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"This classic is a wonderful experience to read, as I expected it would be. The story gets 5 stars.Like other new Kindle owners (apparently) I downloaded an assortment of free books - mostly literature I did not read in school and want to read now. I have seen reviews of Kindle books that complained of formatting glitches in various publications, and this is one that has them. It's a little jarring and disruptive to the flow of the story when lines are truncated and paragraphs are chopped up into smaller segments. If I had paid for this book I would want a refund. 3 stars for the Kindle version."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"That is high praise, I know, but I couldn't think of any better superlatives. George Eliot writes with such keen insight into such diverse lives, it staggers the imagination. Virginia Woolfe wrote that Eliot was one of the few nineteenth century authors who wrote for grown up people, and I couldn't agree more. She never insults her readers by telling them what their opinion should be of any of her characters. They are all intricately drawn with an even hand, good traits and bad. Just when you think you've found a character that it is impossible to sympathize with, Eliot debunks your opinion in a single poignant paragraph.I read and loved this book in college, and I've read it every two or three years since. It never wears thin. Anyone who wants to know how perfectly seamless a novel can be must read this masterpiece."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"I just this book as a required reading for a philosophy and thematic discussion class, and while I have found all the books asigned worthwhile reading, I didn't know what to expect with this book, having never read any Eliot and also having heard it described as a &quot;chick book&quot;. While it does often read like an extremely ellaborate 19th century soap opera, I cannot recommend this book highly enough, whatever your reading preferences. This book cuts across genre lines not just as a result of the witty storylines and sharp dialogue but as a legitimate and inciteful case study of human nature and human interactions, both social and romantic.Set in and around the town of Middlemarch, somewhere in England, the story encomasses the lives of a slew of dilightful and diverse townspeople, tending to focus on and revolve the story around three couples: Dorothea/Ladislaw, Rosamond/Lydgate, and Mary Garth/Ted. The entire story is very complicated and impossible to give a summary of here, but sufice it to say that Dorothea is an aristocratic, idealistic, religious girl of twenty who wants to do something great and has an inquiring mind, so she marries a man named Casaubon, but he turns out not to be so great as she had hoped and he has a young cousin named Ladislaw who has been supported by Casaubon and doesn't understand how Dorothea could be attracted to him, and is convinced that Casaubon will make her as wretched as he is so Ladislaw must protect her... And that's just one of the many inter-weaving subplots.The real genious of this novel is the complex realistic characters that George Eliot fills her book with. These characters are all real and presented in such a svmpthetic light that though you will likely come to care for some and despise others, you find it difficult to judge them as being good or bad. The role that human relationships plays in our lives and the problems caused by common miscommunications are all dealt with realistically and sympathetically. Questions such as, what makes a good marriage?, what does it mean to be great?, and how should one treat ones fellow man? are all featured genuinly a promonently.This is not to say that this is necessarilly a philosophic novel, it can be read just for the real pleasure of reading, but it is one of those rare great books that never fails to entertain while engaging the mind and the spirit throughout. A must read for anyone, regardless of taste, who likes to read for the sheer pleasure of it."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"There is no question that this novel is a work of fine literature and an unusually in-depth portrait of the lives of a few characters. On this merit alone, it is worth reading. But . . .I found the book, despite its astuteness, to be rather dull and dry, and ultimately boring. While I appreciate detail, I also appreciate aesthetic description, and her ongoing passages were simply not amusing enough to keep me interested. Don't get me wrong: I understand that literature is not all about feel-good entertainment. But this novel is as lacking in the aesthetic department as it is brilliant in the technical/analytical. And when a book truly bores you, what difference does it make how fine a novel it is?"},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"This one deserves 10 stars, it is really one of the most incredible books I've ever read. I think I've only given a brilliant rating to the Count of Monte Cristo and Bleak House. This is a fascinating character study of the people of Middlemarch, a town in Victorian England. I can't even begin to try to describe the story -- there is Dorothea who makes a dreadful first marriage to an older man, Dr. Lydgate and his disastrous relationship and marriage to the self-centered Rosamund, Fred Vincy and Mary, and much much more.The way the author pulls her story and characters together is incredible, and the insight into the characters is nothing short of brilliant. To quote from the book jacket and Virginia Wolf \\"one of the few English novels written for grown-up people.\\"Just be warned, this is not a sit on the edge of your seat, can't put it down until it's finished type of novel. This is a story to savour and enjoy the multi-faceted characters and the author's glorious prose like a fine red wine or a box of chocolates (or both). If you are looking for high action and adventure, this is not the book for you. Highly recommended for any lover of 19th century English literature, not as dark and brooding as Hardy can be, but the prose is just as lovely, if not better."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"This book is very high on my list of favourite books of all time, and it is thought to be George Eliots' masterpiece. It is wonderfully grand novel that covers a lot of territory in a lot of pages. There are four main plotlines in the book, and Ms. Eliot develops each of them to the fullest without letting any of them get lost in the shuffle. There is the story of Dorothea Brooke, the story of Lydgate's marriage, the history of Mary Garth and the fall of the banker, Bulstrode. The book is a masterpiece because of the storyline and the characters which she does so very well, but it's also a masterpiece because it is a very substantial work of great psychological and moral penetration. I can't say anymore about the book, since my words cannot hope to convey the grandeur of it, but it is a \\"Must Read\\" for anyone who loves great literature and purity of the English language. Definitely another \\"desert island\\" book for me."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"George Eliot was one of the most agile sports reporters of the Victorian era, and this novel, set in a bucolic English town, shows Eliot at her feisty best. The scenes of blood and gore were a bit much for readers at the time, but the exalted visions that overcome the boxers when they succumb to a knockout punch are as inspiring as any of the techno-hype that Hollywood delivers today. It's time to resurrect the reputation of this in-the-ring journalist-writer who knew the pulse of the people and put it on paper on purpose, pulling no punches."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"My mother described reading this book like jogging through Jell-o and I am inclined to agree.

The book is OK, but i think getting old wrongly. Compared to Austen novels it is a heavy, bored, intellectual, pretentious book. The characters are good, but somehow, by the slowness of her style you star to not care about them. The politics and religion are a nuissance.

I saw many people praising this as one of the greatest books of all time so I bought it and was excited to get into it. In all honesty, I had a hard time keeping awake. The story line was good. My problem was with the writing. I LOVE descriptive writing. Thomas Hardy is one of my favorite authors. He takes me to the village and I become part of it. I never cared about Middlemarch. I was disappointed with the character development. I only cared for a few of the main characters. There was too much philosophy, excessively LONG sentences and filler that distracted my interest. I found it very odd that in this lengthy book three weddings took place but she never wrote about even one of them. One chapter the wedding was close and the next chapter it was a month later. But we got details of medical theory, politics and went through the bidding process of many items at an auction (when only one item had a connection to the story), etc. I also found it interesting that each \\"book\\" of the book was 100(+/-1) pages long.

However, the font style and formatting used by the Oxford press is really unattractive, and there is no way to change the font style. You can change the size of the font but not the actual font style itself. It is a very old style and looks like something from the 1800s. I'm sure this was fine for printed books in the 1800s, but it looks horrible on a Kindle 2 screen in the 2000s. Come on Oxford, when you convert your books to an e-reader format, you need to put some thought into how the work will be displayed on e-readers.

It is a little slow at times, but even worth re-reading. I would say more, but I read the book a long time ago."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"Middlemarch is a town in early nineteenth century England and serves as a microcosm of English life at that time. And it's not just about the landed gentry. It covers many walks of life and includes a kaleidoscope of characters who are not comfortable with their wealth or lack thereof, their choice of spouses, their family history--you name it. There's Fred Vincy, who's been educated for the clergy but doesn't feel he's cut out for preaching. He fancies Mary Garth, who's pleasant and plucky but plain. Mary loves Fred but can't abide his aimlessness or his financial follies. Of course, Fred and Mary can't come right out and express their feelings for each other. Dorothea Brooke has it all--beauty, thoughtfulness, sufficient resources--but chooses to marry an older, unappealing, wealthy scholar. She realizes her mistake during the honeymoon but does her best to make it work until he conveniently dies. She has a penchant for her husband's cousin Will but can't admit this, even to herself. Her husband was obviously more attuned to the situation than Dorothea or Will, as his will makes it impractical for the two to marry. In fact, there are lots of scandals involving Will's heritage and relationship to Bulstrode, an unsavory, overly pious character, who is being blackmailed by an old acquaintance. Tertius Lydgate is the new doctor in town who hopes to make his mark in medicine and is Dorothea's male counterpart in the altruistic department. His reputation, however, suffers from his liaison with Bulstrode, and he finds himself buried in debt and married to a beautiful but frivolous woman who can't appreciate his aspirations. This is sort of a Victoria soap opera with lots of misunderstandings and even some political turmoil, which was lost on me, even with the assistance of the notes at the end."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"The greatest classic I have ever read, a mature psychological work. But it is long, which take a lot of time to read"},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"I read this Bantam text from cover to cover in anguish.George Eliot 's language is very hard for a foreigner to read,she used too many clauses and rare usage of words.As a matter of fact,I don't find the book very engrossing or impressive,it was just a story of six young people who at last came to matrimony and some led a happy life(Fred and Mary),some led sort of a bad one(like Lydgate and Vincy).Rather,Eliot's witty comments at the beginning or ending of chapters interested me a lot.I don't understand why Dorothea cared so much about Christianity,and why Lydgate chose to put up with Rosamond for decades until he died,(he should pursue his dream in science.)If Rosamond was very selfish in character,it seemed to me,that at the end of the novel,Eliot delineated her as someone with goodness.She never spoke anything bad towards Dorothea since she went to live in London,and when Lydgate died,she married a wealthy old physician who was good to her kids.These are indeed virtues.So what on earth did the author think of Rosamond?Bad,not likely;good,she ruined Lydgate's career."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"George Eliot was one of England's finest 19th century authors, and Middlemarch one of Eliot's finest novels. It's the story of the blighted marriage of Dorothea, a young and idealistic woman, and Lyd Gate, who is betrayed by his wife's egoism. Middlemarch is a complex work concerning social interrelationships and the struggle to hold fast to personal integrity in a materialistic and mean spirited age. Eliot is unsurpassed in her vivid presentation of England during the 1830s. Superbly narrated by Carole Boyd, this unabridged, six cassette, five hour, Naxos AudioBooks edition is technically flawless and wonderfully enhanced with 19th Century symphonic music. Middlemarch is also available in a CD format."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"Once again, thanks to Amazon for making these classics FREE on the Kindle. I love it. Now to the book - I believe the other reviewers here have covered it quite well so I will just add a few words of comment. First of all, it is wonderful - totally engrossing. I think it was originally several novels that George Elliot (pen name of Mary Ann Evans) ultimately combined into one novel and serialized it. The serialization must have driven the readers mad because the tension builds almost unbearably. I could not wait to get back to it - and it is a long book. Elliot skillfully weaves so many stories into one long thread and they all work together so well. I don't recall ever reading it (at least I could not remember the plot line) but I did see the Masterpiece Theater version (1994) and recalled the story of the severe preacher/scholar Edward Casaubon and his innocent wife but not much else, so that put all the more pressure on me to keep reading. It was such a release to get all the issues more or less resolved at the end! Whew. Netflix has the Masterpiece Theater series on two DVDs and I can't decide if I am going to look at it again or not. It would be nice to see how they handled the characters but I don't know if I could bear all the tensions again! By all means read this wonderful novel."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"Well, not every classic is really \`classic', but I'm so glad I stumbled across this in a local 2nd hand store. Wow. I don't think I've read anything like it before - and I don't think it'd get past a publisher these days. It's so loose, it's almost like a soap opera: she feels no need to tie everything tightly around one major plot, with maybe a couple of sub-plots. The uniting thing is the town (well, generally some of the wealthier elements of the town - although there is some range of class), and the gaze moves here and there among various residents. The characters are really potent. Not necessarily multi-layered and complex, but striking, and Eliot seems to have a gift for finding something authentic to focus on without becoming a mere stereotype. I am reminded of some ofC.S. Lewis'characters, having some essential moral point about them: I know he enjoyed this book, and definitely he could have drawn something of that Screwtape notion of the profound implications of seemingly small actions, interactions, attitudes and choices. Particularly by the end of the book Eliot is quite philosophically didactic, with true heroism painted as the generous life of someone quietly forgotten.This book also leads me to an odd comparison - with Fred Saberhagen's'Swords'series, based around a dozen god-forged blades, each with a particular, if you like, super-power (e.g. healing wounds, cutting stone, bringing luck, drawing loyalty etc.). The fun is watching the way they interact, enhancing, neutralising, antagonising, inflaming each other. Eliot manages that with her characters - she creates such strong personalities I came away with a renewed sense of how valuable each of us are, the significance of everyday choices, the tragedy and triumph of the mundane. Each of Eliot's main characters has the presence of one of these god-forged swords, yet can be influenced well or ill by interplay. Context and personality both work on each other: neither nature nor nurture makes something inevitable - but they are both also hugely powerful. I loved the way that, for example, Dorothea's naively optimistic egocentrism - that she is made to improve the lot of the unfortunate - is not merely dismissed nor endorsed. Her strong personality works both for and against her. There are elements of this in some of Austen's characters, and doubtless Eliot was across Austen, but Eliot feels no obligation to have fairy-tale endings. Dorothea's zeal can both trap and free her - and this despite the purity of her intentions.It's also a delight that the story doesn't stop with a wedding, but follows the course of marriage (or two). There's also wonderful room to move: even characters that you are made to think should end up together won't necessarily. And even that won't necessarily be a bad thing.The book is hugely psychological, constantly highlighting the gaps between why people act the way they do, and the reasons they think they behave that way. Self-awareness is a rare commodity. There is also a huge amount of pride behind actions: I know it's still a huge motivator, but at times in the book I wondered if in that society at that time there was a far greater need to be seen a certain way by your neighbours. At times I lost myself in the torturous logic of why these young (or even not so young) swains with burning passions could never admit to them - but I do live in a time and place where our mythology so strongly condemns (theoretically anyway) money being admitted as a reasonable obstacle to romance. But there are other reasons why people, even well meaning people, can get caught up in destructive conversational patterns that make a hell out of a potential heaven (a point well made in Ann Tyler's painfully insightful,'Breathing Lessons').I'm not completely convinced by all of Eliot's characters, and I'm also separated from some of the potency of some of the conventions she's playing with by time and my own context's assumptions. But I'm still mightily impressed and will definitely seek out some more of her books. And this one goes straight onto my, \\"To be read again,\\" shelf."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"Reading this masterpiece will broaden your vocabulary, enrich your insight, heighten your appreciation of our language, and sharpen your observations of human nature. Wholly satisfying."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"Glad to have had an on line dictionary available as there are plenty of archaic and/or rarely used words. A true classic...and the on line price was too good to pass on."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"Eliot (the pen name of Mary Anne Evans) dazzles with the life in the simple nineteenth century English town of Middlemarch. Eliot's work shines in many ways. Human behavior and life and motivations are told in both amazingly perceptive observation and pinpoint accuracy language. She tells a good story and has engaging characters. This reader found the opening chapter, describing sisters Dorothea and Celia of such luminous descriptive power that its sheer overwhelming quality overshadowed the meanings. Only after settling into the book could one enjoy the characters and events because the awe-inspiring writing became a given. The rich characters are drawn from a variety of the times' social strata, wealthy and poor, young and old, wise and uh, not so wise. They're humans who face the challenges of life, misfortune, the consequences of divergent thinking/acting contrary to public opinion, gambling, secrets, and of facing romance and matrimonial commitment with its varied turns, and many issues of growing up and making choices. Yes, there's more than one good love story going on and it's none too surprising finding out that Eliot is a woman given the depth and insights she elaborates about women's relationships, internal thoughts, and roles with men in this society still very much male dominated. Eliot's magic with words necessarily means keeping a dictionary handy. The principal characters draw one in well, for this reader, particularly Dorothea and Lydgate, and even lesser characters such as Mr. Garth and his family, the dynamics of the Vincy family, and the Farebrother family. Religion and politics and relationships all add to the mix, are written well, and only deepen the reader's enjoyment. Simply terrific. Worthy of its status as a classic and great book."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"This story is somewhat off my usual fayre. Ostensibly it is a romance story, or rather three romance stories that are intertwined. As such it is a book I never before bothered to read as I would not want my cool macho image to be dented by the sight of me flicking through a romance! But I managed to get a copy for my e-reader from \\"Manybooks\\" and thus read it in secret!And I am very glad I did so. Of course, this is a classic so the judgement of history is already there as to the worth of this book, and nothing I add here can change that. Without a doubt this is a book that can be read and enjoyed by many many people. What I can add to this is that it can also be enjoyed by people who do not go in for icky romances! And the reason I can say that is that the real strength of this story does not lie in the romances themselves, but in the wonderful observation ad depiction of life in the 1830s of rural England.From the opening pages where you have people namedropping Wilberforce and other such luminaries in their social circles, you are drawn into experiencing life amongst the tight Victorian social circles. You see how people wish to better not just themselves but others, but are often frustrated by the cages of convention. You see characters reform themselves, and others ruin themselves. You see people who are not evil and yet do evil deeds for human reasons. You see a mirror on the souls of the characters and ultimately ourselves as readers.George Eliot's characterisations are wonderful. Her writing is still accessible to the modern reader, and whilst she makes some use of techniques where the narrator knows all and can moralise on the reader's behalf - something you would not find in a modern work - these techniques do not wholly detract from the work, and were - of course - quite common in Victorian fiction. One plot element also reminded me of Dickens in the unfolding coincidences in the background of two characters. But whilst the work is therefore clearly Victorian, it remains very readable. The auction scene and some other scenes were very funny, and as you recognise the types of characters being portrayed in real people - past and present - you will be amused by this work.So if, like me, you don't do romances - don't skip this work. It is well worth reading."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"I enjoyed Middlemarch. In fact, the more I read it, the more I enjoyed it. However, I can't really say that it is one of the 100 best novels of all time - I hope not anyways, or I am going to be a pretty disappointed reader if this is as good as it gets. Here is what I liked: The character development is really good. There are multiple story lines that get intertwined and it makes for a nice mix of characters and stories. It truly is a \\"study of provincial life\\", and Elliot does a nice job of portraying different types of people, marital discord, gender issues and societal issues - and much of the topics are still relevant today - quite impressive since the story was written in the 1800s. Elliot also has a nice way of inserting her point of view, or endowing little \\"tidbits of advice\\" that I found \\"highlight worthy\\". It is the type of book where I might go back and just read the quotes I highlighted - as I found them quite relevant and eloquently put. The story held my attention until the end.That being said - I still have trouble giving it a 5 star rating - just not sure it is worth the legendary hype. I kept waiting for something a bit more dramatic to occur. Was waiting for the really big shoe to drop or bomb to hit, and it never happened. I guess that is in keeping with \\"provincial life\\" - it just sort of plodded along. I'm not even certain I could pinpoint the climax of the book although maybe that reflects my shortcomings as a reader :-). And while I appreciated the \\"Finale\\", to learn what became of everybody, it did seem a little contrived to me - a bit too neat and tidy. I was a little disappointed by the end in that regard.In sum - I think it's a good book if you want to tackle one of the lengthier classics. Having a Kindle was key for me, in that I could look up all the words I didn't know (which were many - again - maybe my shortcoming). Clearly a talented writer, I think she achieved her goal of exploring different types of people, marriages, and \\"midlife crises\\". That being said, I would not say it was a life changing book for me - just an interesting read."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"Juliet Stevenson does a fantastic job recreating the various characters in this incredibly long Victorian novel. Her diction is beautiful and she brings to life what can otherwise be a laborious novel to read. Her narration added a sense of understanding to the work, which increased my enjoyment and allowed me to love the language rather than getting bogged down by it. Highly recommended, but it's a long haul!"},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"Even before I started the reading of \\"Middlemarch\\", I was really very happy with the quality of the pulication of this book. Having been a printer for lo 48yrs, it was eye opening upon unwrapping the contents. The binding, the printing is of the quality seldom seen these days. Now, as to the writing; as I read the first two chapters, I was taken in as to the intense descriptions of the characters. I found myself wondering, how come I had never come up on her writing before in my 83yrs of life. Wishing that I had read her writing years ago. Her writing has got me trapped now in re-reading more English literature of that period. VERY PLEASED."},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","review":"George Eliot's classic novel \\"Middlemarch\\" is a timeless treasure that deserves to be read over and over again. My favourite characters in the novel are Dorothea, Will (I always thought of Orlando Bloom playing him while I was reading), Rosamond, Mary and Fred. Very well-written, though Bulstrode's shady past is somewhat confusing to me. great read, though."},{"Title":"The common fossils of Missouri (Missouri handbook)","review":"I first learned to identify fossils with this little book, and I still treasure it. The photos are a bit antiquated, but informative, accurate and fascinating. The text not only gives great descriptions of the fossils themselves, but also a condensed geological history of our region. I wanted to give a copy to my nephew for Christmas, but could not find it.....glad it is still available online. If you, a family member or friend has an interest in Missouri's geological history, this wonderful little book is a must-have."},{"Title":"The common fossils of Missouri (Missouri handbook)","review":"I THANK THIS BOOK IS A HELPFUL TOOL FOR FOSSIL COLLECTING IN MISSOURI"},{"Title":"Morning Coffee","review":"This book, as well as Warren Bonesteels 'online version' put out daily, as well as his new website, are something that many internet families wouldn't/CAN'T begin a new day without anymore! I met Warren online quite some time ago and have been an avid daily reader as well as sharing his daily \\"Morning Coffee\\" posts with groups throughout the internet with! Often times I don't go to bed at night until Warren has posted is daily issue of \\"Morning Coffee\\" and I've got it out to one and all for their reading pleasure first thing in the Morning. Several people have relied upon this and can't begin a decent day without their cup of java AND their dose of \\"Morning Coffee\\"Warren speaks, types, in a down to earth southern style, a one on one level that anyone and everyone can accept. He makes you KNOW you're family, that you're welcome at his table for a cup of good hot STRONG java and you're welcome to stay as long as you like. Bones (as we nickname him) is not one of those who'll push his ideas on the reader and personally states what he thinks and is more than willing to have YOU write him back with YOUR opinions. Warren is HUMAN, treats his readers as the human beings they are, and always leaves the kitchen table with an open door policy and the knowlege that the coffee is always brewing, strong, hot, good, and that one and all are welcome to join him for some! God Bless this man's Golden Heart! This is THE BOOK~~ONE HUMAN BEING SPEAKING WITH OTHER HUMAN BEINGS on an even level with the reader. Not the 'usual high fallutin Enlgish that the reader has to stop and say, HUH? And need to re-read to attempt to understand what was said. In the humor, the stories, the discussions, the 'visitin', most generally there will be a 'moral to the story'. This book is FOR ALL AGE GROUPS AND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO SOME OF THE WORLD'S YOUTH OF TODAY, THEY JUST MIGHT LEARN A BIT ABOUT RESPECT!"},{"Title":"Understanding the Grand Design- Spiritual Reality's Inner Logic","review":"The truth nature of the Universe and the destiny of mankind has been taught from time immemorial by many great Masters and teachers throughout the world. It is only in more recent years however that the modern sciences and in particular those within the field of quantum physics have been arriving at, and thus verifying the same Universal truths, emphasising the fact that there is ultimately only one reality.In this excellent and unique book, &quot;Understanding the Grand Design&quot;, Joachim Wolf has produced an exceptional work that takes a modern quantum metaphysical perspective of the nature of the multi-dimensional Universe and how it relates to life and mankind. Understanding the Grand Design performs an excellent job of bridging the gap between the timeless Spiritual view of the multi-dimensional Universe and the most recent views of quantum physics, and does so in a way that is highly readable and understandable without being overly scientific or esoteric.Understanding the Grand Design focuses in particular on the Holographic view of the Universe, a metaphor originally put forward by quantum metaphysicist David Bohm who presented a model of the Universe as a &quot;holomovement&quot;, analogous to a fluid hologram comprising explicate and implicate orders. In his book, Joachim Wolf has done an outstanding job of taking this holographic view of the Universe and by means of his &quot;holon&quot; model applying it in very clear and understandable terms in order to explain its significance and importance to everything and everyone in the Universe. This book explains in detail such aspects as the nature of space and time, group entities, the cosmic holarchy, who we are, multiple worlds, multi-dimensional communication, creating your own reality and experiencing multi-dimensional reality.To anyone interested in their own multi-dimensional nature, that of the Universe, and the significance of these to all mankind, Understanding the Grand Design is a unique and exceptional work, and one which will surely have a profound impact on the thinking of these most important subjects. This book is without doubt a &quot;must read&quot; for anyone and everyone interested in all aspects of Spirituality, the timeless truths and nature of the Universe, modern quantum physics, and indeed for all those interested in the reality of the Universe and the meaning of life."},{"Title":"Understanding the Grand Design- Spiritual Reality's Inner Logic","review":"Hello,I have just finished reading Joachim Wolf's book \\"understanding the Grand Design\\", and simply have to share it with the other readers. Jo is an educated scientist. He takes a very scientific approach with his knowledge of Quantum Physics and combines it with modern day Metaphysics.He takes the teachings of histories greatest minds such as Jesus, Buddha, Plato, Emerson and Eienstein. And combines the teachings of modern day visionaries such as Deepak Chopra, Dr. Wayne Dyer, Neal Donald Walsch and Steven Hawking into a comprehensible and easy to read book.He answers some of the greatest questions throughout history, raises new questions, and then answers them just as eloquently.His book explains that our concepts of space and time, are just that our concepts. That they do not really exist outside of our perception of them. That we all live in an unlimited number of dimensions and then explores the concepts of our ability to interact in a multidimensional Universe. He then takes you into an exact method of how we each can go back into our own unique pasts, and affect change in our lives today and for tomorrow.Modern science and their scientists are proving that we are not alone, that we are immortal by proving that reincarnation is real, that one thing can exist in more than one place at a time, and that everything is One. As everything is divided infinitely when viewed from one view point. It all comes back down to One when looked at from the opposite view point. We, and everything else are spiritual. We are all part of One.An absolute must read for anyone interested in expanding their own spiritual awareness, and wanting to know more about how the Universe really works."},{"Title":"Understanding the Grand Design- Spiritual Reality's Inner Logic","review":"This book is a must-read for both the novice and seasoned spiritual seeker as well as for scientists and anyone skeptical of the supernatural religious perspective. Joachim Wolf has offered a legacy that is at once both spiritual primer and doctoral dissertation -- a brilliant distillation of the best that is out there, yet presented with such flow and intuitive clarity that it reflects nature's divine simplicity. And when I say \\"out there\\", I include the best offerings from the self-help genre, from religions of all types, from esoteric and metaphysical philosophy, as well as from across the soft and hard sciences.Although an objective physicist by trade, Mr. Wolf's grand design dovetails almost exactly with the implications of my own research into the subjective source of our innate spiritual proclivities -- human emotion. He is one of the rare few who find their way to the central and sacred frontiers where quantum, holographic, and dynamic principles can finally bridge the illusory gap between science and spirituality. His offering is the most cogent assembly of scientific wisdom and the best package of \\"spirituality\\" I've found to date. It offers a lens though which to interpret and evaluate any other -- including the great religious traditions. Indeed, this is THE one book I've offered to my own children and a legacy upon which I hope to build."},{"Title":"Understanding the Grand Design- Spiritual Reality's Inner Logic","review":"Hello Joachim...Congratulations on your Book and Masterpiece &quot;Understanding The Grand Design&quot;.

The &quot;Holon Principles&quot; in this book finally cleared my 'high denseness' with respect to &quot;we are the microcosm of the macrocosm&quot; and provided the nuts and bolts of comprehending multiple dimensions. I always accepted these ideas but I just couldn't completely understand them.I had found Joachim Wolf's website and was very intrigued by his freely offered paper regarding the subject of this book. However, reading this book is what did it for me. &quot;Understanding the Grand Design&quot; opened new pathways of thinking and most importantly it aided my understanding greatly.The specificity, clarity and most of all preciseness in which &quot;Understanding the Grand Design&quot; is written contributes to its value. Add to this the profoundness regarding its contents and the simplicity of the writing style and you can truly call this book outstanding.The new understanding I have gained from this excellent book will certainly add me to the critical mass necessary.I live in the U.S. and I received this book within one week after ordering it NEW under &quot;Used and New - right here on the Amazon website&quot;, directly from Trafford-Publishing."},{"Title":"Understanding the Grand Design- Spiritual Reality's Inner Logic","review":"Joachim Wolf's book is one of many now on the market that attempt to explain the link between the physical world and the world of the spirit.

I bought this as a place to start & I am impressed with the quality and functionality of this book. It comes with an audio cd, a culture guide, cards/pages with the phrases covered in the CD, a culture guide and a laminted pocket card of all of the phrases.It all fits neatly into this waterproof little binder that fits easily inside your ACU side cargo pocket. The CD is well done as is the book and it is easy to take with you. I have already started chatting with the local nationals here in Bagram that I come in contact with. Sure, it's not Rosetta Stone, but internet connectivity can be very slow here and this little book can go anywhere with you. I like the book so much that I have ordered the Iraq Arabic version & pre-ordered the DARI version. And let's face it, the culture guide is useful because many Americans have never been outside the US, and really don't know that Haji is meant to describe someone that has been to Mecca on pilgrimage, and it should only be used as a term of respect. Grab a copy of these little books while they are still available. They are great- a good quality, common sense product. Finally, something actually written with soliders in mind! I am delighted with this book!! AAA+"},{"Title":"Accent on Afghanistan: Pashto","review":"Good as an introduction to Pashto. The Rosetta Stone series is better, yet it is much more expensive. The topics covered here (travel, greetings, food, numbers, etc) are sufficient for someone who has no previous knowledge of the language, this is clearly geared toward teaching soldiers and relief workers. It does include some commands, military terms and ranks. I agree with the other reviewer, the \\"DOs and Don'ts \\" are really geared toward complete idiots, it's almost embarrassing that advice like \\"Don't call everyone you meet 'Hajji'.\\" would need to be dispensed to an American headed overseas. Overall the CD and flash cards are very easy to use together and (unlike some other language courses I have used) the native speaker on the CD is very clear and easy to understand in his pronunciations. The fact is, you can't learn a language just from a dictionary or phrasebook and this set gives you that little bit of an edge to get started with Pashto. You won't find yourself having lengthy conversations or hosting a Pashto discussion group, but you'll have some basics and, if you are in-country, hopefully this will be enough to get you by. I would buy this again, it's well worth what you pay for it...but if you are planning on mastering this language, you might look at other options."},{"Title":"Accent on Afghanistan: Pashto","review":"Language portion is limited, but is packaged well. The 'Do's and Don'ts' are unfortunately aimed at the brain-dead though and don't really get into any useful information. Overall, the guide is written for junior soldiers operating in the field, and gives some limited vocabulary. A bit pricey ($26.95 at AAFES) for what you actually get, but a decent multi-media package for the military."},{"Title":"Accent on Afghanistan: Pashto","review":"I found the book to be highly useful with the proper dialects and prononciations of the words. Keep in mind that language has three to four different dialects and this book has the main one that is used in Khandahar province. The book is also used by the military and teaches a great deal of the fundamentals to be knowledgeable of. I have tested Rosetta and compared the two books/software and this by far beats the competition due to price and straight forward lessons. If your planning to visit the country or learn the language, I highly recommend. Cheers!"},{"Title":"Accent on Afghanistan: Pashto","review":"This is basically a Pashto phrasebook, and certainly it doesn't delve into the many mysteries and complexities of Pashto grammar. But I bought it mostly for the accompanying CDs, which are excellent quality and have really helped in learing how the language actually sounds. Pashto is difficult to pronounce- complex clusters of consonants (many more than are allowed in English), combinations of vowels that differ only slightly from each other but which can change the meanings of words, and many regional variations in pronunciation. So if you're working from the online resources available (like the grammar and introductory course of Tegey and Robson), this is a valuable adjunct."},{"Title":"Wife For Sale","review":"This book was published in 1933, when writing styles were different.

The Nikon N60, known as the F60 outside of the U.S., is perhaps the best &quot;snapshot&quot; camera in the world today. And the Magic Lantern Guide to the Nikon N60/F60 is perhaps the best book available to learn about this unique camera, and Nikon photography in general.The Nikon &quot;system&quot; is an extensive collection of lenses, flash units and accessories designed to work integrally with Nikon camera bodies. This book takes the reader step-by-step through the N60, from loading the batteries to choosing the right lenses and flash units. Along the way, the book covers virtually all aspects of basic photography, including depth-of-field, exposure metering, composition, perspective, contrast, creative effects, filters, choosing the right film and flash photography.The book has value beyond understanding the Nikon system in general, and the N60 specifically. It covers basic photographic terms and concepts, and is filled with scores of black-and-white and color photos graphically illustrating the capabilities of advanced 35mm camera systems. Fully 50 percent of the book is dedicated to general topics and is not specific to Nikon. This makes the book an exceptional value for novice photographers seeking to broaden their base of knowledge.I would also recommend this book to anyone considering becoming a Nikon owner. It provides an excellent introduction to the Nikon system, with much of the information applicable to the full Nikon line. Purchasing a Nikon is more than just buying a camera. This book will provide valuable information to make the right choices.I found this book to be well organized, well written and extremely useful. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Magic Lantern Guides: Nikon N60","review":"An easily understandable book that explains all the functions of this camera and how to use them in great, yet simple detail.

Once you read this book, you will be able to utilize ALL functions of this camera and know the expected outcome of using each function. It also explains the basics of photography while describing functions. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR BEGINNING PHOTOGRAPHERS who own the N/F60 or any SLR. Includes several photos to see the effects of different camera settings."},{"Title":"Magic Lantern Guides: Nikon N60","review":"This well-organized book will help you get the most out of your Nikon N60 camera. It takes you through each of the camera's many features, explaining the technical basis behind each one and how to use each feature properly.The book also teaches you the basics of photography -- how aperture, shutter speed, focal length, etc., affect the pictures that you take. The author's points are clearly illustrated with many helpful photos.The manual that ships with the N60 is a good one, but this book tells you all kinds of things that the manual does not -- such as the way the various &quot;program modes&quot; interact with the flash, and other useful bits of knowledge.The structure of the book and the author's style make this an excellent guide for photographers of all skill levels. Professional photographers can skip the the sections on the basics of photography, and concentrate on the explanations of the camera's features.All in all, this book finds a good balance between teaching you the specifics of using your N60 and the broader aspects of being a good photographer in general."},{"Title":"Magic Lantern Guides: Nikon N60","review":"I bought this book beacause I dont have the manual of my second hand camera.

The two cameras are similar, and since Magic Lantern hasn't written a book on the N-65, this is the most useful reference for the N-65 currently available.The book gives clear explanation of the functions of the N-60, and how to make use of them.

Senneth is a terrific character, someone independent and headstrong along the lines of Rachel in the first Archangel book, but without the aggressively stubborn streak. Senneth is a natural leader, and the cast of supporting characters are additionally intriguing. this is well worth the read, and while it's not the best book of hers i've read, amazon won't let me give it 4.5 stars and i *did* love it."},{"Title":"Mystic and Rider (The Twelve Houses, Book 1)","review":"'Mystic and Rider', by Sharon Shinn. I am not sure what led me to picking up this book, maybe something in the title caught my imagination, or perhaps it was the front cover image, which has a strangely compelling feeling of mystery to it, or maybe it was just blind luck on my part. However that may be, I am very glad that it caught my eye. From the moment I opened the cover and read the first few lines, I was hooked and could not put it down until I had read the very last lines.In 'Mystic and Rider', the mysterious and powerful female mystic, Senneth, takes up a mission for the aging King of Gillengaria. She is joined by a small band of individuals that not only each have their own diverse talents, but are also a strange mix of companions. An aristocratic shapshifter and her servant, who shares in this talent, two members of the elite guard known as King's Riders, a young, very gifted empath, and a wild, and dangerous creature. Their mission, which sounds at first relatively simple, is made increasingly more difficult, as they travel among the southern houses of the Kingdom, gaging the sentiment of the land, seeking for any signs of discontent among these southern nobles.Shinn has created characters that jump off of the page and come to life so very easily, amid a world that is different, and yet so close to our own in certain basic ways. She takes the themes of power, and friendship, distrust, and romantic love, and blends them together into a most powerful and dynamic story set amid a world that is on the brink of plunging into chaotic war and rebellion. The magical system of Gillengaria, as well as its political, social, and religious structure are wonderfully complexe and interwoven, and surperbly explained through the story, all of these elements being very crucial to the storyline, not just added on like decoration, or as an after thought.'Mystic and Rider' is a book that I highly recomend for any lover of fantasy tales, or even the casual fantasy reader who enjoys a good romance with an unusual setting.RD Williams, Author of'The Lost Gate'"},{"Title":"Mystic and Rider (The Twelve Houses, Book 1)","review":"This is the first volume of a new Shinn fantasy series. Typical of her work, lots of characterization, strong female characters, and the hero is NOT an all powerful, all knowing superhero, they (she) is all together human, with flaws. Story takes place in a fantasy world, where magic can be performed by a small minority (called Mystics), with a growing movement of an \\"anti-magic\\" religous order. Very roughly kinda of Kurtz Deryni world, but less development on history and culture and a much greater dependance development of individual characters."},{"Title":"Mystic and Rider (The Twelve Houses, Book 1)","review":"I begin reading Shinn the year she came out with Archangel and she has not disappointed me, yet. Her worlds are intriguing and fanciful. Her characters are realistic and she seems to get better and better with each book.Shinn creates another new world with Mystic and Rider. In this world, the people fear, even hate anyone with magical abilties to the point of murdering whole families. The king has sent out a few of his most trusted to guage the temperment of his kingdom. The person to lead the small band is Senneth (a mystic with astonding abilities). With her is a daughter of a wealthy and royal linked family (also a mystic) and her companion. For protection the king had assigned two of his royal guards (called Riders). Everyone in the kingdom fears the Riders because of their incredible fighting abilities. But even this group is weary and uncertain of each other.In this book, the reader follows along with the band of unlikely friends as they travel throughout the kingdom witnessing atrocity after atrocity and doing what they can to make a difference. Throughout it all, they grow in friendship and become more to each other than they ever expected. The story is definitely not finished here with this book and I'm anxious to see where Shinn will take it next.Very much worth your time."},{"Title":"Mystic and Rider (The Twelve Houses, Book 1)","review":"Mystic and Rider is a fantasy romance. The title tells it all: There's a mystic, and a rider, and they have a boy-meets-girl story set in a fantasy milieu. In fact, the title's a bit of a spoiler, because once the mystic and the rider had been introduced, and they had negative chemistry, I knew how it was going to work out.Senneth has the magic of the Pale Mother, or moon goddess. She is also a rough and ready fighter who happens to have been born to a noble house. Tayse is a King's Rider, an elite group of soldiers sworn to the king. He's mistrustful of magic in general and Senneth in particular. Throw in a religious-political movement that reviles the mystics and a north-south divide, and you have a diverting but formulaic fantasy romance. Unfortunately both the fantasy and the romance elements are uninventive. Freshness in either one would have made the book a lot better. I would recommend this book for a plane trip or another time when you can't get your hands on anything else. There are sequels, but I really can't be bothered (unless I'm trapped in an airport once more)."},{"Title":"Mystic and Rider (The Twelve Houses, Book 1)","review":"King Baryn orders the mystic Senneth to journey through the realm of Gillengaria to find out how the nobles feel about his rule because rumors persist that the aristocracy is unhappy. Accompanying Senneth is Riders( soldiers loyal to the king) Tayse and Justin and Mystics Kira and Donnal. Along the way they pick up Cammon, an indentured servant who isn't even aware he's a mystic until Senneth shows him how to use his powers.The journey is fraught with danger as a cult, the Daughter of the Pale Mother, headed by Conralinda Gisselness has amassed a large following of women who declare that Mystics are evil and must be destroyed. She whips the populace into a frenzy and has her soldiers kill the Mystics wherever they find them. Senneth and company also learn that several heads of the twelve houses are worried about the succession since the king has only a rarely seen daughter. Rumors that his queen is a mystic also upsets the people who think those who wield magic are evil. Civil war on a religious and politic front seems inevitable.Sharon Shinn demonstrates her amazing writing talent in MYSTIC AND RIDER the first installment in a great new fantasy series. Senneth risks her life to save a baby from its grandfather who wants it dead because the infant was born with mystical powers. Readers will adore this vulnerable heroine who is one of the strongest mages in the land and is completely devoted to the king. Riding through the realm, the riders and the mystics observe how much the common folks detest those with magic even killing their own children. The world of Gillengaria is so realistically portrayed; readers will be convinced that this world actually exists.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Mystic and Rider (The Twelve Houses, Book 1)","review":"Wow! For those who live for transportingly exquisite fantasy, this book, and this author, are real treasures. I loved this tale, which is the 6th Sharon Shinn book I have read. And though that leaves 8 others still to enjoy, her works are curiously absent from and practically unknown in local libraries and bookshops. Called \\"A Novel of the Twelve Houses\\", this book is the first of that series, and I will delightedly reread it for sheer pleasure, as well as to refresh my memory, when the next book is published.For a quick plot line that doesn't do the story justice, this book recounts a journey of a band of 6 (2 King's Riders, 4 various others with a variety of magical gifts) to search out and define the vague sense of unrest and mutiny that seems to be growing in the kingdom.From the start the characters are interesting; their temperaments and personalities expand as they become better acquainted and face the difficulties of their task. The setting is the island kingdom of Gillengaria, similar enough to our past world to feel comfortable and familiar, yet with twists of novelty and magic that entice and amaze. The plots, like the players, grow and crystallize into little gems with many facets and sparkling depths. None of this could be achieved without great skill in language that conjures visions and stirs affections. The music of the place names and characters is of nearly mythic tone: Serramarra Kirra of Danalustrous, Lumanen Convent, home to the cult of the Pale Lady, Senneth, mystic to King Beryn of Gillengaria, the wild raelynx from the Lirrenlands. And the images are hauntingly clear in the mind's eye; I have an indelible memory of the final portrait of Senneth, dressed in a white lace gown of a straight, tight fit, with her short white-blonde hair floating in the evening breeze, illuminated by moon light, appearing as a candle aflame. Simply put, this is a book full of wonder and delicious imagination."},{"Title":"Mystic and Rider (The Twelve Houses, Book 1)","review":"I found the book difficult to finish because there is very little action or humour. It is told from a woman's perspective and the story never moves beyond the predictable. There is no thief or trickster amongst the companions to add colour to the story.

Magic, mayhem, romance, sword fights, a little something for everyone."},{"Title":"Mystic and Rider (The Twelve Houses, Book 1)","review":"This is a so-so book, although Shinn's writing is fluid and easy to read. The characters are engaging, and I cared what happened to them. The backstory of the world was mildly interesting, although Shinn could have invested a bit more there.The magic system felt weak to me. It isn't clear (for example) what keeps \\"shiftlings\\" from simply transforming the enemies weapons into something harmless, or for that matter the \\"moonstones\\" into something harmless. (To be fair, I think a sympathetic reader can overlook things like these, but it would be nice to get some kind of explanation into the text.)The relationships between lords and their vassals seem highly idealized and not very plausible for an agrarian economy. Shinn has transported twentieth century ideas into a (nominally) medieval setting in a manner all-too-familiar in the fantasy genre.Nor is the story particularly interesting. We start out with a quest to find out the state of the southern provinces. We learn quickly that the state is \\"not good\\", and the rest of the book basically confirms that without adding much. The real story is the changing relationship between the characters. This is fairly well done, but the result is essentially a fantasy romance with a weak plot.Despite all that, I enjoyed it, but... there isn't much to think about when the book is done. I struggled with how many stars to give, because I enjoy Shinn's writing, but I don't think I can justify more than three."},{"Title":"Mystic and Rider (The Twelve Houses, Book 1)","review":"First book in the Twelve Houses Series; well done with believable characters and a good story line."},{"Title":"Mystic and Rider (The Twelve Houses, Book 1)","review":"While not as original as Shinn's popular Archangel trilogy, this first of four in the Twelve Houses series, set in the land of Gillengaria, is tailor-made for the growing audience of fantasy fans who like a good juicy romance. Elderly King Baryn sits on a shaky throne, wed to a strange childless queen, and hides his only heir, a daughter. To investigate rumors that Gillengaria's southern noble houses are plotting revolt and fostering a pogrom against mystics born with supernatural powers, Baryn sends out five diverse individuals: Senneth, a female mystic who commands fire; Kirra, an aristocratic healer and shape-changer; Kirra's shape-shifting servant, Donnal; and Tayse and Justin, two elite King's Riders deeply distrustful of mystics. After rescuing the boy Cammon (an orphan empath) and a raelynx (a savage cat), the party undergoes increasingly perilous adventures while a disturbing attraction between Senneth and Tayse builds into profound and forbidden love. Shinn's spellbinding characterizations, especially that of the hard-bitten Tayse, who loses his heart to the powerful yet vulnerable Senneth, animate this familiar parade of shifting political alliances and disparate adventurers who gradually bond. Shinn's complicated pantheon of gods fallen mostly into disregard, a plethora of unsolved puzzles and ample promise of her characters' lives \\"changed by love\\" in future installments make for a rich beginning.

This book covers the journey of a rather strained party of travelers, four magically-gifted \\"mystics\\" and two King's riders who are assigned to protect them, as they move through the kingdom, trying to discern if rebellion or other issues are surfacing.The book is definitely predictable. I had figured out several key plot devices well before the major characters did. It is also derivative: other authors have covered the \\"hate and fear magicians\\" topic before. However, I am still giving it five stars, because the plot is enjoyable, the characters are believable and interesting, and the world-building is great. I especially enjoyed that both Tayse and Sennath are very strong, but also very vulnerable at the same time. The villains are dangerous, irritating, and fanatical, but very believable. I also enjoyed watching the gradual evolution of the characters and their relationships with each another. I'm definitely looking forward to the next installment."},{"Title":"Mystic and Rider (The Twelve Houses, Book 1)","review":"I'm opting to give this book four stars, simply because the ending was satisfying and I did enjoy reading it. There were some flaws though that irritated me throughout the way, and I was very disappointed in Shinn's writing style (her Archangel series seems to be very popular, and although I haven't read it, from the way I've seen her work described I expected better).First off, it was very predictable. Not in the just-like-every-other-fantasy sense, although it wasn't anything terribly new, but I often found myself rolling my eyes since it would be obvious what happened next. I got the sense of just being strung along on a series of mediocre adventures with all obvious outcomes.It took me about halfway through the book to actually bond with some of the characters, and it was not even close to the bonds I've felt with characters from other books (maybe its a problem, but I can really grow attached to a character if they're written right). I'm sure your meant to, since there are situations meant for just a thing, but it just doesn't work. For example, Tayse (the hero) stops talking to Senneth (the heroine) for ridiculous reasons. I understood why, in a sense, but I felt like I was missing a whole lot to make me actually relate to him. I get the feeling that Shinn was grasping at straws to create conflict between her main characters.Despite all that, I was relatively happy closing this book. The loose ends were tied up fairly well considering this is the first book in the series, and I'll be able to wait patiently for the next book to come out. But maybe that isn't such a good thing, since some of the best books I've read keep me aching for the next chapter. I recommend this book as a light read, and if you go into it with few expectations I'm sure you'll enjoy it. It is definetly not a bad book, but it simply lacks what I want out of epic romantic fantasy. But who knows? This is just the beginning."},{"Title":"Mystic and Rider (The Twelve Houses, Book 1)","review":"Mystic and Rider is the first in a series of fantasy novels staring a group of friends who are lead by Senneth a woman with mystical powers. Her team is composed of three other mystics and two soldiers. They are on a quest to discover the feelings of the people in the kingdom. On the way they encounter several traitors and a wild creature called a raelynx. I listened to the audio edition of this novel and found had potential but felt it lacked edginess and depth.I like a bit more... Edge in my fantasy. Senneth and her group never felt quite real. There was no sexual tension, no edge, and certainly very little grit. Even when Senneth is injured this occured off stage. The relationships are all pretty chaste, almost like a young adult novel. Senneth loves Tayse, Donal loves Kira, etc, but they don't do anything other than get mad when they feel ignored/slighted or yearn very subtlely for each other.Thus, listening to this story, it took me a long time to feel anything for these characters. I also felt the male characters were poorly described. For instance I know that Kira's hair is gold, and Senneth's is White, and what the ladies are wearing, but the guys are usually just described as dark. We learn towards the end that Donal is bearded, but by then, I had created an image of him in my own head, and it did not include a beard.I think this was an ok effort. The author is capable of more, and I would've liked to see her ditch the Raelynx who was a bit annoying after awhile. Also Cammon (sp) grated on my nerves. I think this could be improved by maturing the series a bit and adding a bit more grit. I don't need every gory detail, but surely in a group of two women and four eligble guys there is more going on than playing cards and being bland. I want action! Hurt feelings! A coarse joke or two, something to make me feel these characters are less Ken and Barbie and more real."},{"Title":"Mystic and Rider (The Twelve Houses, Book 1)","review":"Mystic and Rider (2005) is the first Fantasy novel in The Twelve Houses series. Gillengaria is ruled by a king, but the Marlords of the Twelve Houses control most of the land and commerce. If the king dies without heirs, a new king will be chosen from the Twelve Houses.Mystics in Gillengaria have various talents and are often distrusted and even hated due to these unusual abilities. Senneth is a mystic, but different from all others whom she knows. She can control fire, bathing herself in it if she wishes, a daughter of the sun goddess.Senneth is sometimes called the King's Mystic since she started doing missions for him. This time she has other mystics with her, Kirra and Donnal, who are shapeshifters, and Cammon, who is a sensitive. She is also accompanied by two King's Riders, who do not trust her at first.In this novel, Senneth's party takes a side excursion into Dormas to free Cammon from indenture. His family had been overseas when his father died. He and his mother took ship to return to Gillengaria, but she died enroute. The ship's captain sold him to a tavern keeper to pay for their passage.Once freed and escorted safely away from the town, Senneth starts teaching Cammon ways to use his mystical abilities. He begins to notice that he can perceive things without the use of his normal senses. Although Senneth has duties to perform at the present, she decides to introduce Cammon to some of her sensitive friends as soon as possible.In a small town, the group discovers a strange phenomenon. Something is killing small animals and even a child and a passed out drunk. Senneth recognizes something familiar in the situation. After gathering more information, she decides that the killer is a raelynx, a wild cat from the Lirrenlands. Senneth sets out at night and lures the raelynx to her and then controls its mind and body. Despite a few protests, Senneth takes the raelynx with them on their mission, much like she included Cammon in the group.In this story, Senneth is the nominal leader of the group, but encourages the others to contribute their ideas. Although it is her mission, Tayse is the actual leader for daily affairs and defensive decisions. In a sense, Senneth is the strategist and Tayse is the tactician.Senneth and Tayse have to work together rather frequently and closely. Since she is not a King's Rider, Tayse doesn't trust her, but he beginning to have less distrust. Justin, the other Rider, also begins to respect her ability and judgment.The group finds numerous indications of hatred toward mystics, from social disapproval to outright murder. The further south they travel, the worst the situation looks. They begin to hear more and more about the Daughters of the Pale Mother and their preaching against mystics. They also hear about the soldiers following the Pale Mother. Moreover, the southern Houses are beginning to expand their household troops.Senneth and Kirra occasionally meet with the Marlords and discuss their views on mystics and the king. They find that the southern nobles are angry over the potential succession problem of the kingdom. King Baryn has only one daughter, Amalie, and she has been secluded for several years. Amalie's mother had died fairly recently and the King remarried shortly thereafter; some rumors said that the new Queen is a mystic.Senneth is determined to push on to Gisseltess lands before she returns to Ghosenhall, the royal capital. The others suggest that she turn back sooner, but she is the mission leader and they follow her. Even when they encounter armed bands searching for them, they follow her. Even when Tayse is captured by hostile soldiers, they follow her. By this time, they have become a close-knit team and she is the leader.Highly recommended for Shinn fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of magical talents, close combat, social encounters and a bit of romance.-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"Mystic and Rider (The Twelve Houses, Book 1)","review":"A party of very disparate people are roaming the kingdom on a mission for the King. Two of them are King's Riders, legendary warriors totally loyal to the King, and three are Mystics, magic users who are tolerated in the capital, but are looked at with suspicion by many, particularly in the southern kingdom, where the party is finding rumors of discontent and possible civil war and treachery. The leader of the party is Senneth, a woman with a mysterious past who is a powerful Mystic who can control fire and work some other kinds of magic, and who has the ear of the King, much to the consternation of the two distrustful Riders. With her is Kirra, a beautiful young noblewoman, who is also a Mystic, but protected by her powerful father who leads one of the Twelve Houses of the Kingdom. She is a shapeshifter, and so is the fifth person, a male servant/guard/companion, who is also a shape-changer. Despite their clashing personalities, they have a similar goal--to serve the king--and they work surprisingly well together, at the start, picking up a sixth member--a boy who is a Mystic. Senneth seems to have a heart for gathering strays, so he joins their group, saved from a life of servitude and danger as a lone Mystic. As their adventures continue, they gradually bond--very gradually! But that's part of the fun. They face a powerful noblewoman who has founded a fanatical religious order that is intent on wiping out Mystics, and her brother, a treacherous nobleman who blatantly schemes to take the crown. Along the way the party gets to know each other... even Senneth gradually has to give up her deepest secrets. I enjoyed seeing this odd party clash and bond. Their adventures weren't earth-shatteringly unique, but the world and the magic is interesting and looks to be a great place for more adventures that I'll happily follow."},{"Title":"Mystic and Rider (The Twelve Houses, Book 1)","review":"I enjoyed the book very much, and found the characters intriguing and charming, but the plot really was pretty episodic. The reason seemed to be the necessity of introducing a setting that would serve over several books' length of series.So the excuse was that we'd go meet each leader of 12 houses (I think we only made it through half of them, so the other half are probably in book 2), and the king, and the bad guys.I like almost all Shinn's books that I've read, and find her writing style is appealingly warm. Like Senneth in the book, it spreads warmth everywhere but is hesitant to catch fire -- lest it do some damage. I think the character of Senneth is a good metaphor for how Shinn is as a writer. She always has the ability to burn everything down, or kill, but she really does not want to.This means the scale of happenings in the book is mild. I prefer that, but others might miss torture, murder, sadism, or the like. There are fanatics and there are 'bad guys' but overall, they aren't melodramatically bad.I like Shinn's tendency to romance plots, too. I didn't actually expect one in this book, though why, given that she always has them, I have no idea. But about halfway it became clear that it was a romance plot and all the better, the travelogue was getting a bit boring by then and I'd already figured out the characters' secrets.If you have a soft spot in your heart and would rather not be a killer, rather adopt a man-eating mountain lion than shoot it, and rather risk your ex starting a war over you than kill him in self defense, this is the book for you. If a character like that would make an appealing heroine to you, likewise. :)"},{"Title":"Mystic and Rider (The Twelve Houses, Book 1)","review":"There is unrest in Gillengaria as whispers begin of some houses possibly rising up in rebellion to wrest control from an old king. Added to this is the presence of Mystics in the realm. Men and women with magical power. For years they have lived side by side unremarkably with their non-mystical brethren. But lately, distrust of the Mystics has flared up. A new cult built around a Moon Goddess has made a policy of hunting down and killing mystics and the distrust is beginning to spread among the common folk.King Baryn has decided to send one of his most trusted advisors, Senneth, on a journey to the Southern houses to see how deep the unrest really is. Senneth is a powerful mystic with a colorful and mysterious past. Joining her are two King's Riders, his most fearsome,loyal and elite Guard, Tayse and Justin. Also two other Mystics, Kirra Dannaloustrous, the high born petted daughter of one the wealthiest Houses and her Servant Donnal. Both of them are shape shifters. And along the way they pick up Cammon, a young mystic with the ability to \\"read\\" people. This group of six Mystic and Riders head out on a journey that is full of danger and surprise and, yes, even a little romance.I picked up this book on a whim because the cover was so bright. Really, it is a bright yellow/orange with a picture of Senneth on it making fire with her fingertips. I had read Sharon Shinn's stuff before so I was reasonably sure it's be a nice read. I was not disappointed. At it's most basic, this is a kind of introduction to Gillengaria. We learn about it's land, it's people, it's customs etc. As this is the first of a four book series, there is quite a bit of exposition, but it isn't done in a boring way. Shinn manages to reveal what she needs to in an organic and often exciting way. And it is, importantly, an introduction to the six characters who make up the center of this and the remaining three books.In the beginning the six characters are a disparate band put together by their king for a fact finding mission. Tayse and Justin are a unit. Loyal to their King they will do whatever he tells them, but they distrust the Mystics. Justin hates the nobility and therefore despises Kirra. Donnal is fiercely loyal to Kirra only. Cammon is a johnny-come-lately and is positioned as the tag along an is unsure of his place in the group. Senneth is the leader of the group (much to Tayse's displeasure) and is set apart. She is aloof and very mysterious and has the Kings' complete trust. This fractured band somewhat testily and uncomfortably undertake to spend months together.But over the course of the book, there is a slow coming together -- a gelling. The group begin to see each other's strengths and learn about each other's pasts. Because they also encounter peril on their journey they learn to fight at each other's backs and trust each other. The author does a really nice job of making this happen in an uncontrived, yet noticeable way.And truly, this is Senneth's story. She is the enigmatic center of the group that they (an we the reader) want to know all about. Of all the things learned on the journey, Senneth's story is easily the best and most fascinating. I really liked spending time with this group. I look forward to seeing what else they have in store for us."},{"Title":"Mystic and Rider (The Twelve Houses, Book 1)","review":"The first novel in the series of the Twelve Houses, this is the story of a scouting party who has been sent out into the towns and villages to test the feelings in regards to Mystics. The king needs to know the truth, but he understands the dangers involved, so he sends two of his Riders to accompany the motley group of mystics on their journey. Feelings run high, and trust isn't easily given. Senneth is a mystery to many of the players in the group, but she is the one whom the king charged with the journey, so the Riders, Justin and Tayse, must put aside their feelings of distrust in mystics to complete their charge. As the group travels on, adding members to their already unusual group, situations cause some re-evaluations and self-reflection of personal feelings. This is a great story, with a lot of players but not too many, well-written. It was a difficult book to put down. I look forward to the next - The Thirteenth House."},{"Title":"Mystic and Rider (The Twelve Houses, Book 1)","review":"I came to this book with fairly high expectations, having read and enjoyed Shinn's novels The Shapeshifter's Wife and Summers at Castle Auburn. I found it to be a decent read, but rather jarring all the way through. The characters are likeable enough, but they seem to blab out all their backstory in an unrealistic way -- although Senneth holds back a few details of her past early on, they seem to pop out more because the plot needs some picking up rather than because it's warranted by what's going on with her psychologically. The setting is really underdeveloped. There is slight description of the landscape they're riding through but it never feels very real. When they stay in an inn it feels like the Marriott -- they're in connecting rooms! Each of the plot twists gets resolved very quickly without any tension ever building up -- I never felt the characters were actually in danger (and of course they have to stay alive and undamaged for further adventures in successive books, don't they?). Towards the end the romance finally gets resolved and the two characters who've been falling in love throughout the book get together, but there aren't any fireworks by this point. The writing was not bad but not terrific either -- I found myself doing line edits in my head as I read, and I'm sure Shinn can do better than the standard of prose in this novel, based on her other books I've read. My overall impression was that she rushed through this book, perhaps for economic reasons (looking at her books for sale on amazon she seems to be writing two series at the same time, one for adults and one for young adults). If I didn't have anything else to read, I'd pick up her next book to while away the time, but really there are far too many other fantasy novels out there for me to spend time on the rest of this series."},{"Title":"Mystic and Rider (The Twelve Houses, Book 1)","review":"Like a mystified and riderless horse, Sharon Shinn's fantasy novel \\"Mystic & Rider\\" gallops to the point of fatigue and frustration. This conclusion is especially unfortunate in light of the excellent opening chapter. But buyer beware: the tension and excitement rarely increase from that point, and the last of the 440 pages brings us little closer to some kind of resolution or revelation than the first. Rather, the *entire* novel is simply a prologue for the rest of the series.The novel's plot is perfectly plain. A band of adventurers is dispatched by the king to investigate troubling rumors in the southern provinces. Shinn's writing is usually transparent and, in some places, strikingly good. Her characters are likable if on the bland side, and the magic system is passable. (Some people are born as \\"mystics\\" with useful, though usually minor, powers--not unlike mutants in the X-Men comics.) But neither the writing nor characterization overcome the lack of focus and tension in the story itself. To elaborate (and not be thought unfair), I'll discuss my specific problems with the story after the next two paragraphs. Please stop there to avoid spoilers.In sum, I really liked the first chapter or so, and Shinn's writing kept me chasing this riderless horse of a novel until the unsatisfying end. It may be that, now that the set-up for the fantasy kingdom is complete, this turns out to be a wonderful series (because this could have been a great book with a stronger plot and focus). However, I'll wait and see before spending any more time or money on the chase.Recommended as a library loan for die-hard readers of fantasy. Two-and-a-half disappointing stars.*SPOILER ALERT* (PLOT DETAILS INCLUDED)*Most genre novels follow a pattern of rising action, climax and resolution. (The Fellowship journeys toward Mordor; it splits and the situation darkens as Frodo struggles toward Mount Doom; the characters reunite in the aftermath, and loose ends are bound.) I'm all for creativity, change, and other advancements of genius that limit cookie-cutter tales; however, there's a reason why the pattern of rising action is the standard: it makes good stories; it's logical; it works.*By contrast, Mystic is entirely episodic. On the plus side, I've never read a fantasy novel with this wandering feel before. On the minus side, I realize there's a reason why. (See above.) What you have here is a company setting out with a goal, yes, but an unfocused one: see what's out there and gather information. So there's no tension or increasingly difficult series of obstacles or increasing political or relational entanglements. Rather, the company meets a different problem in each spot along the way. A series of episodes results, and the chapter titles could be listed accordingly: They rescue a mystic boy from slavery. They find slain mystics. They endure a snowstorm. They save a village from a strange predator. They help deliver a mystic baby. And so on--and the tension never intensifies because it's as if they're not staying in the same story.*What's even more maddening: early on, they've mostly gathered the information the king will need. However, they just keep wandering in and out of trouble, just to get a bit more. They meet two potentially interesting villains along the way, but just as quickly, they leave them behind .... (Nor do they consider sending someone to report back to the king in case the others are killed or captured. Also, their rescue of Tayse from the convent was absurdly easy: (1) the leader trots out her defenseless novices to meet this dangerous company, instead of surrounding them with armed soldiers; (2) a raelynx can dodge whole volleys of missiles?; (3) why not shoot the companions instead of the raelynx? Better yet, use some foresight and cunning and hurl glass globes of powdered moonstone at their mystics to disable them.)*As a final note, the main character, Senneth, is decent: a powerful mystic (with a mysterious past, of course) who is also a competent swordswoman. However, how can the reader even begin to worry about her or the others when, time and again, she's described as the most powerful mystic in the world? In fact, no one even comes close to her--she can even burn down cities! A good person to travel with but, unfortunately, not necessarily to read about."},{"Title":"Mystic and Rider (The Twelve Houses, Book 1)","review":"I was very disappointed in this book and could not finish it. Shinn's angel books are so much better."},{"Title":"Mystic and Rider (The Twelve Houses, Book 1)","review":"So I quit reading.

Some of her books have been quite enjoyable and others have been eye-rollingly silly. I really enjoyed Mystic and Rider, and found it to be one of the most interesting reads I have had in a while.The caveat to this is that I am extremely character driven- as a life long fantasy/sci-fi reader I find that for the most part the plots have all been explored to a certain extent, what sets a novel apart is the characters. And I found the characters in M&R; to be very interesting and engaging. Senneth was a wonderful character set in a team of engaging and interesting people that really made the story come alive.

And I can't really say why I liked this book either except maybe for the \\"hero\\" of the story, Tayse. And really he is almost a Jungian Archetype of the dark stoic sword wielding hero. Unfortunately I absolutely love that Archetype so I devoured the book in a single evening. And so since the book mainly revolved around him and his love interest, who was an appealing character herself, I thought it was a pretty good story. Still I had this nagging feeling that I have read this story before. It is not exactly a cookie cutter sword and sorcery book; however, if you read a lot of sword and sorcery books you will find your self with a weird since of deja vu.

Shinn develops a great central character and combines prejudice with magic as the figure head for trouble. I loved the tension created as a civil war brews under the guise of good vs. evil. The evil being anyone with magic. It reminds me a lot of the Deryni books by Katherine Kurtz.

I hate to admit to the fact that I first read these books over 45 years ago. I sat down and read them again. I was as delighted this time as I was when I was fifteen. This is fiction from an era we will not see again. This is the stuff little boys dream of! Read it, savor it and enjoy it! I cannot recommend this one high enough."},{"Title":"The Gods of Mars","review":"I just finished rereading this remarkable adventure story, and must say, some of the capsule summaries above leave a bit to be desired.Yes, John Carter returns to Mars after 10 years absence, and finds himself in a paradise. But ironically, it's a paradise that soon turns into a kind of violent warring hell. The plant men are only the beginning. The bitterest enemies are a race of almost diabolical priests, the Tharns, who set loose white apes and plant men to slaughter thousands of religious pilgrims. I'm not spoiling the plot at all, since this becomes clear in the first two or three chapters.Again, there's a deep bond between the hero, John Carter, and a brave and stunning young woman named Thuvia. John Carter, a warlord, is not content to merely escape. He must somehow end this evil empire of hypocritical priests and mass slaughter.One fine element is the reintroduction of the green warrior chieftan, John's dear friend from the first novel in the series.There are strains of deeper thought woven throughout. For example, the biting satire against mindless &quot;fanatic&quot; religions.Heck of a book. Burroughs writes in a style that would seem a bit heavy today. But after a chapter or two, the reader usually can get in the stride. These books read fast-- you can't put them down. The heroines are GORGEOUS-- but the language is &quot;clean&quot; and the books can be recommended for teens. The description-- often in battle scenes-- is up to anything written in adventure science fiction today. This book was written-- amazingly-- in about 1917."},{"Title":"The Gods of Mars","review":"This book, #2 of 11 in Burroughs' John Carter series, is a direct sequel to the classic \\"A Princess of Mars,\\" and a reading of that earlier volume is fairly essential before going into this one. \\"Gods...\\" was first published in serial form in \\"All-Story Magazine\\" in 1913, and comprises one of Burroughs' earliest works. It is amazing how much action the author manages to cram into the book's 190 pages; on just about EVERY page there is some kind of incredible happening or colorful bit. The book really is hard to put down, and yet, at the same time, the end of just about every paragraph could serve as a cliffhanger! The pace of the book is brisk and relentless, and really carries the reader along to another great cliffhanger at the conclusion. In this volume, our hero, John Carter, returns to Barsoom after a decade's absence, and goes to that planet's \\"heaven.\\" But heaven turns out to be anything but, and our man gets caught up in battles with plant men and white apes, lost civilizations, religious taboos, the plots of an evil \\"goddess,\\" duels in the arena and on and on. There are two action set pieces that Burroughs really puts over well. One is the slave revolt that takes place halfway through the tale; the other, a bravura, four-way air battle between the forces of the black, white, red and green men of Barsoom. Both of these sections are thrilling in the extreme; better than anything in the first Barsoom novel. It's also nice that Carter, an Earthman on Mars, fights alongside men and women of varied races, colors, and religious beliefs in a common cause; there's some kind of message there--one for tolerance and brotherhood--that we could all avail ourselves of today.Having said all this, however, I must admit that there are problems in this novel that prevent me from giving it a top grade. These problems mainly take the form of fuzzy writing and internal inconsistencies. Burroughs, in this novel, does not do well in describing geography; his depictions of the Valley of the Therns, for example, are almost impossible to visualize (for me, anyway). A map of this planet (such as the one provided in LeGuin's Earthsea books) would have greatly helped, given Burroughs' inability to clearly set out his world. As for the inconsistencies: Burroughs, the \\"editor\\" of the novel, says he first read Carter's manuscript (for Book #1) 12 years previously; but if he had really obeyed Carter's will (that the manuscript not be opened for 11 years), then he would have only first seen the text of \\"A Princess of Mars\\" ONE year before! Tars Tarkas is said to be grieving over his kidnapped daughter in one section of this book; then, a few scenes later, he learns of this kidnapping for the first time. Huh?!?! The scene with Carter on the black-pirate cruiser contains many inconsistencies. Carter is said to be fighting five of these men; he kills three of them, and then three are left. Huh?!?! Six pirates are killed, all told, but later in the book, the number is said to be seven. Carter is said to have killed all these men single-handed, although the Thern princess, Phaidor, had helped him. These pirates are all asleep in the cruiser when Carter comes upon them, although they had been sacking the Thern temple scant minutes before. Does this seem likely? Inconsistencies such as this can drive an alert reader crazy. And don't even get me started on the redundant expressions such as \\"haven of refuge\\" and \\"craven cowards\\" that pop up all the time. Burroughs improved with age, but these early books are rife with problems that a good copyediting should have weeded out. Still, these minor problems are easily overlooked when one is caught up in the sweep of the story, and this story is as exciting as they come. It really is a tremendous feat of imagination, and one that any lover of swashbuckling fantasy should hugely enjoy."},{"Title":"The Gods of Mars","review":"Having introduced the characters in 'A Princess of Mars,' the author gets down to the action, in this the second Martian adventure of John Carter, with, as I recall, a new opponent, ready to fight, on almost every page.The author subtly pokes fun at religion, race and our conventions and rituals regarding them, while writing an exciting adventure story that certainly gripped my imagination in the early sixties.John Carter remains the perfect Virginian gentleman, respecting women, seeking no unfair advantage, while fighting plants, animals and multiple races of Martians. He must struggle to overcome them all, if he is to set free his beloved Dejah Thoris from a nested series of &quot;Heavens within Heavens.&quot;If he wins, will he kill the &quot;Gods of Mars&quot; in the title? What will happen to religion on Mars if he does? If he loses...........An ideal introduction to science fiction and fantasy for boys reaching puberty.

Originally published in 1913 as a serial in &quot;All-Story Magazine,&quot; this story finds John Carter returning to Mars and setting off to find his woman. Knowing that it was originally published as a serial is useful because Burroughs loads on the cliffhangers throughout the novel.

But in reality it's a far cry from heaven and Carter turns a world upside with his challenging revelations.The real hero of the story, however, is Dator Xodar, a prince of the black-skinned First Born of Barsoom, the highest race on the planet. The First Born prey upon the white-skinned Therns, who in turn prey upon the nations of the Red and Yellow men of Barsoom.

In fact I would say this is a step down from A Princess of Mars in general quality. However, A Princess of Mars is, in my opinion, the best story ever written.

Together they fight their way through the Martian &quot;heaven&quot; (which turns out to be a living hell) past giant apes, plant men and false gods. Along the way they meet new people, discover hidden races of &quot;gods,&quot; and find new quests.However, this book fails to reunite John Carter with his wife Dejah Thoris until late in the book (very late in the book). Their relationship was always my favorite part of the original, A Princess of Mars. Naturally, I am a bit disappointed in this. However, I feel that The Gods of Mars holds up better than most sequels--it is fun and exciting, and returns the reader to one of the most interesting worlds ever conceived in all of fiction.

So why is it that when he is presented with something so simple as the &quot;mystery&quot; of the identity of one of the major characters, said identity being so glaringly obvious that the reader has it figured out within a paragraph of the character's introduction, it takes Carter SEVERAL CHAPTERS to figure out who this guy is?This inconsistency (not the only one, I'm afraid), isn't really all that bothersome in and of itself, but it's problematic in that it (sin of sins!) takes the reader out of the story. In a novel like The Gods Of Mars, all you've GOT is story. Anything that takes you out of it is therefore a major flaw.I still enjoyed a lot of The Gods Of Mars, and will probably read The Warlord Of Mars (the next book in the series) if for no other reason than to see how TGOM's cliffhanger ending is resolved (yes, I admit it, I wanna find out). I just hope it's an improvement upon its predecessor."},{"Title":"The Gods of Mars","review":"The Viking lander in the 70's proved there was no life on Mars.

What I find truely amazing about this story is that deals with things such as aerial warfare but was written in 1913 when people were still debating if airplanes could ever have military value.Although the author was looking to the future with life on Mars and flying battleships, his values are anchored in the Victorian era. John Carter looks to fight the good fight, rescue the damsels in distress and still stay true to his princess. He's a think man's Conan and a monogumous James Bond all rolled into one. The plot line takes several unexpected turns and your pulse will be pounding as the story builds towards its climax.The story is written in the flowery prose that were typical of the Victorian era and it takes a little getting used to. As another reviewer mentioned, you just need to slow down, sit back and enjoy this one. It's definately worth it.The copy I had was about a few years old and the binding completely came apart and as I tried to keep the pages in order while reading I felt like I had uncovered a first addition from 1913. Normally, I would not have been to happy about that, but given the situation it just added charachter to the experience.If you pick this book up, make sure you also get a copy of the next book in the series &quot;Warlord of Mars&quot;. Once you finish &quot;Gods of Mars&quot; you'll want to jump right into the next book."},{"Title":"The Gods of Mars","review":"This continuation of the Barsoom series adds two more races of people to Martian life: blacks and whites. Despite being written prior to the civil rights movement in America, I felt E.R. Burroughs handled his depiction of black people remarkably well. He admits that black people are strong and beautiful, though they must ultimately be defeated and subdued by John Carter (like the other races).The hero's emergence as the undisputed ruler of all races through military prowess is still troubling. It is hypocritical for a man to condemn the Martians for their 'might makes right' mentality and call them heartless, and then conquer and pillage their cities.The pacing of action kept me interested throughout the novel, despite E.R. Burroughs' tendency toward verbosity. I rolled my eyes as each Martian declared their undying loyalty for John Carter and every woman swooned at his feet. John Carter was built up to be such a model of perfection that he seemed unreal. He was a super hero and not a real person despite the challenges he faced.Of course I am looking at this novel through modern eyes. Contemporary heroes have been transformed into average people that react in very human ways. It is perhaps unfair to judge this early fantasy character based on modern tastes, but I can't help thinking that John Carter would have been a more complete hero if he had shown some human weakness."},{"Title":"The Gods of Mars","review":"\\"The Gods of Mars\\" is, to me, that rare sequel that is as good as, if not better than, the original story in a series. \\"The Gods of Mars\\" starts with the second death of John Carter on Earth and his subsequent arrival in the Barsoomian \\"paradise\\", the Valley Dor. It chronicles his escape from the Valley Dor and the White Barsoomians, the Therns, and his subsequent capture by the Black Barsoomians, the First Born, and his escape from the Lost Sea of Omean, the home of the First Born.

Well, obviously in a novel named \\"The Gods of Mars,\\" he isn't going to stay on his home planet. But Edgar Rice Burroughs' second Barsoom novel introduces a whole new dilemma for our hero -- how to get back to the world of the living.John Carter returns to Mars, but is shocked to find that he's in a completely unfamiliar part of it, populated by grotesque Plant Men and white apes. After encountering his old friend Tars Tarkas, Carter learns that they are in the Barsoomian afterlife. The problem is, nobody can return from the pilgrimage to the River Iss -- and if anyone tries, they will be killed.But the greatest threat comes from two breeds of Martian that Carter has never seen before -- the Black Martian pirates and the White Martian Therns, both of whom consider themselves to be gods.Anyone who survives the valley is turned into a slave, and Carter soon makes new allies among his fellow captives. But even if he can escape the grasp of the \\"goddess\\" Issus, he may not be able to survive in a world where escaping from \\"death\\" is blasphemy -- especially when he finds that Dejah Thoris may be doomed as well.\\"The Gods of Mars\\" is a much faster-moving story than the first Barsoom book, even though we're introduced to a whole new part of Mars and two new Martian species. Burroughs just plunges right into the main story right away, and it's a long time before he stops to contemplate the flora/fauna/customs of the Martians.Burroughs' prose is also more polished in this story, with longer action scenes and a faster pace -- as well as some moments that are absolutely horrifying (the plant men, with their corpselike skin, ragged noses and wormy hair). And while he still has the slight stuffiness of early 20th-century pulp, he injects a lot of vivid descriptions and action into the story.John Carter is still a bit on the Stuey side -- multiple women are in love with him by the story's end, for instance. But he's still a very strong character, with lots of guts and courage. Burroughs throws a rather unexpected twist into the story when Carter discovers that one of his fellow captives is actually related to him; and he also introduces some other interesting characters, such as the malignant Issus and the strong, proud Thuvia.\\"The Gods of Mars\\" is one of the few sequels that is actually markedly better than the original book. But be warned: it leaves you dangling on a cliffhanger that will leave you scrabbling for the third book."},{"Title":"The Gods of Mars","review":"The Gods of Mars+++++++++ caution contains what some might construe as spoilers++++++++++The Gods of Mars is the second book of the John Carter series followingA Princess of MarsThe Warlord Of Mars.In this book after John Carter's arrival, a boat of Green Martians arrive on the River Iss and are ambushed by the previously unknown Plant Men. The lone survivor is his friend Tars Tarkas, the Jeddak of Thark, who has taken the pilgrimage to the Valley Dor to find Carter.Carter and Tars Tarkas discover that the Therns, rulers of Valley Dor, a white-skinned race of self-proclaimed gods, have for eons deceived the Barsoomians of the outer world by disseminating the myth that the pilgrimage to the Valley Dor is a journey to paradise. Most arrivals are killed by the beasts of Valley, the survivors enslaved by Therns.Carter and Tars Tarkas rescue Thuvia, a slave girl, and attempt to escape, capitalizing on the confusion caused by an attack by the Black Pirates of Barsoom upon the Therns. They are separated during the attack: Tars Tarkas and Thuvia hijack a Black Pirate flier, while Carter fights his way aboard another, killing all but one of the Pirates, and rescuing a captive Thern princess.Carter, talking with the captured Pirate Xodar, discovers that the Black Pirates, called the \\"First Born\\", also think of themselves as gods, and prey upon the Therns as the Therns prey upon others. He, also, discovers that the captive Thern is Phaidor, daughter of the \\"Holy Hekkador\\" (high priest) of the Therns. When their flier is recaptured by the First Born, they are taken to their land, built around the underground sea of Omean, below the lost sea of Korus and the Valley Dor. Both are located at the South Pole of Barsoom.Once there, Carter is taken before Issus, the goddess of Barsoom; an ancient, evil woman who has manipulated her own people and the rest of Barsoom into maintaining a hierarchy with the First Born on top. Issus dictates the policies of the Therns through secret communications with them. The Therns, thinking they are receiving divine communications, do not realize that they are duped by their enemies.Issus takes Phaidor into her service as a handmaiden for one Martian year. Carter is imprisoned, with Xodar as his slave as punishment for being defeated by Carter. Thereafter Carter treats him with honor, and thus gains in him a friend. In prison, they meet a young Red Martian captive from Carter's home country of Helium. Soon thereafter, Carter and the youth are taken to the monthly games of Issus.In the games, the handmaidens of a year before are sacrificed, and their bodies will be eaten by Issus and her nobles. Carter leads a revolt of the prisoners, killing many of the First Born. Carter and the youth almost kill Issus before the First Born suppress the revolt. Carter and the youth escape via underground tunnels, and give themselves up to guards unacquainted with the revolt to be returned to their prison island. Upon hearing the story of the revolt, Xodar rejects the notion of Issus' divinity.Carter, Xodar and the youth hijack a flier and escape. Soon after, Carter discovers that the youth is his son, Carthoris. The flier is damaged and must be abandoned in unknown territory. They encounter Thuvia, who describes the capture of Tars Tarkas by the green warriors of Warhoon (a clan rival to his own). Carter goes alone to rescue Tars Tarkas, but is discovered. After a chase, Thuvia is sent on alone mounted while the men attempt a last stand against the Warhoons. They are rescued by the Heliumetic navy; but do not find Thuvia.Commanding one of the warships is Carter's friend Kantos Kan; but the fleet is commanded by Zat Arras, a Jed (chieftain) of the hostile client state of Zodanga, and Carter is suspected of returning from Valley Dor, which is punishable by death. Tardos Mors, the Jeddak of Helium, and Mors Kajak, the Jed of Hastor (the grandfather and father, respectively, of Dejah Thoris, and thus Carter's in-laws) are absent from Helium, having led fleets in search of Carter. Later, Carter discovers that Dejah Thoris is missing, believed to have taken the pilgrimage to the Valley Dor to find him.Upon returning to Helium, Carter is tried for heresy by the Zodangans; but the people of Helium do not tolerate this. To avoid civil war, Carter's judgment is deferred for a year. Sola, the daughter of Tars Tarkas, arrives, having escaped the First Born.Carter realizes that Dejah Thoris will be selected as a handmaiden of Issus, and thus will have only a year to live; wherefore he and his comrades go to rescue her. They uncover evidence that Thern spies are monitoring them, and Carter is kidnapped by the Zodangans. Carter refuses Zat Arras' offer of freedom in exchange for endorsing Zat Arras as Jeddak of Helium, and is imprisoned. After half a year in a dungeon, Carter wins his freedom through a ruse, and the mission to the land of the First Born is launched, with secretly raised troop levies, ships, and many troops lent by Tars Tarkas.Upon approaching the South Pole, a Thern fleet challenges Carter's fleet, and behind Carter's fleet arrive another fleet led Zat Arras. Finally, a fleet of First Born arrives, leaving the rescue mission for Dejah Thoris in jeopardy. Carter encourages the Therns and First Born to fight one another, and the Heliumetic crews of the Zodangan fleet mutiny in support of Carter. Carter then takes his remaining fleet with Tharkian troops to invade the underground sea of Omean.The combined Heliumites and Tharks defeat the First Born, and Issus herself is killed; but Dejah Thoris, Thuvia, and Phaidor, each of whom loves John Carter, are imprisoned in a room of the Temple of the Sun, of whose rooms each opens only once per yearThe Gods of Mars was serialized in five parts in All-Story magazine, the first part published in January 1913 and the final part published in May 1913.

John Carter the Earth born Virginian blood filled man returns back to Mars to claim what is his. None which means more to him than his beautiful Martian Wife. Not all goes well though as Carter returns to Mars, he finds himself in a part of the planet never seen by his own eyes. As a matter of fact the part of Mars he returns to is in fact what many Martians believe to be Paradise. Their own version of Heaven. All who make the journey to this great beyond do it freely, and are never seen again. Should they return from this paradise they find death waiting to be delt out to them by their own friends and family.John Carter finds this Paradise this Heaven to be a lie. A lie that has seeped into the very fabric of every species of Mars culture, belief, and ideas of life and death. So John Carter does what he does best. He test his metal against even the gods of Mars. He destroys royalty, fortress', and the so called Goddess of Mars herself. Shattering all ideas and beliefs of the Martian man, John Carter turns their Heaven, their believed to be \\"great afterlife\\" into a nightmare. John Carter shall open the pits of Hell and make his kingdom out of its fire.Why? For truth, for freedom, for friends, family, and most important Dejah Thoris. Come along on this adventure as Carter finds his son, old allies, and death around every corner at the end of his long sword. None shall cross his path and live.

Its been a long time since I read the first few Tarzan books, but I don't remember his supporting cast being as well drawn as the characters in this book. Tars Tarkas for example--John Carter's four armed, green skinned war chief of a best friend is just amazing. In some ways he is an even more interesting character than John Carter (his backstory in the first book is wonderful).This book picks up about where the first left off, ten years later, again introduced by John Carter's distant cousin--Edgar Rice Burroughs, pretending to be a Virginian. John Carter claims to have figured out how he travels between Earth and Mars and has prepared his young nephew for the upcoming excursion. (To a degree it reminds me of the Perelandra tales of C.S. Lewis, except MUCH better.)John Carter goes back to Mars, hoping to be reunited with his princess, Dejah Thorris, only to find himself having transported to the worse place on Mars to be. He has transported into the Dor Valley--essentially he is on his way to the land of the dead. In this book he discovers the 'truth' of the Martian spiritual beliefs, which up unto this time he had been content to respect.He encounters races that in his time on Mars before, had been unknow to him at all. There are white martians, the holy Therns--essentially a priest class, and black martians, the First Born, who are essentially an over pampered high class. He also comes face to face with the goddess of death, Issus.Its a great book, and the love between John Carter and Dejah Thorris is really well illustrated.Now on to the third, as the second left me wanting more and while it was 'wrapped up' it wasn't really."},{"Title":"The Gods of Mars","review":"We last left John suffocating and wondering if we will ever see him again (except for those few intrepid people that dare to read ahead)\\"Twelve years passed since I laid the body of my great-uncle, Captain John Carter, of Virginia, way form the sight of men in that strange mausoleum in the old Cemetery at Richmond.\\"John returns to a Mars he never saw before yet soon finds old friends and new adventures.

When he revived he found himself back on earth, separated from Dejah Thoris, the Princess of Helium and his beloved. Originally published in 1913 as a serial in &quot;All-Story Magazine,&quot; this story finds John Carter returning to Mars and setting off to find his woman.Knowing that &quot;The Gods of Mars&quot; was originally published as a serial is useful because Burroughs loads on the cliffhangers throughout the novel. When Carter returns to Barsoom a decade has passed and he finds himself in that part of the planet that the natives consider to be &quot;heaven,&quot; which proves to be a more ironic idea. Carter has to reunite with his friend the fierce green warrior Tars Tarkas, fight with the great white apes of Barsoom and plant men, violate some significant religious taboos, survive the affections of an evil goddess, help with a slave revolt, fight in an arena, and still save Dejah Thoris in the middle of a giant air battle between the red, green, black and white people of Barsoom.&quot;The Gods of Mars&quot; is an early Burroughs novel, which means it is high on action and low on details. ERB would set his adventures in strange worlds such as Barsoom, Venus, Pellucidar, etc., but beyond the basic idea of it being a strange world he was content for such places to be the settings for this stories. The writing is a bit stilted and ERB likes to mix cliches and ponderous phrases that make the narrative seem dated, but &quot;The Gods of Mars&quot; meets his basic criteria of providing a ripping yarn for his readers. The best thing you can say about this novel is that the action never stops from start to finish. The worst thing you can say about it is that Burroughs puts off reuniting our hero with his beloved, but if you have read many of ERB's novels, Tarzan or otherwise, you know that once his happy couple is back together the story is pretty much over.However, even at the end there is another cliffhanger that will make you track down &quot;The Warlord of Mars,&quot; the next installment in what is clearly the best Burroughs series. ERB milked the Tarzan character dry and still produced another dozen novels in that series, while the Mars books (sorry, the Barsoom series) remained relatively fresh."},{"Title":"The Gods of Mars","review":"Edgar Rice Burroughs (September 1st, 1875 - March 19, 1950) continues the adventure started in \\"A Princess of Mars\\" in the sequel, \\"The Gods of Mars\\". This novel was published from January to May of 1913 in \\"All-Story\\" as a serial, and then published in book form in September of 1918. John Carter returns to Barsoom, finding if he were in time to save Barsoom at the end of the previous book, and searching for Princess Dejah Thoris who he left behind.As with the first book, this one opens with a foreword written by Burroughs, where he implies that this is a true story and that John Carter is real. The story then picks up with John Carter returning to Barsoom, but to an area which he has not seen before. He is almost immediately forced to fight for his life defending himself and a Green Martian who turns out to be his old friend Tars Tarkas. He soon finds that he has arrived in the Valley Dor, where the River Iss empties into the Lost Sea of Korus, or in other words, heaven. But it is no heaven, it is a place where those who come are slaughtered by the plant men, eaten by the white apes, or by the Therns, who fancy themselves divine, but have their own version of \\"heaven\\" which is much the same as that of the Red and Green Martians, and as much of a lie.Once again, John Carter makes friends and enemies along the way, from Thuvia, a Red Martian prisoner that he frees from the clutches of the Therns; Phaidor, the Thern female who falls for John Carter after he rescues her from the black pirates; Xodar, the black pirate who John Carter captures and who turns the tables on Carter. And, of course, the Goddess Issus, of the first-born. There is also a young Red-Martian warrior (Cathoris) who displays superior fighting skills, and Burroughs teases the reader by hinting at who his father might be, but always interrupting before it is revealed. Other old friends and foes appear as well, such as Kantos Kan, and Zat Arras.The story is entertaining enough for the reader to forgive the amazing coincidences within. One can certainly ignore John Carter arriving where Tars Tarkas is, even though he had never been there before, because the mysterious travel between worlds is not explained. On the other hand, the escape from Shador and the underground world of the first-born leading the escapees right to where Tars Tarkas and Thuvia are would certainly qualify as an amazing coincidence. Additional coincidences would include the Helium fleet appearing in the nick of time and of course on the opposite side, the re-abduction of Thuvia under their very noses.Almost the entire book is spent in John Carter's pursuit of returning to Dejah Thoris, and time and again he is thwarted until the very end when he finds her, and then as the reader knows, foolishly leaves her to help his allies, only to find that she has been taken once again. The book ending in a much more obvious cliff-hanger than the first one, which some readers may find unfair.Overall, this book is not quite as good as the first in the series, but Burroughs does a good job of keeping it fresh and entertaining, building suspense for the next in the series, and of laying the groundwork for future stories as well. As a result, I give this book the same rating as the first in the series, as it doesn't let up very much from the quality of entertainment of the first work."},{"Title":"The Gods of Mars","review":"The cover to the Del Rey edition of _The Gods of Mars_ that I have at hand is a Michael Whelan painting of John Carter and Tars Tarkus fending off a mob of blue-skinned aliens with flat tails and medusalike hair. A giant boulder is behind them, two pale moons are in the sky, and a six-limbed white ape is on the edge of the action. There is a ring of mountains and cliffs in the background.This prompts me to muse a bit on Burroughs illustrators. The main illustrator of Burroughs first editions from 1916 on was J. Allen St. John. His sketches were somewhat rough, and his more detailed illustrations were muted paintings or washes. He was not, perhaps, a great artist, but he was a great Edgar Rice Burroughs artist. His style was Victorian, which matched the style and plot of Burroughs's romances.St. John directly influenced the art of two younger artists, Roy Krenkel, Jr. and Frank Frazetta, who did many covers and interior illustrations of Burroughs for Ace Books. Both Krenkel and Frazetta are, I think, technically superior to St. John. A measure of this is the fact that Krenkel won a 1963 Hugo for his Burroughs illustrations. Boris Vellajo is stylistically similar to St. John, Krenkle, and Frazetta. He is as erotic as St. John was Victorian, but he holds that eroticism a bit in check on all his Burroughs illustrations that I have seen.Whelan is a bit in this tradition in that his paintings are realistic. But Whelan's art is more \\"solid,\\" whereas the other illustrators used more sketches and washes. His style is more like that of Kelly Freas.In the early 1960s, Ballantine employed a series of artists-- including Robert Abbett, Neal Adams, and Richard Powers-- to give Burroughs's books a more modern, impressionistic look. The artists, especially Powers, were competent enough. But the attempt was abortive. Burroughs was not a modern writer, and a modern look simply did not go well with his stories.I do not pretend to have an encyclopedic knowledge of Burroughs illustrators, but I believe that a few generalizations can be made. Since Burroughs's heroes and heroines tend to be unclothed, handsome, and beautiful the illustrator should be good with human anatomy. (Frank R. Paul's stiff, jodhpurred people will not do.)There are lots of beasts, imaginary and real, in a Burroughs romance. The artist must be good with nonhuman anatomy as well. An old-fashioned, realistic style is more appropriate than a modern, impressionistic style. And lots of detail in the illustrations is preferable to artwork that is \\"sketchy.\\" The artist should make the setting \\"come alive\\" for the reader.But we seem to have drifted a bit from the novel itself. _The Gods of Mars_ was first published as a five-part serial in _All-Story Magazine_ in 1913 and was a sequel to _A Princess of Mars_ (1912), the first Barsoomian novel. At the close of _Princess_, John Carter is whisked back to Earth, with Barsoom possibly about to lose its atmosphere. In _Gods_, he finally manages to return and launch himself off in a series of new adventures. Some reviewers have correctly noted that Burroughs is careless about many details in this novel. But it seems to me that he is nevertheless quite good with his descriptive passages. Here is a sampling of some passages that seem to me to have a kind of dreamlike sparkle:As far aloft as I could see the stems and branches and twigs [of the giant trees] were as smooth and as highly polished as the newest of American-made pianos. The wood of some of the trees was as black as ebony, while their nearest neighbours might perhaps gleam in the forest as clear and white as the finest china, or, again, they were azure, scarlet, or deepest purple. (13)To my left the sea extended as far as the eye could reach, before me only a vague, dim line indicated its farther shore, while at my right a mighty river, broad, placid, and majestic, flowed between scarlet banks to empty into the quiet sea before me. (13)The face of the entire cliff was, as later inspection conclusively proved, so shot with veins and patches of solid gold as to quite present the appearance of a solid wall of that precious metal except where it was broken by outcroppings of ruby, emerald, and diamond boulders-- a faint and alluring indication at the unguessable riches which lay deeply buried beneath the magnificent surface. (21-22)For quite half an hour we descended [down a black chasm in a giant mountain] and then the shaft terminated abrubtly in the dome of a mighty subterranean world. Below us rose and fell the billows of a buried sea. A phosphorescent radiance illuminated the scene. Thousands of ships dotted the bosom of the ocean. Little islands rose here and there to support the strange and colourless vegetation of this strange world. (77)It was still dark when we passed the northern boundary of the ice cap and the area of clouds. Below us lay a typical Martian landscape. Rolling ochre sea bottom of long dead seas, low surrounding hills, with here and there the grim silent cities of the dead past; great piles of mighty architecture tenanted only by age-old memories of a once powerful race and by the great white apes of Barsoom. (121)Now _this_, by the double moons of Barsoom, is why you read Edgar Rice Burroughs! Not because he was a great writer (he wasn't), or even because he was the best of the American scientific romance writers (he wasn't). But when he was cooking with gas, he sometimes made a connection with the little exotic story teller sitting cross-legged with his hookah in your subconscious. Burroughs's imagination, admittedly undisciplined, brought a fantasy to life."},{"Title":"The Gods of Mars","review":"The story , of course , is fabulous but this is the worst binding I have ever seen in 30+ years of reading paperbacks.

I've been studying it for a while to help me with my writing, because in a way that's what most Improv is--Improvised writing. Sure, there's a theater aspect, but many of the games are more about coming up with lines on the spot than coming up with actions.At first I was turned off by the book's focus on high school and things like how to recruit other students to your group, run shows, and participate in competitions. That sort of thing goes on for more than half the book. But I was pleasantly surprised to learn a few things I didn't know before, like how the members of the group raise the stakes in a scene. That one gem was something I found particularly useful for my writing. (It's all about raising what the character wants to a need while providing more obstacles that are related to the goal itself.)It's by far not the best book on Improv I own.

Dr. Appell (who was a consultant for the series), tells us what life was really like in a M. A. S. H. unit. The series took some liberties with actual events, but its overall portrayal was fairly accurate-though the series lasted 10 years compared to the three years of the Korean War itself, and the average length of stay for surgeons in a M.

When the book was first published, the author had sent her a copy. There's a story about her on p. 105 and pictures on the cover and on pp. 106 and 99, LT. Marilyn Brown. She recommended the book highly, but I'd never managed to read it when I'd found it by inter-library loan or when I'd borrowed Dad's copy. But after Marilyn's funeral I sent for my own copy and read it.For years she had shared her adventures, her fear, her funny stories, her painful PTSD memories. I had always known MASH, even before the TV show. Marilyn lived it, both the laughter and the tears. Through her, I got it second-hand. Through this book many others can come to understand what these men and women, these ordinary heroes, accomplished and suffered as they set the standard for battlefield medicine in the modern era.I highly recommend this book and would even if I didn't have a personal connection to it. The reader is presented with an historical angle rarely seen, with insight into the staffs' daily lives, with events and anecdotes that educate, inspire and entertain-- some of which made their way into MASH scripts for TV.

The author states that the detail on the Arabic forces is lacking. The events covered here in the two volumes The Israeli Army in the Middle East Wars, 1948-1973, and Arab Armies in the Middle East Wars, 1948-1973. Subsequent events are covered in the volume Armies in Lebanon, 1982-84.The rivalry between Israel and the surrounding Arab nations goes back before WW II with the 1917 Balfour Declaration that a homeland for the Jews would be established in Palestine. This was done in the wake of the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire without consulting the Arabic peoples of Palestine.After much unrest in the 1930s matters came to a head in 1948 after the British left and Israel was proclaimed, the surrounding Arabic states invaded Palestine. The resulting war caused many of the Palestinian Arabs to flee the conflict. The resulting de facto partition resulting from the Israeli victory led to four more major ground wars and ongoing border raids and terrorism.Their return was not to be allowed, even more tragically, they were kept in refugee camps and not allowed to disperse or assimilate in the rest of the Arab world in a manner similar to that done by the displaced persons who fled Eastern Europe in 1945. Now, several generations on, the desires of the Palestinians to return, destroy the state of Israel, and reclaim the land of their origin, have festered for so long that no rational solution seems in sight. At various times the Israeli's neighbors have backed or opposed or expelled the Palestinian forces in response to their own internal political imperatives. Thus, the Egyptians have signed a peace with Israel, while the rest have not. Syrians, Saudis, and others have continued to offer them refuge and aid while the Kingdom of Jordan expelled them all in &quot;Black September&quot; 1970, an event which led to the raid on the Olympic delegation in 1972.No matter what side your sympathy lies, hope of peace is still remote, and all concerned victims of this conflict deserve the prayers and good wishes of the world.The color plates are of the usual high quality and coverthe Israeli, Lebanese, Jordanian, Egyptian and other local forces."},{"Title":"Arab Armies of the Middle East Wars (2) (Men-at-Arms)","review":"this is an excellent introduction to the arab israeli conflicts summarizes everything beautiffuly dont miss the illustrations &amp; photos"},{"Title":"The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge","review":"I first read THE NOTEBOOKS OF MALTE LAURIDS BRIGGE more than 35 years ago. I found it difficult going, but I thought it profound (as I had been taught to regard it). On re-reading it, I once again find it difficult going, but now I find it less than profound. To be sure, there is some exquisite writing and some spell-binding and memorable passages. But much of it is far too cryptic and idiosyncratically private to be great literature, and occasionally it is silly. Further, in assessing the worth of the work I cannot ignore certain aspects of Rilke's personal biography, as discussed at the end of this review.Published one hundred years ago (twelve years before completion of his acclaimed masterpieces of poetry, \\"Duino Elegies\\" and \\"Sonnets to Orpheus\\"), NOTEBOOKS is Rilke's most extended exercise in prose. Nonetheless, the prose of NOTEBOOKS is poetic, impressionistic, and at times mystic. There is no narrative in the traditional sense and it seems rather misleading to refer to the book as a novel; indeed, more than once I have seen it called an \\"anti-novel\\". It consists of a series of meditative entries in two notebooks by a 28-year-old Dane of minor nobility, Malte Laurids Brigge. A few of the entries record, like a diary or journal, events of the ostensible present, which for the most part are Brigge's unpleasant encounters with the bustle and squalor of Paris, to which he has recently moved with limited funds. But far more entries deal either with the past - the personal past of Brigge as a child and that of his parents and forebears, as well as the past represented by a vast assortment of historical figures going back centuries, mostly nobility, saints, divines, and unrequited lovers - or with speculations (\\"the teeming maggots of my conjectures\\") about life, death, love, art, and the post-Nietzchean world without God.The arc of the book is supplied by Brigge's search for his identity, his self. In connection with that search, Rilke deliberately invokes the Biblical story of the Prodigal Son. But it is a very self-indulgent prodigal son, and Rilke's version (such as it is) is told from his perspective. Within literary circles, NOTEBOOKS is known as one of the leading literary works of its time dealing with the search for selfhood, and it also is sometimes said to be a precursor, maybe even an early landmark, of 20th-Century existentialism. Alas, the self of Malte Laurids Brigge (perhaps like the self of Rainer Maria Rilke - ?) is not a particularly attractive or admirable one. To me, Brigge is the great-grandson and literary heir of Goethe's Werther, and NOTEBOOKS is, curiously, even more fusty than \\"The Sorrows of Young Werther\\", published more than a century earlier.A paragraph about the translation: The first time I read NOTEBOOKS, it must have been the translation by M.D. Herter Norton. Recently, wanting to re-read it, I went looking for the volume I first read only to discover that I must have packed it away in boxes in storage. It was easier to purchase a new copy. What I bought was a translation by Stephen Mitchell. I did not particularly care for the book, and after 50 pages abandoned it, thinking that the Mitchell translation must be to blame. Then I saw that a new translation by Michael Hulse (highly regarded translator of, inter alia, several works by W.G. Sebald) had just been published by Penguin. That was the edition and version I read for this review. It turns out that I am essentially indifferent as between the Hulse and Mitchell translations. With some passages, Mitchell does a better job, though on the whole the Hulse translation seems slightly more comprehensible and lyrical. The footnotes to the Hulse translation, however, are much more informative than those to the Mitchell translation, and I found Hulse's introduction more useful than the one by William H. Gass. On those grounds, then, I recommend the Penguin/Hulse edition over the Viking/Mitchell/Gass one.In the end, I conclude that I cannot attribute my relative disappointment on re-reading NOTEBOOKS to the translation. Rather, I think the explanation is simply that the book resonated more with a relatively callow youth than it does with someone in the autumn of his life. I also suspect that given the particular tides of Western culture over the last third of a century, NOTEBOOKS has not \\"worn\\" well.Finally, I cannot entirely put aside the character of Rainer Maria Rilke, who was \\"one of the most repugnant human beings in literary history\\". That is the judgment of Michael Dirda, from his review of Ralph Freedman's biography of Rilke, \\"Life of a Poet\\" (contained in the excellent collection of Dirda reviews, \\"Bound to Please\\"). As Dirda explains,\\"[T]his hollow-eyed communer with angels, Greek torsos, and death was not merely a selfish snob; he was also an anti-Semite, a coward, a psychic vampire, a crybaby. He was a son who refused to go to his dying father's bedside, a husband who exploited and abandoned his wife, a father who almost never saw his daughter and who even stole from a special fund for her education to pay for his first-class hotel rooms. He was a seducer of other men's wives, a pampered intellectual gigolo, and a virtual parody of the soulful artiste who deems himself superior to ordinary people because he is so tenderly sensitive * * *.\\"I find it impossible to marvel and ponder over cryptic pronouncements and soulful cries when I have very little respect for the man who uttered them. At bottom, it's all a sham."},{"Title":"The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge","review":"I was extremely disappointed in this version. The translation by M. D. Herter Norton is much more eloquent.

The language is so beautifully strewn together, filled with vivid color and wit, it is easy one of the great classics of modern literature. This is Rilke's only novel and is an enduring work that has inspired a genre, a poet that put a poet's mind in literature.Each page is a vivid canvas in itself, this book should, in my opinion, be read slowly and allowed to ruminate on the mind instead of devoured.This books is a collection of elegant and beautiful thoughts strung together"},{"Title":"The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge","review":"Reading \\"The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge\\" is to have the feeling that you have never before read words used in exactly this way for exactly this purpose. Rilke, perhaps most known for being the greatest German-language poet of the twentieth century, has written what can only be called a prose poem - but even to use this phrase is to reduce a fullness that cannot be reduced. This novel is symphonic, lush, and poignant. In its evocation of memory, it is Proust avant la lettre. But there are also moments of pureness and clarity that are reminiscent of Wittgenstein, which creates quite a striking contrast. Rilke's experience with art and art criticism highly influenced his writing. His prose-poetry is pure imagism, but is also full of expressionism and impressionism. All of this sounds like an unlikely salmagundi, but I can assure you that there is something lasting and moving that inheres.We are so used to novels being narratives of action that when we meet something like this, it gives us pause. There really is no plot here as most people would conceive it. The narrator calls to mind Dostoyevsky's Underground Man, brooding and destitute. Malte is haunted by the doppelgangers that he lived with during his well-to-do childhood, all now long dead; he is the only member of his ancient Danish aristocratic family. The book flits in and out of memories of the deaths of his father and other relatives and their relationships. In many novels, one can easily separate, if one wishes, content and form; here they seem to belong to one another, the poetry and the memory inextricably intertwined.Unlike many other reviewers, I wouldn't say that the novel is difficult reading, but it might not be something that you want to read in one or two sittings. Like the \\"Duino Elegies\\" or the \\"Sonnets to Orpheus,\\" they are meant to be dipped into. The text (at least in this edition) is subdivided into seventy-one parts which serve as breaks for the narrative line of thought. If you will excuse the length, this is from section twenty-nine, and it is representative of the style throughout:\\"One thing is certain: that on that evening I was drawing a knight, a quite solitary and unmistakable knight, mounted on a strangely caparisoned steed. He turned out so brightly colored that I had to change crayons frequently; but it was the red one that I used most of all, and reached for time and again. Now I needed it once again; but it rolled (I still see it) right across the brightened page, to the edge, and fell down, past me, before I could stop it, and was gone. I really did need it urgently, and having to climb down after it was distinctly vexing. Awkward as I was, it was quite a business to get down; my legs were far too long, and I couldn't draw them out from under me: remaining too long in a kneeling position had numbed my limbs; I could not tell what was mine and what was the chair's. At length, rather at sixes and sevens, I did make it to the floor, and found myself on an animal fell that extended under the table to the wall. But at this point I was confronted with a fresh difficulty. My eyes, accustomed to the brightness above and still wholly entranced by the colors on the white paper, were unable to make out anything at all below the table, where the blackness seemed so dense that I was afraid of knocking against it; so I fell back on my sense of touch and, kneeling and supporting myself on my left hand, combed through the cool, long-haired, familiar-feeling fell with my other hand. But there was no sign of the crayon.\\""},{"Title":"The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge","review":"Mitchell's &quot;Malte&quot; is absolutely stunning - as valuable a gift to English readers as Kaufmann's Nietzsche translations. It's true that, like Zarathustra, this work is overextended by approximately 1/3 and, in several instances, flirts dangerously with self-indulgence. (Hint: unlike Thus Spoke, which bogs down in the middle, this one disappoints at the end, despite a memorable final sentence). Yet like Zarathustra, it remains one of the most courageous, important and underrated works of the late 19th/early 20th century. And, like Nietzsche's classic, offers proof of the potential beauty of German, prose unleashed in the spirit of poetry. Required reading once a year -- a guilty pleasure, indeed. Surpassed only by Gide's &quot;Counterfeiters&quot; as a sadly neglected must-read. Vintage International got everything right with this edition (even the font is perfect). Diametrically opposed to Camus's distant style in &quot;The Stranger&quot;, this work nonetheless packs a similar wallop. Indispensable."},{"Title":"The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge","review":"This is an important book in literary history. It describes in &#34;ultra realism&#34; the rise of mass culture, the loss of individualism and personal value in 20th century Europe. It's told through the eyes of a failed artistand destitute nobleman arriving in Paris for treatment of some undisclosed mental illness. It contrasts with Kafka's surrealism, dealing with (basically) the same themes. So it's interesting and worth reading from those points alone. It's just that the language and plot are rather hyper emotional making the read a tough slog. But I'd still recommend the book for its pivotal position in literature and history."},{"Title":"The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge","review":"This book is a dense jungle of metaphor, symbol and history.

The notebooks is haunting in its meditative poise-its ghostly luminosity interrogates the nature of death and dying in incomparable prose. Rilke's writing sings in this free floating presentation of decline and mortality. This is also a boldly existential work; we are confronted with the insuperable question of the nature of the self in relation to the world, allowing with its singular potentialities. A tremendous influence for Nietzsche and Heidegger, who would appropriate his extraordinary meditations on mortality in their own radical ways."},{"Title":"The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge","review":"Rilke's poems are great. This book is sporadic. Some of the entries will really stun you, and others are tedious. The plot is skeletal, more a scaffold than a structure, but the real reason to read this book is because Rilke is brilliant, and you will find so very many good books that act like books in your life, but very few or none like this. It is one of those wonderful little unique experiences in the world. Sometimes I think there is nothing so valuable in this over-crowded world as weirdness, because there is far too much normalcy, and the more millions of normal people who bump into each other, the more loudly they start complaining about how the little guy, the average citizen is being ignored, squeezed, blah blah blah. Stand out already. Get an eccentricity. For a good jumping off point, start here."},{"Title":"The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge","review":"Rilke's most important prose work is barely a novel and more a conjunction of reflections, some of them somber and rambling. Rilke impersonates an alter-ego, a Danish poet who lives in Paris, lonely, sick, and impoverished. What little plot there is, is the narration of childhood and adolescence stories which, in spite of the novel transcurring in recent, modern years, retain a Gothic and Medieval air, on the one hand, and Proustian on the other. THe main character of these stories is his father, who receives crude yet intimate portraits, but also his mother and other relatives whom they visit in dark, barely inhabited mansions. Although rather depressing, this noble and wealthy past contrasts sharply with Malte's present, sordid and hypochondriac. Brigge spends long hours in charitable hospitals' waiting rooms, where he is witness to sickness, despair, lonelines, and terror towards the cold, technical treatment from doctors and nurses. Interspersed with this narrative are strange stories of obscure and ancient kings, which seem to round up this book, accurately defined by some as a prose poem.Other reviewers are positive about this book as an early Existentialist work. I don't disagree: effectively, at the time of writing, technology and social change had done away with many of the defining certainties and characteristics of European culture, and this dislocation created a great measure of anxiety and uncertainty, not resolved to this day. There are so many works of art that seem to be rooted in and expressive of, this feeling, that the evidence is overwhelming. This would be another valuable trait of this book: although firmly rooted in European tradition, the \\"Notebooks\\" have an ominous undertone of the horrors soon to come a few years later with the long world wars."},{"Title":"The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge","review":"The great modernist poet Rainer Maria Rilke wrote only one \\"novel\\" in his lifetime: The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge. He termed it a novel; I am not so sure. The book is a compilation of narrative, philosophical asides, sketches for future poems, and detailed descriptions of artwork. It is clear that the writer is a poet, for much of the content does not make sense except in an irrational way. I was struck, for example, at the beginning of the novel by the narrator's description of people's faces. Everyone has four or five faces they wear throughout their lives. like masks. Some wear out quickly, the seams tearing at the edges. Some never use any face but one. Once, while walking through the streets of Paris, the narrator Malte hears a woman crying down a alley. When he investigates, the woman pulls her face out of her hands so quickly that she is left palming it in a puddle of tears, her head an open chasm.Malte is a young aristocrat from Denmark without money who has moved to Paris to pursue his poetic vocation. The books flashes back and forth between his childhood memories and his observations of the people in France. In the second half of the book he hints at a love interest he left behind, an older woman who may be a relation.The work jumps around from scene to scene randomly, and I had trouble making any sense of it. That is until the end, when Malte examines the New Testament story of the Prodigal Son. He imagines this character, not as the selfish libertine popularly construed, but as a sensitive young favorite of everyone in his household. He flees his family and gives away everything he owns to his \\"friends\\" simply because he no longer wishes to be loved. To be loved is to be controlled, and he wants freedom. He will love without reciprocation, because to love is to live. The Prodigal Son, then, is a symbol of Malte and his antipathy to attachment to anyone. As every selection in the book shows, he prefers to sit in the corner with his notebook making observations about those around him or delving into his reminiscences from home, never getting up and actually entering into the fray of life.Those who need a clear plot and a reliable narrator beware. This book is non-linear and reads more like poetry than a traditional novel. But I love literature which challenges me to look at the world differently. The Notebooks certainly does that.I have been a long fan of the translations of Stephen Mitchell. I was first drawn to this particular book by the excerpts inAhead of All Parting: The Selected Poetry and Prose of Rainer Maria Rilke (Modern Library) (English & German Edition) (English and German Edition)This translation is first-rate."},{"Title":"The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge","review":"Plunge in to this work of genius and you will emerge with a new view of what can be accomplished in fiction.

It offers no sappy \\"Everything will be alright\\"s, but just chronicles a life adrift--fragmented, distractable, and more often than not disquieted.

Itleads to a strange reading style whereby I'm weighing abridgement optiopns as I proceed but I still found myself amazed by some passages in this book, particularly those of a surrealistic vein which I wasn't prepared for having read his poetry. Anyway! I was struck by the books similarities to the previous book I abridged, Goethe's Sorrows of Young Werthe, the story in letters of a troubled young man who commits suicide. Rilke's young man is also troubled, not by unforsaken love as is Goethe's, but more by death and the nature of his memories. Rilke, I read, wrote to some Countess that he thought the artistic principle wasn't good tho the concept of a found notebook was viable. I agree; the notebook lacks a narrative or coherant structure, and though soem od the passages, particularly on death, are striking and insightful, and some of the childhood memories very vivid, there are a few flat digressions, into obscure biography, for exmple, and a relatively long 'comic' digression about a Russian obsessed with time which falls flat on its face, I feel (the voice is all wrong, like a frenchman trying to tell a Russian story in Gernman),and there's probably one ghost story too many. The tone and quality fluctuates, but there is some truly great prose passages in this book: strange, vivid, startlingly insightful - what you'd expect from one of the world's greatest poets."},{"Title":"The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge","review":"Based on the stellar reputation of Rilke the poet and ecstatic reviews here and elsewhere of this, his only prose work, I purchased this book with eager anticipation of experiencing a seminal literary masterpiece. Perhaps it is my philistine and cynical nature, but I found this book a vast disappointment.The book is, in essence, a series of self-absorbed and largely fatuous, angst-ridden observations of a type typical of late 19th/early 20th century adolescent intellectuals; a bildungsroman, in essence of a characteristic type. The ruminations on poetry, poverty, death (all preoccupations which are capable of elevating the thinker to the status of ruined nobility) are generally banal and thoroughly unoriginal. All that was lacking was an opium addiction. Additionally, there is no definite plot, but the approach is not \\"stream of consciousness\\", either.Much better works on the same theme have been written by, amongst others, Dostoevsky (\\"Crime and Punishment\\", \\"Notes from the Underground\\"), Gorky (\\"Diary of a Man in Despair\\", an unjustly ignored work), Strindberg (\\"A Madman's Manifesto\\"), Huysmans (\\"La Bas\\").In summary, this is a genre work of little literary, philosphical or poetic distinction."},{"Title":"The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge","review":"[....]Loving another does not entitle one to their love in return, but being loved by another does place oneunder an obligation. This is the awful truth that Rainer Maria Rilke's semi autobiographical hero,Malte Laurids Brigge, seems to be trying to evade. In fact, this is very much the dilemma of modernman, for no matter how much we love God, our love will not necessarily influence Him, but His lovefor us places us under an obligation to Him. Of course, the easiest way out of this dilemma is simplyto deny the existence of God, which has been the response of Modernity.Unfortunately, this still leaves the problem of fellow humans, and the obligations that their love putsus under. Thus, Rilke, who wrote the book after running away from his wife and young child, says ofBrigge :[H]e had decided never to love, in order not to put anyone in the terrible position of being loved.Or, as Sartre more famously said :Hell is other people.Both quotes reflect an understanding that love ultimately places limits on human freedom, by creatinginterdependence.Brigge's/Rilke's reaction, one which has been all to common in our age, was to turn completelyinward and become totally self-absorbed, to disregard others. And in the absence of God and of otherpeople what is the central fact of the self ? Mortality. So it is little surprise that an obsession withdeath thoroughly permeates the Notebooks. If you really want to read about an effete and morbidlyself-centered intellectual who is down and out in Paris (of course Paris), this is the book for you.But if you don't share in the pathologies, it's likely to be off-putting, at least it was for me. [The beauty of Rilke's language]certainly does not redeem the depressing story. Rilke's concerns are those you would expect of theman that Michael Dirda describes above : only his own unpleasant self. In the end the book is mainlyinteresting as an influential expression of a philosophy of mere existence that has proven enormouslydamaging, contributing mightily to the unfortunate atomization of humanity in the 20th Century.GRADE : D"},{"Title":"The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge","review":"This proto-existentialist novel features a main character (Malte) that is frightened by the possibility of faceless-ness; that is, he is terrified by the collapse of a coherent subject/identity in modernity. This work is highly critical of the traditional narrative where everything occurs in a logical and temporal order that is coherent and teleological. Through the character of Malte, Rilke illustrates the decay of such an understanding of one's self and the chaos that results.Rilke read a lot of Nietzsche prior to writing this book, and many of the same themes Nietzsche contemplated in The Gay Science and Thus Spake Zarathustra are reworked by Rilke in this novel. It is my interpretation that Rilke was trying to work out a theory of modern, fragmented, existential subjectivity and then offer some way to make such a life livable. Rilke explores such themes as memory's transience, unpredictability, and instability, the role of a God in a world after the \\"death of God\\", and a dissolving of the conceptual categories between the self and the other, or the inside and the outside, all play into this fascinating book.The book is written in notebook form, which plays into the notion of fragmentary identity and problematic narrative. Entries jump from the past to the present to imagined futures in an often random and chaotic order. There is no \\"plot\\" to speak of, although there are bits and pieces of narratives, but nothing sufficient enough to create a comprehensible 'Malte'. All the while, you are in the mind of a character that is trying and failing to make sense of it all (to 'impose' a narrative).The later Martin Heidegger always lauded Rilke (despite Rilke's being too metaphysical) for being able to express ways of interacting with the world that were non-humanist. He was especially interested, and wrote significantly about, a passage (p. 46 in the Vintage paperback edition) where Malte imagines a house and its inhabitants from a single mutilated wall that is left remaining. I'm not too sure what his relation to the text as a whole was, so I'll leave it at that.This book is an intellectual paradise and is rich in treasures as long as you are willing to look for them."},{"Title":"The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge","review":"though it seems to be a collection of strange lyric essays moving from simple snapshots to fantastic recollections and musings. There are seeds planted early that expand and flower, painfully and beautifully and so truthfully. This is what books should do for people. Every sentence, as foreign as it can seem, you've known all your life, and you see it now in words. I don't know anything about german, but this translation is incredibly beautiful, I cannot imagine the original could work any better than this.

I read it when I was 19 and for me that was the right age. Rilke's Notebooks contain what amounts to the crisis of modern existence. For Rilke the solution was writing some of the best poetry ever written. If you want proof read it. For Malte it was not so clear yet and his struggles will be very familiar to any student of the arts. As a time piece this also has much value. It records the change over from the old Europe to the new. For Malte, as it was for many of Mann's, Musil's, Broch's... characters, this proves devastating. Identity threatening. The second half of this book is not as good as the first half but I'll take that first half and disregard the rest. Read this while reading Rilke's greatest contribution to our world, his poetry."},{"Title":"The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge","review":"I recently had occasion to replace my worn-out (tattered) copy of The Notebooks of MLB and when my new copy arrived I started reading it. It is a remarkable work in every way, sometimes seeming simple and straightforward, sometimes so arcane it's almost impossible to figure out what Rilke is trying to say. I love this book. I have learned so much about myself by looking into the mirror Rilke holds up -- a mirror he himself faced, and in response to which he wrote The Notebooks. He invites us into his universe, and it is so rich and abundant we always learn new things about ourselves as we read. This is a book to savor, to live with, to read often. Take it in small doses if it seems too arcane. Reflect on it, and the meaning will come to you. And if it doesn't, let it go and come back to it at some future time. I first read it 25 years ago and I'm still discovering new things in it. The layers of meaning can be overwhelming.

It is a difficult text, often vaguely referencing obscure Medieval history. It has endnotes to help you through it though. It is entirely worth the effort to read this book (too many books don't make you try these days) because it is unlike anything I have ever read.

Needless to say, it was like nothing I'd read at that point, being all of 21. It didn't matter to me that the book was plotless (as has been noted elsewhere)--the prose was gorgeous.I still have my copy, and have gone back to it a number of times in the last 20 years. At one point I read aloud, to my wife, the last section in which Rilke/Malte gives his interpretation of the Prodigal Son story. I didn't know when I began, but it would soon reduce me to tears. So you could say it spoke to me very personally about love and \\"not wanting to be loved\\", which is part of his theme about the Prodigal.A gem of a book, but probably not for everyone...but then, that's true for many books!"},{"Title":"The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge","review":"This book can be quietly savored by fellow introverts which is what Rilke obviously was.

I have used the Red Guide in Italy and especially recommend the Red Guide if you intend to get off the beaten path and visit smaller or less well known towns in France. Don't imagine that the Red Guide only includes four star hotels and three star palaces of haute cuisine! The hotels and restaurants listed are rated on a 1-5 scale (1-5 forks for restaurants and 1-5 roofpeaks for hotels) along with special recommendations for outstanding entries, exceptional values or bargains. The listings include everything from simple family-owned small-town accommodations to the Ritz in Paris. There is useful information advising what food or lodging is available in towns that don't make it into a guidebook including details such as prices, relative level of comfort and special features (such as having a beautiful view or being in a historic building) and even the lower end of the restaurants listed are a cut above the average. The Red Guide integrates well with Michelin Maps and the Michelin Green Guides (the Green Guides contain historic and landmark information, but no hotel/restaurant listings). We (on occasion) drive a half-hour off course to eat lunch in a town with a Michelin rated restaurant. When using a Michelin map the names of towns with restaurants or hotels in the Red Guide are underlined in red for easy reference. Almost all of our lodgings and most of our meals for two weeks in France (excluding one emergency road stop at a McDonald's near Roanne and one lunch from a crepe vendor across from our hotel in Paris) were in establishments listed in the Red Guide. We stayed in a range of hotels to the most simple to the most &quot;luxurious&quot; featured. We ate in Michelin 1-5 &quot;fork&quot; rated restaurants as well as a Michelin one star restaurant in Paris and a three star restaurant in Burgundy Only one restaurant was disappointing -- a two forker in Paris (Au Bon Acceuil - 7th Arrondisement) which attempted to do an &quot;American-style&quot; turn of the tables. The food was good, prices reasonable, but being accustomed to 2-3 hour dinners we found the service to be geared toward getting us out the door in 90 minutes -- the next diners were waiting and the waiters were practically breathing down our necks! The Red Guide is in the language of the country -- here French -- but it includes a translation &quot;bookmark&quot; and the symbols used are easy to understand. If you like to get out and independently travel away from major tourist destinations, but still want comfortable accomodations and great meals, don't go to France (or Italy) without the Red Guide.

The holes can be found on pretty much every page. eg p1. Dawkins states that \\"Today the theory of evolution is about as much open to doubt as the theory that the earth goes around the Sun..\\". Excuse me? What about the arguments amongst evolutionists themselves - Darwinists, those who believe in punctuated equilibria, saltationists - they can't even agree among themselves, let alone convince the creationists or the growing intelligent design movement. To simply state that there is \\"no doubt\\" is just dogma - plain and simple. This is to say nothing of the raging debates that occur to try and explain the \\"arrival\\" of the fittest - Abiogenesis? Clay theory? Panspermia? - the debate is endless and has implications for the evolution debate as a whole.His constant use of \\"must have\\", \\"could have\\", \\"probably\\" etc I also find unconvincing. If, as he states above, there is so little doubt about evolution, why can't he be more sure of himself? If God's design is such a leaking sieve of an idea, shouldn't his be watertight? eg. p19. \\"We can now see that less-favoured varieties must actually have become less numerous because of competition, and ultimately many of their lines must have gone extinct\\". If he really can \\"see\\" this, why not just state it as a fact? Why the need for \\"must have\\" ?I could go on, but won't.I'm glad I bought this book. It has strengthened my faith in God immeasurably!"},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Anyone who reads this must be acquainted with the theory, or idea, of determinism: All atomic motion and subsequent reactions were necessarily predetermined by the original motion and properties of the atoms at the moment of the Big Bang. This idea is completely consistent with complete reductionism. In fact, reductionism necessitates determinism. How could it do otherwise? While it is true that quantum mechanics might create a narrow range of possibilities for the deterministic flow of particles, most biologists insist that much sub micro effects would have no real consequence, and at any rate, since such effects are completely random, they should cancel themselves out. So if reductionism is the correct model of the universe, then the entire flow of evolution was just as predetermined and unalterable as the path of a projectile. Since particulate motion is blind, it is absurd to suppose the Big Bang gave these particles just the exact motion necessary to eventually create mankind. Something had to have given these particles the precisely correct original motion and chemical properties to accomplish this. What we regard as \\"natural selection\\" was all in the original Intelligent Design. So while evolution is not in doubt, Reductionism without Intelligent Design makes no sense.

This feature of Darwinism is, of course, present in the book, but the ideas discussed in it are far more complex than a quick judgment based on the cover would imply. Note the title: it does not refer to \\"selfish humans\\": the stress is rather on the noun, the gene. The gene is the protagonist. And, of course, the title is also figurative. The gene is not selfish in the same sense as a human being is: it is only designed to replicate itself. And this all-powerful tendency is what, according to Dawkins, is (or should be) the foundation of our understanding of animal behavior.Anyone put off by the title should be advised that it contains pronouncements such as the following sentence, which is startling to find in a book by a biologist: \\"We, alone on earth, can rebel against the tyranny of the selfish replicators\\" (p. 201) And if you are still in doubt, begin by reading the next-to-last chapter (\\"Nice guys finish first\\"), in which Dawkins takes a lengthy detour through game theory and the prisoner's dilemma to demonstrate how selfishness or vindictiveness at the level of the individual is not necessarily the most successful strategy for replicating your genes.All in all, a fascinating book."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Excellent ... A real eye opener. The most plausible explanation of life on earth that I have ever read. And it's not based on a hunch from an ancient philosopher but from a modern scientist conducting real scientific research."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"In his play \\"Suddenly, Last Summer,\\" Tennessee Williams writes of a young man who, on vacation at the seashore, watches newly hatched baby turtles struggling down to the safety of the water. Only a small percentage get there, though, because the gulls overhead scoop them up and eat them faster than they can crawl. The young man, observing this and already under great psychic tension, tells his cousin that now \\"I have seen God!\\" Later on, we realize the man is morally insane, and that perhaps this was the turning point; his descent into insanity.Whether Williams himself thought of God the same way, I don't know. But certainly the example of the turtles and gulls had been chosen, out of thousands of other such biological observations, because the young man chose to find God - or truth - in it. He could, if he had been in a sunnier mood, chosen to look at nesting robins or a mare and her colt.In \\"The Selfish Gene,\\" Dr. Dawkins argues against the idea of altruism in nature: mothers take care of their young because they love them, etc. Dawkins says they do it because it's in their genes. But he takes it one step further: he says it's the genes themselves that are struggling to survive - not the whole animal. The analogy of genes \\"using\\" animal bodies for their own \\"selfish\\" ends, as if we were robots and the genes our drivers, is made over and over again.Of course, Dawkins realizes this is not correct. Darwinism asserts that biological life came into existence blindly: cells and animals came (and continue to come) into being, not because they chose to, but because of natural selection. And the ones who survive do so because of serendipity.This is a very hard concept, of course, to understand. I remember Sister Pauline laboring to explain to us girls in junior biology class that the white butterflies didn't decide to turn black; they turned black over generations, due to natural selection. She had a hard time of it. (Catholics are \\"allowed\\" to choose between a literal or analogous interpretation of the Bible, so she was not breaking any official rules!)In other words, a \\"selfish\\" gene (or animal) makes no more sense in Darwinistic terms than an \\"altruistic\\" one.Dawkins explicitly states this on page 196. But he uses the selfish gene analogy so many more times - hundreds of times - that, just from the sheer repetitiveness of the theme, it may sink in too deeply (and do some psychic damage) to people who are not currently living on the sunny side of the street, so to speak.For those people, like the gentleman who wrote the touching review of how this book contributed to fits of depression, I'd say: This point of view has no more legitimacy than the altrustic point of view.An additional (and, I think, unnecessary) weight on the sensitive reader's soul is the aspersions that Dr. Dawkins, an aggressive atheist, throws on the concept of God - limited mainly, I think, to his chapter on memes (he saves most of his vituperation on this issue for another book, \\"The God Delusion\\").On that score, I'd say: please realize that scientists don't know everything. People in different professions develop different mental prejudices: lawyers think like lawyers, engineers like engineers, etc. And scientists, for whom scientific method is everything, tend to think that anything that's not measurable therefore doesn't exist. This is a logical fallacy. They also tend to think they are so intelligent, and the world outside science is so simple, that they can read a few survey books on religion, philosophy, or history and know all there is to know about the field. This leads them to made irresponsible, blanket statements, completely unaware of how little they know.On page 201, he winds up a chapter by saying all is not gloomy; humans can still strive towards altruism; that \\"[w]e, alone on earth, can rebel against the tyranny of the selfish replicators.\\" Then, in a long footnote, he writes that some of his colleagues disapproved of this passionate summation. \\"In some cases, the criticism came from doctrinaire sociobiologists jealously protective of genetic influence....\\" and in others, from \\"high priests of the left jealously protective of a favorite demonological icon!\\" (His exclamation point.) These latter, apparently, were objecting that he on the one hand implied a belief in free will while on the other hand talking like a genetic determinist. He objects to this, saying, if I understand it, that he's both, and ends the argument by saying, \\"We, that is our brains, are separate and independent enough from our genes to rebel against them. ...[W]e do so in a small way every time we use contraception.\\"Now, I don't pretend to have a handle on the philosophical and sociobiological arguments regarding whether or not humans have free will, or even what exactly free will is. But in the above I don't see that Dr. Dawkins really does, either: he treats it far too simply.In sum, read the book, but don't let it get you down. After all, if the village priest doesn't have the right to bully people intellectually, than neither does the research scientist."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Here I go again. Reading Richard Dawkins and gritting my teeth. Dawkins is one of the most pretentious authors I read. Dawkins is a Dawinian fundamentalist who figures somehow, someway he has been blessed with THE EXPLANATION of life. Like all fundamentalists, he ignores history, which shows, overtime, all know-it-alls are eventually proven fallible. He would be well advised to consider that maybe he isn't the great prophet he thinks he is. Look, I take the easy way out myself and figure I don't know much of anything. But I do know that history shows that people who figure they have THE answer are eventually proved wrong almost all the time. Dawkins would be more readable if he started from the premise that the cosmos is a very complex place and odds are he hasn't figured it all out himself. I just don't like to read fundamentalists at all. If you don't like reading pretentious authors, you might want to skip Dawkins. It's not what he says, it's how sure he is that he is right and any other idea is wrong. Grow up Richard! OK, my rant is over.I have a confession to make. I wrote the above while in the middle of reading The Selfish Gene. Now that I've finished, I must amend my critique. The final third of the book was much less strident and much more interesting, in some instances profound. The last part of the book spent more time on new ideas and less time defending Dawinian fundamentalism. I just wish Dawkins would have employed a more civil tone from the start."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Not for nothing is this masterpiece often rated up there with Newton's Principia and Darwin's Origin of the Species. It is a masterwork of unparalleled proportions. I savored each page and was awestruck at the brilliance of Dawkins' achievement: to explain altruism on a molecular level. This is momentous and life-changing science writing at its very best. This is the real bible."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"In this classic sociobiology text, Dawkins shows how mathematical analyses can help us understand the evolution of social behaviors in humans and other animals.For much of the book, Dawkins uses game theory to show how differing strategies can come to coexist in populations. He does this with strategies of physical aggression (\\"hawk\\", \\"dove\\", \\"bully\\" etc.). He uses this approach to explain how the sexes could have evolved and to analyze the interactions of various mating and infant-care strategies.Dawkins also presents mathematical analyses that can explain the evolution of altruistic behaviors--i.e., behaviors that promote the survival of others while reducing the chances of survival of the altruistic individual. Here the analysis is based on the fundamental understanding that natural selection ultimately operates at the level of genes rather than organisms.In the process of natural selection, random mutation creates differing alleles (versions) of genes that create different varieties of a feature (e.g. different eye colors, or different levels of aggression). The alleles that endow the organism with characteristics that best serve to reproduce that allele become increasingly common in the population.By reducing the likelihood of survival, altruism reduces the likelihood of reproduction of individual organisms. However, an allele that creates an altruistic behavior could become common if that behavior benefited enough other individuals who also carried that allele: the process known as kin selection. For example, if an individual with one copy of an allele sacrificed its life to save the lives of two individuals who both carried one copy of that allele, the loss of the individual's copy would be compensated for by the preservation of the others' two copies. Altruistic acts toward closer relatives are more likely to be of benefit to an allele because closer relatives are more likely to also have that allele.In a similar vein, Dawkins elaborates the strategic advantages of reciprocal altruism and forgiveness using an analysis of \\"the prisoner's dilemma\\" trust gameAll of this makes for fascinating reading. However, Dawkins takes three linguistic and logical shortcuts that can lead the reader to misunderstand the process of natural selection.Dawkins makes the common mistake of referring to gene alleles as \\"genes.\\" Secondly, for much of the book he writes at the level of the individual organism rather than the allele. Thirdly, in order to make it easier to evaluate how specific strategies impact the frequency of the allele in the population, he writes as if genes--and animals--are thinking beings that consciously strategize with self-reproducing goals in mind.Dawkins sometimes points out when he is taking the logical shortcuts, and they don't compromise his analyses of specific strategies. However, he almost never restates his arguments in scientifically objective, allele-centered terms. As a result, these shortcuts can prompt the reader to create an incorrect mental model of natural selection in which human-like genes--and the individuals they control--are locked in a dog eat dog competition for dominance.Unfortunately, Dawkins himself seems to have succumbed to this misconception. On page 2 he writes: \\"I shall argue that the predominant quality to be expected in a successful gene is ruthless selfishness. This gene selfishness will usually give rise to selfish behavior.\\"Gene alleles don't have attitudes to other alleles of the same gene, they simply influence the characteristics of the individual who carries them. Indeed, only a fraction of genes have anything to do with social behavior. Is an allele for light hair in Northern Europe \\"selfish\\"?The alleles that become frequent in a population are the ones that code for characteristics that enhance their reproduction in the environment that the organism lives in. Most mutations produce alleles that reduce the viability of the organism and hence of the allele. If one wanted to attribute a quality to alleles that become prevalent it would be \\"lucky,\\" or \\"effective,\\" rather than \\"selfish.\\"When evolutionary theorists write of \\"survival of the fittest\\" they are referring to reproductive fitness, not the ability to win a fight. Indeed, Dawkins himself demonstrates how non-aggressive strategies can come to stably co-exist with aggressive ones in a population.That said, reading \\"The Selfish Gene\\" was a pleasurable, at times even enlightening, experience for this reviewer. I strongly recommend this book, especially if you don't already have a background in game theory or in the theory of kin selection.Just be careful to step around the pitfalls that Dawkins falls into."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"I can't talk much about the merit of Dawkins' specific evolutionary ideas (for example, his skepticism of Group Evolution Theory) since I'm not a biologist. I'm a physicist and decided I should learn a bit about evolution. I thought I understood it, but realized the richness of the theory through his amazing exposition. He starts right from the first molecule evolving in the primordial soup right up to humans. It really changes your perspective on things."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"I have read a few great books from Richard Dawkins and this one is equally amazing. The arguments the author talks about are very thought provoking. Recommended to any one interested in Evolution and its relatives."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"This book is a must read for everyone. Richard has done it again with this masterpiece. Apparent and fake purpose is destroyed and replaced with a blind natural selection where evolution takes place at the gene level."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"This is a GOOD book. The author presents an argument that through evolution, the real replicators and survivors of life (both animal and plant) are the genes. We humans (and all other species) simply provide a \\"survival mechanism\\" for these genes to operate and promulgate. He presents an analogy early in the book about how human programmers write software programs for a computer to play chess. After completion, the computer plays an opponent. The programmers can not intervene in the game. Their work is done. Also, when the programmers wrote the program, they could not anticipate every possible chess move in all possible contexts by an opponent and provide a singular move in answer. The combinations are much too large to analyze in such a way. So, the programmers set up guidelines and general \\"strategies\\". Newer programs even provide the ability for the program to \\"learn\\" by earlier moves in similar situations. This is how the author feels genes program us survival mechanisms to allow them (the genes) to spread (procreate) as often and as successfully as possible. Dawkins gives space to competing theories (mostly philosophic, sociologic, or anthropologic). Some reviewers have expressed pessimistic views; kind of like that old Peggy Lee song \\"Is that all there is\\". One reviewer even blames the book for his bouts of depression. I do not see the message as so negative although some \\"animal rights\\" proponents might be upset about what wild animals do to each other (both inter and intra species).Selfish Gene theory is one explanation (of course Dawkins would say the ONLY explanation) of how we organisms on the planet behave (why we feed and protect our offspring, how we choose when to fight and when to retreat, even why females have menopause and males fertility declines slowly. It may even give the genetic origin of why a courting man takes his date to dinner (and possibly why some men expect a reward for same). I know that Dawkins is a confirmed atheist but I do not find any objectionably strident atheism in this work. I WOULD say that he cavalierly says something like billions of years ago, in the primordial soup, along came some type of composite of atoms that could copy itself (my, what a lucky happenstance - the origin of life just kind of happened). If I were in Professor Dawkin's class, I would ask him \\"well, if the programmers programmed the computers to play chess, then who programmed the programmer? He would probably happily say \\"well, of course, their GENES programmed them\\". And I would say \\"well, Professor, who programmed the genes?\\""},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Behavior is passed along in genes. Richard Dawkins, the evolution biologist, presents a good case and lots of evidence. The book gives the reader a unique perspective of how creature's behavioral patterns propagate and enhance survival. For pleasure reading I still prefer his \\"God Delusion\\", a masterful mixture of logic, incite, and research."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"In this excellent book, professor R. Dawkins provides a logical overview of how evolutionary theory works and discusses its various mechanisms in detail. To be sure, prof. Dawkins advances a particular branch of the evolutionary theory - that of the selfish gene. In doing this, throughout the book he routinely compares the selfish gene theory to other competing branches of the theory. In doing these comparisons, however, he always provides a somewhat lengthy and most importantly a fair treatment of the competing theories. Indeed, I would say he goes out of his way to ensure that he doesn't misrepresent the others' theories.Unlike his later books, in which Dawkins focuses on attacking the proponents of the pseudoscience of Intelligent Design, and theists of all sorts, there are no such distractions in this book. Occasionally, prof. Dawkins provides commentary on ethics, morals, society and philosophy, but such commentary is kept to a minimum and are largely somewhat relevant to the theme of the book.Whether you are a novice to the evolutionary theory, or a biologist/scientist, this book was a joy to read. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"the book is a masterwork,It defacto changed some of the ways I look at things,the writing is good not over killing any-point but making them felt and each one count.

It gives you tools of critical thinking that can be applied to a myriad situations.A must read for anyone going into a field of biology or economics."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"The book is amazing. Dawkins does a great job of explaining the theory of evolution, and goes on to explain how it (or generalizations thereof) can be applied in completely different contexts, like that of memes.

I think that the majority of people misinterpret this book by the title of it. It could've easily also have been given the title 'The Altruistic Individual' for the majority of the book it discusses reciprocal altruisim, and why individuals are altruistic based on what it best for their genes. We are essientially gene machines, doing what's best for our genes; however, the genes have provided us with the ability to rebel against them (i.e contraception)Dawkins also introduces the theory of the meme. Basically, as genes are in natural selection and reproduction - so memes are to human selection and cultural reproduction.Buy the book! Amazing read!"},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"This book is just as exciting as it is groundbreaking. The idea behind it carries much weight and force, and is very hard to argue against. It is a universal fact that every organism's primary concern is survival, save for a few strange exceptions. Dawkins provides lucid metaphors and in depth explanations as to how evolution works from a genetic viewpoint, and how our behavior is ultimately aimed at propagating our genes.Dawkins talks alot about genes that determine behavior, or 'miss-firing' genes causing deviant or irregular behavior. I would agree that our genes may predispose us to inherit certain traits or behaviors to some extent, but our enviornment and other external influences undoubtedly contribute to effect our behavior as well.One concept I can't entirely agree with Mr. Dawkins on is that of Memes. Yes, ideas are spread from person to person, and they effect our culture, etc, but they are products of our own minds, not seperate entities. Also, a meme cannot be analyzed, nor does it have any specific substance, it seems to me like an imaginary thought replicator. To me the whole idea is so entirely subjective and speculative that I do not feel it is legitimate. However, his example of a meme that causes a fear of going to hell was a very good example. I prefer to name credulity and superstition as the causal factors.Overall, this book is very well written, and the examples given to support the selfish gene theory are superb. I highly recommend this book to anyone considering it, you won't be dissapointed!"},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"This is perhaps the most important modern book written about evolution, which is all I'll say on that front.It's also worth noting that it was written when Dawkins was still primarly a scientist, and stuck mainly to the science...now he's regressed (evolved in a new direction would be more accurate) into someone obsessed with something as inconsequential as religion."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"The Selfish Gene is the second Dawkins book now that I have not bothered to finish reading. In fact, I found myself looking upon my bookshelf wondering whether I could ever find the motivation to read another book. There is just something about the Dawkins writing style that crushes my excitement and fervour for learning. Upon reflection of this recent attempt, I feel that it may be the way he describes concepts. The Selfish Gene soars across some fairly difficult terrain and attempts the very difficult task of accurately dispensing, in lay terms, genetics and reproductive processes such as meiosis, evolution, selective pressures etc. That it is in lay terms is this book's greatest strength, but also its weakness. In order to ensure the reader grasps each concept, it is discussed in multiple ways using a range of metaphors. For some readers (myself included), the prose will frustrate as you gain a comprehension of the material and then grind though pages more about that same topic. I must point out however that I have previously studied genetics, evolution and biology in university so it is likely that my professors were standing on Dawkins' shoulders when they taught us. This is no doubt a significant contributor to my frustrations with the book - I already knew the topics in a scientific sense.So given the above one might ask why the rating. Well, the book isn't targeted at me, but at an audience not cognisant of the mechanisms of evolution. For the purpose for which it was written, and in with that in mind, I can see that this book would greatly enlighten the reader and I loved how he could explain things easily in a way that I've never been able to. Further, many other reviewers view the Selfish Gene as a classic of pop science and I would have to agree with that assessment, if only because of the overwhelming number of positive reviews."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Perhaps when this book first dropped 30 years ago as the blueprint for evolution it was considered radical. Today it's taken as a given that the primary motivating force for behavior has a genetic basis. This shift in attitude may be a direct result of the widespread influence of The Selfish Gene, but I wouldn't know. I wasn't around then. But this is a fine work to help everyone understand the core essence of human nature, and how we can use our superior capacity for reason to create a society of compassion that compliments our biological imperative.With the existence of such formidable works as this, it remains positively astounding that any debate should remain on the matter of Creationism, Intelligent Design or whatever transparent euphemism is currently fashionable amongst the fundamentalists so populous in rural regions.Of particularly acute interest to those seeking a slight edge in the competition of the fit should be chapter 9. This is something I most certainly will be passing on to those with whose success I have a genetic interest. Most, however, will never find their way to it, which suits me just fine. The less you know, the better it is for me. Hahahahaha!"},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Richard Dawkins is a figurehead not just for evolution, but for various other endeavors that are far more controversial (his militant atheism comes to mind). I cannot comment on him in those fields, but he is without a doubt a superb evolutionary biologist.Just as Stephen Hawking can make astrophysics accessible to the lay person without dumbing down the essential philosophy of it, Dawkins can accomplish the same with biology. Using a bevy of useful anaolgies and metaphors, as well as meticulously researched scientific evidence, the book walks us through evolution from its earliest period on the planet, up to the present day, and beyond. His \\"meme\\", revolutionary for its time and still a popular term today, remains a valuable insight into \\"cultural Darwinism\\" and how replicators need not be limited to the genes in living bodies."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"This book is not what I expected! I think that no other book has a more misleading reputation than The Selfish Gene. The irony is that Dawkins is nicknamed \\"Darwin's rottweiler\\" but his gene-centered theory of natural selection is thoroughly non-Darwinian. Darwin published Origin of the Species in 1859. The concept of the gene didn't gain acceptance until the early 1900s and the basis of Dawkin's gene-centered theory, molecular genetics, didn't develop until the 1950s and 1960s long after Darwin lived and died. So how does Dawkins pass off this book as a primer on Darwinian evolution? By crafting his faulty arguments exclusively in metaphor.Dawkins argues that genes are like pages in a book... and like oarsmen... and like primary policy makers, gamblers, master programmers, and extra-terrestrials from the Andromeda galaxy! Bodies are like survival machines, and like translocators, lumbering vehicles, processed food, and like gene machines guided by an executive simulator (that last bit is Dawkins-speak for the brain). Unless the reader is already grounded in evolutionary theory they will be quickly misled by the abuse of metaphor.150 years ago Darwin realized that animals and their environments are inextricably linked: animals run from predators and chase after prey, they forage for food, search for mates, endure cold, drought, disease, starvation and a thousand other insults. Darwin also recognized that each member of a species was just a little bit different from its peers and that that difference caused it to interact with the environment just a little bit differently. Darwin argued that those animals with traits that allowed them to better withstand nature's deadly assaults tended to reproduce a little more often. Those traits are hereditary and can gradually transform one species into another species better suited to its environment.Dawkins turns this familiar Darwinian theory on its head and counter proposes the gene-centered theory of evolution by natural selection. Unfortunately for Dawkins' thesis, genes don't interact with the environment so when he argues that genes are targets of natural selection he doesn't mean it in the conventional textbook sense, he means it in the whimsical Dawkins sense. And when Dawkins states that genes are \\"immortal\\" and that unchanging immortality makes them the \\"fundamental unit of natural selection\\" (i.e. change) Dawkins is deliberately founding his argument on a paradox. Genes can't change, they can't evolve, they don't interact with the environment and the gene-centered theory is nonsense but Dawkins will convince you otherwise by arguing about oars and Andromedans and bookcases.Whereas Darwin conceived of natural selection to explain speciation, Dawkins doesn't venture beyond micro-evolution. On the origins of sexual reproduction and multicellularity he does write a little but only very vaguely. If you put aside the science fiction bits about replicators, memes and whatnot, Dawkins doesn't have much to say about the big picture at all.I did enjoy this book though. In fact, I enjoyed it a lot because The Selfish Gene is consummately eccentric, fantastic and entertaining. Yes, The Selfish Gene is also deceptive and paradoxical but somehow that makes it all the more intellectually engaging. If you're looking for an introduction to evolutionary theory look elsewhere first and then come back to the Selfish Gene. It you're looking for a mish-mash of science, science fiction and hyperbole then look here first."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Anything by Dawkins is outstanding. He is one of the top biologists alive on the planet today."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Sometimes being 30 or more years behind the times allows one to read \\"classic\\" books and determine whether they stand the test of time. Richard Dawkins' \\"The Selfish Gene\\" does - sort of.The concept that all lifeforms are just \\"gene survival packets\\" is an interesting angle on genetics and evolution - one that is worthy of consideration and quite probably true. This is the principal value in reading this book - there isn't that much more which is insightful therein.Glad I read it, but it's a \\"sort of\\" classic."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"\\"God is a meme.\\" This simple idea destroys 200 generations of theological philosophizing. So why only four stars? Through no fault of Dawkins', this book, written over 30 years ago, is dated. I don't think it ranks as a theory of evolution, at best it is a hypothesis which Dawkins has a very hard time stating. There is so much quibbling in the initial chapters that I was close to giving up. I was reminded of early science writers who had to resort to \\"humors\\" and \\"ethers\\" to substantiate their theories.So, why four stars? Because Dawkins was on the point of \\"discovering\\" emergence. He actually used the word without realizing its full impact. The meme, of course, is the \\"motive power,\\" if you will, of the emergent next step beyond genes, what Dawkins calls the vehicle (for genes). If you believe in evolution beyond the Darwinian biological stage, emergence makes a lot of sense: from Big Bang to matter, to atoms, to stars, to galaxies in one direction and from atoms to molecules, to life forms, to intelligence, to technology and beyond in another. If you are interested in exploring emergence I can recommend \\"At Home in the Universe: The Search for the Laws of Self-Organization and Complexity\\" by Stuart Kauffman who argues that Darwinian evolution is necessary but not sufficient to account for evolution. For a look at future emergence, I recommend \\"The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence\\" by Ray Kurzweil who talks about our robotic descendants. Another excellent book related to emergence is \\"Deep Simplicity (Penguin Press Science)\\" by John Gribbin.BTW, deep simplicity is what \\"The Selfish Gene\\" lacks."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"I bought this book while I was on vacation in Florida; it kept me away from the beach, but made the trip so much better. This was my first real introduction to the theory of evolution by natural selection, it made me see the world in a whole new light. The selfish gene is an extraordinarily well written guide to evolution, I recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"This is one of the better works of popular science that I have read and serves as a great introduction to the workings of natural selection. I came to this book as a social scientist who has allowed myself to become woefully ignorant of natural science, and this book really helped me wrap my head around a number of complicated processes. Dawkins here proposes a new way of thinking about evolution. Previously many disputed over whether we should look at individual organisms or entire species as the fundamental units of analysis. A species approach would mean arguing that certain behavioral traits are prevalent because they are beneficial for the species as a whole, while an individual-centered approach interprets prevalent behaviors as advantageous to the individual organisms. Dawkins' approach is closest to the latter, but he argues that we should shift our level of analysis even further downward, to the genes themselves. He urges us to think of organisms as vehicles which genes manipulate to ensure their transmission down through the generations. The title of the book refers to this basic portrayal of genes as selfishly manipulating the behavior of their hosts so as to be passed on to the host's offspring. In other words, even though genes themselves aren't conscious agents, we should conceive of them as such, and any explanations of animal behavior that ignore this are incomplete.In the course of the book Dawkins uses this approach to attempt to understand many seemingly anomalous behavioral traits among different species. Some of the most fascinating parts of the book concerned the social insects, namely bees and ants. Dawkins also makes good use of game theory to demonstrate how certain behavioral \\"strategies\\" came to be selected. He introduces the useful idea of an \\"evolutionarily stable strategy\\" to explain the relative prevalence of certain behavioral traits among various species. This is basically a sort of equilibrium; any deviation from this equilibrium, which would come about if a particular trait became more prevalent, would be balanced the subsequent increase in rival traits.I would recommend this book to anybody seeking a clearly written, non-technical introduction to evolutionary theory. While it may seem clich&eacute; to praise an author for writing about complex subjects in an articulate, easily comprehensible fashion, Dawkins really does succeed in doing so. I just had a couple of concerns that forced me to detract a star. First, while Dawkins conscientiously tries to avoid mathematical exposition, at times his presentation would have benefited from being slightly more technical. This was particularly true when he introduced game theory to explain the prevalence of certain strategies. A simple chart showing the payoffs resulting from certain strategies would have made his argument much easier to follow (he does do this in a later chapter on the evolution of cooperation). Finally, there is a later chapter in which Dawkins tackles human culture. He uses the term \\"memes\\" to refer to the cultural equivalent of \\"genes\\". He wants to argue that the transmission of memes down through the generations is really comparable to genetic transmission. I really didn't find this chapter very persuasive, and it certainly didn't provide me with any better understanding of cultural evolution than I had before. I think one could make an argument to the effect that culture evolves through similar mechanisms as natural organisms do, but Dawkins doesn't do it here. Nevertheless, this chapter that I am criticizing is rather peripheral and its weaknesses don't detract from the overall book. Overall, this was a very informative, well-argued introduction to evolutionary theory."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Richard Dawkins does a masterful job of teaching some elementary biology to the layman. The first three or so chapters do a great job of teaching the basics of evolution and the origins of life, while the rest of the book brings to the table a whole new way of seeing life, not as an attempt from individuals to survive and pass on their genes, but as an act of selfishness on the part of the genes themselves.This is a very fascinating read, and I highly recommend it to anyone, whether you want to learn about evolution, about the incredible mechanisms which are responsible for life, or the captivating \\"selfish gene\\" theory."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"I read the 30th anniversary edition of the book, from what I can tell the anniversary edition only contains a new short introduction and some review extracts. I kind of wish that Dawkins would have added some new additional footnotes, because the notes from the second edition were great, Dawkins better explained some things and even admitted in a few places where he was wrong. With this being 20 years after the second edition, surely even more has changed.This book so far is my favorite from Dawkins. His tone is far less assertive and arrogant than his later books, he'll often times admit when something is just his idea and that it very well could be wrong. In this one he's trying to bring more attention to the selfish gene theory, he takes a more cautious approach and tries to convince the reader this is correct and not so much that anyone who disagrees with him needs to be conquered. Also until the end his usual religious rants are completely absent and even then its only a few brief pages.This book helped to popularize the gene theory and introduced the concept of the meme and regardless of anyone's views of the two ideas, Dawkins influence from this book is enough to at least be a little respected. For me personally, I do think the selfish gene theory is plausable and Dawkins does present a good case, although I don't know near enough to actually have a valid opinion. In the end I really wish Dawkins would have stayed more like this, he seems to ramble more in later books and is more concerned with eradicating the world of creationists and theists than writing books for people who accept evolution and want to learn more about it. I have high hopes that The Extended Phenotype is more of the same (even if the reviews I've read seem to indicate that it will be over my head)."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"A biological concept explained is surprisingly easy way. In nutshell, it is about Darwin's Theory of Natural Selection at gene level. But book does contain a lot more details and useful observation at gene as well at individual organism level."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"\\"The Selfish Gene\\" is Richard Dawkins most notorious book. Many have heard about it and read disjointed quotes from it. Few have read the whole book. Parts of it do live up to the bad expectations, as when the author says: \\"Let us try to teach some altruism, because we are born selfish\\".Indeed, this anniversary edition has a foreword of the mea culpa type, in which Dawkins points out that he voted Labour at the time of writing the book (i.e. he voted Wilson and Callaghan) and later opposed Margaret Thatcher's Tory government. He also admits that the metaphor \\"selfish gene\\" can and have been grossly misunderstood, and that the book should perhaps have been titled \\"The Eternal Gene\\" or \\"The Altruist Vehicle\\". The problem with the book, really, is that Dawkins - despite the best of intentions - isn't always clear on whether \\"selfish gene\\" *is* a metaphor, or whether it's in some sense to be taken in the vernacular sense (as in the quote above). Besides, in a competitive-capitalist society, it's inevitable that the expression will be taken in its vernacular, literal, everyday sense, rather than in the more philosophical sense sometimes intended by the author. Selfish genes do conjure up pictures of a Hobbesian war of all against all, or at the very least of Adam Smith (the Adam Smith of \\"Wealth of Nations\\" for those versed in the Adam Smith Probleme).So what does Dawkins mean, then, when he talks about \\"selfish genes\\" or \\"the tyranny of selfish replicators\\"? The idea of selfish genes does mean that there is no pure altruism among living organisms, at least not among non-human animals. All cooperation is ultimately based on the self-interest of individual organisms or their genes. Essentially, there are two kinds of \\"altruism\\" in nature. Genetic altruism is directed at close kin, as when birds act as helpers at the nest, aiding their parents and siblings (and hence their own genes). Another classical example of genetic altruism is the curious phenomenon of sterility among the worker castes in social insects. Reciprocal altruism is directed towards non-kin, such as flock members. Gregarious birds warning one another of an approaching predator (or bird-watcher) are a good example. Here, the altruism is based on \\"I scratch your back, you scratch mine\\". Thus, all cooperation and seeming altruism in nature is really nepotism or the give-and-take of favours among competitors.In contrast to more doctrinaire sociobiologists, Dawkins admits that pure altruism is both possible and desirable among humans. Humans are products of natural selection, but they are unusual in the sense that their intelligence makes it possible for them to counteract the very same natural selection when they see fit. Dawkins have been criticized for being philosophically inconsistent on this point, but this *is* his point. His political opinions are (by US standards) \\"liberal\\" or even \\"radical-liberal\\", so he clearly believes that it's desirable for humans to cooperate in truly altruistic ways.Personally, I'm not so sure whether pure altruism is absent from non-human animals. Just one example: what about brown bears adopting orphaned bear cubs? Isn't that pure altruism? Dawkins and other Neo-Darwinists believe that natural selection only works on individuals or individual genes, but things could get more interesting if we also acknowledge group selection and selections on even higher levels. If nature is viewed as a holistic system, the question of altruism would have to be posed anew. Besides, the fact that genetic, reciprocal and \\"real\\" altruism are balanced in nature, is a positive discovery, not something to deny, frown upon or commit intellectual suicide over. Had I been religious, I would have dubbed it Providence!Unfortunately, all too many Neo-Darwinists have taken a somewhat different tack on the matter. Often, they deny that individual acts of \\"pure\\" altruism can exist at all, even among humans. They paint genetic or reciprocal altruism in a bad light (since when is reciprocity bad?) and contrast it to the pristinely pure Sermon on the Mount. Since natural selection doesn't favour the latter, we supposedly live in a dark, Hobbesian world without end. Am I the only one who detects a certain perverse glee in the writings of such people?I don't believe Richard Dawkins belongs to that crowd. However, his private philosophy doesn't square very well with his scientific convictions. And as long as they don't, I'm afraid Dawkins will continue making up self-contradictory metaphors..."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"I'm an avid math/science pleasure reader, so I picked this book up one day when I was at my local bookstore. I'm glad I did.Dawkins' main thesis here is that the gene is the fundamental unit of biological reproduction and that all biological phenomenon can be better understood if we look at what benefits genes as opposed to individuals. While arguing his thesis, Dawkins discusses biological relatedness and how it ultimately guides the behavior of individuals; why 'kin altruism' is so prevalent, for example. He also discusses the conflict of interest between certain genes and how that dynamic ultimately plays out from an evolutionary standpoint. He also introduces the concept of 'memes', which is interesting, if largely speculative.The writing style is also pretty good and usually interesting, though it lags occasionally.This is a good Dawkins book and certainly recommended to anyone who has an interest in biology/evolution. While I won't say this is the absolute best book I've ever read, it's probably one that I'll end up re-reading at some point.4.5/5"},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Almost anyone is impressed by life's immense variety. Back in the 19th century only a few educated people ventured how this diverseness came about. It was not even deemed necessary. Life had probably been the same at least after the Great Flood. God had mysterious reasons for designing the world as it was. Amateur naturalist and keen observer Charles Darwin was to offer an alternative explanation. His ideas overturned all views about the subject, but evidence to support them was scanty.Mendel's studies on heredity, the discovery of molecular genetics, and a constantly growing body of paleontological findings have nurtured neo-Darwinian school of thought: life's diversity in Earth is the result of billions of years of hereditary evolution through natural selection.Thirty years after its first edition, The Selfish Gene, by Richard Dawkins is still exciting and inspiring reading. It raises an intriguing question: what does natural selection pick out? And it gives a riveting answer: natural selection chooses those genes that outdo their pairs (alleles) regarding longevity, fecundity and copying fidelity, to achieve this, genes collaborate with other genes in making and sustaining vehicles likely to survive and reproduce, thus passing copies of the gene to their progeny. Genes are different from vehicles in that they are able to make exact copies of themselves. Diversity among analogous genes (portions of DNA big enough to have a definite genetic function but small enough to avoid splitting and recombination), and the resulting diverseness in their phenotypic effect is a precondition for natural selection to promote evolution.The catch phrase selfish gene, underlines the fact that if one takes the gene's point of view nothing really matters that does not maximize the number of faithful copies of each particular gene that are produced and passed to the vehicle's offspring.The book is an all-times classic, still totally up-to-date. It is in no need of any restorative work whatsoever. The 30th anniversary edition adds no new material to the 1989 second edition, apart from a new introduction by the author. Chapters 12 and 13 and end notes where an opportune addition to the first edition after a 12-year exposure to praise and criticism and Dawkins' 1982 book The Extended Phenotype. If you have not read The Selfish Gene you will surely find it instructive and pleasing; if you already did, it will be thought-provoking to do it again. The anniversary edition is in any case a good add-on to your library."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Hacia el Buda desde el occidente: Sus Ensenanzas sin mitos ni misteriosI read this book for the first time in the 80's and found it excellent; it is quite well placed in number nine of the Discover Magazine 2006 list of Greatest Science Books of All Time. When Dawkins first published his book back in 1976, he wrote that, though the theory of evolution was generally recognized and barely doubted then, \\"the full implications of Darwin's revolution had yet to be realized.\\" I feel positively that those implications are now absolutely realized and only religious fanatics dare to question natural selection. This quantum leap in universal understanding is due in a large proportion to The Selfish Gene. Dawkins not only explained Darwin's selection but also expanded it backward in time with sound clarifications to the emergence of the first self-replicable molecule and forward to the recent time through imaginative elucidations about the replication of cultural characteristics through what he calls \\"memes.\\" Memes, the social equivalences of biological genes, is a word the author created and is nowadays of common use in social sciences.When I became seriously interested in the Teaching of Siddhattha Gotama, the Buddha, there were a few notions in common between the Teachings of the ancient sage and the assertions of the modern biologist--the inexistence of metaphysical essences in living beings, the purposelessness of life as a phenomenon, the \\"undivine\\" nature of morality--that I decided to read once more The Selfish Gene. In a material universe, how or where does Buddhist reincarnation fit with Dawkins's biology? Here I have my own interpretation (which the bright English scientist most probably does not share). Each gen or, better said, the design in it coded, is eternal. Says Dawkins: \\"Each gen leaps from body to body in its own way and for its own ends, abandoning a succession of mortal bodies before they sink in senility and death. The genes are the immortals, or rather, they are defined as genetic entities that come close to deserving the title\\". So, the much talked reincarnation or rebirth of some Eastern religions could be well assimilated to body-to-body transmission of genetic information, instead of some kind of mysterious energy or metaphysical essence. Enough of that! My biological interpretation of Buddhist reincarnation does not add a bit to the wonder of this book. The Selfish Gene is just superb."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Given the sloppy research and broad proclamations in Dawkins' more recent books (a tendency I'm tempted to attribute to arrogance, for a variety of reasons I shall not get into here), it is something of a shock to go back and read his older work, which, despite being a work of 'popular science,' is rigorous in its logic and actually contributed a great deal to changing the modern understanding of how evolution works in the long haul. People could debate all day about which of his books are the 'best,' but certainly nothing more provocative and influential has issued forth from his pen than his first work, The Selfish Gene. Even a cursory glance through the negative reviews here will serve as a testament to the power of its ideas: this book forces us to rethink so many of our fundamental assumptions about life, the universe, and everything (rest in peace, Douglas Adams!). Many people on here find the implications of the ideas on display here frightening, and perhaps even dangerous. This is to be expected: it provoked much wonderment and thought in me, a staunch atheist. I can't imagine how alien the world of the selfish gene must seem to the religious temperament. But I digress. Many of the positive reviews are VERY positive, and this is a cherished book for many people. My point here is, first, that the ideas introduced here are important, and, second, they're introduced very well.It would be impossible for me to do justice to the ideas contained in this book, and so I won't even bother. But the fundamental argument and worldview of this book is worth discussing briefly, if superficially. When this book was published in the late seventies, naive ideas about evolution, such as group selection theory, were wide-spread, and so a distorted image of what Darwinism really amounted to was continually encountered. Enter Richard Dawkins, who argued that our conventional understanding of life was upside-down: rather than thinking of evolution as groups of organisms or even individual organisms using genes to replicate themselves, perhaps genes were using individual organisms to replicate themselves. That is, Dawkins argued that the primary unit of selection was not the group, or even the individual, but the gene itself, in the long run. Genes are not the tools organisms use to make copies of themselves; rather, replicating molecules build increasingly efficient vehicles for delivering themselves through the generations in any given environment, and this process of increasing efficiency is called evolution. This ultimately reduces organisms from the main actors in the play of life to mere \\"survival machines\\" (Dawkins' term) being indirectly manipulated by their genes.It is obvious that this stabs at the core of the uneasiness and fright some people feel when they are engaging this work: according to Dawkins, we are robots, or puppets. Dawkins uses both metaphors in this work to describe organisms, but the one he really runs with is the metaphor of organisms as robots. Needless to say, people don't like being classified as \\"gigantic lumbering robots.\\" For the religious, the objection is obvious: they believe humans to be animals with souls. But even many secularists have raised their eyebrows as the oft-quoted passages comparing organisms to robots. But, as Dawkins notes, robots are not necessarily the clumsy, mindless clods of old science-fiction shows, and if we are puppets, he says, we can at least understand our strings. Needless to say he goes out of his way to disassociate himself from genetic determinism or the establishing of any kind of morality: Dawkins is not here to preach, but to present a conceptual framework for understanding the mysteries of evolution.The central metaphor of the book, however, is that of the eponymous selfish gene. Of course, genes are microscopic molecules and thus can't be consciously selfish, but they act AS IF they were. So anthropomorphic language runs throughout the work. While Dawkins often introduces extended metaphors, he never lets them run wild and take over the work. In the case of the selfish gene, selfishness is defined in a purely behavioral manner, so there are no real problems introduced by this. The selfish gene exploits every available opportunity to replicate more efficiently and spread throughout the local gene pool.As said before, I'm not going to relay the various arguments in this book, but I do want to give potential readers a basic outline of this book, so that they understand that scope of the material discussed here:Chapters 1 - 3 discuss basic stuff in biology, from a certain theory about the origin of life (he intentionally uses different origin theories in each of his books, due to our lack of knowledge in that area) to basic discussions on cell biology and the function of DNA. Chapter 4 sets up selfish gene theory through a basic discussion of what 'behavior' is. Chapter 5 discusses animal aggression and its relationship to such concepts as dominance hierarchies and ESSs (Evolutionarily Stable Strategies, an application of game theory expanded upon in a later chapter). Chapter 6 explores how individual altruism (a strange observation in the cut-throat world of Darwinian ruthlessness) can be explained through gene selfishness. Chapters 7 and 8 discuss kin selection, with 8 focusing squarely on parent-offspring relations. Chapter 9 talks about sexual selection and exploitation. Chapter 10 focuses on reciprocal altruism. Chapter 11, the final chapter in the original edition, introduces the now famous ideas of cultural replicators, or memes. In the book's second edition in 1989 Dawkins tacked on two chapters to the end, which, I think, are also two of the best. Chapter 12 takes a closer look at game theory and how it relates to our understanding of evolution. And chapter 13 reproduces in abbreviated form the central argument of his second work, The Extended Phenotype, which argues that the effects of genes can ultimately be described as influencing things outside of the individual organism as well, if very indirectly (of course, as Dawkins points out, the genetic influence on the organism is itself indirect, if to a much lesser extent).I hope that this review might serve its purpose of giving undecided customers some hint as to the richness and breadth of scope in this work. I hope everyone reads this book. Now, it isn't perfect: Dawkins has edited almost nothing from this work, leaving it virtually untouched, so that what you read in the first eleven chapters in 2010 was all there in 1976 as well. What this inevitably means is that some of Dawkins' speculations have been shown to be false over time. Most of these errors were pointed out in the voluminous end-notes added in the second addition of the work (Dawkins never failed to point it out when he is wrong about something, which is something I can really respect-- here is a thinker with integrity), although some, such as the correct function of surplus DNA, were only discovered recently, so that they escaped mention in this book. It is fairly easy to get up-to-date on all this, and there are no shortage of people who love to point out where exactly Dawkins is wrong on something. So be sure to supplement this book with some minor research if you care about keeping your understanding current. Also, the chapter on memes is admittedly sketchy (although many see more value in the idea than I do), and some sections of this work, especially when he is discussion the origins of life, are contentious. Keep this in mind. But you'd be hard-pressed to find a more important and readable introduction to both Darwinism and selfish gene theory than this.This third edition of the work, released in 2006, doesn't really add anything to the central text, like the huge overhaul of the second edition, but it restores all previous introductions, forewords, and prefaces, and adds a new one for this 30th anniversary edition. Also included are extracts from reviews of the work. This is really like an Ultimate Edition of The Selfish Gene, and if you've never read before, I advise you to read it now. At worst, it'll give you some interesting ideas to chew on. At best, it'll give you a whole new perspective on life. Read it."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"The first thing I will say about The Selfish Gene (TSG) is that it is not the first book on evolution you should read although as a Dawkins book it is not a bad choice but for those unfamiliar with both, then I would suggest Climbing Mount Improbable or The Blind Watchmaker first. Both of those books by Dawkins have a much broader, more generalized, look at natural selection and evolution.TSG is an entirely different type of book because it is particularly academic and a very complex read on specific lines of reasoning that are even aimed at correcting the misconceptions of big name professional biologists. It assumes that the reader will be somewhat acquainted with Darwinism and evolution. If you are not then I would strongly urge that you pass on TSG until you do. In fact, you will bring much more to TSG and get much more out of it if you spend time on his above mentioned works first. I would also suggest Darwin's own \\"The Origin of Species\\" if you can.The reason for doing this is that during the 1970s TSG entered midway into a battle within evolutionary theory to settle some disputes and to make this version of Darwinism accessible to the general reader. If you don't know much about why TSG was needed in the first place then I don't think it will make that much sense to read it now. If, however, you understand what is going on previous to it and how it is presently used, then TSG becomes mandatory reading but it is not like Dawkins other works except for maybe the sequel to TSG, The Extended Phenotype, that should be treated the same way as TSG and certainly not read before this very progressive book on evolution.The Selfish Gene is a massive assault on evolutionary biologists who explained behaviour by using phrases like \\"for the good of the species\\". Dawkins and most of his English contemporaries from the time of R.A Fisher's \\"The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection\\" (1930) and the modern synthesis had difficulties in trying to explain altruism in terms of Darwinism, like why some organisms in the struggle for survival appear not to struggle for themselves but for other organisms. Many biologists aligned with the work of V. C. Wynne-Edwards on a mathematical model for group selection to explain this problem. This was a bold step away from Darwin's view, and the established scientific evolution model of the individual as the unit of selection, not the group. Darwin had speculated on group selection very briefly in The Descent of Man but to actually incorporate it into Darwinian evolution almost seemed contrary to natural selection. Yet the Wynne-Edwards math that groups could be selected was good on paper and so many believed that altruism could be solved this way.What they didn't know was that an alternative explanation for altruism was emerging around the same time as the Wynne-Edwards model. This alternative explanation for altruism did not require group selection. This alternative was called Kin Selection and was developed by W.D Hamilton in a paper called The genetical evolution of social behaviour (1964). TSG can be best described as a book popularizing an explanation of Hamilton's discoveries. While Hamilton had found a very elegant solution to altruism it came with a price that Dawkins and many of his colleagues are asking us to take and in a way it's not entirely different from the leap that Wynne-Edwards wanted but this jump in evolutionary thought is certainly nowhere near as startling as group selection. The jump is this. We need to develop the concept of the individual as the unit of selection to include the gene.There is much to favour the view that we should take a gene-centred view of evolution but Dawkins stresses that we are not really moving from the individual as the unit of selection at all, just seeing it in a new way. G. C. Williams in Adaptation and Natural Selection (1966) had already challenged group selection. So had the very influential Maynard Smith who was developing the ESS (evolutionary stable strategy) through game theory and applying it to evolution. E. O Wilson had just finished writing \\"Sociobiology\\" and was battling fellow scientists in his own university over whether we should really be subjecting human social behavior to the science of evolution. Dawkins TSG thus emerges in the middle of this poignant moment as a vehicle to see the matter of Hamilton's work firmly through to finish. For anyone interested in evolution, it is not only worth every bit of the effort, but mandatory reading.It makes it all the more interesting that for such an important read there is very little Dawkins in TSG at all. In fact Dawkins writes significantly about everyone else in evolutionary thought except himself. He is like the Francis Bacon of the 20th century, extolling on so much and unselfishly on the work of others that he has little time to say much about his own thoughts on evolution except for the shortest chapter on the concept of the meme as a cultural example of natural selection at work outside of the gene.There are two editions of TSG and the 30th anniversary edition with a new forward. It is important to at least get the second edition as there are two fresh new chapters spanning some extra 60 pages plus a fist of new notations at the back to explain his position more clearly, update us on current findings, correct some errors and validates some hypothesis as now theories. It is actually probably due another update. The first edition doesn't have this and the meme chapter was the chapter that closed the first edition of this book. Anyhow the 30th anniversary edition does it all.Chapter 1 - Why are people?Dawkins brings up morality in relation to Darwinism and defines altruism along with explaining the Darwinian version of behaviour. There is some basic outlines of natural selection and this books sets up the question of why altruism? Wynne-Edwards/Robert Ardrey/ Konrad Lorenz (although Lorenz gets lots of better press for other discoveries later in TSG) group selection is introduced as the alternative to individual selection (albeit wrongly as Dawkins notes). G. C. Williams's work is used to start countering group selection.Chapter 2 - The ReplicatorsDawkins describes how molecules build up in evolution, DNA replication and ideas of competition between replicators.Chapter 3 - Immortal CoilsDawkins looks at the origins of replication, A. G. Cairns-Smith's crystal hypothesis are given as possible candidates, DNA sequences in terms of genes are explained by analogy of books and pages, mutations are brought into the scene along with the unit of selection and the evolution of biological complexity. Peter Medawar's views on gene selection, death and cancer are intriguing.Chapter 4 - The Gene MachineSurvival, multicellular life, genes and behaviour, communication between genes and behaviour, the emergence of consciousness, the brain as a supercomputer, evolving strategies launches TSG into the heart of its subject matter. Here Dawkins as ethologist gives specific examples of these in action. Insects and colonies are his speciality. Mimicry as a strategy is explained along with predator prey interactions.Chapter 5: Aggression: Stability and the Selfish MachineDeveloping more on predator prey interactions the terminology of \`cost-benefit' brings us to Maynard Smith and his Evolutionary Stable Strategy (ESS) that governs behaviour. The ESS is a mind blowing package of evolutionary development that expands the field considerably. Organisms are pre-programmed biological units that are also pre-programmed to behave and respond to situations. This is all about the chance of pay-offs against losses. Various strategies are explained and given examples in nature. Applied game theory transforms Darwinism into a whole new dynamic. Dawkins talks about his mentor ethologist Niko Tinbergen.Chapter 6: GenesmanshipDawkins now moves onto Kin selection. At this stage in the book the reader will have to have their thinking cap on to follow through the strategies that become somewhat mathematical. It also looks at how genes compete or cooperate among themselves. The coefficient of relatedness is explained.Chapter 7: Family PlanningThis is about the evolution of parental care, population sizes, birth-rates and the ecology of David Lack. This is also aimed at dispensing with group selection.Chapter 8: Battle of the GenerationsDawkins expands on parental care and stratagems related to it. R. L. Trivers gene concepts are brought into the picture and parental investment (P.I) is discussed along with parent-offspring conflicts. Zahavi is made known but plays a more important role later. Deception and deceptive traits are brought up so we can see the evolution of cheating.Chapter 9: Battle of the SexesNow it is time for the evolution of sex and how to define sex, most it based on R.A Fisher's work. The role of the sexes becomes evident in that battle. Trivers is used to enlarge on it and again the gene plays a central role in understanding it. Zahavi's handicap principle will stimulate thoughts on sexual selection.Chapter 10: You Scratch My Back I'll Ride On YoursHamilton's work is able to produce geometries that look like group selection based on selfish gene principles. Altruistic signals may even be selfish without invoking kin selection such as in cave theory and \`never break rank'. Next comes what is maybe the hardest part of the book, the evolution of slave-making species with respect to sex ratios. Heads will be left spinning and even Dawkins says his is. The evolution of symbiosis is developed upon this and then the classic puzzle of the Prisoner's Dilemma is played out.Chapter 11: Memes: The New ReplicatorsThis is about the possibility that natural selection is not just limited to the gene and suggests that culture goes through a very similar selection process that becomes embedded in people's minds and is transmitted from brain to brain. These cultural memes can serve their own purpose and may not be to our benefit. Dawkins looks at religion and invokes memes as a possible explanation. The author is clear though that this is a hypothesis and is using it mostly to show how natural selection is not just limited to the gene. Effectively this chapter ended the first edition and Dawkins maintains that humans can fight against any selfish problems that we have to live a better life.Chapter 12: Nice Guys Finish FirstThis is an addition and is part of the second edition. This is mostly about Robert Axelrod's experiments with the Prisoner's Dilemma and how it applies to biology and focuses on the tit-for-tat strategy and how it competes with others. Do you cooperate or do you defect? Great game theory.Chapter 13: The Long Reach of the GeneThis is a synopsis of his second book The Extended Phenotype (EP). You could really drop this chapter and just pick up EP except that he does recap TSG for the last few pages so at least try to read that if you can. It will also give you a taste of. In a way this is not saying anything scientifically new about what phenotypes are and do except to add how the selfish gene extends outwards to interact with the environment and other organisms. Dawkins might be offering an innovative approach to dealing with biological evolution.So, to sum it up, group selection is declared dead, Darwin's principles are still alive, the gene is perfectly compatible with evolution and this view brings much more.TSG is a radically sweeping revolutionary evolutionary thought to see the gene as the unit of selection. Whatever you might think of this, one thing is for certain, the group selectionists didn't see the group rejectionists coming with TSG and even 30 years later haven't manage to displace the selfish gene view. What arguments they have had are as weak as the group selectionist model that they depended on. TSG makes a solid case that the alternative view from the gene strongly infers answers to altruism and may quicken the pursuit for the origins of evolution itself from the view of chemical replicators. For those who can accept it, this is probably the new face of evolution.At the same time we should mention weaknesses as the argument does challenge the traditional concept of the unit of selection as the individual because in some cases the genes need not be in the individual. Apparently duplicate genes in another individual qualify and the concept even goes further to say genes helping other genes symbiotically as per EP are to be considered as part of individual. That's a very big thing to say. Yet Darwin didn't get the concept of genes when he described natural selection. Any scientist who takes the selfish gene very carefully by conserving the unit of selection as the individual would, quite frankly, be on the right side of Darwinian evolution and even the Neo-Darwinian movement of the modern synthesis... but is probably missing out on much. If someone says that the unit of selection is the individual, you cannot say they are wide of the mark, but it looks like they have to turn to the gene to explain certain instances of altruism. In TSG Dawkins is trying to say that they are the same thing However in his next book, EP, Dawkins clearly works to overthrow overemphasising the unit of selection as the individual. He even goes as far to say that it is wrong and gives reasons (such as meioses). The only true unit of selection is the replicator and in Dawkins view that can only mean the gene. What we really need to ask for now though is what is the evidence for the selfish gene?In reality the evidence for models outside of the individual as the unit of selection are quite scant, but the gene as unit of selection does have direct evidence to support it. The evidence for group selection is controversial and after 30 years they haven't made much ground. Simply put, there doesn't appear to be much of a debate anymore even if some group selectionists make some noise (it looks like they just don't understand the concept of kin selection). There is evidence for the selfish gene but does this mean we should accept the revaluation of the unit of selection to include the gene? It appears we should. As a note, group selectionists need to do a lot better to try and match this kind of quality science and do not do themselves one bit of justice by trying to discredit it with scare-tactics and ambiguity. Saying things like every other possible unit of selection except for the gene can be the unit of selection doesn't help anything.We have one other question to ask. Does the selfish gene model include all genetic information and does all behaviour need to invoke the selfish gene? I can't help but remember that even Dawkins shows how Hamilton didn't have to invoke gene selection to explain altruism in terms of the individual as the unit selection. Imagine if all altruism was explained this way. The selfish gene might be relegated to a very small minor role in evolution. You are best to reserve judgement on how far reaching the selfish gene model actually is until you look more at EP. EP really is where the argument is at, but TSG helps set up the basic premise that the gene view of evolution is the answer to many outstanding questions in evolution.Another thing to note is that creationists have never been able to produce an alternative science to this model. No matter how they may critic it, complain wrongly that it is genetic determinism or dislike his use of metaphors, they cannot refute the math in his cited peer-review nor can they offer a substitute science.Not to end with a critic I would like to add that TSG is quite possibly the most important book on evolution next to Fisher's \\"The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection\\" which is only trumped by Darwin's publications. I don't think I am wrong with that praise."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Dawkins uses a very interesting strategy that I've not seen before in trimming down a book that could be a little too long: Putting a lot of statements that would have worked just fine as endnotes as endnotes. This has cut a lot of fat out of the book and made a very dense topic a lot more approachable.In trying to make the text approachable, he has also not used a single equation in the whole text-- even though he could have saved a lot of space by simply taking the route of using an equation. There would not have been much diminshment.Lastly, he gives a balanced presentation by including the contrary arguments of some researchers in the field and by rebutting/ addressing those points (rather just neglecting to mention them). This is done in such a way that it is neither too abstruse nor a dismissal out of hand.Making a 250 plus page text on the whether natural selection takes place at the genotypic level or the phenotypic level is a Herculean (and laudable) task in and of itself.

Dawkins did not write in an interesting or fun fashion and my interest was largely driven by the content, in other word this was a highly intelligent book that was somewhat arduous to read. I cannot recommend this book for the general reader. For these readers I strongly recommend Dawkins's The Greatest Show on Earth."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Selfish Genes = Altruistic phenotypes?Many people who have never read the book (and strangely a few who apparently have) misunderstand the phrase 'Selfish Gene' to mean a gene that causes people to be selfish. Actually, the selfishness referred to a (metaphoric) quality of genes themselves, selfishly causing their own survival and replication.Ironically, as Dawkins discusses, the selfishness of the gene can actually result in altruism at the level of the organism or phenotype. This is because, where altruism is directed towards kin, this can aid the replication of genes shared through common descent among relatives.Nevertheless, Dawkins clearly sees organisms as fundamentally selfish - albeit a selfishness tempered by a large dose of nepotism. To some extent he mitigates this view in more recent ('extended') editions (those published since 1989 ten years after the publication of the original) by the addition of a further chapter on reciprocal altruism (Chapter 12: 'Nice guys finish first') a subject he had already dealt with less extensively in chapter 10 ('You scratch my back, I'll ride on yours'). In this additional chapter, he essentially summarises the work of Axelrod (The Evolution of Cooperation: Revised Edition).This additional chapter, along with Chapter 13 ('The long reach of the gene' which summarises Dawkins' ownThe Extended Phenotype: The Long Reach of the Gene (Popular Science)), though interesting in their own right, unfortunately, tagged on the end, interrupt the flow and conclusion of the work. The book probably works best, in a literary sense at least, in its original form.The 'Genes-Eye-View'Dawkins takes the so-called 'genes-eye-view' of evolution to its logical conclusion. To this extent, contrary to accepted opinion, Dawkins' work is not only a popularisation but actually breaks new ground theoretically.Maynard Smith (1964) talked of kin selection by analogy with group selection. Even William Hamilton (1964) talked largely of the direct, indirect and inclusive fitness of organisms. Dawkins, however, takes this line of thinking to its logical conclusion and looks not at the fitness or reproductive success of organisms - but the replication of genes themselves.Though he stridently rejects group-selectionism, he replaces this, not with the familiar individual selection of classical Darwinism, but rather with a focus on selection at the level of the gene itself.Humans, Memes and Escaping the Tyranny of Selfish ReplicatorsAlthough much of the interest (and no little of the controversy) in this work flowed from its potential application to human behaviour, humans (a \\"rather aberrant species\\" in which Dawkins professes to be \\"not really very directly interested in\\": Dawkins 1981 at p556) are actually mentioned only rarely. Indeed, most of the discussion is theoretical, actual animal behaviour is described only for illustrative purposes, and even these illustrative examples often involve simplified hypothetical creatures (e.g. 'hawks' and 'doves') rather than real organisms.Where he does mention humans, it is often to point out the extent to which this species apparently fails to confirm to Darwinian predictions. For example, at the end of his chapter on sexual selection (Chapter 9: Battle of the Sexes) he observes that, among humans, it is women who seemed more concerned with what he terms 'sexual advertising' (p164-5). (An explanation for this may be that, among humans, male-male competition has historically taken the form of intra-sexual selection rather than inter-sexual selection, i.e. male-male contests (fighting) rather than female choice: Puts 2010.)Chapter 11 ('Memes: the new replicators') - what was, in the original version, the final chapter - also focuses especially on humans. To a large extent this focuses again on the extent to which humans are an \\"aberrant species\\", being subject to cultural as well as biological evolution to a unique degree.However, Dawkins also claims that the principles of natural selection discussed in the rest of the book may apply to cultural evolution as much as to biological evolution and, in doing so, coins the concept of the meme as the cultural equivalent of a gene, passing between minds analogously to a virus (seeThe Meme Machine (Popular Science);Virus of the Mind: The New Science of the Meme;The Selfish Meme: A Critical Reassessment; andDarwinizing Culture: The Status of Memetics as a Sciencefor more recent discussions of the concept).While certainly interesting, I doubt memetics will ever be a serious science. One of the main factors governing the infectiousness of a given meme, is the extent to which the human mind is receptive to it and the human mind is itself a product of biological evolution. The key to understanding human behaviour, even cultural behaviour, is therefore how natural selection has shaped the human mind - in other words evolutionary psychology not memetics (Evolutionary Psychology: The New Science of the Mind (4th Edition)).Finally, Dawkins ends on an optimistic literary flourish, again emphasising the supposed uniqueness of humankind, claiming that \\"we, alone on earth, can rebel against the tyranny of the selfish replicators\\" (p201). Unfortunately, this ignores the fact that the \\"we\\" who are supposed to be rebelling (including our \\"conscious foresight\\" in which Dawkins places such faith) are ourselves a product of the same process of natural selection and of the same selfish replicators. Even the (alleged) desire to revolt must be a product of the same process.The problem with Dawkins' cop-out Hollywood-ending conclusion is therefore, as anthropologist Vincent Sarich is said to have observed, that Dawkins himself has \\"spent 214 pages telling us why that cannot be true\\" (seeStraw Dogs: Thoughts on Humans and Other Animals). The preceding 214 pages, however, remain an exciting, eye-opening and stimulating intellectual journey, even thirty years after their original publication.Dawkins R (1981) 'In defence of selfish genes' Philosophy, Vol. 56, No. 218.

Although many of the reviews point to the fact that \\"anyone\\" can read it, I doubt \\"anyone\\" would want to. Although he is very clear in his writing, it is still a dense book.

What first gave me pause--namely, that we are merely recycled, big-brained vehicles carrying the more important replicators--I now view more positively.

If you are new to science or if you are a young teen, I would recommend starting with The Magic of Reality and then moving on to The Greatest Show on Earth. Reading this one after those first two is a great way to put a lot of the picture together.You will often find yourself nodding along with the book as if these things are so obvious, Dawkins is merely pointing out things we already \\"knew\\".

Richard Dawkins' words describe a new way of viewing the evolution process, a view that describes genes as the principal contributor for the survival and progress of species. This selfish gene behavior can be explained, in part, thanks to mathematical's game theory, which is something simple to understand since the author provide a serie of examples. He also punctuates that the selfish gene can cooperate with other genes in order to be a evolutionary stable strategy (survive through time), so in that way Nice guys can truly finish first."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Richard Dawkins is my favorite author.

Richard Dawkins is a genius, and an outstanding author. I would recommend any one of his books to any person."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"it is basically the best non-fiction book that I have ever read. Even if you do not agree with the content, you would be amazed by the writing style."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"The first thing I want to say is how much respect I have for Richard Dawkins as a scientist, as a teacher, as a writer of fascinating prose, and as a person. He is a brilliant and courageous man who works hard to bring his knowledge and insights to all of us. For the record I have read six of his books and reviewed four of them. They are:The God Delusion (2006)The Ancestor's Tale: A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Evolution (2004)A Devil's Chaplain: Reflections on Hope, Lies, Science, and Love (2003)The Extended Phenotype: The Long Reach of the Gene (1982; 1999)The second thing I want to say is that The Selfish Gene is one of the landmark science books of the 20th century, and so I am pleased to see this 30th Anniversary Edition (from 2006) with a new introduction by Dawkins and some new footnotes.Rather than review the book as a whole, however, as has been done many times, in this review I want to concentrate on the central issue of the book, namely the question of \\"at what level does natural selection work?\\"Dawkins believes that the environment selects certain genes, or more properly speaking, suites of genes and therefore operates primarily at the level of the gene. I disagree and believe this is like saying that the public selects certain letters, or words, or sentences of words when buying a book. The words (or more properly the ideas represented by the words) are the reason the public selects a book, but what the public selects is nonetheless the book. Genes are like ideas in books. Ideas must appear in some medium, even if it is just word of mouth. Genes must appear in organisms, which are the products of both the genetic instructions and the environment in which they develop. Consequently genes help to produce individuals (or in the case of social insects, a group of individuals that can be seen as a single organism). Dawkins calls these individuals \\"survival machines.\\" In turn the environment selects certain survival machines that contain certain genes.Another way of expressing this is to say that the environment selects genes by proxy, that is, through the medium of the individual phenotype. The environment cannot directly affect the genes since the genes are safely encapsulated within the survival machine which does not in any Lamackian way communicate with them. The exception is when an electromagnetic particle hits the code and alters it, creating a mutation. The environment does not act on that altered code; instead it acts upon the individual that is born to carry that altered code or lack thereof.The individual gene itself (if we can speak of such a thing which is just a section of code) doesn't work in isolation. It is always allied for better or for worse with other sections of code. Certain sections of code are reproduced again and again because they are handy or work well with other sections of code in a way that allows the survival machine to reproduce and its offspring to reproduce. But the environment cannot select certain selections of code. It can only select the individual containing that code (and a lot of other code besides). In fact, it cannot just select the individual, it must select its possible mates and even much of its environment as well, such as the plants and animals it uses for food and shelter. To speak of selecting genes or even individual organisms is just a convenient way of talking.What is really selected is a group of organisms of some kind. Some consider an important group selected by the environment to be the species or the ecology. Giving a large enough perspective, I would go so far as to say (going beyond Lovecock and Gaia) that natural selection operates on the level of life itself.Another point is that the genes never reproduce themselves by themselves. Nothing in this world that I know of actually reproduces itself by itself, except dividing cells, and they do this only most of the time. As is now known, occasionally bacteria trade genes with other bacteria and thereby reproduce not quite exact copies of themselves. A strand of DNA is replicated with the help of the machinery of the cell. Viruses need cells to replicate themselves. Anything that was one hundred percent effective in making exact copies of itself would not undergo Darwinian evolution and would in fact have died out long ago. The dreaded grey goo of nanobots replicating until they cover the earth is still just a fantasy of science fiction.The problem with the current understanding of evolution and natural selection is the problem of not seeing that everything is connected. Any place we draw a boundary is artificial or arbitrary. Even at the skin. Franklin M. Harold, in his book, The Way of the Cell: Molecules, Organisms and the Order of Life (2001) writes, \\"Organisms process matter and energy as well as information; each represents a dynamic node in a whirlpool of several currents, and self-reproduction is a property of the collective, not of genes.... DNA is a peculiar sort of software, that can only be correctly interpreted by its own unique hardware....sending aliens the genome of a cat is no substitute for sending the cat itself--complete with mice.\\" (op cit., p. 221)For those of you who have read Dawkins' original edition from 1976, this edition is still to be recommended, particularly for the updated bibliography and for the 66 pages of endnotes where Dawkins graciously admits errors and points to new discoveries, most interestingly that of Zahavi's \\"handicap principle\\" which goes a long ways toward explaining some \\"altruistic\\" behavior. See my Amazon review of The Handicap Principle: A Missing Piece of Darwin's Puzzle (1997) by Amotz and Avishag Zahavi."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Complex and controversial issues of Natural Selection are presented and discussed in an entertaining and understandable way...a must read for anyone interested in the realities of nature.

Williams said that \`natural selection, albeit stupid, is a story of unending arms races, slaughter and suffering. Its immorality has to be accepted and, at least, to be thought about'. R. Dawkins did think about it. His provocative scientific analysis changed (should change) our vision on mankind. In superb endnotes he puts some points on the i's of former editions.GenesIn a Darwinian world without design or purpose the fundamental unit of selection is the gene (a portion of chromosome material). The predominant quality of a successful and potentially immortal gene is ruthless selfishness.Replicators and VehiclesGenes compose replicators and use discrete vehicles (organisms with specializing cells) for the propagation of their replicators. The qualities of a good replicator are longevity, fecundity and copying fidelity. The master-replicator is DNA. It supervises the manufacture of proteins, which in turn control chemical processes in the cell. A particular gene is all the replicas of a particular portion of DNA distributed throughout the world.Individual bodies (organisms), not species, are the sole vehicles in the evolutionary process. The essential quality of an effective gene vehicle is the possession of an impartial exit channel into the future for all genes inside it (fertilized egg). Genes exert ultimate power over the vehicles through the nervous system and use the vehicle's brain as executive (in a completely unconscious manner).Gene differences emerge only in the phenotypic effects on bodies and the world.Gene pools, altruism and battlesGenes live in gene pools, evolutionary stable sets of genes, which are only occasionally invaded by a new gene (= evolution).Kin altruism, like parental care, can be explained by the fact that close relatives have a greater than average chance of sharing genes. Reciprocal altruism is a win-win solution for all gene participants. In their struggle for domination (survival) genes generate unconscious amoral behaviour in generation and gender conflicts (of interest).MemesIn the soup of human culture the meme is the unit of (un)successful imitation, the new (cultural) replicator.Memes and genes can reinforce each other, but can also be staunch enemies.Very serious warningEven if we assume that individuals are fundamentally selfish, their conscious foresight could (should) save us from the worst excesses of the blind replicators. One of these excesses is a demographic explosion. It the population growth continues at the actual rate, the world is not so far away from the point where its human population, jacked in standing position, will form a solid human carpet all over our planet.In a clear, easily understandable vocabulary with brilliant metaphors (book, boat, (non)zero sum games, gambling, dilemmas), Richard Dawkins simply destroyed scientifically the utmost selfish Right and Left Moral Majority, wherefore eternal thanks.N.B.

I can understand why--the prose is lucid, the ideas are presented in uncomplicated ways, and Dawkins panders to the reader's ego. However, there are major problems with the ways he presents information. While Dawkins gives an accurate description of evolutionary biology and comes up with the stellar idea of memes, the rest of the book is speculative and poorly-researched. Dawkins relies on pre-set ideas and notions that the reader(and Dawkins himself) might have to present difficult ideas. Some points of contention: Dawkins' ideas of women and men, Dawkins' ideas of animals, Dawkins presenting genes as 'selfish' and then believing that a short forward will help correct the misinformation, Dawkins' personal and dogmatic ideas that have no scientific backing whatsoever.This book should really be presented as Aristotle is: history preserved, a stepping stone to the path of truth."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Nothing new - freely taken from George C.

The book came fast and I had no problems with the seller or the price. excellent read and well worth more in the information inside."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"\\"The Selfish Gene\\" is a popular science book by Richard Dawkins, written more than 35 years back. The 30th anniversary edition has more updates and there is a last chapter motivating the reader towards another book called \\"The Extended Phenotype\\" by the same author. This book is very famous over past four decades for its support of evolution theory and how the fundamental replicator called gene supports it. Reading this book is a great experience only to those readers who are supportive of Darwin's evolution theory. Others might disagree and pose more questions on the validity of few tall claims made in the book. As a person who generally supports evolution, I was able to relate most of the contents in this book.There is always a conflict among people regarding the natural tendency of living organisms - selfishness Vs altruism. Though most people believe that altruism is the inherent nature of living beings, the evolution theory by Darwin suggests otherwise. The altruism nature of living beings is supported and propagated by scientists having faith on group selection. Starting from the origin of life, Dawkins argues that every activity of living beings is towards selfishness. The selfish nature of living beings is essential for their survival and replication of their genes according to Dawkins. He illustrates them using examples such as how cuckoo kids destroy other unhatched eggs to get more share of food from their mothers.Dawkins exposes the readers to a primeval soup consisting of replicators to start with. These replicators are selfish by nature as they would want to make identical copies of themselves. Dawkins extends the theory of replicators to more general concept of gene/DNA present in the every living cell of a plant or an animal. Through various illustrations, Dawkins proves that the selfish nature of the gene is inherited even by the body (vehicle) of the living being which is built using them. Most of the examples given in the book are at the behavioral level of organisms and the group selection strategies are vehemently opposed by sufficient counter examples.Dawkins considers why the propagation of their own genes is the primary motivation behind the reproduction. The living beings who fail to do this will go extinct over time as natural selection only favors selfish genes. Basically, Dawkins strives to answer the following questions. How does selfish gene theory account for individual behaviors like aggression, sex, and spreading? How does even symbiotic relationship between two species is still in agreement with selfish gene theory? Why is the balance of sex ratio (male-female) almost the same even though the females put more effort in spreading of selfish genes? What are the ways in which a female selects her male partners for efficient propagation of genes? How come tit-for-tat the best strategy among a group of competing species?To explain the difference between human beings and other living entities, Dawkins introduces a new term called meme as the basic replicator of culture. Memes are responsible for carrying the cultural aspects from one human to his/her followers and successors. Memes are the very means used by spiritual gurus to train their disciples into believing in certain ideologies about God. Memes can also exploited as a means to inculcate altruism among a group of humans and thereby reduce the effects of selfish genes. However, people generally use memes to impose their own beliefs on others without ever caring about the altruistic benefits that can be achieved by the spread of benign memes. In short, Dawkins claims meme may bring altruism into the genes depending on how that meme evolved from a culture.The summary of the book is that as the genes are selfish, the nature all living entities of the world is inherently selfish. One has to teach altruism in humans by other means called memes for efficient functioning of the world. I found this book very knowledgeable and well illustrated. However, I felt Dawkins spends most of the time poking fun at other theories such as group selection which seems a bit digressing and annoying. Dawkins seems to be not that open minded as a popular science writer which may be due to his own selfish gene not having evolved that altruistic because of his memes.The first person ('I') narration in this book does not help in his cause either in inspiring the reader. Dawkins may be a great researcher and supporter of evolution theory. But as a writer of popular science, his arrogant tone makes him fall way behind other eminent writers such as Carl Sagan, Richard Feynman, George Gamow, and Simon Singh. Very daring statements made by writers such as Dawkins, though their spread of rational scientific cause is unquestionable, stand the risk of turning off layman's interest towards science. In spite of all these ethical issues regarding the tone of the book, I recommend this book with some reservation as it contains a treasure of novel perspectives on evolution theory. The reader is fed with a lot of interesting insights about his own existence in this world.P.S.: I am not planning to read any of the other books of Richard Dawkins. There are better popular science and math writers such as Carl Sagan, Bill Bryson, Simon Singh, George Gamow, Richard Feynman, John Derbyshire, James Gleick, ET Bell, etc. These writers indeed inspire you on every page of their books instead of being too rude and preachy."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"The discovery of DNA was one of the major scientific discoveries of the 20th century, and the application of this innovation promises to be critical to the 21st century.This book is rightly regarded as a book everyone should read. There are many misconceptions about Dawkins' position which can only be cleared up by reading what he has actually said. The 30th year anniversary addition includes additional endnotes where he explains (often in humorous detail) how some reviewers apparently only read the title of his book.Altruism is an important theme of the work, and Dawkins is by no means opposed to altruism.This is also the book which introduced the concept of the meme. Whether taken literally or used as an illustrative example, memes are an important idea."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Dawkins makes the fascinating point that, of all the sciences, evolution is the only one that laymen claim almost universally to understand. Most members of small town school boards would never feign understanding of quantum theory or general relativity, but when it comes to evolution they somehow know enough to require its teaching alongside \\"intelligent design\\" pseudoscience, or to ban its teaching outright. Thankfully, the book straightened out my understanding of evolution, leaving me not only with a beautifully simple and subtle understanding of how life on Earth came to take the form it now holds, but also with a better understanding of humanity's purpose on this planet.That last point may surprise many readers. Judging by the popularity of Michael Edwards' review (it is quoted in Dawkins' introduction to the 30th Anniversary Edition), most people familiar with the book see in it a vision of a purposeless, aimless meandering through the eons, of humans as helpless slaves to their genes. After all, if humans are nothing more than \\"survival machines\\" with no more purpose than to carry the genes they contain down through the ages, what are we worth?To someone used to thinking of human beings as the \\"dominant\\" form of life on Earth, as a species above and separate from all the rest, this book may be cause for despair. This is because the bald, unvarnished truth of the book, and of this view of evolution, is that humans are no more special than any other life form on this Earth. We are no more special than the deer, no more special than the algae, no more special than the simplest bacteria. Neither are we any less special.Why should this revelation be a distressing one? We alone among all the creatures of the world, including humans still living as they did before contact with Western or Eastern civilization, have it in our heads that we must take our existence solely into our own hands. Dawkins rephrases \\"survival of the fittest\\" as \\"survival of the stable,\\" meaning that the species, and strategies unique to them, that survive are the ones that cannot be improved upon under current circumstances. We have tried to improve upon the strategy for living as humans that evolved with us, and the steady decay of the world as a result is evidence that we are failing in the attempt.That we are survival machines for selfish genes does not take away from the purpose of life. It merely changes us from masters of the Earth, or more accurately a rebel species at war with the rest of life, into just one among many, a gem in a mountain of gems, each no more or less precious than any other. If I've achieved nothing more than to confuse the reader, I recommend Daniel Quinn's books, most notable \\"Ishmael\\" and \\"The Story of B.\\" They've shown me a meaning and purpose in life wholly compatible with our existence as gene-operated robots (so to speak.)"},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"I will just briefly mention, that not only was this book composed of interesting information about evolution but it was purely a joy to read.

To be honest the way Richard Dawkins constructs arguments, he could sell sand to the Egyptians.I know it is an old book and a few of the points he states are no longer as valid as they use to be, but at the point of writing this book was astonishing, it not only ignited my interest in biology and evolution but changed my outlook of the whole world in general.Read this book first year uni and feel your mind expand into the best popular science book ever written."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"This is the book that introduces the concept of \\"memes\\".

As metaphors there is no question that this language, so characteristic of the way in which humans behave, actually helps quite a bit in understanding very impersonal aspects of biology and evolution. This shows us, I think, that despite the fact that, for example, much of game-playing can be expressed in neutral mathematical language, colorful metaphors from our natural languages can really liven up a subject and awaken us to the weirdness of science, its counterintuitive aspects and even the beauty of nature from a scientific point of view. Of course, the cost of using metaphors is a certain ambiguity, and opens one's viewpoint to being rather easily misunderstood, especially when one uses such \\"loaded\\" words as \\"selfish\\" to describe an inanimate object. This must be counterbalanced by a fresh perspective that can lead to such nice creative insights as the \\"meme\\" concept, and the possibility that inanimate processes can \\"appear\\" to be associated, for example, with \\"strategies\\". In a way, one can almost see this as a subtly sarcastic attack on the anthropomorphic character of many religions. We are accustomed to the vocabulary, methods, and theories of the physical sciences impinging on what one took to be curiously personal space. It is enchanting and startling to see that the language of personal descriptions can be used to enlighten us about impersonal aspects of science. Of course, Dawkins' book in its third edition was not modified over the second, but even so, this wonderful viewpoint he propounds is still new for many of us, and can really open one's eyes to possibilities. This is a demonstration that, strictly speaking, one can progress by merely looking at what has already been discussed elsewhere but from a new perspective."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Dawkins warns his readers that his language, where it constantly may appear to hold \`subjective' or \`moral' or teleological content, does not really--in fact it is argued to hold no real connotations beyond that of figuratively describing \`programmed machines.' He says, \\"it is convenient for me to use the language of purpose as a metaphor in explaining the behaviour of survival machines.\\" All of biology answers finally, and ultimately, to \\"the \`gold-standard' of evolution, gene survival.\\" When he conjures \\"units of detriment\\" and \\"a generalized altruism investment measure,\\" he qualifies his own language as being less than ideal because it over emphasizes non-genetic influences. \\"In many respects, however, this is just a quibble,\\" he goes on to say, and such descriptions may be \\"well worth using in practice.\\" It cannot go unnoticed that Dawkins fills pages with this fancy philological footwork--indeed he must if he has any hope of deflecting the otherwise all too obvious inevitability that he is contradicting himself. \\"Investing\\" in new generations, \\"life insurance risks\\", etc--these terms are just metaphors, all that's really going on is gene selfishness, which, by the way, isn't really gene \\"selfishness,\\" of course! But, practically speaking, it really is!Any line of argument that has such a difficult time hiding from itself, and must invoke such all-encompassing effusiveness in an attempt to do so, should invite much more skepticism than this storied storybook has inspired in many supposedly \\"scientific\\" sectors! Several well regarded philosophers of science have forcefully rebutted Dawkins, the most enjoyable to read perhaps being the late David Stove, who observed, \\"If the question were asked, then, whether Dawkins really believes that genes are selfish in the ordinary sense, the answer best supported by the text of [The Selfish Gene] would be: \\"of course he doesn't; yes he does.\\" Another philosopher (M. Midgley) has noted that Dawkins presents \\"the useful art of open, manly self-contradiction.\\"This ubiquitous slipperiness is not the only problem here. We are also given the \`problem' of altruism (which, of course, cannot really be altruism). In the first chapter, Dawkins pleads, \\"Let us try to teach generosity and altruism . . . Let us understand what our own selfish genes are up to, because we may then at least have the chance to upset their designs . . .\\" He goes on to reiterate this later. In Dawkins hands, there is nothing but nonsense at play here. He has already stated that \\"the gene's law of universal ruthlessness\\" may be \\"very nasty,\\" but this \\"does not stop it being true.\\" He invokes \\"generosity and altruism\\"--which \\"the \`gold standard' of evolution\\" demands cannot really be \\"generosity and altruism,\\" he speaks of genes' \\"selfish\\" \\"designs\\"--which he will tell us aren't really \\"selfish\\" or maybe even \\"designs,\\" but he does two things that are even weirder. He suggests that what he sees as THE ultimate hard and true \`law' of biology can be set aside if we sufficiently will to do so (ultra-Darwinian \`selfishness' is absolutely true and constant unless we don't want it to be--something that hardly fits with his own arguments!), and, he suggests that organisms (\\"survival machines\\"), namely \\"us\\", who do not actually possess \\"generosity and altruism\\" are to (in our somehow Enlightened position?) \\"teach\\" these mythological qualities to others--who cannot, per the \\"very nasty\\" gene's \\"selfishness,\\" actually receive these pedantic gifts! How is any of this reconciled to Dawkins' core doctrine that, \\"There is really only one entity whose point of view matters in evolution, and that entity is the selfish gene\\" (Dawkins' inevitable winner is NOT our desire to make pretend \\"altruism\\" become genuine altruism!)? He is spitting into the wind. And who can constitute this \\"us\\" of Dawkins', that is to ask, who can impart something that he has been precluded from actually possessing, to another (who, incidentally, is also precluded by \`law' from actually receiving it!)? And what IS this external standard that presumes to identify our putative \`gold standard' as being \\"nasty\\"? Explain \\"nasty\\" without contradicting yourself, Dr Dawkins! Presumably his answer will be that \\"nasty\\" isn't really \\"nasty\\"! The real problem for Dawkins and the sociobiologists is a theory that must insist that altruism and generosity are \\"problems\\". A theory that defines an Albert Schweitzer or a Mother Teresa or a Florence Nightingale as \\"problems\\" to be \`explained away' by appeal to a convoluted canon of infallible doctrine, is self-evidently silly--is, in fact, silly in the exact same sense as variously maligned religious nonsense. Whatever capital the \`selfish theorist' might believe he gains over the theist by invoking a \\"problem of evil,\\" he will soon enough find that he will have to more than repay given the awkward burden of his own \\"problem of goodness.\\" (While one can certainly argue as to whether it is adequate or not, the theist's \\"problem of evil\\" is inherently addressed, and perhaps answered in part, by admitting to any significant degree of freedom [of the will and/or of quantum 'openness'], which is obviously why Dawkins, in his assumed role as atheistic \\"chaplain,\\" has so frequently stated that he is \\"not interested\\" in \`free will'. One wonders if he (a), believes he freely chooses this disinterest, or whether (b), his genes \\"selfishly\\" dictate it! As compared to the possible concomitant implications of freedom, the Dawkins/sociobiology problem of \\"altruism\\" has no similarly logical mitigation, all that is available to IT is the dogmatic demand that \\"altruism\\" MUST be a manipulative expression of selfishness--by mere \`reason' of doctrine alone!)Dawkins may be the most famous living biologist, a kind of \`rock star' we might say, but his fame traces only to a popularizer's pen, he hasn't \\"discovered\\" anything biological--except, some of his myriad fans may counter, \\"memes\\", which he has named and identified as cultural \`units of imitation'. The sociobiologists seem to have been greatly impressed. Less indoctrinated and more disciplined and skeptical minds have not. Some excellent philosophers have had great sport with the meme \\"theory\\". Memes are said to be ideas that \\"propagate themselves.\\" Yes, themSELVES. They \\"should be regarded as living structures, not just metaphorically but technically.\\" They \\"literally parasitize\\" other brains by means of \\"infective power\\". This may be an interestingly artful package of language for describing the spreading of ideas, but does choosing this artful story and package of language constitute biological \\"science\\"? Good grief. If it does, almost anything might! Well, if a man is \\"taught Pythagoras's Theorem at school, his brain has been parasitized by a certain micro-maggot which, 2,600 years earlier, had parasitized the brain of Pythagoras,\\" says Stove mockingly. \\"And if a man already believes that genes are selfish, why also should he not believe that prime numbers are sex mad, or that geometrical theorems are brain parasites?\\"Well, enough of memes, they have gotten more attention than they merit. Although the difficulties for The Selfish Gene are easily recognized by anyone whose brain hasn't been \\"parasitized\\" by Dawkins, EO Wilson, and the sociobiologists generally, the books seminal logical flaw of logical flaws is Dawkins' mythic \`selfish gene' itself. There is a stunning (and strictly human) vanity to the proposal that there is an \\"advantage\\" to an individual organism that is provided by means of replication/ reproduction. Sure, my progeny -might- look after me in my old age, but let's face it, this motivation would hardly fit comfortably into the \\"selfish theory\\"! In case anyone has come up with a logically consistent explanation as to how replication can be an \\"advantage\\" to the parent organism (or gene), skeptical and analytical minds would like to hear it. I certainly haven't. But there is a conspicuously large space for vanity in the \\"selfish theory.\\" If I assume the role of a \`selfish theorist' I can happily tell you that the genealogical studies of my daughter have revealed a family tree containing some \`impressive' personages. For example, Beli Mawr, a Celtic king said to have been a god in pre-Roman Britain, turns out to be one of my ancestors. The obvious question of any clear-headed skeptic is this--what \\"benefit\\" or \\"advantage\\" does my existence confer upon my \`god' father, Beli Mawr (or any other ancestor)? At this point, I may puff out my chest and say something like, \\"well, just look at me--how can you not see it!\\" As if my existence does in fact confer something upon him of individual, even \\"selfish,\\" benefit! How Dawkins and EO Wilson have blessed their ancestors (actually reaching back and providing them a \\"benefit\\" or even an \\"advantage\\")! Well, selfish theorists, unless you've got something a lot more impressive than that, I'm afraid you just look silly. As Stove has written, \\"in reading Dr. Dawkins I have often formed the impression that (in Wittgenstein's phrase) a certain picture holds him captive. A picture, namely, of an exceptionally vain author, or parent, or photographer, who delights in surrounding himself with his own writings, or children, or self-portraits. But genes (it can hardly be necessary to say) can no more be vain than they can be selfish. They cannot delight in the number of replicas that they make of themselves. They are not even intelligent enough, after all, to know when they have made a replica of themselves.\\"At this point, the Dawkins/ultra-Darwinian faithful will be anxious to argue that I've missed the simple elegance of the \\"selfish theory\\" by understanding \\"selfish\\" to actually mean selfish; and will want to tell me, as has Dawkins, about how genes and organisms are blessed by Natural Selection to the extent that they are \`replicating machines.' But this is only a tautology, after all. Organisms more likely to survive and reproduce will probably prove to be more likely to have survived and have reproduced. Obviously yes, this is a true, important and relevant observation, but what has been \`explained?' It is argued that a successful replicating machine produces as many \\"copies,\\" or offspring, as it can. But do you know anyone who has had as many offspring as they CAN? Do you suppose that anyone ever has? If you don't think it's fair to use humans as an example here (Stove tears down this objection), then look at other examples in nature. The very large order Hymenoptera (roughly 18,000 species) includes many groups [of ants or bees] in which exceedingly few individuals reproduce; but Dawkins likes to point to dogs (Canidae) when he thinks they help him make his point (chapter 2 of The Blind Watchmaker, for example), so let's do that here. To a certain rather large extent, wolves (Canis lupus) live (hunt, eat, rear young, grow old, etc) in groups in which only the so-called \`alpha' male and \`alpha' female will reproduce with any regularity, while many, if not most, of the individuals in these packs will infrequently, rarely, or never reproduce (although they will devotedly help protect and feed the offspring of the \\"alpha\\" animals). At this point I suppose it is again necessary to appeal to \\"altruism\\" that isn't really altruism, or some other contorted excuse of the sociobiologists. And why not--theirs is a \`theory' that, at least when given sufficient hindsight, must \\"explain\\" and \\"predict\\" EVERYTHING biological, even those \`problems' that it obviously neither explains nor predicts! An obvious variation of Dawkins' (ultra-Darwinism's) \\"prediction\\" tawdriness is as follows: A baby bird screaming louder may prompt its parents to feed it more, which would obviously bestow a positive \`selection value' on loud screaming; on the other hand, loud screaming uses up energy that a hungry chick may already be deficient in, and, it is more likely to attract predators, both of which would bestow a negative \`selection value' on loud screaming. So the simple logic that tells us that \`survival benefits' are always naturally selected while the opposite are always culled away, manages to easily predict that loud screaming is something that will be genetically rewarded (i.e., selected), AND that loud screaming is something that natural selection will slice away. All we have to do to determine which conflicting \\"prediction\\" to hold to, is to determine *at some later time* whether the screamer population is robust or has become extinct, and viola!, we will know which of our contradictory \\"predictions\\" we then observe to be \`true'! Karl Popper must be \`turning over in his grave!' A \\"theory\\" that can predict anything and everything actually predicts nothing (in physics, this is also the current dilemma of the \\"M-theory\\"/\\"brane-world\\" ideas, which, it is becoming increasingly apparent, will have to retreat from the optimistic status of physical \`theory' and admit they are only \`somewhat interesting ideas' or \`non-testable conjectures,' since they inevitably \\"predict\\" anything and everything, they actually predict nothing). Asking an ultra-Darwinist/sociobiologist to define a means of falsifying his \`theory' has been likened, by one philosopher, to \\"talking to a log.\\"How can such a poorly argued book have been such a smash hit? Some philosophers, i.e., R. Kimball, have offered interesting answers that speak more to psychology and perhaps the blinders of \\"group think\\" than to scientific method or critical rigor or logical coherence. \\"The devil made me do it,\\" said Flip Wilson. \\"God made me do it,\\" says the Calvinist. \\"It's the aliens from space,\\" says the UFO abductees enthusiast. \\"It's the evil spirits,\\" says the demonologist. \\"It's \`the stars',\\" says the astrologist. \\"It's a shadow,\\" or \\"it's the bad blood,\\" say the shamanist and the occultist. \`Scientific' types presume to look down their noses at such things of course. But do they? It seems that certain popular forms of biological reductionism need puppetry too. Dawkins entered a market yearning for a would-be \\"scientific\\" puppet master and supplied the 'fix'. He has artfully tapped the supposedly more sophisticated \\"puppetry theory\\" audience. \\"It's the \`selfish gene', yah, that's what it is.\\" And the audience raucously screamed \\"Hooray!\\""},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"When Einstein formulated his Relativity theory, he proposed some postulates, one of them being that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light. If that postulate is wrong, then most of his theory, if not all, will have to be reconsidered. It looks like Dawkins has done the same thing for evolutionism. His postulate: Genes somehow have a very strong influence on behavior. He goes as far to say that an altruistic person is being altruistic because his genes want to persist / replicate / whatever. So a \\"survival machine\\" would sacrifice itself for other similar \\"robots\\" with the same genes. Well, it is a fact that there are selfish people in the world. Did they choose to be selfish OR do they have some kind of gene combination that makes them selfish? It is also a fact that there are racist people in the world. Are they just favoring their genes so that racism would be a natural behavior? Is it \\"natural\\" according to Dawkins theory to be altruistic and racist?I am just examining Dawkins' postulate with the same humble freedom that scientists are questioning Einstein's postulate as I write this by trying to detect faster-than-light particles at the CERN accelerator. I am hoping that my faster-than-light particle equivalent for Dawkins' theory is something much easier to detect: free-will.So if free-will is a falacy, if human behavior is very strongly determined by genes, then Dawkins is probably right and morality is pointless. I think he is not, so I would like to see more tests against his postulate. This is after all science and not faith. (If you don't like my comment, say why in the comments. I don't mind being convinced I am wrong)"},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"As a trained philosopher of science, I read the book owing to the recommendation of a friend working on biology and my own interests in updating my knowledge on theories of gene and evolutions.Dr. Dawkins has a compelling and persuasive style of writing that makes his book enjoyable to read. But his arguments are not always as tight as they appear to be. I find too many questions and problems with this book and can only bring out some essential ones here.First and foremost, it is not clear that what he describe as \\"selfishness\\" can be regarded and treated as \\"biological\\" features like the long"},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"A silly idea or a dangerous delusionAnalysis of Dawkins's The Selfish GeneThe preface says \\"This book should be read almost as though it were science fiction.\\" I disagree. The book should not be read at all, as it has no factual or educational value. Or it should be read as pure fiction, as it is not scientific. It is strange that it was published at all.Dawkins starts with some sort of epiphany, that we humans are not the actual organisms that we are, but merely survival machines for the \`selfish molecules known as genes'. The preface reads like student's notes, by someone who did not quite get the lecture.The first chapter (with pompous title \\"Why are people?\\") is just as silly as the preface. I found myself disagreeing with every assertion. Let's take the first sentence. \\"Intelligent life on a planet comes of age when it first works out the reason for its own existence.\\" What? 1) Life is not a singular term; it is a collective noun for a myriad of living systems, complex themselves. 2) Knowing that life can exist in a myriad of complex forms, what does the metaphor \`comes of age' convey? That all of life forms singularly come of age, at certain defined point? Or that \`life' is a singular entity, somehow independent of forms within which it exists? 3) On \`a' planet? How would Dawkins know? Has he empirical grounds for such comparison? Has he ever witnessed \`life', as an entity, on a different planet? If not, why this generalisation? 4) Why would the entity within the organism figure out the reason for its own existence? I would have thought that it was the other way round - if \`life' is an entity that exists within us, shouldn't it be the organism that must figure out what exists within itself? (The existence already knows.) 5) The first sentence fails completely to establish the levels of analysis.The problem with communicating any sort of epiphany to others is that you cannot assume that their starting point is the same as yours. A scientific book would first try to establish the common grounds, the commonly agreed upon principles or facts, if they are to be challenged. It would not start with a personal view, and flimsy metaphors, then proceed with fairy tales. A scientific book would establish the levels of analysis, and explain the reason for proceeding in a certain manner. A popular scientific book would take time to explain to a lay person the basics of theoretical thinking, and why laying out levels of analysis is important. It would also stress importance of empirical evidence, and use of sources. The most difficult thing for a lay person is to figure out that the levels of analysis are confused, if they are, or if empirical evidence is used properly. Even academics, in my experience, tend to be attracted by trends, captivated by the rhetoric and ignorant of the epistemology.A number of reviewers state that the book is fascinating because Dawkins is such a good writer, and his prose is captivating. How can anyone flow with a prose that continually introduces semantically and syntactically fuzzy elements? I had to re-read that first sentence many times, in order to comprehend its meaning, and failed. I could not even establish a temporary interpretation of its intention, not even a quasi-meaning. I had to argue with nearly every sentence during the first paragraphs. That's anything but captivating. It makes one wonder if a lack of ability to interpret language makes people susceptible to manipulation. I've tried to read the book several times since 2002, and always gave up after the second chapter. Skimming through the rest, it was only more of the same. The empirical examples for animals came presumably from zoology; however empirical grounds for important discussion of kin were just hypothetical examples. Dawkins found it convenient to ignore a science that has amassed huge knowledge on kinship, namely anthropology. Author's ignorance of the variety of kinship's systems (and implicitly the variety of related behaviours) is not only rude or disrespectful; it also reveals his incompetence in writing about complex subjects. In the small tribal societies, from which the larger societies originated, the most important rule concerns who you are allowed to marry or not. Transfer of genes in small tribes is never a matter of free choice, but always a matter of avoiding genetic danger of too close marriages. Exercising choice - in order to preserve the perceived selfish qualities of a gene - is only possible in modern societies, where inbreeding is not an issue. It was humans, not genes, that dictated the rules of kinship, and Dawkins should know that. He is ignorant of his own ignorance - yet the lay readers do not know that, they are deceived.The mark of a good scientist is the ability to challenge his or her own perceptions. A good scientist will probe for truth, not popularity. A good scientist will ask others to do the same, i.e. challenge his perceptions or discoveries, so they together can come closer to truth. Richard Dawkins clearly wanted many people to believe in his epiphany, to take them on his discovery ride before he knew where he was going. Now that most of his ideas are proved wrong, he does not seem to be capable of admitting it. That says it all.What I particularly disliked about the book is that Dawkins asserts himself as a Darwin interpreter. How many of the reviewers have read Darwin's Origin of Species? Darwin's work shows all the marks of a true scientist. He has been studying the subject for decades, before he decided he would present his findings. He starts out with a long list of previous research, meticulously described, before he presents his own theory. Darwin is aware of the controversy he may create and the heretical standpoint he takes to his own beliefs; yet he does not present his theory to gain status, position or popularity. His sound research has convinced him, and he thinks it's his duty to convey truthfully what he has discovered.It saddens me to think that Darwin is now interpreted through Dawkins, as Darwin would probably have disagreed with Dawkins's unscientific methods and his jumping to foolish conclusions. To my knowledge, Richard Dawkins has not done any significant research, so his work can't be compared to Darwin's ever, on any level. Dawkins is an interpreter, and a poor one at that.If people are truly interested in the theory of evolution, they should read the original works, and find decent interpretations that help us understand the context. If readers are into our origins, a good contemporary author I can think of is Nick Lane, whose books on oxygen and mitochondria are extremely well researched and complied, brilliantly written and exciting. Having read his books, I can never think of a \`single' gene or a \`selfish gene'. The number of genes in a single cell and the complex rules for transfer of mitochondrial genes debunk that.The completion of the human genome project has rendered any notion of a single gene useless yet some authors (like Matt Ridley) continue to write as if genes were separate entities, rather than integrated in the functional wholes of cells. Another example of the single gene delusion is the questionably scientific genetic manipulation of genes in plants intended for human consumption. Experiments showed that single genes of different species would not transfer, but had to be forced. Experimental animals would not eat them; they had to be force fed, and most of them died, had malformed offspring or could not reproduce at all. What has GM got to do with the selfish gene theory? The fantasies of isolated genes have lead to the manipulative thinking and production of genetically modified organisms. The experiments (obscured to the mainstream) showed that in reality, most genes act as integrated networks; therefore their transfer can wreak havoc in organisms. Now that the danger is discovered, the experimenting itself can be traced back to such superficial theories of independent genes.Therefore, when Dawkins asks the reader to have faith in his fantasies, he is asking for a huge leap of faith. Rather than selfishness or altruism, when it comes to genes, I'd recommend the reader to think systems and function, organising hierarchies, and abstract communication. The idea of a \`selfish gene' is, depending on the context, a silly idea or a dangerous delusion."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Dawkins writes that \\"the argument of this book is that we, and all other animals, are machines created by our genes\\" (p.xxi) and that \\"We are survival machines - robot vehicles blindly programmed to preserve the selfish molecules known as genes\\" (p.xxi). Yet, according to him, this book \\"is not science fiction; it is science\\" (p.xxi)!Dawkins contrives to overlook the twin discoveries that:1. the observable traits of organisms are mostly conditioned by the interactions of many genes;2. most genes have multiple effects on many of these traits.Dawkins transfers characteristics with which he is familiar from human behaviour on the macro-level to the inanimate components, \\"genes\\", of which we are physically constructed. He then proceeds to argue that these impersonal entities, which he imagines to possess characteristically human traits, infallibly generate the same unpleasant traits in human behaviour on the macro-level. So he writes: \\"The gene is the basic unit of selfishness\\" (p.36).The absurdity is evident in that genes or other nonconscious entities cannot be either selfish or unselfish. They cannot \\"compete\\" against anything or \\"choose\\" anything.If Dawkins were right, what would be the point of declaring, as he does: \\"Let us try to *teach* generosity and altruism, because we are born selfish\\" (p.3)? For if we really were machines, as he believes, even these very concepts would be meaningless to us. And certainly his oratory could have no effect whatever on our actual behaviour.In fact genes do not force us to behave in any particular way. Neither can they possess the ability to direct or to comprehend all that is required to adopt a course of either heartless selfishness or heartfelt, sacrificial compassion.The arguments in this review have been challenged by the claim that Dawkins himself answers these charges. His claim is, in effect, that that \\"the evolution of behavioural reactions or patterns via natural selection\\" and \\"control by nonconscious mechanisms\\" are two vastly different ideas. Also it is said that Dawkins does not deny a freedom of choice as the very last lines in this book itself \\"celebrate the human ability to make choices that transcend genetic control and instinctive reactions.\\" So it is said that Dawkins \\"repeatedly draws clear distinctions\\" to prevent his readers from jumping to the conclusions expressed above.However, there is a vast difference between asserting that such distinctions exist and actually laying a solid theoretical foundation for such distinctions. To lay the kinds of foundations which Dawkins does and then to go on to insist that these foundations do not lead to their logical conclusion is nothing less than an act of faith on Dawkins' part. It certainly does not bestow any validity upon Dawkins alleged distinctions. The bottom line is that Dawkins' presuppositions simply do not lead logically to the sort of distinction which he asserts.Essentially this debate is an argument not about data, but about underlying assumptions. Here is a example of what I mean:ASSUMPTION: 1. \\"evolution is a fact\\";DATUM: 2. \\"human beings have consciousness\\";ASSUMPTION: 3. \\"therefore evolution is capable of generating consciousness\\".Once again, it is a case of \\"garbage in, garbage out\\" (as Dawkins would say).The major challenge to evolution's status as a 'hypothesis' is that it has no predictive value. Whereas Newton's account of planetary motion, for instance, enables us to make accurate predictions of the future 'behaviour' of the planets, the evolutionary paradigm does no such thing."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Dr.Dawkins \\"meme\\" hypothesis which is centered on the \\"selfish gene\\" concept (and it has also over extended itself into the realm of philosophy, in its vagueness it borders in the pseudo-science) which lacks rigorous scientific foundation.Below you will find a better rigorous scientific Explanation.Called: Acetabulis ludum theoryby Dr.Et non Realis ,PhD in Nequam-biology (Instituti de Nequam Scientia)Abstract- Cell Biology in Evolution: an elaboration of Dr. Lynn Margulis Endosymbiosis theory.Co-option of cell mechanism, the locus here is the archetype Mitochondria as the Principal symbiogenic regulator agent, via reverse transcriptional mechanism.Primitive Mitochondria use a survivable strategy that is explained by using reverse transcription methods (DNA Insertion and deletions and altering gene viability for translational yield) elucidating the production of pseudogene and Repetitive DNA Sequences, also changing gene messaging (mRNA) on the translational protein cycle, altering the cell cytoplasm micro-environment to the advantage of the archetype mitochondria.

This could only be taken seriously by those who are so blinded by the details that they can no longer think straight, so they are not able to figure out where the argument is wrong, let alone realize something IS wrong with it.What almost everyone doesn't seem to understand, even about VALID arguments is this: ALL a valid argument does is set up a tug of war between the premises being true and the conclusion being false.

That was also not written in the textbooks of Genetics. Lamarckism was frowned upon since Darwin and statements of the Bible that the sins of the fathers effect following generations ridiculed as myths. But now it seems to be scientific research, provided the news are correct.The first who succeeded in this ground-shaking understanding was the biologist Emma Whitelaw at the Queensland Institue fo Medical Research. The Israelite biologist Eva Jablonka said that the whole discourse about inheritance and evolution would change and that it meant the end of the \\"selfish Gene\\".Not long ago allegations that adaptation of an organism to the environment would pass over to the descendants was regarded as scientific heresy. They contradicted the ruling cognition of the evolution theory. It was said that accidental variations in the genetic material, so called mutations, supply the creatures with an advantage in the struggle for life.It seems that Dawkins fabricated a hotshot, which he should urgently revise. The air for evolutionist is getting more and more thin. They need another helping sub-theory, or two?The discoveries of the Epi-Geneticists are an example for a scientific truism, which is not well known to the public: scientific knowledge - here the evolution theory -is a preliminary knowledge. Whereby it is still the question whether the evolution theory is not just an ideology.The \\"It is proved!\\", stated quickly, does not always mean the truth! Dawkins premature ideas concerning the Selfish Gene is such a \\"wanna-be-knowledge\\", which proves as en error in the light of serious scientific approach. At once several evolutionary dogmas go down without a whimper, if accident is not the hit. Now we have data for a new explanation: Not the accident calls for variation in the genetic material, rather it is the designation! Designation comes from Design! More concrete: the free will of man, letting him do this or that, hence having effects on the body and right into the genetic material. And this seems to be the undeniable scientific found. These self-eveloping genes have their limits, of course, but it is apparent that man has more responsibility for himself and others than can be welcome by those who like to do what they want.The not very respectful assertion of Dawkins and his purporters that human genetic material is nothing more than the rather minor valuable rest of evolution falls somehow very un-gently back on them. Not the genetic material is garbage, but it could be advisable, that many meters of bookshelfs of evolution publications must be tidied out. They suffered a wondrous evolution, from accredited professional literature to scrap paper!"},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"The book itself is not badly written with some interesting ideas.But...Here is the big hole.If as Dawkins says all species competed openly, and us humans are the top place holders in the struggle for existence.Then, where are the second place holders???E.g. in the Olympics ( or any other open/free/un-manipulated competition)you see the gold medal, the silver medal and the bronze medal winner.In the race among the millions of species, if we humans have invented Google/amazon/space shuttle etc etc and are therefore the gold medal winners.How come no other species has invented the bullock cart yet?For God's sake the reptiles still go naked!And they have supposedly been around longer than us!So, conceptually the idea behind the book has this big flaw."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"I ordered a copy for me and one for my friend.

So yeah when we're done reading it I'll put a real review up but I just had to say that I'm impressed with the gift wrap.And btw she was also curious why I picked this book for her.

The book is very interesting and insightful on the topic of genetics, survival, evolution, and general psychology.

Buy this book if you're looking for an intelligent and VERY relevant read!"},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"This book twisted and changed my perception of life. In excruciating detail, Dawkins elaborates on the meaning of life, explaining the why and how of everything we do based on genetics and DNA. You will not look at life the same after reading this book. We are all survival machines that are focused on the survival of our genes, an exclusive self-interest. I loved the comparison and break down of why true altruism does not exist, and is merely self-interest disguised as altruism. The added portion on game theory at the end, is stellar and provides the adequate background for those curious about the subject. This book is a winner."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"\\"The Selfish Gene\\" created a huge splash when it was published 35 years ago. It explained how species succeed under Darwinian evolution. But it doesn't apply to modern man! We are dying out. You can attribute it to \\"The Unselfish Gene\\" or more aptly \\"The Selfish Phenotype.\\"Richard Dawkins theorizes that evolution is a matter of genes passing themselves on. The phenotypes - the animals and plants that we see, like us, are irrelevant except to the extent that they are successful in propagating their genes. There is ample evidence in the animal world that the individual doesn't matter. The black widow spider eats her mate after mating. Salmon swim upstream and die after leaving and fertilizing their eggs.Among human beings, however, the phenotype is all that matters any more. We are vastly more concerned with living people than with future generations. Educated, intelligent people are especially indifferent to passing on their own genes.Humankind long ago overcame predators and disease. Other tribes are our most significant competition. Human societies excel at outbreeding and killing off rival societies. Over history those Homo sapiens cultures that did not go extinct had to evolve continually to maintain their competitiveness. Since the Renaissance, European cultures have dominated in the realm of ideas, and not done too badly in population, while the Asian cultures have dominated in sheer numbers of people.Altruism was essential in building large societies. Orientals and northern Europeans especially evolved to look out for others in the tribe. To empathize with them. These tribes coalesced into nations with a high level of trust, and low levels of crime. Intelligence was a necessary ingredient. People had to understand that helping others was in their own long term interest - or rather, that of their genes.Culture spread like peacock feathers once people started living in large groups. Individuals could prosper exploiting talents like management, bookkeeping, singing and acting... anything to set oneself apart from ordinary farmers and yeomen. Of course the pretty girls liked this kind of talent, and women developed their own flirtatious wiles to catch the most attractive guys. Anybody who could do so formed himself into a distinctive individual, if possible an intellectual. A philosopher.Europeans incorporated various degrees of altruism into their philosophy. Rousseau was a wild optimist, Locke and Burke less so. They had a sense that Europe had a better model for living than the rest of the world, and by persuasion or conquest they were going to share it. Western culture reached most of the rest of the world through Christianity, the military and business. We called it the \\"mission civilitrice\\" or \\"white man's burden.\\" We might've been wrong but we were never in doubt. We promiscuously spread our culture, believing that everybody else would benefit from it whether or not they asked for or wanted it.We convinced ourselves that the whole world was one people; that mankind had transcended tribalism. We were kidding ourselves, of course. The rest of the world didn't comprehend why we would believe that, and didn't trust our motives. Did we fight in Vietnam or Iraq for the benefit of those people? C'mon, get serious. Even our supposed allies thought it was all about oil - even though Vietnam didn't have any.Western societies have been swept up in altruistic movements for the last century. Workers of the world, unite! Civil rights! Ban the bomb! End overpopulation! Save the whales! Save the environment! End global warming! Ban genetically modified organisms! Ethical treatment for animals! Adherents support these causes with the evangelical zeal with which their ancestors embraced Christianity. Also, a cynic would add, the same unexamined faith.Like the Christian crusaders of 1000 years ago, we are generous in sharing our convictions with the rest of the world. They in turn look at us much the way they looked at Christians. Weirdoes, but rich weirdoes, good for a handout if you pretend to agree with them. African strongmen, for instance, take a European stand on GMOs because they benefit from European aid. Whether or not GMOs would benefit the people is hardly considered.Westerners are smug about having exchanged a belief in cloudy religious myths which emerged 4000 years ago from the Levantine desert for the grab bag of above-named modern cloudy myths. Our new myths offer a balm for the soul as we pursue our sensual and material delights: Jacuzzis, gourmet foods, huge homes and cars, and so on. Just as we moderns delight in pointing out the obvious contradictions inherent in Christianity, we are marvelously blind to the contradictions in our own belief systems, such as between saving the whales and taking cruise vacations.In this seminal \\"Selfish Gene\\" Dawkins introduced the idea of a meme, an idea, behavior or style that spreads from person to person within a culture. Religion is clearly a meme. Dawkins, a stout athiest, rails against it constantly. However, all the other above-named cultural detritus is nothing more than memes. We are in the thrall of the half-baked products of our own fantasies and hubris.Our brains and altruism have gotten us ahead of evolution. We believe that having children imposes an almost immoral burden on the Earth's resources, and self-indulgence memes seduce us into spending whatever energy we might have invested in children in satisfying an ephemeral, artificially induced drive for consumption. Nobody needs a Toyota Tundra or an Apple iPad, but some eerie compulsion drives us into their showrooms. We indulge our lhasa apsos instead of our children.For us, the selfish gene is a thing of the past. It has been replaced by the selfish meme. Memes, however, can only infect other minds, and with fewer births there are fewer hosts. The genius of religious memes is that they reproduce both bodies and minds. Evolution would predict that selfish memes eventually die out. The nature of the religious memes which will survive, those which drive people to procreate, is an interesting speculation. I'm sure it would drive Dawkins crazy."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"It is hard to imagine anyone being more capable of proffering a point of view and being absolutely convincing in the process. The Selfish Gene just makes too much sense not to be right on target, and I only wish Richard Dawkins were an American politician."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"For anyone interested in evolutionary biology, this book is a must read. The book is primarily focused on the \\"genes-eye\\" view of evolution, but it is much more. It is dripping with ideas, including a good introduction to the meme concept. While this book has been criticized in various quarters, and while some of the ideas presented may not be \\"correct\\", that really misses the point. I think Dawkins would be the first to admit that many of the ideas presented here are \\"speculative.\\" Despite that, however, the point is that this book stimulates thinking in a powerful way, and that's why this book is rightly considered one of the best popular science books of all time. Dawkins has an outstanding ability to write so that lay readers can grasp his arguments. Dawkins also has the ability (which is very much evident in this book) of inspiring readers with respect to the joy of scientific inquiry, very much, in my view, like Carl Sagan before him.I highly recommend this book.Paul Gehrman, Author, Kaleidoscope"},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Professor Dawkins's book on evolution is geared to the non-scientist and presents evolution, and the underlying idea that it is the gene that is surviving not the organism, in clear, understandable and interesting language.

It completely changed the way I think about a lot of things that happen as far as how we deal with the world around us.I actually found this book due to one of the Enron founders stating that it was one of their motivations to succeed, and I wanted to see what they saw in this book. I will say that this is one of those moments where an expectation of something bad turned into something extremely good.

When I finished this book, I did something I had never done before: I read the same book again. The second time through, I underlined things and scribbled thoughts on the inside covers and in the margins and wrote emails to friends about questions forming in my mind. After that second pass, I bought and read Dawkins's \\"The Blind Watchmaker\\" and \\"The God Delusion\\" and watched his TED video and several other videos of his on YouTube. \\"The Ancestor's Tale\\" and \\"The Extended Phenotype\\" are on my to-do list. I am quite impressed with this guy.\\"The Selfish Gene\\" is my clear favorite of his books so far, and quite possibly my favorite read of all time. I thought I already knew a lot about evolution, but this book refined my understanding substantially. And Dawkins has a gift for writing, an ability to take a subject that in the wrong hands could be quite dry and make it very interesting.Now for some qualifications. First, if you don't already have a reasonable understanding of evolution and the process of natural selection, you should probably get that somewhere else before starting this book. Carl Zimmer's \\"Evolution: The Triumph of an Idea\\" and the accompanying PBS video (which I think you can see at pbs.org) are an approachable choice.Second, this is not light reading. It's readable, but there is a lot going on in these almost 400 pages, and you should expect to spend some time thinking about what he is saying. This is not a book to skim.Finally, if for whatever reason you have trouble accepting the idea of evolution by natural selection, then there is probably little point in reading this book.In this 30th anniversary edition, Dawkins has 66 pages of endnotes which make very interesting reading. Rather than change the original text in subsequent editions, he commented on it in the endnotes. At times he explains why he said something the way he did, or shares findings that have emerged since he wrote the book. In some cases he talks about the flak he got for saying what he did. And in a few cases he admits that he didn't say something in the best way. I found the updates and self-reflection in the endnotes quite enjoyable.If you haven't already read this book (at least once :^), please do!"},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"If you want to learn about evolution, this is the first book you should read.

Good for an introductory read or as new insight to the advanced reader. Would have liked to see more insight on interspecies relationships."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"The Selfish Gene does not tell the whole truth, and I hope readers will seek other information to balance the \\"dog-eat-dog\\" world in which Richard Dawkins lives. I think of the scientists who once thought light was a wave. They would argue and fight with scientists who thought light was a particle. Finally some scientists came along who said \\"in some circumstances light acts like a wave, and in some circumstances, light acts like a particle.\\"I hope readers will find a similar solution for Richard Dawkins Selfish Gene. Sometimes genes may act in ways that can be described as selfish, but genes can also be viewed as highly creative and very cooperative (and that is how they made you.)I think of the destructive nature of The Selfish Gene. Geffrey Skilling read The Selfish Gene and felt selfishness was an inherent part of nature. He encouraged his employees to act in selfish ways, and as a result his company Enron became miserable place to work. Eentually Enron went bankrupt, devastating the lives of its employees, its investors, and mony throughout the United States.http://www.emory.edu/LIVING_LINKS/empathy/Reviewfiles/Seed.htmlOne reader of The Selfish Gene said he was depressed for 20 years after reading the book.I hope Richard Dawkins view of The Selfish Gene is soon overshadowed by the views of people like Frans de Waal in his book The Age of Empathy.It is interesting how the basic elements of our lives, our cells, can come and go so anonymously and yet it is because of their hard work and generosity toward each other that we have a self and are aware of our lives.How interesting if we view life from the perspective of cells, instead of the perspective of our selves. Our conscious lives are a construct from our neurons. Having a self helped our species, and all animals with a self, survive. A self constructs the prison Einstein talked about, where we feel separate from others and the world. Neurons working together give us The Self and this world view.From the perspective of cells, cells are there to help other cells. Cells form giant societies - 10 trillion of them form you. In these societies, each cells has an intricate job - and if each cells is successful performing its job, then the animal or plant survives.In the individual organism, cells help other cells. Even throughout life, cells help other cells. It is as if the first cells 600 millions years ago said to their children \\"Go out and experiment, and find ways to help each other. Look at how desolate is this earth, with no life but us, just a few cells. There is no oxygen. How will we survive? We don't know, but if you experiment with ways of being and ways of reproducing - there is a slight chance we will survive.And here we are, 600 million years later - and the descendants of those original cells survived, and prospered, and we have them to thank for our lives.Instead of Richard Dawkins \\"red in tooth and claw\\" perspective of a dog eat dog world, the world becomes a loving place where cells help each other survive. The cells of the lettuce help the cells of the rabbit survive. The cells of the rabbit help the cells of the hawk survive. The claws of the hawk may be red from the blood of the rabbit - but the cells of that blood give the hawk life.Are there other social societies in which individuals are generous like our cells? Honeybees form societies, and each honeybee works for the benefit of themselves and all the other honeybees. Perhaps people might evolve to one day form a human society as generous as the society of honeybees and our cells."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Here Professor Dawkins explains evolutionary theory in a way that is at once informative and engaging."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Book is of great quality and I received it on time.

This book was less. It was a fine academic work and, with some faults, rigorous and philosophically sound - but convoluted and dense. I think he established he knew the field in this book but did not become an Author until later. Unless you are a genetics groupie (and who isn't) skip this and buy and read Genome."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"As any student of the financial markets knows, you can plot variables of past share price behaviour on a graph and always find a mathematical formula which fits the curve: it's called \\"curve fitting\\". It is another thing again to find a formula which predicts the share price!\\"The Selfish Gene\\" isn't science: it's in principle like an exercise in curve fitting but without even the rigor of mathematics. In this book Dawkins presents an untested hypothesis - that gene self preservation is the main driving force of evolution. For the rest of the book he states facts and interprets them through the lens of his hypothesis and indicates that by doing so he is providing evidence to support it! Tellingly he cites absolutely no scientific studies which support his hypothesis. Dawkins in \\"The Selfish Gene\\" is exactly the same as a fudamentalist christian stating that their biblical god exists as an explanation for the existence of the universe, and that because \\"The Bible\\" contains facts this proves the god explanation is a fact.The mass acceptance of Dawkins' book by the general public is illustrative of the need for prioritizing science education in society:Most people think that the essence of science is explanation and so they swallow Dawkins' selfish gene explanation of evolution as though it has some sort of scientific support, simply because it is espoused by a \\"scientist\\". The fact is of course that any phenomenon can be given an infinite number of explanations whereas science is in essence about (striving for) successful prediction. To gain any scientific credence Dawkins' hypothesis would need to be successfully tested for any predictive power it may possess.An irony is that organisms, in order to achieve better environmental conditions for their survival, depend on their ability to predict, and then alter their behaviour and their environments accordingly. Even single celled organisms are able to do things like \\"predict\\" where they should move to increase the likelihood of finding food or better sunlight conditions for their energy needs in order to survive and reproduce.The cells in Dawkins' brain seem to excell at predicting how to make money out of pop \\"science\\" but appear limited in their ability to actually do science."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"While I was attending college (more than a few years ago) I took a class on evolution. There was no Google at that time so I was searching for books the old fashioned way: the library's card catalog. When I saw the title \\"The Selfish Gene\\" I knew I had to read the book.The book itself was unassuming and plain -- a ragged first addition. The University possessed only a single copy. I figured that this would probably be the beginning and end for Dawkins's literary legacy. The university's copy was 20 years old by the time I checked it out but it was unknown to me or anyone I knew.The Selfish Gene was a revelation of evolutionary extrapolation. Like no other work, it crystallized the theory I knew into a deep understanding of the chain of evolutionary cause and effect. My view of the world was changed forever. As a matter of fact, the world itself was demonstrably changed by the book. \\"The Selfish Gene\\" was the origin of the word and concept of 'meme'. The meme of the concept of 'meme' is de facto proof of the validity of Dawkins' ideas.This book is one of the top 5 books I've ever read (and I've read hundreds). It's an accessible read but it still maintains complexity."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Richard Dawkins has influenced public understanding of science and discussion of religion. Whatever he says or writes deserves careful consideration, because he's a brilliant, considerate intellect. You probably know that this book was first published in 1976 and it fueled a fountain of inquiry into the life sciences. Both Dawkins's and The Selfish Gene's places in history are strong.Well I finally got around to reading it. Ultra-short summary: As we consider the progress of life through natural selection, it is useful to drop our focus on the organism, and replace it with a focus on the gene. Genes do not possess volition, but we can understand some important aspects of evolution better if we pretend that genes are struggling to survive and multiply, using organisms as their \\"vehicles.\\" Dawkins also proposes this approach to our study of ideas, for which he coins the term \\"meme.\\"Basically, that's it. These concepts are reiterated many, many, many times in the text. Richard did wear me out. I mean, we got it the third time you said this; a twenty-third time isn't adding to our understanding. I hasten to add that this repetition was probably more valuable in 1976 when the concepts were new. Dawkins has written many books after this one, and I think his thought and writing greatly improved. Therefore, I'd recommend a book like \\"Climbing Mount Improbable\\" over \\"The Selfish Gene.\\"Today many of Dawkins's ideas have been expanded and clarified by other science authors. One book I'd recommend on this subject is \\"The Limits of Family Influence: Genes, Experience, and Behavior\\" by David C. Rowe. As the title indicates, Rowe's book focuses on humans, and it held my interest better, when relating technical information. Talk about ants and I'll listen for a minute; talk about me and I'm yours all day."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"At first, I was quite disturbed by the title, and as a consequence, reluctant to read it. I mean, how could a gene be selfish? And even if this was meant only as a metaphor for higher principles, I could not swallow (and still can't) the \\"gene this, gene that, mutate this, mutate that\\" approach popping all over the place; there must be more to evolution than gene mutation and replication. In short, I am not very fond of the gene-centered view of evolution, except maybe in the case that gene is used as a metaphor, or better yet, if we take genes, memes, and temes, and put them under the umbrella of replicators, then we might have a replicator-centered view of evolution, or, the survival of information.Dawkins hosted an interesting series at PBS on evolution, where he presented the ideas of Darwin to the general public. Apart from this, his two papers, \\"Arms Races Between and Within Species\\" and \\"Animal Signals - Mind Reading and Manipulation\\" in collaboration with John Krebs, made me want to dig into some more high quality ideas on evolution.If you watched the PBS series or any other series presented by Dawkins, you know that he's a calm and patient person. That calmness and clearance of mind flows right back into his writing which is smooth, easy to follow and at times seems warm.It seems like in the evolutionary literature, every new view on the subject, every new theory is bound to tackle all the important questions if it is to be a successful one. Questions regarding animal signaling, aggression, the difference between sexes, rearing of the young, matting preferences and others are all brought to surface by the author with the almighty gene in mind. The book can also be regarded as an anti-Intelligent Design manifesto. The feeling it conveys is that there is no purpose in the universe, that life is merely the bonding of some special kind of chemicals, whose only ambition is to avoid decaying. How does it do that? By coming up with strategies and mechanisms to avoid just that. If only the information could somehow be stored in a kind of fixed unbreakable manner, it doesn't really matter that the present life form disappears, as long as the information on how it was built in the first place, survives past it's personal destruction, and can be used to form a new, identical individual. But there is a compromise; if the environment in which the bit of life has to survive changes, it would be perilous if he would remain fixed in his place in his form and function. Thus, he has to adapt constantly to his (new) conditions, this is does by mutations and changes in phenotypes. Changing as it goes in nature, by trial and error is also risky; if the new form is not better than the old one, it could face extinction; so a large body of the same kind of life is always desirable if new strategies for survival are to be found; many of them will not succeed, but some of them will. This is made possible through reproduction, and every life form will try to bring to life as many copies of himself as it is possible at every given time and place.The writing stands in contrast with the group selection or species selection [see unit of selection] and this I feel is correct from a theoretical point of view. There is always a desire to search for fundamental principles, for elemental building blocks, be it in physics, chemistry, genetics or philosophy. In this regard, the gene is the fundamental unit of information that is passed on from organism to organism in it's original form, and this is all that matters, biologically.The fact that it's a book written for the general public takes away some of it's appeal, the writing is sparkled here and there with catch-phrases that have nothing to do with the theory itself, only maybe, with how well the book will sell. At times, this is really frustrating and you would just want to skip pages to the essential stuff. Also, some background in Mendelian genetics would be really helpful to have, as well as some knowledge of Darwinism ideas, especially reading On the Origin of Species in advance."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"I love the way Richard Dawkins writes. Highly logical, and always covering his tracks to avoid misinterpretation as is so likely to happen in this case. I loved the second chapter. For a long time I had wondered how evolutionary theory could explain the beginning of life. That insurmountable mountain is truly difficult to climb. But this book seemed to have a plausible answer. In his second chapter, \\"The Replicators\\", Dawkins gives an account of how life could have evolved in the primordial soup as small chemicals that could self assemble and make copies of themselves. When he says that the purpose of our life is to continue the duplication of these original replicators and that we are but survival machines for these chemicals, I experienced a moment of epiphany.I will recommend this book to every thinking man and woman. I think it has a life view changing impact in the reader. In the 30 years since the book was written biology has made immense advances. However the beautiful theory of evolution was perhaps never better interpreted than in this book. Perhaps no one really understands evolution just like no one understands Quantum theory, but this book is perhaps the best I ever got to understanding the meme of evolutionary theory."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"\\"Why are people?\\" This is the title of the first chapter of Selfish Gene. In the first paragraph of the book the author states that Charles Darwin made ii possible for us to answer this question sensibly. The book promises to help the reader answer this question and such others as \\"Is there meaning to life?\\" It delivers on the promise.Dawkins has a unique gift for communication. As you read a paragraph densely packed with concepts and assimilate them, inevitably your mind goes \\"hmm... that's sounds good, but..\\" Invariably Dawkins has anticipated these objections and he deals with them one by one. There are many other good books out there which explain the theory of Charles Darwin but I would be surprised if any of them is as good as the Selfish Gene.A word of caution. Starting to look at the world through Darwinian glasses is very similar to Neo's taking the \\"red pill\\" in matrix.

I wish I had read it before I went to college, when it first came out. Dawkins's thoughts here illuminate the way we think. In the same way that Copernicus, Kepler, and Galileo showed us that the earth revolves around the sun rather than vice versa, Dawkins and the various biologists and ethologists he quotes show that organisms revolve around their genes rather than vice versa. The implications are widespread and profound. If you ever wonder what Scott Adams (creator of Dilbert) is smoking when he says humans are just moist robots, it's pure Dawkins.You need to read this.However, the Kindle e-book is an embarrassment. Serious misspellings and notational weirdness are all over the place. They are ever so totally distracting. Plus the footnotes, which are so important for updating the earlier text to this century, don't work on Kindle hardware or on Kindle for iPad (or apparently on any Kindle version).

It's a great shame that such an important book has been ported to the Kindle platform in such a cavalier fashion."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"The book provides a gene-centric view on evolution, a perspective complimentary to the most popular &#34;individual selection&#34; approach. Genes, not individual organisms, Dawkins argues, are the replicating entities, so they are the basic units of natural selection. This paradigm is employed to explain certain phenomena (like grandmother altruism, or other particular forms of &#34;altruism&#34; in general), that would be hard to explain from &#34;benefit of the individual&#34; paradigm.In one of the final chapters, Dawkins applies the same theory to the evolution of another kind of replicators, &#34;memes&#34; (or ideas), and points certain striking similarities.The book was not an eye opener (quite probably because it's been 30 years since its initial publication, and some of its ideas are much more widespread nowadays), but it was definitely worth reading.For me, the most value from reading the book came from various insights scattered across its pages. Learning about things like animal manipulation, parasites and their influence on hosts, benefits of altruism, game theory and evolutionary stable strategies was incredibly interesting and definitely expanded my perspective.I strongly recommend the book. Learning and understanding our evolutionary inclinations is the only way to gain control over them."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"I just finished listening to the MP3 CD version for the second time. I'll probably do it another 1-2 times because there is so much information to take in. Richard Dawkins (RD from now on) does a simply amazing job of breaking things down into understandable terms; though with the complexity of the subject matter, multiple readings are still beneficial. I have a BS in biolgy so I had a fair ammount of knowledge going in as well as knowing most of the vocabulary. For those without this knowledge, it might take a bit longer but I don't believe will decrease your appreciation of this book.There is a reason that most people consider this his definitive work; RD touches on most of his explanations/theories for how he sees the world. His other books, which I'm in the process of reading/acquiring seem to expand further the thoughts of this one. This is not a \\"believe in my opinion or you're stupid\\" book. It's a carefully laid out and organized group of observations/evidence that allows the reader to make up her mind. Whether you are an atheist, or a creationist, this is an absolute must read (I do acknowledge I'm roughly 30 years late to the party on this one). For atheists, it gives explanations for how things can develop (morality included) without a divine creator. For creationists, it hits on the major aguments against ID so if a creationist wants to be taken seriously, she would have to be able to at least refute RD's theories.One thing no one can say about RD is that he doesn't think things through to the best of his ability (which is considerable).SR"},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Scholars pro-evolution can generally be divided into 1) those who believe in evolution at the group level (ie: The reason lions behave in a particular way is because they want to survive as a species) or 2) those who believe in evolution at an individual level (ie: The reason a particular bird behaves in a particular way is because he wants to survive as an individual bird). Dawkins' views are closer to the latter. In fact, he takes it a step further and argues for evolution at the gene level. I think he makes a very convincing case for his views. Of course nothing is certain (except uncertainty perhaps) so he does not prove his theory definitively.The book can be hard to read at times and may be a bit slow for those with no background in biology or science.

Upon reading it, I cannot help but view the world in an entirely new light, one that is at once unsettling and intriguing. Author Richard Dawkins is quite effective at communicating his opinions to readers in a clear and provoking manner, interspersing short anecdotes in his discussions to further illustrate his ideas. Dawkins is clever in that his work can be read by both the scientist and the layman with great fervor. I, myself, found my eyes hooked onto its pages for hours at a time. From the very first page, one is addicted; these self-replicators are mindless congregations of matter that have been able to construct \\"gigantic lumbering robots\\" within which entire colonies of themselves exist, sealed off from the outside world (p. 19). Their communication with their host is limited, instead opting to deal with their creation through indirect and oftentimes torturous manipulation. It is mind-boggling to accept that these replicators are none other than DNA, and we are merely their \\"survival machines\\" (p. 20). I found it most interesting to see Dawkins' arguments from a philosophical standpoint; how have we as survival machines lost the ability to recognize that we are not one separate entity? Why do we think and feel as \\"I\\" and not \\"we\\"? Dawkins provides an explanation and it is simply that selection has favored genes that promote cooperation with others. This has happened to such an extent that the communal nature of a colony of identical genes is for all intensive purposes unrecognizable. Evolution has seemed to favor a survival machine having the ability of subjective consciousness. This certainly brings us to the paradox of what our individual consciousness entails--what our lives truly mean. As Dawkins so beautifully ponders, \\"...perhaps consciousness arises when the brain's simulation of the world becomes so complete that it must include a model of itself\\" (p. 59). Returning to the topic at hand, what makes The Selfish Gene so remarkable is that presenting its heavily scientific concepts is prose that is almost lyrical in nature. Indeed, this is where the magic of the book grasps the reader like a clenched fist. Instead of describing the movement of cistrons from one generation to the next by describing how the chromosomes align on the metaphase plate, and how chiasmata form, Dawkins chooses a much more romantic route: \\"As the cistrons leave one body and enter the next, as they board sperm or egg for the journey into the next generation, they are likely to find that the little vessel contains their close neighbors of the previous voyage, old shipmates with whom they sailed on the long odyssey from the bodies of distant ancestors. Neighboring cistrons on the same chromosome form a tightly-knit troupe of traveling companions who seldom fail to get on board the same vessel...\\" (p. 33). That is the magic that is The Selfish Gene."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"I read The Selfish Gene (2nd edition, 1989) because it is one of the twenty books Charlie Munger recommends in the second edition of Poor Charlie's Almanack (which I have recently read and recommend very strongly indeed).I'm going to quote Dawkins from the preface to the original edition as he provides an excellent summary of the central message of the book and its effect upon him (and me):\\"We are survival machines - robot vehicles blindly programmed to preserve the selfish molecules known as genes. This is a truth which still fills me with astonishment. Though I have known it for years, I never seem to get fully used to it.\\"Using one of the many excellent analogies utilised throughout his book, Dawkins explains that we are like a chess computer program that has been programmed by its creator to play in its absence. The programmer (genes) takes no part in the game (life) but instead provides the tools for its vehicle (animal, plant etc.) to play the game on its behalf.I am glad that Dawkins says that he never gets fully used to this idea. I find it very difficult to replace the idea of my primacy in my body with the idea above. It requires a sort of \`flip' in one's perception - but it is so different to what our senses tell us that it flips back without a conscious effort (or so I find, anyway). But how many of us have not regularly had to do battle with themselves to do what they know they should do rather than what they feel an urge to do? Dawkins' ideas provide an excellent framework in which to help understand these problems, which I suspect is a major part of the reason why Munger recommended this book.For example, Munger believes that what he calls \`reward and punishment superresponse tendency' is the most powerful of the psychological biases that affect humans (and other animals). Dawkins provides a very convincing explanation of why this should be the case: because it is a method that the programmer (genes) can use to provide rules that its vehicle (us) can use to learn to cope with its environment better in the absence of the programmer. It is thus much more efficient than providing an endless number of detailed rules and copes with the problem of an environment that may be different to that \`expected' by the genes. Even so, these rules do not always help us today - for example it helps to explain why rich societies have a problem with obesity: our genes did not expect us to have access to such plenty that the rule to reward us for putting sweet things into our mouths would cause problems.Our selfish, almost immortal genes do not care about us - their short-term, throwaway vehicles. We should also expect to find that we have been programmed with selfish behaviour in our creators' image. However, he makes two very important caveats, which mean that overall I think the book has a rather hopeful message:1. We are likely to have a statistical propensity towards selfishness, but that does not mean that individually we are doomed to that behaviour. We have a choice.2. In my favourite chapter, \`Nice guys finish first' (one of the two chapters added for the 2nd edition) Dawkins uses the Prisoner's Dilemma gambling game to show that if certain conditions are met (which often are in nature), paradoxically, the best outcome is for selfish individuals to cooperate. And that the \`good' character traits of niceness, forgivingness and non-enviousness can therefore be the most successful.I believe that unless we wish to rely on luck throughout our lives we need to embrace reality as closely as possible, which is what a first-rate book like Dawkins' helps us to do."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Than anything religion has to offer. Forget the fact that Mr Dawkins is an atheist. What this book has to offer goes far beyond the typical banter of creationist vs scientist. This book explains clearly and precisely some of the basic tenets of Darwinian natural selection and how that builds our world.The greatest thing about this book, for me, is that it peaked my interest in science. Throughout highschool and college I never paid much mind to science in general, making statements like, \\"it's too complicated\\". Science can be complex and complicated, but it can also be simply and clearly explained by authors such as Mr. Dawkins.I have to admit that prior to reading this book, I had no knowledge of Darwinian theory. Mr. Dawkins makes great use of simile to explain genes and how they effect animal behavior and structure.**By the way, for those who still think humans are not animals, wake up!!**This book opened up my mind to a whole new world of information. I truly believe that science will one day unravel all of the mysteries of humanity and the universe. At least scientists are willing to question themselves, to admit they don't have all the answers, yet. At least scientists are willing to admit when they are wrong and build on their mistakes. At least science relies on a universal methodology, clearly explained, which anyone can apply. At least scientific evidence has to pass rigorous testing and peer review. The same cannot be said of religion(s) which only re-interpret the same bundle of tired re-worded mythical stories. Religion uses fables to try and refute facts and evidence, of which it provides neither.Science does no harm by explaining things. Who wouldn't want more knowledge about life, the universe, and the hidden causes behind the world. Science reveals to us just how amazing life is, right down to the cellular level. I find it incredibly inspirational. To say science is bad is simply ignorant.I am most thankful for having taken the time to read this book and grasping a basic understanding of genetics and how they effect every being in the world. Thank you Mr. Dawkins for sparking my interest in science!!I recommend this book to anyone who isn't afraid to challenge themselves."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"At about the same time Dawkins first put his pen to \`The Selfish Gene' my granduncle, Albino Luciani, cast his vote for genetic science. Just a month before his election to the papacy, when all other cardinals condemned Louise Brown - the world's first artificially inseminated child - as \\"a child of the devil,\\" the 33 day pope John Paul I, at the time Archbishop of Venice, wrote her parents, \\"I congratulate you on the birth of your little girl. I (the Church) have no right to condemn you for what you asked the doctors to carry out. Be assured, there is reserved for both you and your child a high place in heaven.\\"A week later the cardinal was questioned by a reporter as to why he had defied the papal decree that condemned such experimentation. He told the reporter, \\"My good friend Einstein could not accept the existence of God because of the way God plays dice with His children. Many are born with mental and physical defects only to live unspeakable lives and die unspeakable deaths. How many children are born is not what is important, what is important is that every child that is born has an equal chance at a good and healthy life. Only genetic science can take us there. God played hooky the day that class was taught.\\" This quote is from Lucien Gregoire's \`Murder in the Vatican' the only existing biography of my granduncle.I was surprised that as a layperson I was able to grasp Dawkins's work - particularly as it analyses the world of genes. This is one of his great attributes. He is able to explain extremely complex subjects so that the dimmest of us can understand them. If one aspires to be of the school of Dawkins, as I am, \`The Selfish Gene' is a good place to start."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"My only complaint is that, unlike the 2nd edition, which greatly expanded on the 1st edition, including some very useful and clarifying notes by Dawkin's addressing much of the controvery his first edition created, this aniversary edition does not include any new material, other than a new forward. If you are interested in reading this book, a used second edition copy is as good as this one (skip the first edition -- lacks the last two chapters and Dawkins' comentaries).The information in this book is worthy of five stars. It is the finest treatise on natural selection as the prime shaper of an evolutionary process to date. It clearly shows how a complex biological system (like humans) can arise from simple replicating molecules. It does not refute religious ideas of supernatural creation, but simply provides an alternative explanation via a natural biological mechanism. It isn't, as some think, ground breaking research -- as Dawkin's says himself, if is more a treatise of existing research. It's importance is in Dawkin's magnificent writing ability that bridged the technical fields of evolutionary biology and sociobiology to the layman."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Richard Dawkins' The Selfish Gene is a great book for people with all levels of knowledge about evolution and genetics. It seems that Dawkin's use of metaphors in the bulk of the book, could make it harder to understand the science behind his logic. However, this is not the case because Dawkins is very careful about which metaphors he uses. These metaphors prevent people with a vast knowledge of genetics from getting board while reading the book, but at the same time teach people about genetics without them realizing it. The science behind this book is very solid. Throughout most of the books he cites papers and other scientists. Dawkins is also an accomplished zoologist and a professor at Oxford. Dawkins is obviously an atheist and he is not afraid to express his opinions at the expense of others beliefs. In the endnotes there is a section spent entirely on proving religions wrong.In the book Richard Dawkins makes the argument that genes, not humans, are selfish. He says that this is the only way possible because genes are constantly competing for a \`spot' in organisms. If genes were altruistic then they would not be as likely to get passed onto future generations as those that are selfish because the selfish ones would reap the benefits while the altruistic genes would suffer. This means that at some point altruistic genes became essentially nonexistent in the gene pool.His selfish gene logic means that genes that cause selfish phenotypes are the only genes in organisms. This means that all organisms, without conscious thought, will only do things that they gain from (by gaining he means having a higher chance of passing on their genes). He gives examples of seemingly altruistic relationships, like the aphid to ant relationship. Then he shows that they are actually for selfish gain and it just so happens that along with the gain for the individual comes gain for the other.At the end of the book Dawkins shows that having selfish genes could actually result in a \`nice' organism in the chapter \\"Nice guys finish first.\\" He uses Prisoner's Dilemma, a game, to describe how this could happen. In the end he shows that strategies that play kindly end up getting a higher number of points then those that play meanly. (Strategies are like genes they set up a rule for playing, but do not consciously control the organism/game). This means that to gain selfishly you would actually want to be nice. So niceness could occur in a selfish gene pool.Dawkins also says that humans have a conscious and are one of the first organisms that can act independently from their selfish genes in thought and action.In summary, I thoroughly enjoyed this book because of its scientific teachings and sound logic. Therefore, I would recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Thirty years later and this classic remains a compelling read. This book has fueled a thousand others, setting the perspective for all those interested in the building blocks of life. It's a genes-eye-view of where we came from and how we are motivated, a science and reason-based treatise that is compulsory reading for those of us intent on learning from and about our remarkable natural history. Other books by Dr. Dawkins maybe an easier read but this is where it all started."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"This is the third book I have read by Richard Dawkins. This 30th anniversary edition of the Selfish Gene is the oldest of the books he has written that I have read - the other two have been more recent works. I did not find this book as easy to read and as interesting as the more recent books, but it was still, nevertheless, a good, informative read.In this work, Dawkins discusses in detail the machinations of the gene and how both individual selfishness and individual altruism are explained by the fundamental law that he calls gene selfishness. Dawkins defines the \\"gene\\" as a successful unit of replication. It must have longevity, fecundity, and copying fidelity as its properties. It is the largest entity which, at least potentially, has these properties.I think one important concept to understand in the reading of this material is that of an evolutionary stable strategy (ESS). Two characteristics of such a strategy would be:1. When used by an entire population, it is resistant to invasion by new (mutant) strategies. In other words, is stable with respect to evolutionary changes.2. It carries on doing well when it is already numerous in the population of strategies.A classic example given is that the reason lions do not hunt lions is because it would not be an ESS for them to do so.Two other important concepts are replicators and vehicles. The replicators are the fundamental units of natural selection that form lineages of identical copies with occasional random mutation. DNA molecules are an example of replicators. In the case of vehicles, Dawkins stated \\"The vehicles don't replicate themselves; they work to propagate their replicators. Replicators don't behave, don't perceive the world, and don't catch prey; they make vehicles that do all those things.\\" These concepts aid in understanding how genes affect the outcome of host behavior.The book is replete with detailed examples of how these principles work in nature, and contains an extensive notes section to further clarify the information of the original work.

I'm glad I did. Dawking is brilliant, and this is a must read."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Maybe it's a quirk in my personality, but I'm always looking for some great truth, some unifying theory. After all, if the beautiful world around us was not created by a deity (which, as an explanation, explains nothing), but by something as \`seemingly random' as evolution, then surely there must be some great code, some great pattern (essentially a natural order, a natural \`Ten Commandments, if you will) running through everything. We've always heard that \`code' is \\"fit\\", but again, \`fit' in terms of genes doesn't explain much either. I needed a little more, so I cracked open this book thinking it would open my eyes to some genetic truth. I soon found lots of amazing things, but was met with the crude ugly truth about genetics: they are anything but a guide for morality. The \`beautiful pattern' I was seeking was nowhere to be found. We are met with a contradiction, as men and women: the very thing that gives us enjoyment, indulgence- satisfaction of a few evolutionary \\"carrots\\"- is the opposite of what we consider \`good' and \`moral'. Originally I believed our Morality actually stems from resisting our impulses, our genetics, to separate us from lower animals. Dawkins believes that what we consider \`sophisticated society' actually comes from whatever can be sustained in equilibrium; in other words, the reason we can eat meat, but are repulsed by Cannibalism, is mostly due to the fact that, if we were Cannibals, the species would shrink and eventually go extinct. The equilibrium is for us to eat other animals.It's also frowned upon, in modern society, to kill people. From a Genetic perspective, there's no advantage to killing people, even your rivals.. it wastes energy, and may make other rivals even stronger in rank. Reverse rationalization. Pretty much everyone one of today's social taboos comes from Genetic no-nos.How do Genes affect our bodies, and ultimately societies? These human bodies of ours, to hear Dawkins describe it, are like sports teams that our genes \`join' in order to win a championship. You see, genes don't actually have a goal, but they are known for duplication. That's what they do. And sometimes, they do it better by \`getting along with others'. Likewise, Dawkins goes on to suggest that diseases, that ultimately need their host to survive to spread more, may \`dial back' the sickness for a while, so the \`host' (the sick patient) can live a little longer, so they can infect others. This is why effects of AIDS or Cancer don't show up until later in life. This is not a willful brilliant chess move on the part of your last \`runny nose', its just that that \`runny nose' that took a while to show up propagated more than the one that put its host in the hospital instantly.The funny thing is, human personality, something we identify, describe and name (eg. Human Psychology and Personality Development) is backwards, its Monday Morning Quarterbacking. To hear Dawkins Describe Human Personalities, is like the IBM's Deep Blue Supercomputer walking you through its chess moves in the dismantling of the Kasparov. There is order there, we just didn't know it. An aggressive man and a passive woman, those are just two different strategies. The inclination to see the good in people is really just another strategy. It turns out that we too, represent multiple genetic options. He with the better strategy wins- he'll get the money, he'll get multiple sexual partners, spread his genes, and be very strong and confident. And the personalities/strategies, like viruses, that are more effective, spread.Speaking of personality and morality, what about lying? Do animals ever tell lies? It turns out that when baby chicks chirp louder, they get more food. The mum assumes the hungriest chicks will chirp the loudest. That's right, we didn't (sorry Ricky) invent lying. Animals have been doing it for ages. And when an Animal discovers that its colors protect it (because it looks like a vicious competitor), it's lying too. And exploits the lie.Besides spreading genetic code, we like to spread ideas. Perhaps you've heard this term floating around the Internet: Memes. Memes are good, bad, stupid ideas, that either catch on, or they vanish, evaporate. And Memes have a pretty cool feature, that, like Genes, they can replicate (very quickly, like this \`Boy Slams Bully\` Video which caught fire a couple months ago) by replicating in other people's minds. I can even speak an idea, and 50,000 people can hear it, or write something on the web (or in the sand, on a beach) and people can come back later and read it. The Meme, thought, duplicates, and that's why it's powerful.Interestingly, that makes two things that can replicate, Genes and Memes. Memes are the takeoff of evolution, dovetailing into technology, that got us driving 100 miles an hour, and flying up in the sky, not with strong legs, or broad wings, but, technology. Bad ideas are trashed and good ideas are copied and improved upon (patent system be damned).When we die, Dawkins says, we leave these two things behind, Genes and Memes. Is this all we can achieve in this mortal coil? To raise a family, pass on our code, and leave some imprint on the world, make some mark, be a world famous athlete, scientist, discoverer, pop star or military hero? Shall we be judged not by memories of our loved ones, but by our \`meme'-richness (or Cosmic Google ranking)? In the search for eternal life, it would seem so. All that matters is great ideas. In terms of unifying theories, it's a little weak but there is some justice to it.More reviews like this on 21tiger"},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"The Selfish Gene and The History of Earth should be on the list of everyones favorites.

But, it's no Bukowski."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"No, this isn't an Ayn Rand book urging you to be more selfish.I consider The Selfish Gene to still be one of the cornerstones of Evolutionary Dynamics theory, particularly in its extension of biological dynamics into the non-biological world. Memetics really took general evolutionary theory past a threshold for information and soft sciences. I found its concepts to be invaluable for one of my grad papers on international systems where I made further extrapolations from both biology and memetics, formulating more specific characteristic traits shared by all extreme complexity nonlinear evolutionary systems.Just as Darwin was not perfect, though, Dawkins himself oversimplifies at times. The scales at which these \\"games\\" transpire outside a vacuum include multi-gene traits, male-female trait-complimenting within speciation, role hierarchy, inter-species symbiotic relationships, larger populations, and even whole ecosystems. Furthermore, non-zero sum outcomes are more prevalent than winner-takes-all. Thus accounting for the multitude of levels at which competition occurs and adding, for example, Nash Equilibriums, one can only begin to explore the infinite complexity of how systems evolve.On the religion aspect of this book, I think Dawkins does a fine job showing how biology and the workings of the universe do not necessarily \\"bare witness\\" to a god with the way life works, the planets revolve around the sun, or the rain falls from the sky. Biological evolution is a very specific example of this and case studies in transitional fossils, the newer computer experiments, and showing the prevalence of evolution everywhere help bare it out quite well here. At times, however, he seems to get a little preachy unconstructively to people who will likely just attribute their rationale to faith, anyway.For a more recent and legally interesting exploration of the creationism v. evolution debate, I recommend the Nova documentary \\"Judgment Day: Intelligent Design on Trial\\" for its timeliness and brevity. While I think this discussion is essentially long past over, even for an agnostic like myself I'm not going to dismiss all spiritualism or interest into the nature of consciousness or existence itself. The twisting of science using half-truths and ignorance in support of specific institutional dogmas is fair game for attack, though. And I have to admit The Selfish Gene was as successful as I think one can be in long-form."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Dawkins takes up where Darwin stopped; his reasoning and logical proofs sweep the last bit of theism from the mind.

Dawkins argues clearly and with integrity and you get so many mini epiphany moments as you read that you can't help but be profoundly affected by what you read. You will have such an understanding of how our genes may well influence things that you will look at life around you in a completely new light. I'd say that where as Steve Jones' 'Language of the Gene's' (which is also superb and highly recommended) looks more at human genetics, 'The Selfish Gene' looks at genes in general and applies the theory to plants, animals and human life. This is a very clear and readable book, which makes it all the more enjoyable. Don't get bogged down in the moral and political debates around the issues in this book, as Dawkins repeatedly says, this is about genes and how they function, not about if they are morally right to do so.

I have lost count on the number of times I have turned to this book, with utmost satisfaction. What draws you to it is its sheer value. Origins of life, purpose of life, and the architecture of the living world, couldn't be better explained. Richard Dawkins is simply the best science writer taking his reader in a zestful metaphorical parade, through ever existential questions and sharing a scientific perspective that is refreshing and rational.Firstly, his writing style deserves 10 out of 10. Fit for any class of reader, erudite to layman, this classic rendition is simply too lucid and it would be impossible for anyone to NOT understand the content. Although you might have to read more than once to appreciate the many layers of sheer genius hidden in each sentence.Second - He takes you on a roller coaster ride, with seatbelts on, but nevertheless rocking enough for you to gasp out loud at various twists and bends, and safely brings you down to solid ground.Third - Explaining concepts such as replicators and vehicles with the gene in our planet being the replicator and the fundamental unit of selection for all life and the organisms being the vehicles or the machines (all plants and animals) , selfishness of the gene (reminding everyone constantly about the metaphorical significance of the term selfish), the purpose of life (or the lack of any divine/spiritual purpose) through the bottlenecked life cycle, the cultural unit of selection through memes, the clear debunking of the group selection theories....the menu is utterly savory leading you to crave the book. I take it often on train rides and even though I have read the book more than 20 times, I find it as one of the simple pleasures of life to read it on a train, fully immersed into it as if it was my first read.This book has made my life a lot simpler. While I had been drawn to various spiritual sects in the past looking for deeper meaning and purpose of life, nothing made so much sense to me as this book. While spiritual perspectives are welcome, they never hit the spot for me. I feel liberated with this scientific and rational perspective. I am also in the stage of my life where I am the healthiest I have ever been. Freedom and health is a perfect combination.Thanks Richard Dawkins for being the public advocate of science and skepticism. MY deepest appreciation for your work, your writings, and your ideas."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"This edition contains an excerpt from a 1982 review by John Maynard Smith that sums things up nicely. Smith first observes that \\" The Selfish Gene reports no new facts. Nor does it contain any new mathematical models - indeed it contains no mathematics at all. What it does contain is a new world view.\\" Indeed it does. Most of the material I had already encountered elsewhere, but Dawkins has a tremendous gift for allowing the reader to see the whole of life from a new perspective (in this case, the perspective of the replicators that fashion us).In commenting on the hostility aroused by the book, Smith further notes that \\"[this] is a book about the evolutionary process - it is not about morals, or about politics, or about the human sciences\\". Too many people (myself included at one time) look at the title and see in it a promotion of the naturalistic fallacy ('what is ought to be'), which in turn elicits a defensive reaction from our own moralistic fallacies ('what ought to be is'). The book is not about a gene (or genes) that make us selfish, nor does it excuse selfish behaviours on evolutionary grounds. It is merely a statement of what is. If we deny what is because we don't like it, our ability to effectively remedy what we don't like is curtailed. Besides, things aren't as bad as all that anyway. I like how Dawkins added the chapter \\"Nice Guys Finish First\\" in this edition, where he nicely summarizes social game theory as it relates to evolutionary stable strategies of altruism. It really does make for a more optimistic and upbeat ending."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"This book is simply amazing! It is beautifully written and well formulated. I love how Richard Dawkins argues for his theories. I have learned about evolution in school, but not this way!

Is it smart to cheat others in order to survive? If so, how much can you cheat before you get busted and is less likely to survive?Finally I have to say that this is clearly the best book of Richard Dawkins I have read so far, and I highly recommend it!!

At the heart of the matter is the \\"Selfish Gene\\" which *seems* to seek to multiply itself in the smartest ways to survive the longest. Sometimes one needs to take a \\"game theory\\" view, which leads to counter-intuitive conclusions.Continually Richard Dawkins repeats the mantra that just because something *is* in nature, does not mean that we *ought* to follow this way. The history of humanity is about rising above nature, subduing nature, thanks to our intellect. This may be a story about how we got here, but now we have the intellect to guide where we want to go.Richard Dawkins scientific acumen cannot be denied, nor can his ability to communicate science to the masses.

Though it drags on at times, the entire book is wonderfully written, having the perfect blend of scientific intelligence and basic summarization, so that at no point in the book does the reader feel absolutely confused, nor as if they are being spoken to as a child.In a way, opening this book is like opening a nerdy Snapple cap. Every page has a different interesting study or pattern observed by scientists, and every single one ends up explaining some part of the theory of evolution. Honestly, I don't think that anyone who believes in Intelligent Design could read this book and still call evolution made up. Dawkins connects all the dots for the reader, to a point where disputing evolution is just pure ignorance.This is a wonderfully written, interesting book, and anyone who wants to know more about evolution or just wants to know what all the big fuss is about should definitely read this."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Richard Dawkins has become famous in the public mind as one of the strongest exponents of contemporary evolutionary theory, as well as an opponent of religion and creationism. THE SELFISH GENE is the book that launched his career as a celebrity scientist.Ostensibly it is devoted to addressing, and ultimately debunking, the idea of \\"group selection,\\" or the nearly equivalent \\"altruism\\". What does natural selection actually select? The gene. Or more generally, a replicator, of which a gene is the pertinent example, while speculations on the nature of other possible replicators makes for interesting reading at the end of the book. The fact that genes are units of replication and thus selection is the defining principle of \\"neo-Darwinism,\\" the combination of Darwin's pre-genetic understanding of evolution with Mendelian genetics. Dawkins pursues with logical rigor the implications of this understanding, clearing away a lot of confusions, particularly those centered around explicit or inadvertent assumptions of selection of individual organisms, groups of them, or whole species or ecosystems. Seeming examples of such \\"altruism\\"--one organism promoting another's welfare at its own expense--can often be explained as \\"kin selection,\\" where one organism's genes promote the welfare of the identical genes in closely related organisms. In all cases, though, the gene is doing what is most effective in creating copies of itself.Though Dawkins is addressing a specific, if widespread, confusion regarding evolutionary theory, his book also serves as a good general introduction to the topic. His language is clear, evocative, and often passionate, and his examples and metaphors are memorable. Mathematical concepts, such as the Prisoner's Dilemma, are explained clearly, without formulas or technical language. Quasi-philosophical speculations provide meaty food for thought. He introduces the now oft-referenced if seldom understood idea of the \\"meme,\\" a unit of cultural reproduction. Also, in the thirtieth anniversary edition he provides a summary of the idea he develops in THE EXTENDED PHENOTYPE: that genes' actions on the environment do not end at the boundary of their organism's body, but act on other bodies and the physical world.Some reviewers found this book a depressing read. This, I suspect, results from succumbing to \\"genetic determinism\\", which Dawkins avowedly rejects. When talking about humans, he notes that genes exert a strong statistical influence on our behavior, but not a completely irresistible one. For instance, there are the memes, replicators which evolve much more quickly than the gene. Yet our conscious minds can evaluate and choose to ignore even those. We can ignore the programming of genes (and memes), though it is a tough battle. THE SELFISH GENE helps us better understand what we're up against."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Very well written book.

If you are a religious person, beware that this book might shock you in several ways."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"In eleven short, tightly written, lively, and easy to understand chapters, Professor Dawkins answers all the questions about Darwin's theory of evolution that we might have always wanted to know the answers to but were afraid to ask. He does this even though strictly speaking, the book is not at all intended to be a book on evolution. It was intended to be about the gene-centered view of evolution: that is to say, about how the gene sits at the center of the control module of all living organisms.Dawkins belief in evolution is solid, because to him, Darwin's theory is settled science that has not only stood the test of time but also is a \\"thoroughly-tested\\" and falsifiable theory. And as existential theories of living matter go, Darwin's theory of Evolution -- with its primary instrumentalities of time and natural selection -- provides the simplest explanation (in the sense of Occam's razor), of all living things: of how we got from inorganic to organic matter; from unordered atoms to complex patterns, from simplicity to complexity more generally, and from a single \\"live\\" cell, to the cell's ascendance into more complex living organisms, to higher forms and orders. This of course means that a supernatural being of any kind whatsoever would be superfluous.At the beginning of the book, the author poses the question \\"Why Do People Exist?\\" and proceeds to answer it by saying that: We exist in large part because of the \\"biology of selfishness,\\" that is, due to the selfishness of the genes. In the process of answering this question, he develops the biology of DNA and along the way demolishes some long-held hypotheses of the \\"pre-Darwinian\\" social psychologists and theorists who have long believed falsely that evolution is concerned more with the \\"survival of the species\\" rather than with the \\"survival of the individual.\\" Dawkins claim is a radical and controversial one: that this long-held hypothesis about altruism makes no evolutionary sense; and that if we are concerned about the evolution of altruism, then biology is probably not the right place to look.The crux of Dawkin's thesis is that \\"bodies are mere transport vehicles for genes.\\" \\"We are machines created by and under the control of our genes,\\" the predominant quality of which is \\"their ruthless selfishness.\\" And although altruism may indeed have survival extending value, we are genetically programmed to be ruthlessly selfish rather than altruistic.This is a seminal work that set off the fireworks in the sociobiology debates, and 30 years on, a great deal of its substance is still valid and has endured.

The successes of medical genetics and genomics during the last decade have resulted in a sharp shift toward an almost completely genetic view of ourselves. I find it striking that 10 years ago, a geneticist had to defend the idea that not only the environment but also genes shape human development. Today, one feels compelled to stress that there is a large environmental component to common diseases, behavior, and personality traits! There is an insidious tendency to look to our genes for most aspects of our \\"humanness,\\" and to forget that the genome is but an internal scaffold for our existence.We need to leave behind the view that the genetic history of our species is the history par excellence. We must realize that our genes are but one aspect of our history, and that there are many other histories that are even more important. For example, many people in the Western world feel a connection to ancient Greece, from which arose fundamental features of Western architecture, science, technology, and political ideals (such as democracy). Yet, at best a tiny fraction of the gene pool of the Western industrialized world came from the ancient Greeks. Obviously, this fact in no way diminishes the importance of ancient Greece. So it is a delusion to think that genomics in isolation will ever tell us what it means to be human.\\" [[...]]That paper also argues that genome literacy can teach us how to get rid of racism, cruelty towards animals, and some other bad habits.

If you, like me, have ever had a genetics class in college, you will likely find most of the material in the book boring, like I did. Whether Dawkins had put together a water-tight argument did not concern me since I more or less bought into the premise from the start; however, the way Dawkins approaches his \\"proof\\" can grow tedious. And anyone would have to admit that it's scarcely a proof more than a proliferation of plausibility arguments. There aren't any definitive experiments that set out specifically for this purpose. Rather, there is an interminable array of anecdotal observations where Dawkins loosely applies his new favorite tool, Game Theory, to show that his theory can equally explain the observation as well as any competing theory (e.g. that genes select for group survival as opposed solely for gene survival), and then with invocation of Ockham's Razor, he implores us to adopt his theory over all others.The fact that this text is loaded with words like \\"selfish\\" and \\"altruism\\", and is littered with anthropomorphic metaphors imparts a degree of sensationalism that I could have done without, and frankly, detracts from the science.

Its subject matter--evolution of life on earth--is important. Its writing is flawless and its points well-argued. Its conclusions are significant, controversial, and seemingly inescapable.The Selfish Gene is not for the faint of heart. Just look at the review here titled \\"Fascinating, but at times I wish I could unread it\\"--the author thinks that Dawkins's book \\"presents an appallingly pessimistic view of human nature, and makes life seem utterly pointless.\\" I don't share this reviewer's view, but I'll get to that later. Some background is necessary first.Richard Dawkins is an evolutionary biologist at Oxford University. The Selfish Gene, his first book, was published in 1976. It has since become a classic of popular science literature. I'm not a scientist and I can't critique the scientific accuracy of Dawkins's book, but I don't need to: The Selfish Gene has been scrutinized for decades, and it has emerged mostly unscathed.Though it does contain background material, The Selfish Gene is not an evolution text. Dawkins's goal with the book is primarily to argue for a gene-based, rather than an organism- or group-based, view of evolution. He sets out to refute the theory of \\"group selection,\\" which had been popular prior to the 1970s. According to group selection, traits can spread in a population if they benefit groups, even if they are detrimental (evolutionary-fitness-wise) to individuals. So, for example, group selection implies that a trait for disinterested altruism can spread if groups of altruists are better off than groups of non-altruists.Dawkins argues that genes, not organisms or groups, are the fundamental unit of evolution. He terms genes \\"selfish,\\" a word he gives a technical meaning. A \\"selfish\\" unit of evolution is one that is selected for--that is copied through the generations--in a Darwinian selection process. A \\"successful\\" selfish unit produces many copies of itself; an unsuccessful one disappears. Dawkins does not mean, of course, that genes themselves \\"are\\" selfish. Rather he means that they affect the organisms containing them as if they are. Their effects suggest a selfish disposition.Genes are passed on based only on their ability to influence organisms to pass them on. Their benefit to particular organisms or groups is relevant only insofar as it aids their own selfish interest. Genes must be selfish, as only those most effective at replicating themselves stick around. The \\"unselfish\\" ones all die out.Genes are \\"replicators\\"--they create identical copies of themselves. Organisms are not--they pass only their genes to the next generation. Dawkins provides a possible story of the origin of life: in it, primitive replicators emerged in the primordial soup that was earth's surface hundreds of millions of years ago. These replicators were stable configurations of molecules that, through the laws of physics and chemistry, caused like configurations to be created around them. The copying process occasionally made mistakes, which led to a diversity of replicators. Because the replicators competed for finite resources (molecules), natural selection favored the ones that were best able to survive and reproduce. More-stable arrangements--and arrangements capable of decreasing rivals' stability--were favored. As time progressed, offensive and defensive strategies became increasingly sophisticated, and the molecular arrangements became increasingly complex.Eventually the replicators \\"learned\\" to build bodies for themselves. Dawkins suggests that a particular strain may have \\"discovered\\" (through a mutation) how to build a wall of protein around itself. He terms these bodies \\"survival machines.\\" Survival machines helped the replicators to move around, to defend themselves, and to reproduce. As the replicators grew more complex, so did their survival machines. The living things we now know--amoebas, worms, trees, racoons, humans--are all survival machines. The DNA contained in every cell is the medium for genes, which are the replicators. We are their survival machines.So ends chapter two of The Selfish Gene. Dawkins spends most of the rest of the book elaborating on his argument and demonstrating its explanatory power in specific cases. He covers his bases well and responds to the obvious objections to his theory. I couldn't possibly do justice to the finer points of his argument in this review, and I won't try. Instead I will briefly cover a few of the points I found most interesting.Dawkins's dismissal of group selection, which I mentioned earlier, rests largely on the concept of evolutionary stability. A behavior pattern (\\"strategy\\") that is prevalent in a population is evolutionarily stable if it cannot be displaced by an upstart strategy. Strategies for disinterested altruism--which group selection suggests could develop--are not evolutionarily stable. I'll illustrate with an example. Say that a gene \\"for\\" sitting on whatever eggs lie around is prevalent in a bird population. As long as all the members of the population possess this gene, all is well: all eggs will get sat on. However, if a mutant bird that sits on no eggs enters the population, its genes will spread rapidly: most of its eggs will get sat on (by the altruists), and it will be free to gather food and lay more. A strategy for sitting on whatever eggs lie around thus is not evolutionarily stable. (A strategy for sitting on no eggs isn't stable either.) As Dawkins shows, a strategy for sitting on only one's own eggs is stable.Genes are in competition with one another. They \\"want\\" to propagate more of their own kind, which means that organisms with similar genes tend to have similar interests and organisms with different genes tend to have different interests. Close relatives, who share many genes in common, tend to have closely-related interests. Because parents pass half of their genes to their children, parental care isn't altruism at the gene level--genes have much to gain from influencing organisms to aid others containing them. Because parents and children do differ genetically, however, their relationship is not purely cooperative. You'd expect children to \\"exploit\\" their parents to a degree--for example, by pretending to be more hungry than they actually are--and such behavior is in fact present in nature.Dawkins has much to say on the relationship between the sexes. He defines \\"males\\" as organisms with small and numerous sex cells (i.e., sperm) and \\"females\\" as organisms with large and few sex cells (i.e., eggs). Because sperm can be produced cheaply and in great number, male investment in child bearing is low. Female investment, however, is significant: a large egg must be produced, and a long gestation period may be involved. This discrepancy leads to differences in male and female strategies regarding sex. Because males' genes stand to gain (and lose) more from competition, males are more likely to behave like high-stakes gamblers. In polygamous species, they fight, sometimes to the death, for females. The winners' genes are spread to many offspring, and the losers' genes are spread to none. Because females' reproductive rate is fixed by their ability to produce eggs, they stand to gain less from competition. They have more to gain from being picky in their choice of mates, and all sorts of female mate-selection strategies have developed as a result.Before ending, I want to say a bit about the implications of Dawkins's book. The reviewer I mentioned earlier thinks that The Selfish Gene presents an \\"appallingly pessimistic view of human nature, and makes life seem utterly pointless.\\" I disagree. First, as Dawkins points out, our behavior is only partially determined by our genes. We are self-aware, rational beings, which means we can question the proclivities our genes give us. We can even \\"rebel\\" against them. Dawkins uses contraception as a simple example--non-reproductive sex certainly isn't in our genes' interest. More importantly, we can choose to behave as true altruists. We aren't compelled to obey our genes' selfish dictates.Life is only pointless if we think it is. We can create meaning as individuals and as a species. How we got here is irrelevant; we now have the power to direct our own destiny. I strongly recommend The Selfish Gene to anyone who wants to better understand their place in the universe."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"A mind blowing book. I read it 30 years ago and just re-read the slightly enhanced newer edition. Chapter 2, which introduces the idea that genes, not organisms, are the focus of evolution always gives me a feeling of awe, the closest I can come to a religious experience -- but, of course, Dawkins would not approve of that.Some of the chapters could be heavy going to a casual reader, demanding quite a bit of thought to follow the arguments. Along the way there are some nice descriptions of weird animal behavior.One of the additional chapters discusses the extended phenotype, and made me want to read Dawkins' book of that title."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Once you read the Selfish Gene, Your world will never be the same. Pardon the purple passage and excuse the apparent hyperbole, but what I assert is true, true, true.The basic idea of the Selfish Gene is that the unit of selection is the gene, and the gene, by definition, is selfish. To see why, a quick example will do. Suppose there are two seperate genes, let us label them A and B respectively. Gene A resides inside Karen, while gene B resides inside Kim. If gene A causes Karen to develop into a symmetrical, serpentine young woman, while gene B causes Kim to develop in a highly irregular manner, it is not hard to see that gene A, ceteris paribus, will be passed on in greater number than gene B. Over time this means, eo ipso, that gene A will become numerically superior in any gene pool. Of course life is not so simple, and no one gene causes beauty. However, the point is that the gene's eye view of the world explains so many mysteries of life. Altruism, sterile insects, special treatment toward kin, parent-offspring conflict, sex differences, and on and on: All can be explained with a selfish gene view of life.This may be the most powerfully written popular science book ever. I know that lavishing such praise on any work is problematic. However, I do not know of a book that influenced so many people in such a deep way. Even at 32 years of age, this book is as fresh as ever."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"I was first interested in the work of Richard Dawkins while researching a paper for an anthropology class. I had come into contact with the notion of Memes via a book called \\"Dark Nature\\", and the notion of ideas being similar to viral infection got me going. So I bought Selfish Gene and dove right in. The reading of such dense and possibly difficult meterial is made pretty simple by the use of story narratives and parallels; rendering complex information simple upload and gestate. There is no part of the book that could be considered \\"over the head\\" of anyone familiar with the subject. I was just out of High School when I read this the first time and I have bought numerous copies as gifts for people I have met along the way. As an introduction and explaination of Darwinian theory down to the genetic level this is superb and due to the accessibility of this book I went on to purchase other books by Dawkins as well. Though there is a sort of difference between Dawkins and Gould (another writer on the subject of Darwinian theory) one could be of either, or neither, camp and take many good ideas from this tome. In respect to Memes, which was and is my primary interest, not a large quantity is written, but the effect is quite infectuous enough once the seed is implanted and one can easily extrapolate from there. this book is not just something I suggest, but it and others like it I think should be taught in schools as mandatory reading."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Dawkins book was popular with scientists and lay people alike when it was first released. It remains a classic which should be read as much for historical context as for content. There are assuredly better treatments on evolutionary science these days, particularly as regards the genomic revolution.Oh, and for those who are turned off by Dawkins' athiestic pronouncements in later writings (including, one can safely conclude, the upcoming \\"The God Delusion\\"), The Selfish Gene is freer of that perspective and certainly its insights into evolutionary process do not require that you accept his stance on God.Many scientists wish that Dawkins would tone down the athiestic rhetoric. Not only does it probably reduce the number of lay readers who invest time to read the factual content in his books, but it tends to convey the impression that most scientists have the same or similar perspective. I know of no survey on the subject, but I suspect that relatively few scientists are ardent athiests. For a refreshingly thoughtful alternative perspective, cruise the web for E.O. Wilson's position on athiesm (= a copout) and his advocacy of deism."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Parts of the book were utterly fascinating to me, such as the groundbreaking idea of the \\"meme\\" as a unit of cultural transmission. But the argument that species are survival machines for our \\"immortal genes\\" seems seriously flawed.First and foremost in my mind, it is hard for me to swallow that organisms practice altruism because the gene or genes that are responsible for this altruism have a probability of existing in the recipient of the altruism, the probability increasing with the closeness of familial relatedness. How, then, to explain altruism beyond the family, or even beyond the species? The author mentions that there is at least one well-documented case of a dolphin rescuing a drowning human being. In the book this was suggested to be a mistake. One of Earth's most intelligent animals has a gene for rescuing long, narrow objects and cannot tell the difference between a human and its own species. I got doubtful when contradictory evidence was explained as a mistake. And what about organisms' adopting children originating from other parents? Always a mistake? Highly expensive practice for when the real deal arises?I do not understand why there must be *a* unit of natural selection. Can't there be more than one, sometimes at odds with each other, sometimes in tandem? I do believe genes are selected over other genes, but I believe groups can be selected over other groups, too. Perhaps other units, both larger and smaller than genes (Why not the selfish base pair?), are also naturally selected.Finally, especially considering recent discoveries in genomics that have downsized the number of estimated human genes, there cannot be one gene behind any behavioral trait you can think of, a gene for being nice to your cousin, for example. I get that a gene can have many functions and can have a net effect of being nice to your cousin, and in its absence you would be less nice to your cousin, but this makes for a complicated web which would get torn apart as succeeding generations inherit just part of the web. The influences of biology, environment, and history get harder to ignore."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Before I read this book, I was like most non-biologists out there. I'd heard of the theory of evolution, but had an incomplete understanding of what it meant and if it really had any meaning in the \\"real world\\".It was from this book that I learned that every living creature has an evolutionary past, and that this past has to be considered to understand how animals (including humans) behave.There is so much beauty in nature owed to evolutionary processes--this book is a good place to start if you want to understand that beauty in biological terms."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Just in case many people assume that all negative reviews are from people who don't believe in evolution, I want to state that I have absolutely no doubt that evolution is true. My criticism isn't against evolution but against the theory that is in this book.At the beginning of the book, Richard Dawkins says that \\"this book is mainly intended to be interesting\\" and he certainly succeeded at that!He took the idea of kin selection (the theory that asserts that natural selection in evolution works at the level of the individual plus kin which share the individual's genes) and made it thoroughly interesting by asserting that it's actually the gene that matters in evolution. According to the selfish gene theory, we humans and all other organisms are simply vehicles\\" or \\"survival machines\\" built by the genes in order to pursue their own self-interest - i.e. competing with other genes to make copies of themselves through reproduction. So we are reduced to \\"lumbering robots\\" and \\"selfish machine[s]\\" whose only true purpose is the survival of our genes. Isn't that interesting? Well, much more interesting than the question of what level natural selection works on, usually is, and, accordingly this book was much more popular than a book about the subject usually is.While I personally like Dawkins and believe him to be an honorable, intelligent man who is truly concerned about humanity, I believe this book which made him famous is flawed. Please understand that my criticisms are not of evolution itself but of the particular theory that Dawkins set forth in this book decades ago, before the human genome project and many new discoveries which show some of the weaknesses of kin selection and the selfish gene theory.In 1976, when the book was written, the theory of kin selection seemed quite plausible, 33 years later, as I write this review, much of what seemed to be evidence of this theory has been disproved. The author, of course, cannot be blamed for not knowing what was not known at the time. One of the things that will change your reading experience significantly, and I recommend this, is to read the endnotes to see some of Dawkins own comments on what he originally wrote. Interestingly, in the introduction to this edition (30th anniversary), he states that there is almost nothing he would change about the book, contradicting what he himself wrote in the endnotes. I think it's important that anyone looking to learn about this subject by reading this book today, understands the flaws in the theory as they are known today and, unfortunately, very few of the reviews have touched on this.Criticisms:1. What the author calls \\"one of the most spectacular triumphs of the selfish gene theory\\" - the explanation of the worker bees who don't reproduce because they serve their genes more by helping to raise their sisters and brothers with whom they have a 3/4 relatedness - has been disproved. Dawkins acknowledges this in the endnotes of this updated edition: \\"...new facts lead us to doubt the importance of the 3/4 relatedness hypothesis\\". It turns out that different males mate with the queen so the relatedness goes down to 1/4, but, worse yet, worker bees frequently move and work in another colony where the queen and other workers are completely unrelated to them.2. The explanation of surplus DNA has also been disproved. It turns out that the DNA that was thought to be unused actually serves a regulatory function - it is not a parasite.3. The book uses deceptive math, which is explained in a way that the author himself calls \\"a bit of a cheat\\" [endnotes p 288] that makes many people believe that we share 50% of our genes with our children and siblings, and 25% of our genes with our grandchildren and cousins while, in reality, we share well over 99% of our genes with every human, even when unrelated; and we humans share about 95% of our genes with chimpanzees. The theory that we care about kin because they share our genes seems much weaker when the real numbers are used.4. The author himself, again in the endnotes [page 313], says that the handicap principle, if true, which he now believes it is, may necessitate \\"a radical change in our view of many of the issues discussed in this book.\\"5. The entire \\"Battle of the Sexes\\" chapter is based on a theory which the author himself, in the endnotes, says does not make sense. His original argument: \\"the female sex is exploited, and the fundamental evolutionary basis for the exploitation is the fact that eggs are larger than sperms.\\" In the endnotes he takes it back: \\"even if one sperm is small and cheap, it is far from cheap to make millions of sperms and successfully inject them into a female against all the competition.\\"6. The whole book is based on an empty premise that he himself says no sane person would believe [intro to 30th anniversary edition] - the selfishness of the gene. Obviously genes can't be selfish, but he states because of the selfishness of genes, organisms are naturally selfish. This is where the souffl&eacute; comes into play: the hot air is the \\"selfishness\\" of genes leading to selfish organisms. Useful genes survive. Useful genes lead to selfish organisms doesn't sound quite as convincing.7. The author himself claims he wasn't clear about the difference between a gene and an organism, such as a person, at the time he wrote the book [intro to the 30th Anniversary Edition]. Shouldn't that make us question his conclusions about organisms?8. In the 30th anniversary edition, the author responds to a reviewer who gave the book 5 stars but says that it has caused him bouts of depression since the theory leaves no room for a deeper meaning to life, by saying that no sane person would tie his \\"life's hopes to the ultimate fate of the cosmos.\\" This seems like a rather heartless and unrealistic response, unworthy of the caring man I believe the author to be. Of course we care about meaning in life and evolution does not preclude meaning.9. It has been pointed out that kin selection theory is just group theory among relatives and has the same flaws; it is open to cheating and is, therefore, not part of an evolutionary stable system.10. Dawkins asks us to face up to the question: What on earth do you think you are, if not a robot...? I don't believe it's helpful to fight religious myths by ignoring the difference between living, breathing, caring human beings who took billions of years to evolve and robots. This is done by many evolutionary scientists: reduce humans to something less, in order to sound more scientific and distance yourself from religion; I think ignoring facts makes one less of a scientist.11. New findings have shown that DNA is fluid and responds to the environment - including our own feelings - in order to better help us adapt and survive.

If you are new to this feeling of realizing the world around you. The book basically examines the dilemma between you and others. In other words how to give others and if it is feasible or not. The book is entitled as the bible for neo Darwinian thought, yet it seems to me how much it adds to the Darwinian source of thought is highly exegerated. As for all the books I have read on the psyche of man, the deep analysis for the human intelligence is lacking. The book also has an ethocentricism, prasing the scientific approach too much.And it also favours the individualism of the 20th century, which is the source of all the evils of our daily life. It gives away fragments of justification for the over powered self of the capitalist mode of production.We are not all survival machines only and we will not make sacrifices just for to pass our genes to future decades.This book heavily focuses on the materialist approach of living a life. But it will not explain all aspects of human beings. It can not explain literature, poetry or art or other manly feelings. And the choice between a materialist approach of life and more feeling full life is still a personal choice. (thanks a millions). Humans are not only calculators. This book however is worth reading.

Unlike the other works, I found this one unaccessible to the everyday reader.If you want a more straightforward book on evolution, go with the Blind Watchmaker."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Dawkins spends a lot of time in his new introduction to this edition trying to persuade us that he is not a crude genetic determinist. He tries to dig himself out of the hole he got himself into when he described us as \\"lumbering robots\\" created by our genes. (Chapter 2.)But in an interview published in \\"New Statesman\\" (26th March 1999), while discussing cloning, Dawkins said: \\"Cloning Saddam Hussein would be horrible. Cloning David Attenborough, or someone we all admire, might be fine.\\"If that isn't crude genetic determinism, then I don't know what is. Does Dawkins really think that the nastiness of the dead dictator and the niceness of the admirable Attenborough are simply the result of their genes, and nothing to do with their upbringing, experiences, social circumstances and life-history?This certainly does not suggest that Dawkins has a grasp of the subtle and complex interaction between our genetic potentiality and the environmental factors which play an enormous part in making us what we are.Nor does Dawkins have a real understanding of religion. He is like the philosophers of the Enlightenment in that he thinks that religious beliefs can be dispelled by directly confronting them with rational, scientific arguments. But any atheist (including myself) will know that religious peoples' ideas are not easily dislodged from their heads by logical arguments. And this is not because they have been infected by \\"memes\\". (Memes are Dawkins' imaginary cultural equivalent of genes - a totally inadequate explanation of how people are socialized into accepting beliefs.)Darwin himself realised the difficulties when he wrote that: \\"...direct arguments against Christianity & theism produce hardly any effect on the public; & freedom of thought is best promoted by the gradual illumination of men's minds, which follow[s] from the advance of science.\\"But to understand why it is difficult to win people away from religious prejudices by direct argument, we need to look at what Darwin's contemporary, Karl Marx, had to say. Marx focussed on the social role of religion. He pointed out that it is used by the powerful to keep the masses under control. (\\"The Divine Right of Kings\\", for example.) But he also pointed out that it can inspire the downtrodden in their rebellions. For example, even we atheists must acknowledge that the Christianity of Martin Luther King was a very different thing from that of George W. Bush.Marx is also known for writing that religion is the \\"opium of the people\\". But the full quotation is: \\"Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people.\\"In other words, oppressed and alienated people who are prevented from living full lives often turn to religion as a comfort. It fulfills a need for them. It is therefore difficult to win them from their religious views by logical argument.Dawkins does not see that the best way to undermine religion is, as Marx said, to change society in order to remove people's need for religion. In a society without alienation, inequality, and oppression, religion would wither away. (And I don't mean the bureaucratic state capitalist tyranny of the so-called \\"communist\\" states.)To conclude, I have to say that, despite Dawkins' protestations, his opponents within the field of evolutionary biology - Richard Lewontin, Steven Rose, Niles Eldredge and the late Stephen Jay Gould - provide a much fuller account of evolution and of \\"human nature\\".Phil Webster.(England)"},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"The Selfish Gene is not a scientific work but an ideological work that precisely embeds capitalist ideology into biology as a new biologism.As science it's nonsense. The implicit teleology in the book (the goal is the replication of the gene, the organism merely the vehicle) would, in terms of the efficiency requirement in natural selection, create a situation where more complex organisms are inherently less efficient at the fundamental goal. So with that teleology there would be no increase in complexity through the natural selection Dawkins is at pains to protect as the driving force of evolution. in Dawkins' biologism, the more complex the organism, the less valuable.This is the same as the capitalist move from use-value to exchange-value as the goal. Rather than the goal being to produce useful products, the beginning of the process is money as capital, which is turned into products only in order to create more exchange-value, more capital. The capitalist fantasy of a \\"frictionless\\" economy, i.e. the creation and sale of products with no cost friction, is mirrored in the idea of a \\"frictionless\\" conversion from exchange-value (genes) to more exchange-value (genes) without the cost of an organism.This embedding of capitalist ideology into biology reduces the value of human beings and other complex organisms to nothing more than an unfortunate cost of exchange, which could ideally be done away with. As a result it also justifies the practical devaluing of human beings in a more fundamental way even than social darwinism. What's the issue with treating human beings as collateral damage in the quest for profit - they're nothing more than a vehicle for self-replicating molecules to achieve their goal of multiplying anyway."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"** THIS IS A VERY LONG REVIEW!***I've watched Richard Dawkins speak several times; at one such event, he was asked: \\"Which came first - the chicken or the egg?\\" and he dodged the issue: \\"The egg - if by that we mean the self replicating mechanism. - the chicken, the body, is the temporary receptacle of the information... that's the essence of modern neo-Darwinism.\\" Presumably, neither came first.It took me years to grasp Dawkins's starting-point. If, like Dawkins, you assume that replication came first, it's natural to adopt a Dawkins-style view. But, speaking as a multi-celled organism, I had assumed more or less unconsciously that proto-life may have come first, into which replication somehow intruded. So far as I can tell, none of this is yet decidable; most evidence must have gone long since, disappearing as food or fertiliser.Anyway ... Dawkins calls it 'neo-Darwinism', because the detail of genes in evolution was unknown to Darwin. (And one might add: Alfred Russel Wallace's priority is unknown to Dawkins).By the 1990s, automatic gene sequencing (based on DNA of course) by machine became easy, with the results all supposedly put online. Dawkins is not a practising scientist in that sense; and the observations of animals - for example, accounts of rather weird parasites and the behaviurs they cause in their victims, are mostly taken from other peoples' patient observations. His professorship was (is?) specifically in promoting public awareness of science, e.g. in 1991/2 Royal Institution lectures, and countless others His manner is very polite. He tends to say the right thing: he even said he was given 'a new respect' for the profession of TV filmmakers, after a 1985 TV programme on evolution.Dawkins lists many general influences, along with individual papers. Niko Tinbergen (1953, 'Social Behaviour in Animals'). W D Hamilton and G C Williams on 'social ethology'. R L Trivers (1970s books on 'reciprocal altruism', 'parental investment', 'parent offspring conflict', 'social insects'). V.C.Wynne-Edwards, e.g. 1962 popularised by Robert Ardrey in The Social Contract of 1970. John Maynard Smith on game theory (simple grids with simple outcomes of actions - which assume there's some common measurement of outcome). Later titles (postdating his first edition) include cultural transmission - as in 'memes'.One has to wonder how much of this is talked up, after the fashion of early popular writers on biology. For example, Dawkins quotes such things as the 'Utter selfishness of the Ik of Uganda', as described by Colin Turnbull, and the gentle altruism of Margaret Mead's Arapesh. He doesn't seem to know about Mead's exposure as a fraud - just one example suggesting he takes sources rather too much at face value.Dawkins writes well, in the sense of describing individual modules of the world; it's pulling things together in an overview that's problematical. I'll try to identify some of these serious problems....[1] MEANINGS OF WORDSAs many people have pointed out, there are problems with meanings. Let's look at 'evolution', 'selfish', 'gene' and 'altruism', and 'meme'.The peculiarity of biological evolution is that its mechanism is built into the organism itself. Organisms are so remote from unliving matter, that they only exist because of ancestors - they don't spontaneously generate. 'Evolution' is the change in the totality of life forms from one time period to the next. But this is NOT the same as the 'evolution of ideas' or 'evolution of language' or 'social evolution'. Of course the verbal issue has been with us since at least the 19th century.Assuming that genes generally operate at a low level - as surely most or all they have to, in order to code the fantastic complications of living things - most of the influences listed by Dawkins aren't anything do do with evolution or genes: he, or at least the reader, can hardly help confusing 'evolution' with things like 'social evolution', meaning change which in some way depends on what happened before. I don't think the issue is ever made clear.Dawkins points out many times that 'selfish gene' - 'thinking of the individual [gene] as though it had a conscious purpose .. is just a figure of speech. A body is really a machine blindly programmed by its selfish genes.' There can't be many authors who admit their book's title is misleading!Dawkins is careful to define a 'gene' 'as a unit of convenience, a length of chromosome with just sufficient copying-fidelity to serve as a viable unit of natural selection. This allows for whole chunks of chromosomes to be selected, which allows the meaning of 'gene' to be stretched out.Another issue is long-term changes in genes; since new alleles can form e.g. by mutation, it seems possible many genes are unstable in the long term. In fact, no genes from the origin of life can have persisted to the present day. This suggests genes may not be as permanent as Dawkins implies.On 'altruism' - here's a typical passage: 'Recently there has been a reaction against racialism and patriotism, and a tendency to substitute the whole human species..' and 'The muddle in human ethics over the level at which altruism is desirable - family, nation, race, species, or all living things..' Dawkins never makes it clear what 'altruism' is. Just a set of well-meaning phrases? Propaganda? The suggestion people should be nice to each other? Genuine action of some sort? The word is often used in a sense which is entirely hypocritical - trying to persuade people to have costs offloaded onto them, as in pop-star fronted begging. It is significant that Dawkins, following others, considers 'altruism', 'lies' and 'deceit' in various forms at a simple level, such as nesting birds, but not hypocrisy and lies at the serious, global, political level; this of course is part of the unmentionable material of 'correctness' which allows politicians and others to bemoan mass starvation etc without foind anything about it.Near the end of 'The Selfish Gene' is an elaborate account of 'memes', and this makes sense as a logical progression, since these having nothing physically to do with genes at all. I saw Susan Blackmore speak on memes, and was struck by her trivial examples - a bit of Beethoven's Fifth, a pop song, an ad jingle, a baseball cap worn backwards. In short, a 'meme' is usually something remembered, but not important enough to be worth considering as an 'idea'. The entire process of learning a 'meme' and interpreting it, relying on a lifetime's memory of language to internalise it, is complicated; it only seems simple because we're used to it. Dawkins's more complex examples of e.g. faith, fear of hell fire, and also injunction to never ask for evidence, may have 'deep psychological impact', but rely on lots of repetition at school or whatever. There's some suggestive matter on 'memes' jostling for survival, but that's it.[2] GENES WITH MAGICAL POWERSMuch of this book assumes there's a gene 'for' something - penis length is one example. I don't think Dawkins ever considers what limits can be expected from genes. There must for example be some sort of determinant of skeleton size and shape; but does every part of it have to be defined in detail? Would each finger and toenail need to be specified? Every blood cell? Surely not. His penis example sounds like a bit of sex put in to excite the punters.A good example is a supposed gene to spread 'altruism'. Altruism in any of the normal senses means assessing some situation, and weighing up all the likely consequences of an action on more than one person (or other life form). This is an elaborate intellectual exercise involving the entire perceptual and memory system; how can there possibly be a gene for it?Another example is survival. No organism in the world is descended from an ancestor that sampled death to see what it was like. How can fear of death be genetically determined? Such 'fear' certainly must exist - the human verbalised form isn't necessary - no doubt through avoidance of discomfort and so on; but at some point there must be some perception that something unpleasant to the organism may happen. How can there be a gene for that?Dawkins gets around this: 'it can be perfectly proper to speak of a 'gene forbehaviour so-and-so' even if we haven't the faintest idea of the ... causes leading from gene to behaviour.' But this is in a discussion on certain bees cleaning up larval cells in their hives, obviosuly a very stereotyped behaviour, nothing like something as abstarct as 'altruism'.[3] DETERMINISM AND INTELLIGENCE'A body is really a machine blindly programmed by its selfish genes' illustrates Dawkins in behaviouristic mode. It's true that animals (like children) are highly egocentric and don't think much about the past, the future, or the universe. But it seems perfectly possible that animal brains are a lot better than Dawkins thinks when he brushes e.g. dog behaviour which he thinks only mimics purposive activity, such as looking for food. Animals are handicapped in the sense of lacking efficient mouth/tongue/ear elaborations. But I'd guess even though mute, animal brains are efficient and active. Since nobody knows what the brain does, apart from clearly being at the centre of nerves and senses, the point is difficult to to argue. It seems realistic to argue that genes define a body's plan and send out in the world to do its best. I'm not sure animals such as dogs are as brainless as Dawkins assumes.[Even tiny animals - flies, spiders - sense danger and run away. How come? Do they think - I see a creature and know that if it contacts me with a large object I may be crushed and die; however by increasing the distance between us, the probability is reduced so I'm more likely to be safe? Can there be a gene which caters for all such situations?][4] SEXUAL REPRODUCTIONThroughout this book, Dawkins assumes organisms want to pass on as many genes as possible. And they should (e.g.) be indifferent between all their offspring. (It seems to follow that incest ought to be common). However all this seems based on a mistake.Why have sexual reproduction? One of its strong points, paradoxically, is precisely that half the genes of each parent are not used. Assume (this is all simplified) the probability of a gene mistake is say .00001. Then the probability of correct copying is .99999. An organism with 100 genes has probability .99999^100 of transcribing correctly. Fairly simple algebra indicates that longer genomes will show errors roughly in proportion to the number of genes. The must come a point where females only will have a significant probability of passing on defective genomes, not reproducing properly. There simple life forms (aphids? worms? bacteria?) where breeding rates are so fast and easy that dead-end lines don't matter. But if women in an asexual world duplicated themselves wrongly, mistakes would build up to the point where costs of defective children would be too great.If half the genes are thrown away, the result is something like regression to the mean. Parents with large numbers of genetic problems will cause many spontaneous abortions. It's also true that indusputably superior specimens will have little chance of having indisputably superior offspring. Sex supplies stability - essential for complex organisms - there's a sort of stabilising mediocrity. A descendant of (say) William the Conqueror may have none of his genes. This stabilising idea, where a small proportion of embryos are rejected as a quality control mechanism, is omitted by Dawkins. He claims parents should be indifferent between all offspring, even with lethal deformaties which parents presumably would wish to not reappear.There's some interesting material on why e.g. eggs should become 'large' and sperms small. And why there should be 50:50 males and females, attributed to R A Fisher - who however relied on the fact that modern creatures have 50:50 sperms from which it seems to follow. Does this prove there couldn't be a different arrangement?[5] GLORIFICATION OF EVOLUTIONThere are (at least) seven types of writers on biology. The rather dim Fred Hoyle types, who seem unable to understand that vast ranges of time and space are usually needed for evolution. (I recall someone telling me: \\"I don't see cats turning into dogs\\"). And the Fabre type, emphasising repetitious stupidity (e.g. caterpillars that follow a leader - around the rim of a plant pot - for days). And the types (e.g. Bergson, G B Shaw) who have a rather fantastic attitude to evolution, expecting incredible new things to 'emerge'. There are also those who emphasise the incredible wastefulness of the evolutionary process: evolution compared with building houses by trial and error of techniques, leaving the world littered with the remains of innumerable incomplete houses. And the D'Arcy Thompson types ('On Growth and Form') who, as with J B S Haldane, consider lengths, areas, volumes, air pressure, surface tension and so on as influences on organisms. And the encyclopaedist types - H G Wells's 'Outline of Life' was brilliant - Faust mythically sold his soul for reference volumes of this sort.Dawkins is influenced by all these types, but leans towards marvelling over the diversity of life, and the process of Darwinism, in my view unrealistically. He praises the 'miserly economy' and 'maximal efficiency' of 'survival machines'. A counter-view is that evolution is insanely wasteful, a series of bodges which just about work, but with numerous weak points.- We saw this in the chapter on aggression. Even thougha 'conspiracy of doves' would be better for \\u000eevery single individual&Auml;\\u000e&Auml; than theevolutionarily stable strategy, natural selection is bound to favour the ESS.[6] GENES WORKING TOGETHERDawkins's oarsman example seems very weak. He talks of a typical university boat. But suppose there were 10o,000 rowers - given colossal numbers of genes, replacing one by a better one surely can be expected to make almost no difference. I'd have thought somehting like a factory or city would be a better exmaple, but with almost no job replacement - if one of the workers did the wrong thing, the whole affair could crash.[7] COMPUTER ANALOGIESDawkins loves or loved his Mac (and incidentally believes viruses are simple to write, certainly a mistake). He seems to think the brain is similar to a computer generated display: 'The evolution of the capacity to simulate seems to have culminated in subjective consciousness. Why this should have happened is, to me, the most profound mystery facing modern biology. .. Perhaps consciousness arises when the brain's simulation of the world becomes so complete that it must include a model of itself.'This seems to be a mistake of the same type as in 1930s drawings of the brain showing vision as something projected on a screen. And/or an overestimate of the ease by which the brain is fooled. Surely, in practice, optical illusions are quite rare and need careful design to work. Dawkins hasn't heard the idea that belief in ghosts fell as electric lighting rose.[8] DISAPPOINTING OMISSIONSGiven an atmosphere of perhaps methane, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, with ammonia in the sea, and lightning, it's been known since the 1920s that a 'soup' could form - a dilute sea of organic molecules - carbon in almost unique in forming chains of almost any length. Dawkins puts emphasis on amino-acids and proteins, but metal ions, possibly dissolved from minerals by weak nitric/hydrochloric acid, and sulphate ions could be there too. If replicating chemcials appeared, the question is how the hell there could be some coded way for 'instructions' for life to develop from that. One might specualte that a molecule could attract a tiny shell or coating or arrangement of auquatic ions or other molecules, and maybe grow by absorption, and split at some point, carrying primitive instructions to repeat the process. I was disappointed that there's nothing on such possibilities, or indeed certainties.Dawkins says little on the evolution of insects: at first sight, eggs -> caterpillars -> pupae -> flying insects seems impossible to square with evolution; perhaps more difficult than the eye. There must have been intermediate stages, such as pupae able to move (as in dragonflies), and some predecessor stage to eggs. It's easy to see the advantage of the process - an early stage of eating low-value food, followed by a winged phase of looking about to deposit eggs. But it's less easy to see how it could have taken place. Just as with the chicken and egg.Another thing I missed was discussion on the very long term (though the 'ESS' = evolutionary stable strategy' incorporates this). Many books with a biological tinge have scenarios such as: one person having more children than another, and feeling they've won an evolutionary battle. Or people with lots of children, supported by social services, described as 'fit'. Or mass murders of specific types (for example, of intellectuals in the USSR) don't have any effects. It's easy to miss the extreme long-term consequences, especially of course with human beings, who tinker with the world more than any other species.----------------------Dawkins' 'Selfish Gene' without doubt tapped into some need for understanding of the world. But I don't think, in cool retrospect, its influence was very positive. Many Amazon reviews show people interpreting it as sociobiological praise for selfishness, or as showing that ethical beliefs are meaningless, or worrying over determinism. I remember a woman in a radio programme saying \\"some men aren't interested in a loving relationship, because they want an heir; I read about it in a book by Richard Dawkins\\". Maybe they misunderstood it, of course, but the misunderstanding is only possible because the messages are muddled.The book doesn't help much, even with topics which are explicitly discussed, such as 'fast women' and 'philanderers'. The undiscussed problems include killing, or getting killed, under military command; why people dying on the streets don't just desperately grab at money to survive; overpopulation problems; genetic defects. Nor are political group issues discussed much - tribal and other groups working in secret, propaganda and its meme effects, competitin over resources. The book does have the vitally important underpinning of evolution. But the detail of the book is questionable. Three stars?"},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"The thirtieth anniversary celebrations of Dawkins' best seller reminded me of my disappointed response to its original publication. I was then assembling a reading list for an ethology-oriented course on human nature in a liberal arts faculty. Konrad Lorenz' On Aggression was my over-view book of choice, but I was on the lookout for alternatives. Ed Wilson's Sociobiology had appeared the year previous, but it was unsuited to my course objectives. Then came the Selfish Gene, whose author I knew to be trained in ethology. Might the book thread a path through the bio-behavioral complexity of human behavior? Within minutes of opening it, I realized that far from serving my purpose, the book was a Great Simplifier peddling the worst stereotypes that my social science colleagues entertained about the bio-behavioral initiative. Some particulars. *Attitude. Good teaching requires that students be met where they are and led to the methods and substance to be studied. But here students encounter a gigantic misanthropic insult: they are \`lumbering' robotic slaves to their genes. It gets worse because genes obey the law of \`universal ruthless selfishness' so that \`altruism must be bad and selfishness good'. Oh dear! Haven't we heard this before? Yes, it's the gospel of nineteenth century Let-Them-Perish sociology, which mutated into this century's Compel-Them-to-Perish violence. This is the attitude of aggressive dogma hostile to critical thought. An ethologist should recognize this to be the posture of indoctrination, not of inquiry. *The author's bullying facilitates his substitution of potent symbolic language for fundamental principles of the life sciences. Thus, he confers on genes the status of \`replicators' that build the \`vehicles' (\`organisms', as biologists call them) that make up the web of life. This is at odds with what every biology text says. Organic \`replicators' are CELLS, not genes. The cell division that replicates a new organism (for sexually reproducing species) is MEIOSIS, which joins one strand of DNA of male and female sex cells into a new strand that then multiplies by MITOSIS to become the embryo and eventually the growing organism. This is elementary biology. It's incompatible with Dawkins' reductionist, gene-centric interpretation of life. Genes are not the drivers; they're components of the complex cell phenomenon. *The attribution of \`selfishness' endows genes with a mode of action familiar to common sense, but a light year's distance from what genes actually do. I once asked a molecular biologist his opinion of Dawkins' book. He chuckled and responded: \`He must be talking about British genes. All the genes we see [in Australia] cooperate.' Dawkins excuses his anthropomorphization by insisting that \`selfishness' is a metaphor. He wrote a violent diatribe against a philosopher (Mary Midgley) who criticized it at length. But at an evolution conference at Northwestern University, he declared, after being annoyed by questions about the metaphor: \`I say that it's a metaphor to defend myself; but I really mean that genes are selfish'. On hearing this, I thought that he had hung himself. Journalists were present, and surely they would grab this news line. I was wrong. The audience of about 250 Neo-Darwinians broke into warm applause at his embrace of deception in scientific communication! *'Selfishness' and \`replicator' are indispensable ingredients of Dawkins' popularization of genetics at the expense of reality. One reality puzzling to geneticists at the time he wrote was the phenomenon non-coding genes, also called \`junk DNA' and 'passenger DNA', which comprises about 95 percent of eukaryotic cells. Why don't the working genes, exercising their \`ruthless selfishness', eliminate the free riders? This fact deeply embarrasses geneticists, who tend to think that these genes have a function that hasn't yet been discovered, or that they are relics of once functional genes. Yet redundancy paradox is a door to a long list of paradoxes. In the human genome, for example, the Alu sequence is repeated 580,000 times and comprises twelve percent of the genome. Why? Nobody knows. Moreover, such sequences occur in the midst of functional genes and must be cut out by enzymes before the gene can express--a bizarre arrangement (a \`maladaptation' for an evolutionist). Then there's the \`C value paradox', meaning the absence of correlation between genome informational complexity and organismic complexity (salamander cells contain 40 times more DNA than human cells, and so on for eukaryotics). Next there's the presence of hundreds of inactive viral sequences in vertebrate genomes, the decisive importance of protein folding to physiological function (highlighted by prions, which are replicating PROTEINS), gene networks that coordinate many genes to effect an outcome, alternative protein expression (a single gene may code for many proteins), and the complexity of genes (introns, extrons, transposons, retrotransposons, mRNA, rRNA, and tRNA, etc). These facts and problems are a brief light on what molecular genetics is about. But Dawkins avoids them, assuring his readers that \`all genes look alike'. Yes, they do...if you don't look at them! *Dawkins' theme isn't life phenomena generally but a special subset, the mechanism(s) of evolution. For him it's all natural section: the struggle for existence that only the \`fitter' survive, as they do because of morphological or other variations that give them an advantage that their conspecifics don't have. This explanation was subjected to intense criticism from the moment of its launch by Wallace and Darwin. The criticism continues today. Here are a few items. In the years just before Dawkins published, Motoo Kimura's experiments showed that most variation is selectively neutral (\`neutral theory'). Neutral changes accumulate in genomes and constitute a non-selective \`genetic drift' of organisms. Another change mechanism is endosymbiosis, where prokaryotic organisms, such as bacteria, exchange genes (\`conjugation'). Another mechanism, parallel to endosymbiosis, is horizontal gene transfer between eukaroyts. These evolutionary mechanisms are hot topics today (made hotter by controversy about the consequences of genetic modification of crops), but they come after the Selfish Gene was published and were not incorporated in subsequent editions. Nor could they be because understanding them requires specialist knowledge of molecular biology that lies beyond popularization. The consequence is that Dawkins' Handy Andy explanations of evolution make little contact with the scientific literature. *Let me conclude by reverting to the dogma that we humans are \`lumbering robots'. At the end of his book Dawkins finds a redeeming way out: thanks to our cognitive capacity, we humans can rebel against the genes and overthrow their \`tyranny' by acting on choice, perhaps even moral choice. If so, why not say this at the beginning of the book, and eliminate the opening misanthropic insult? Perhaps because it has an indoctrination function. Indoctrination incorporates an initiation phase whose objective is to transform identities. The entry identity is despised and insulted (Marine recruits are called \`grunts') as part of the identity discard process that prepares the new identity, in this case, dedicated Dawkinsism. The old, despised identity is now associated with Others who reject the acquired identity. For Dawkinsites, the Other is those despised Creationists, against whom the charismatic master hurls an unending stream of bigoted insults. Disciplines who absorb his hatred can but admire his liberating doctrine. There you see that Dawkinsism is a polemical, sectarian abuse of evolutionary science."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"The Selfish Gene: 30th Anniversary Edition--with a new Introduction by the Author by Richard Dawkins is a book written by a author who wants to help the reader understand evolution and natural selection.

It is a masterpiece of choice illustration, finely honed definitions and pedantically nuanced distinctions, all framed by his engaging, pacey style. It has justly made him an iconic populariser. It is his best referenced and most tightly reasoned book.He starts with characteristic confidence: Darwinian evolution is as established as the earth's solar orbit. Blind prejudice or intellectual deficiency alone could misinterpret the data. The debate about his ingenious central thesis, the validity of a gene-focussed and gene-preserving explanation of altruism and other counter-intuitive behaviours, continues 31 years on.Strange then that as an exponent of hard-nosed empiricism, that his second chapter should take flight into the hyperspace of imaginative speculation. From p.12-14 see the brave professor leaping confidently into the realm of pre-biotic evolution. A world of hydrogen and methane, lashed with lightning, in which pre-biotic substrates accumulate to such excess they form a scum on the primordial soup. Serious doubts about the duration and degree of an intensely reducing atmosphere are voiced by geologists, but this is no deterrent to our bold champion. Watch the analytical chemists sucking their teeth and wincing as the author leaps further into the abyss, the bungee cord of tedious documentation and observation already looking dangerously frayed. Where are the pyrimidine nucleosides? (quite impossible to synthesize). What of the instability of cytosine? How can phosphate be preserved without precipitation? What on earth will enable bases, sugars (requiring quite different synthetic conditions) and phosphate to meet, and then miraculously and without enzymes to fuse correctly as even the most primitive proto DNA/RNA. The gaping abyss of data appears unending, yet Poppins-like, our professor seems to assure us, if we wish for it hard enough, however impossible - anything can happen. The difficulties have but just begun, what of chirality, what of the propensity of polymers to hydrolyse, how to survive intense ozone-less UV radiation? But lo! (p. 15) Our seer perceives a miracle - a virgin birth! * No, more amazing still, a virgin Replicator, unbegotten yet always begetting! Intrinsically unstable enough to have been formed initially, but stable enough to fill the whole earth with copies. Despite a studied vagueness here he suggests a primitive form of DNA (now his latest vogue is AATE). In p 18. our mysterious replicator wonderfully accumulates longevity, fecundity and copying fidelity. By p.19, wonder of wonders, it has metamorphosed into a \`simple' cell, with protein synthetic machinery, chiral purity, an intact membrane barrier, metabolic, transport, repair functions and most marvellous of all the ability to reproduce the whole. By p.20 the miracle transformation of \`goo' to you is complete.Here is narrative that makes the wildest encounters of the Enterprise or Galactica look as mundane as Carnaby Street by comparison. Here is drawn out, revivified spontaneous generation similar to the kind Pasteur definitively crushed in 1862, 3 years after the Origin was published. The imaginary link in chapter 2 is indispensable to the chain of Dawkin's whole thesis. But this is not science - it's wishful supposition. Here is a religious materialism that avoids the data, rather than re-examine its assumptions, however increasingly ridiculous they appear.*(Footnote to p.16. Dawkins' over forced distinction between two Hebrew terms is artificial, as 10 min reference to a concordance might have warned him. It suggests over-reliance on doubting colleagues, dubiously disguised as theologians. See the Hebrew of Joel 1.8.)"},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"In a book entitled \\"The Selfish Gene\\" purporting to prove the theory of blind genetic control over animal behavior, the first thing the reader expects is a discussion of genetic mechanisms and the biochemical interaction between said genes and behavior. To this point, I find it odd that only in the first chapter, and only over several paragraphs at that, does Dawkins discuss the A,C,G,T mainframe and protein synthesis.From what I can tell, Dawkins suffers from the basest of Philosophical mistakes - he uses a certain pre-supposition to advance a theory without ever PROVING the pre-supposition at hand. In this case, Dawkins argues that the Gene's desire to replicate is the answer behind evolution...unfortunately he fails to realize THIS IS WHAT HE MUST PROVE! Rather than laying out the direct scientific links between individual genes and their related behaviors, Dawkins speaks only of the later behaviors never once proving that Genes had anything to do with them.In a nut-shell, had this book been entitled \\"The Evolution of Behavior\\" I could have accepted it - unfortunately, as it stands, this book attempts to prove a Genetic theory it never once even considers.Don't be fooled - to prove the existence of a certain behavior and later attribute it to genetic coding is no different than to prove the existance of the same behavior and later attribute it to the will of God.

But who tried to get into situation-comedy and failed. After that he began to rely on a variety of people who wanted their signs read. He began to utilize his astrology so that he could remain somewhat liquid financially. Joel also loves tushes: the bigger the better. This review won't go into any details. Suffice it to say that Joel's oncoming baldness, his age, his loss of revenue all play into a summer in which he believes he can resurface in Provincetown, as some has beens have done and enjoyed a certain popularity. He is also looking for his Twin Flame, which his mentor Yris del Coro has predicted he would find. Joel hopes he would find it with the young Lucas Allison. Lucas agrees to join Joel in Provincetown but actually never spends time with him, instead looking for some action in the new Provincetown production of Shut Your von Trapp!.Describing the rest of the action would involve naming too many characters who are also manipulative, looking for sex, looking for popularity or looking to find someone to buy, rent or to mooch. The novel is like a comedy of manners in which there is a lot of running around, lots of disguises and lots of guile.Towards the end of the story, Joel experiences a magical thinking period. I think this undermines the story and relies on a certain kind of belief, and I don't mean the suspension of belief. One can do that to a certain extent.

Since a great many of the surviving pieces used the \\"overshot\\" weave structure, this book provides an exhaustive coverage of that weave, which remains a favorite for throws and blankets and such. Overshot patterns follow a simple block structure that makes them adaptable to a great many other weave structures. Atwater does not limit herself to overshot, and she covers other weave structures appropriate to two and four shaft looms. This book has been a favorite of weavers for decades. It deserves a place on bookshelves alongside the works of Marguerite Porter Davidson, Berta Frey, and Harriet Tidball. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Journal of a rabbi","review":"I was extremely pleased to be able to obtain this book, as it is difficult to obtain in New Zealand.

Although the images presented in the book are of good quality, The author seldom labels parts or pathology mentioned in the images. For example, \\"arrows\\" should always be used for each ultrasound image illustration that was discussed in the text. For someone just starting out or learning how to interpret sonographic images, this is a must. Bottom line: This book may be ideal for experienced sonologists or technologists, but it is not helpful for beginners.I also bought, Diagnostic Imaging: Ultrasound by Anil Ahuja, MD. This one is well organized with structured and detailed examples and explanations. Thus, if you are a beginner, I do not recommend Rumack's book. I recommend Anil Ahuja's book."},{"Title":"Diagnostic Ultrasound: 2-Volume Set","review":"did not receive the item, just an email stating that the order was cancelled and monies would be returned to my account as the item was incorrectly priced! unreliable! bet it wouldn't be that easy if i was the one that decided the book was too expensive after the sale had alreadt gone through..."},{"Title":"Diagnostic Ultrasound: 2-Volume Set","review":"I ordered these books online on May 21st and still have not recieved them (It is June 22nd).

Anyone who scans knows how much these clips add to the material presented in the text.Unfortunately,Elsevier has a silly system with a bookscratch code like a lottery ticket,multiple registration pages, all of which fail to permit access. Fill out all the forms then wait several days for a sales rep to call you!! For a book you've already purchased for $320USD???????Pretty sad! As a result- I would have to downgrade Rumacks 4th Ed to a 4 star item. This flaw does reflect directly upon the quality and usefulness of this edition,so long as easy access is blocked from the substantial educational material contained in the innaccesible video clips.

I finished it in less than 6 hours, it was so unputdownable. Although the end is bittersweet, it seems the main character, Aeriel, is destined to put her longings aside and attend to her duty, no matter the sacrifices. It also seems that Aeriel knows this, from the times she wished to take another path, but didn't, and the times she wanted the consequences to be different, but they weren't and she had to let go of everything (except her \\"Shadow\\") and follow her own path towards her own destiny, no matter how painful it may be.As stated above, the end is bittersweet, and I'm a person who likes happy, fairytale endings that in all probability would never happen in real life. I also had a problem with Sabr, she is so greedy, she wants Irrylath all to herself and can't let him love anyone else. I loved the part when Irrylath yelled at Sabr, saying that the reason he didn't believe that the apparation was Aeriel was because she told him it wasn't. It made me feel so good for Aeriel that her enemy (even though they were on the same side) was being yelled at by Irrylath. Go, Irrylath!This book is one of the best I've ever read, and it deserves to be read by everyone, young and old."},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"[...].I LOVED the ending.

However, like so many others, I want there to be another book with Aerial, Irrylath, Erin and I want Sabr to leave Irrylath alone! Please Let there be just one more"},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"'Tis true though, it would be nice to have at least one sequel to the trilogy. The first and second were the best, I think. However, I have to give this one credit, it wasn't like it bombed or anything, it just didn't live up to the other ones. Maybe Ms. Pierce had a reason for doing so. Perhaps the reason was not to make it not as well written as the others, but maybe it reflects some events that occurred in her life at the time of writing it. I don't know, I'm just guessing. I suppose there couldn't have been a much better plot or way of writing it than she already has, but please, Meredith, please make a sequel to the trilogy, or even more than one, another trilogy for all I care, just don't leave it at that. It was a peaceful ending, but not a fulfilled or happy one, I like those kind of endings, and so do (apparently) many other of your readers. In spite of the fact, I have to say that this book was still very well written, interesting, and though, not demonstrated in this one as much as the other two, still kept the pages turning. Her books are very well written. I mean, WOW, what an imagination she's got there mixed in with beautiful technique. I hope she writes some more.

SURPRISE! GASP! The story doesn't have a happy ending! I couldn't believe it. In the end, all the characters ended up being unhappy and I was too.(Am I the only one who thinks that the pearl of Ravenna is being a little selfish??) Anyway, I wanted to cry for them, but I was too shocked that such a great author would end a trilogy this way! That said, this book and all the other books in the series would have received 5 stars if it had not been for that ill conceived end. Note to prospective readers: If you plan on reading this trilogy, do so. You are in for a fantastic ride. Just beware, in the end, you may not be satisfied."},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"Yep, it was all the people that reviewed this book before me said, and maybe more. The only thing I absolutely hated was the ending. I'm sorry to say this to all you people who liked it, but I've been chicken about it long enough. I HATE the ending. (And for some reason I feel good FINALLY saying this.) It didn't give me a sense of hope at all, and I was rather startled. There were some characters I did not take a liking to at the beginning of the book that Pierce tried to make likable at the end, and it JUST DIDN't WORK. Call me a romantic phony, but Aeriel just didn't get all that she truly deserved and the author makes her cheerful? However, other that this, Pierce makes this book a wonderful work of art. It's even got a tad bit of science fiction, though it SF bores me...but Pierce manages to make is wonderful. A fresh approch to fantastical ideas...and if there were a sequel to it, I would grapple for it and probably bite the heads of the unfortunate folks who dared to interupt me in the reading. &lt;Sigh&gt; Go ahead, disagree with me about the &quot;hate the ending part.&quot; In fact, if you do, I will thank you. In my horror did I overlook a happy part? If I have, write a review and tell me about it--I'm suffering. There was (it began in the second book) a kind of gloominess laced with wonder and interest that got me getting a bit--wacky. At the ending of the trilogy, the lacey stuff that hold it up just enough for me to bear fall away and I nearly cried. If you plan to read this trilogy, read the first two and wait until the fourth come sout before you read the third and after that, go on to the last one. If not--then don't read that last. That is, if you are dumb like me. &lt;Sigh again&gt;"},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"The book was a page turner. Now, I read almost a book a day but when I got to the end of the book I was furious with the author. I have read many of her books and I would rate most of them 5 star but this book 1 star seems to much. If she was going to have such a bad ending it seemes to me that she should write a fourth book having a happy ending.

Ahem...I like most wanted a freaking happy ending...You know a fourth book would be cool...you know...Irrylth did say she would free Ariel from her enchantment...hey why not? His turn now! Come on!

There are twists and turns that even I couldn't see coming and it is wonderful seeing Aeriel come into her own. This story is about being greater than you thought you could be.

Not perfect, not too sad - just right."},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"The brilliant conclusion of the beautiful and amazing Darkangel Trilogy sees Aeriel finally facing the White Witch who enslaved her husband, Irrylath, who is massing an army. Aeriel must claim both her destiny (unraveling the Ravenna's mystery) and her husband's love or her entire world will end. Emotionally powerful as it is stunningly beautiful in its deceptively simple gothic and dream-like imagery, the conclusion to the Darkangel Trilogy is just as strong as its predecessors and cements this as one of the greatest series of the fantasy genre.

The ending was very depressing to me because it felt like the character just has to keep making sacrifices over and over again; she has a second of happiness and then is left feeling numb. Not to say that the exploration of Aerial's feeling and the details of her journey are not important, I just wished it ended a little differently because I am a romantic, optimist, and idealist. I also would have liked to know what Irrylath was thinking, and feeling the whole time. After thoroughly enjoying the books, I feel that it could have been even better if we could see, hear, feel what he was feeling. My curiosity to know has tempted me to try and create Irrylath's Point of view myself. I think he's a really great character and if Miss Pierce ever reads this, I would love to ask her to let us take a glimpse of Irrylath's mind."},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"The third book in the Darkangel trilogy is a bit of an improvement.

A book u just can't put down"},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"***This review contains spoilers***As the last installment of the \\"Darkangel\\" trilogy, \\"The Pearl of the Soul of the World\\" had a lot to live up to, as well as a lot to wrap up. In the first book \\"The Darkangel,\\" slave-girl Aerial saved the darkangel Irrylath from the misery of his own existence under the power of the White Witch and returned him to his mother's house. In \\"A Gathering of Gargoyles\\" she undertook another task, in searching for the lost lons to fight against the White Witch in the coming battle and in doing so discovered her own extraordinary heritage. Now the various countries of Aerial's world have gathered together in a great army to march against the witch, with her husband Irrylath at its head.But the story begins in the most unexpected way. As the story opens, we find a young woman in a cave deep underground, with no memory of who she is, mute, with a silver pin driven through her temple and a sinister feeling that someone is following her. Although the \\"amnesia\\" plot device may seem cliched to some, Pierce uses it brilliantly by instigating it right from the beginning, so that the girl's identity and the events that led up to her awakening in the cave are kept shrouded until the time is right (and as it turns out, her forgetfulness plays an important role in the narrative; it's not just a silly plot twist and it's *not* brought on by a bump on the head).Found by three duaroughs (beardless dwarfs basically), the young girl accompanies them through tunnels and caverns, all the time endangered by the presence of the witch's evil creatures. Eventually the girl finds a hidden passage to the ancient city of Crystalglass where the last of the Ancients - Ravenna - awaits reveal to her the truth of the White Witch and the world's history and to give her a final task: deliver a (literal!) pearl of wisdom into the Witch's own hand.The girl (as you've probably guessed) is indeed Aerial, and when she meets Ravenna her memories return to her. We learn what happened in the space between \\"A Gathering of Gargoyles\\" and the time she found herself in the underground caves, (including the gathering of Irrylath's army, the rebirth of Avarclon, the equine lon that died in the first book, and Aerial's newfound reputation as a powerful sorceress). Most importantly of all is the dynamics between herself, her devoted servant Erin, her detached husband Irrylath and his cousin Sabr. Pierce excellently and poignantly weaves the bonds that tie these people together; Aerial's hopeless love for Irrylath, his seeming indifference toward her, Erin's devotion to Aerial and her scorn for Irrylath, and Sabr's sneaky innuendoes to discredit Aerial and snatch Irrylath for herself. It's certainly a tangled web of intrigue!As well as these core characters Pierce also keeps good track of the rest of her (by this stage, rather large) cast of characters, all of whom have an interesting and vital part to play in the progression of the story. As such, we have reappearances from Talb, Syllva, Eoduin and the maidens, the Ma'a-mbai, the lons, Irrylath's brothers and Roshka. Only Roshka was a tad underused - as Aerial's newly-discovered brother I would have liked to have seen more of the bond between siblings. Pierce's gift is that none of her characters are strictly good or evil, and just as Aerial must cope with her jealously of Sabr and the pain she feels in regard to Irrylath; Sabr herself is not wholly bad, acting as she does out of love for Irrylath. And as for the White Witch...well, I don't want to give her story away, but let's just say she is given a name, a heritage and a heartbreaking motivation for the evils she does during the course of the story. Just as a darkangel was once redeemed, so too is there hope for the Witch...if she chooses to take it.Pierce creates a vivid portrayal of a world; which is hinted at being our own terraformed moon set far into the future. However, no fantasy fan should be put off by the vague allusions toward science-fiction (such as archaic machinery and burning \\"chariots\\" that transport the Ancients from planet to planet), as this trilogy is fantasy at its core. However, ideas that Pierce brings into the narrative, such as the reasons behind why the moon was terraformed in the first place and the ultimate fate of \`Oceanus', should resonant in the readers' minds as contemporary statements of our world's present condition.And then of course there's the ending, and as one can see browsing over the other reviews most were quite disappointed. However, in my opinion there was no other possible way for the story to finish. Pierce carefully laid out the elements of the story, and the conclusion makes sense given the facts that she had established. The ending thus takes on a tragic, inevitable and fateful air, reminiscent of all the best love stories. Though saddened, I could understand why things happened the way they did.BUT!For all those who were upset at the conclusion, hope remains. In an interview Meredith Ann Pierce had this to say:\\"Anybody who considers that a satisfying ending is nuts. Take heart! I intend to shift focus to Irrylath and show him as a very human character coming to grips with a life of duty, devoid of personal satisfaction or love. No longer overshadowed by Aerial, Irrylath must forgive himself for his crimes as a darkangel, regain his wings and discover the secret that will set both him and Aerial free. Aerial will learn the high personal cost of surrendering herself, however nobly, to Ravenna's planetary rescue plan.\\"\\"Here end for a time the adventures of Aerial. The adventures of Irrylath have only begun\\" - this was the line that Pierce wanted to end \\"The Pearl of the Soul of the World\\" with until her publishers vetoed the decision. Now that we have hope for Irrylath and Aerial, all we can do is wait impatiently. Until then, \\"The Darkangel\\" trilogy is a fantastic set of books."},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"I was very disturbed when I read the other on-line reviews. I think that this book is the culmination of the other two in the trilogy. If the ending were truly as bad as everyone seems to make it out to be, I think I would have been the first to notice. After all, I waited for years to discover the ending. I first read The Darkangel in third grade. Later after Pierce wrote the second book, I searched and searched for the book only to find it in a second hand store my freshman year of college. My college roommate was the one who searched for the third book, and she gave me the book for my college graduation. As you may guess, I had my own desires that Areil and her Prince would end up &quot;happily ever after.&quot; However, I was not disappointed. The whole series has focused on the theme of responsibility and sacrifice. In the first book, Ariel sacrifices herself first to serve her mistress and later to save the good and destroy the evil within the darkangel. In the second, Ariel sacrifices her time and energy in trying to to recover the gargoyles and restore them to their former selves. The third book shows Ariel once again sacrificing herself so that the world may be a better place. Ultimately, the message of this trilogy is very religious and inspring in a world overrun by selfishness. Further, I think Ms. Pierce is a woman of incredible talent. I am now a graduate student of literature and I can honestly say that reading Pierce's novels early in life instilled in me a love of the written word that has yet to be quenched."},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"I WAS NOT LOOKING FOR A FAIRY TALE ENDING. I really wasn't. I mean, I realized (very early on) that this story was not about romance. If it were, then Pierce would have focused a little more of her attention on Irrylath rather than only having him pop up every once in a while. That much was easy enough to decipher. What I WAS looking for, however, was less angst and for the heroine to at least stop getting the raw end of the deal time after time after time after TIME. So she had Erin in the end. Great! Okay! That's wonderful! But can someone please explain to me how much of a difference it made to have Erin go away with Aerial rather than having her take Irrylath? If her husband was such a distraction, then wouldn't her best friend have been too? I mean, one could argue that the love that she had for her husband was much different than that which she had for her friend; true enough, but love IS STILL LOVE. In my opinion, the love that she had for Erin was much more tangible than her infatuation with the prince...because she actually knew and spent time her. I understand what Mrs. Pierce was trying to accomplish here, I really do, but it just didn't work for me. It would have made a lot more sense to have Aerial leave by her self. I would have actually bought that and, quite honestly, would have been satisfied in the end. Having her leave one partner behind, only to be replaced by the other made absolutely no sense to me whatsoever. Sorry, but it didn't.This third book was a bit choppy, too. I had no idea what the hell was going on at the very beginning of it. It was pretty obvious that there were several years in between the publication of the second and third book. Seriously, it shows and in a major way. It seemed as though the author was just trying to finish things as quickly as possible. The pace, flow, and overall feel of this volume was just off. I don't know how else to explain it.I wanted (so very much) not the hate this series, but halfway through the last book, I knew exactly what was going to happen. I only finished it because I'd consumed the first two so quickly and had enjoyed them so thoroughly that it would have been pretty lame to stop in the middle of the last one ...So (begrudgingly so) I pushed myself to finish it.The only impression that this series gave me was that the heroine simply switched places with her husband, and was made to become the vassal of an old, hypocritical, selfish crone who was no better than the witch her self. My opinion has NOTHING to do with romance or lack there of.The heroine is majorly screwed from the time she left her mother's arms to the very the end of this series.Five stars for the first two books, minus two stars for the crappy ending.Way to finish off such a great series...how disappointing."},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"The series, as a whole, was one of the most mesmerizing pieces of literature for young adults today. It involved themes such as good vs. evil and the power of love. Once the Darkangel Trilogy is started, you can think of nothing else until it has been finished. You read and read, the suspense driving you further, until you reach the pinnacle...only to find it is the most depressing end to the most enchanting series. The despondence doesn't end there though. You will dwell on the ending, searching for every possible loophole to change it only to realize that a &quot;trilogy&quot; leaves no real space for an epilogue. All in all, any book that can provoke emotions as intense as one feels after reading &quot;The Pearl of the Soul of the World&quot; is well worth reading."},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"I really liked the first two books. Darkangel and A Gathering of Gargolyes. I particularly liked the second volume because Aerial displayed great character and courage. However, the last book, The Pearl of the Soul of the World did not live up to my expectations. Aerial lacked character, she didn't do anything extraordinary in this book. There was no adventure like the second volume. I was disappointed at the way the story ended. Aerial sacrificed herself throughout the story. Despite the finality of this triolgy, the story line is wonderful. Everyone who loves adventure and fantasy stories should consider reading this trilogy. The ending leaves me longing for more. Could Aerial take part in any other story that you're writing Ms. Pierce? I would love to see Aerial again, along with her trusted friend Erin. Thnak you for a wonderful journey."},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"I loved this series, it's was beautifully written, complex, and heartfelt. Until the end. Take my advice and and stop before reaching the end of the novel. It was an unsatisfying and disappointing conclusion to an otherwise amazing trilogy."},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"I'll start out by saying the Darkangel Trilogy is fantastic.The first two had me completely entranced, as did this third one. But the first time I read the ending to this book, I cried. I hated the book, the series, everything about it. It took my a while to get over it and finally about a year later, I started thinking rationally again. Maybe I over reacted and the ending, though sad, had it's point. So I went back and read it again. To my surprise, I had the same reaction, this second time as I did the first. I was completely unsatisfied.I'm a reader who does not need a faerie tale ending to everything, but there were so many other options for the end that would have made it better, if not 'happily ever after,' that I must say it is unexcusable. It was as if the author got bored and decided to wrap things up as quickly as possible rather than think it out. It's too bad there was such an ending to a remarkable series."},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"While I loved the first two books and waited forever for this last book, the ending absolutely ruined the book for me. Ms. Pierce seemed like she was trying to be &quot;deep&quot; with her ending, but it was baffling, completely unsatisfying, and very weak. She didn't have to write a 100% happy ending, but I expected some satisfaction &amp; fulfillment and received only frustration. Aeriel completely acted out-of-character: she worked so hard to free her Dark-angel and have his love, only to nonchalantly hand him over to his annoying cousin! Though I hated the ending, Ms. Pierce did create a remarkable and inventive universe with her first 2 books (the 2 stars are for her first two books)"},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"A little confusing, the book starts out with a Nameless Girl suffering from chronic pain that keeps her from remembering or even speaking. There aren't many clues as to the identity of the girl, so the revelation of just who this character is, is rather pleasing.In the third installment of the Darkangel Trilogy, the readers get to see the war between the Lorelei and the mortals played out. The moment we've been waiting for. The triumph will belong to whom? There's also a special little task that the lovable heroine must undergo that will determine the success or failure of the war for the mortals.Sometimes a little hard to follow, but still very worth it in the end, even though I wasn't too satisfied with the ending, I was still content with the ending."},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"This trilogy might be my new favorite trilogy since Lord of the Rings. The world Pierce creates is absolutely stunning and her heroine is uncharacteristically human, flawed and yet perfect, completely perfect and believable. It was wonderful watching Aeriel grow and become a young woman. It was equally hard to watch her sacrifice so much.The ending did cause me a lot of despair which was terrible and surprising since it takes a lot for books to truly move me these days.Towards then end when Irrylath and Aeriel reunite I felt that he was undeserved. Though, true to Aeriel's character she would never make him prove himself because she loves him none the less, I wanted to see him work for her. He is so mean, so unyielding to her that, to me, his character did not grow enough to deserve her in the end. And alas, he was not allowed to have her.The end is so bittersweet. The idea of the end is to close things up, not make you want/yearn for more. I don't think Irrylath was given the chance to truly grow and I think Aeriel, who struggled to make the world right and save the man she loved, was dealt a supreme injustice. It seems, with the ending, that she was punished instead of rewarded. I feel she has now the same fate Irrylath had in the beginning. It was hard for me because it seemed as though history was repeating itself. Ravenna did not give her much choice, what choice did she really have when the pearl dust was flowing through her veins and she would never rid herself of Ravenna? No, in the end it seems that Ravenna manipulated Aeriel. Ravenna took advantage of Aeriel's humanity and love for not just Irrylath but for the world he lived in.After everything she did to save the world, can no one, truly, save her? It's hard to believe it. All the extremes, the magic Aeriel went to you would think some of that might help her.Anyways, I gave it a 4 out of 5 because even though the end is unsatisfying the rest is delicious.I read the review by \\"Ravenna\\" and I hope that Pierce writes more... it's been what though? Twenty years since it was first published and I don't seen any sequels. It makes me sad."},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"Well i agree with most of the readers out there...like others i loved the DarkAngel and Gathering of Gargoyles...how i became upon them was weird i just picked it up off the shelf in the library and read im glad i did...they were the best books i have ever read but the ending of the third one disappointed me..i want a sequel to this book because i wanna know what happens...i loved her adventures...and i want more like other readers..."},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"The trilogy is \\"Darkangel\\", not \\"Aeriel\\" yet we get very little about either. Aeriel's past is a mystery, the Darkangels/icari are a mystery, the whole Ancient Ones story is a mystery, and at the end we're kind of left without many answers. Yes, we meet one of the Ancients and (SPOILER) we learn a bit of their past but not much. We know just a bit about the icari but not much and why the whole flying vampire bit in the first place? What about the many various races on the planet and their history? No depth there.This final book of the 3 starts out very poorly, wasting about 50 pages with Aeriel wandering around with a pin in her head. So? And I started to wonder if Erin was homosexual with her strange attraction to Aeriel.In addition, Aeriel always seems to have someone rescue her at just the right moment, with just the right person or thing popping in to pull her chestnuts out of the fire; it came across a little contrived and unlikely. It would have been better had she suffered some permanent injury after all the near-death experiences and her \\"magical\\" ability to find the right path, the right helpers, the right means of transportation, the right elixir, etc., so much so that all around her swear she's enchanted. That's how unrealistic it seems to even the very characters in the story, so how should it seem to the reader? There you are!As it turns out, the Darkangel plays a small role in the trilogy, and Aeriel and he have little to do with one another except in parts of the 1st book. Why the author named it Darkangel Trilogy makes little sense when it's all over.Despite these shortcomings, it's a fast and enjoyable read. Just think what it might have been had it been given more meat and the books been 400 pages instead of 300. Could have been quite a classic instead of just another \\"throw away\\" fantasy."},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"I loved this book. The only problem is that it dosen't seem complete. In the end Aerial finally wins Irrylath's heart but then she leaves him. It just seems that there should be a second trilogy to follow up on the story."},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"I loved the Darkangle series and the writing was really good. I loved the way everything was made up, even the sun and moon had a different name. The only thing I would change was the ending because it was really disappointing."},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"I LOVED THIS BOOK! It was sooooooo good. I was heart broken to find out that Aeriel didn't end up with the Darkangel. I actually signed on to see if Ms. Pierce has written any other books. I really want a fourth book to this trilogy. If you read this Ms. Pierce, START WRITEING! Hurry up! I highly recommend this book to anybody. From a romance fan to a Sci Fi fan. It was great all together! Get the book and start reading!"},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"All I have to say is that I love this series, but this is my least favorite of the 3. The first time I read it I actually screamed \\"How can she do this to Aeriel, how can she do this to ME!\\" I was with Aeriel all throughout her journey, through every struggle, every pain, every heartbreak...how is it that she could finally win for her world &amp; have that happen, IT'S NOT FAIR.But then again, that is life, right? Just because it is another world, another time, another person...life still is not fair.I may have read these books a millions times, I may be 26 years old now, instead of 12, but I am still very angry with Meredith Ann Pierce. I read the last book hoping that this time she'll get it right...sigh. Read it anyway or you will always wonder what happened."},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"Okay, first of all. I was going to rate this book only 4 starsbecause it had such a sad ending. It can't have happened. Whateverhappened to 'happily ever after'? I didn't like how Aeriel had to go away from her love. I almost cried. I just read another person's review, andI encourage her/im to do a fourth book on the series. There must be a happy ending. There MUST be! But, besides that, I say this book was really good. PS If I were Aeriel, I'd say,&quot;Heck with destiny. I want to stay with Irrylath.&quot; If you see this, Ms. Pierce, I hope you're happy, 'cause a lot of people aren't. Oooh... sometimes I'd like to hit you in the nose for that horribly sad ending. check out my other reviews on the other 2 books in the series. I'm outie."},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"ok, like i've read all the three books in the dark angel trilogy in three dayz and was ssooooooooooooo dissapointed with the ending of the last book...oh my god! i cried and cried and cried some more. when you think of it im crying over a book...im wasting my tears...im sending sorrow to my heart. i would have rated this book 5 star but i didnt cuz of the ending...the ending upset me so i would've just rated it a 1 star...i hope ms. pierce comes to her senses and realizes how unhappy the readers were at the end and makes a fourth book to the trilogy!"},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"...it this book were in any other series, I'd give it a 5. But as the ending to &quot;the Darkangel&quot;, it seems kinda lame. It's missing the fairytale-like magic that swirls around the 1st and 2nd books. Way too many words are spent on Aerial's thoughts. At the end of the book, there are pages and pages spent on Aerial's talk with Ravenna. That part was supposed to be Ravenna trying to convince Aerial that leaving is necessary, and yet it sounds more as if Pierce is trying to convince the readers that this is the best possible ending. Pierce takes up pages trying to justify her own writing ( which an author should never do ) and mops up the rest of the ending with unnecessary haste."},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"It always seemed as if Aeriel was being prepared for a much greater task than any previous one. Even though she does not get her heart's desire, she proves herself worthy of a far greater reward. She also wins the love of Irrylath, even though she does not get be with him, which is a victory in itself. The whole trilogy is a journey of love and its growth as Aeriel grows into womanhood."},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"Miss Pierce's first two books int his series were wonderfully written and I was really looking forward to the last book in the trilogy but I was some what disappointed in the last one. What you expected you didn't get so that was some what of a bummer. I was highy disappointed in the way things were reveled to Aeriel. All in all I liked the book but it wasn't the best of the three."},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"I read this book about six years ago when I was fourteen. I comprehended the book very well at a young age, and have treasured the book thus far. I find myself to be an avid reader but this by far is one of my most favorite books. The confidence that the young transient Aeriel illuminates thoughout the entire book, helped me during my teenage years. I have always remembered her character and the struggles in which she overcame to be the best that she could. This book is very special to me and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"aeriel awakens underground with no clue to who she is but a glowing pearl on a necklace. with the help of three duaroughs, she journeys across the desert to find Ravenna, for only she can say what the pearl holds. she discovers the truth of who the pearl belongs to, and that Irrylath had been under the lorelei's spell all these years since she made him mortal once again. this book was one of the best i have ever read. before reading this, though, you must read the preceding books, because if you dont, it becomes extremely confusing. they were all wonderful books, and i loved them."},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"It is rare to read a trilogy and have the last book be potent. The Pearl of the Soul of the World, besides being potent, it leaves you crying for a continuation. In the end, it is worth the money to own the set of The Darkangel Trilogy. Once you have experienced reading Ms. Pierce's books, your view of the world may never be the same when seen through The Pearl of the Soul of the World"},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"I expected so much more, I mean, after the first book The Darkangel, I just had to read the sequels. Thing is, I wish I never did start. Okay, so she gets married, it seemed as though nothing happened at all emotionally."},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"This book is probably the best of the three, but with the most disappointing ending. It's almost like Meredith Ann Pierce wanted to hurt Aeriel and Irrylath."},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"I can't believe it, I can't believe it. All those tough time I was finding the blasted ending of this triology, and I nearly blew it. Aeril work hard for what she has done and I said she should get what she deserves. I wish Meredith Pierce will write a book after this, but you always have to wonder what it will be about. I hate it when you author lets the end wonder like that.*sigh* But all I can said is, YOU ARE GREAT!Keep up the good works.*sigh again*"},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"I was very disturbed when I read the other on-line reviews. I think that this book is the culmination of the other two in the trilogy. If the ending were truly as bad as everyone seems to make it out to be, I think I would have been the first to notice. After all, I waited for years to discover the ending. I first read The Darkangel in third grade. Later after Pierce wrote the second book, I searched and searched for the book only to find it in a second hand store my freshman year of college. My college roommate was the one who searched for the third book, and she gave me the book for my college graduation. As you may guess, I had my own desires that Areil and her Prince would end up &quot;happily ever after.&quot; However, I was not disappointed. The whole series has focused on the theme of responsibility and sacrifice. In the first book, Ariel sacrifices herself first to serve her mistress and later to save the good and destroy the evil within the darkangel. In the second, Ariel sacrifices her time and energy in trying to to recover the gargoyles and restore them to their former selves. The third book shows Ariel once again sacrificing herself so that the world may be a better place. Ultimately, the message of this trilogy is very religious and inspring in a world overrun by selfishness. Further, I think Ms. Pierce is a woman of incredible talent. I am now a graduate student of literature and I can honestly say that reading Pierce's novels early in life instilled in me a love of the written word that has yet to be quenched."},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"I found this series by first having read Ms. Pierce's Firebringer Trilogy. Like Firebringer, I was engrossed by the utterly enchanting storyline, and was quickly lost in the realm of the Moon of the future. But the ending left me upset, confused, and oddly hurt. I like a good tragedy as well as the next aspirering writer, but to bring such a beautifully woven plot to such a final and crushing conclusion is neither fair to the reader, nor the story itself. If only Ms. Pierce could have better explained the resolution, I wouldn't have balked so completely at the ending. However, she does leave an opening for fourth book, and if she cares to revisit the Moon of our far-flug future, I will gleefully snap that book up too. I highly recommend this book, if for no other reason than Ms. Pierce's singular writing style, and frankly to find out how it all ends. Still the ending leaves much to be desired, and only rates 3 stars."},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"I thought this was one of the best book I have ever read. I can't believe the author ended the book like that, I wish it had a happy ending, but then nothing could be help I guess. I sorta agree with Aierl on what she had to said to her husdband, &quot;We had two whole years and all we did was wasted it...&quot; Oh well, I suggest people read this book. Hopefully, the author will have another book after this one."},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"This was an okay book, but I didn't like it as much as the first. The ending is just so hopeless. I know some people will disagree with me but that's the way it feels."},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"I read this series in the 7th grade and I only found Pearl last year in the children's section of my local library. Her writing has crafted such a intriging universe it is postively compelling. her inspiration for the series from a dream in a jungian dream analysis makes it even more interesting. If you haven't read the first two I highly recommend picking them up."},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"I first read the Darkangel Trilogy when I was in 6th grade. I have spent the past 7 years trying to find the set. The Pearl of the Soul of the World has always been my favorite one, and also the hardest to find.

I can't wait to get it!"},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"After searching for _The Pearl_ for almost a year, I nearly cried when I read it.

Aeriel is a woman to be admired - - a true heroine."},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"Well, what can I say? This has been my favorite book for almost six years and though I have not reread it since I was 11 ( I moved to Taiwan when I was 12, and english fantasy novels are verly rare here. ) I have never forgotten it.

I found myself honestly caring about Aeriel, Irrylath the Darkangel, the gargoyles and even the wraiths. In \\"A Gathering of Gargolyes\\" I delighted in the knowledge that Aeriel wasn't just a lowly slave, and found myself honestly hoping Aeriel and Irrylath would find a way to work it all out. Then, in \\"The Pearl of the Soul of the World,\\" I felt it all building toward what I hoped would be a satisfying conclusion. Nope. I'm crestfallen and saddened. A beautiful series... but I think I should have stopped reading at the end of Chapter 14 (\\"Flood\\"). If M.A. Pierce was trying to impart a message (i.e. \\"We have to sacrifice for the greater good\\") she could have saved the trouble. Why not have a lon shuttle Aeriel to Avaric daily? Conjugal visits complete with saving the world. Disappointing ending to a lovely trilogy."},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"I loved the DarkAngel Trilogy by Meredith Ann Pierce. She is an exceptional writer who can capture the reader's attention and leave them spellbound. Its hard to create a fictional world with so many unnatural creatures and settings in it; so obviously different from our own, but Pierce pulls it off beautifully.Like many readers, I was upset at first over how she ended Pearl. I wanted to know what happened to the drought inflicted Moon, how the different kingdoms fared and MOST importantly I wanted Ariel and Irrylath to live happily ever after and have LOTS of children! But after thinking about it (and rereading the trilogy a couple more times) I decided that I liked how Pierce ended her third book. It would almost not be enough to end the series, you can't end it. Meredith Ann Pierce wrote her final chapter in a way that left enough room for the reader to fantasize in his/her own mind about what they think might have happened, and I think that in itself is the best ending she could have ever come up with."},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"I LOVED this book!!! It was sooooo good, except the ending. The ending left me wanting more, no needing more. It leaves the reader kinda hanging there wondering what's going to happen next.

It was still good."},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"The Darkangel Trilogy is without a doubt my favourite book series of all time. The writing style, the characters and the plot ensnared me completely and lodged themselves in my mind.This, the final novel in the trilogy was just as wonderfully crafted as the two that proceded it and yet the ending left me feeling rather unsatisfied.It seems such a shame to me that after all she went through Aeriel is not allowed to have fully completed her task and to rest. Also I believe the issue of wether or not Irrylath truly loved her is not fully wrapped up...."},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"I read all three volumes. Each one was very informative and very detailed. When I read a book, it is seldom that I'll reread it. But, I reread this one.

I wish this book was a requirment for school, because if you enjoy fantasy, this book would appeal to you"},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"The ending to the spellbinding and eautifully spun Darkangel trilogy, the end left me begging for more. There were so many things that could have happened, and so many ideas that such a blunt finish sparks. It leaves me begging for more. Aeriel completes her mission, but, as Ravenna said, loses what was most precious to her. The irony of the story was so moving; I loved and hated this last book at the same time. Why? It was an ending written so wonderfully and sadly. In my opinion, I know Aeriel must stick to her decision, but... Oh! If you want a happy ending, go somewhere else. But, it's truly a beautiful and heartbreaking end to such a masterpeice by the wonderfully talented Ms. Peirce. Is it really the end of such a wonderful tale?

I like the happy fairy-tale, disney style ending, happily ever after but a slight bit more realistic. if the culmination of ... and two hours of time is depressing, why read it? of course that might not bother some people. if they are you, you will like this book. i loved the writing style and the characters, their complexity, their three-dimensionality. otherwise, i would give it five stars, as well as the second book in the series.

The ending was triumphant and glorious but not in the sense for the main characters, Aeriel and Irrylath.I wish there could be a way to gather them, but the destruction of the world was a too big problem to be postponed. I was reminded of Spiderman's phrase : With great power comes great responsibility. While Spiderman get his chance to be able being close with MJ, while Aeriel was not, given only a few hours with her prince, and the next, Ravenna's task made her to part with him, for good. Not the ending I was expecting.

Whee!"},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"I loved this book and all the other books in this trilogy. I first read this book and the other two in the trilogy when I was in seventh-grade and I adored it. Now over five years later, I reread it and I still love it. My problem with the book is that the ending left me unsatisfied. It was a very powerful ending but like all the other people out there I was hoping for a happy ending. I was upset when there was not one, but I think that a sequel for this book could be easily written furthering Aerial's adventures. She has a lot of work ahead of her and I wouldn't mind reading more of what happens to her. I believe that after all she went through she deserves to be happy. Ms. Pierce I really hope that you write a sequel to this trilogy."},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"Well, here's to those of you who absolutely HATED the ending... I liked it. Yes, it was terribly sad, but THAT, everyone, was the element of realism that Ms. Pierce decided to insert into it. I really don't like those little fairy tales where everything is all sappy, happy, and hunky dory in the end. Real life isn't like that. It can really be tragic at times, such as is the case here. And, I definitely agree with whomever it was who said that Aeriel was showing her lack of selfishness in the end. I think every single one of us could learn a lesson from Aeriel. Life isn't about getting what you want. In fact, consider yourselves lucky when you DO get what you want. Aeriel proved her self when she gave up &quot;self&quot; for the good of all, and I absolutely loved the theme of &quot;sacrifice for the greater good&quot;--a wonderful phrase to live by."},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"Surprising and disturbing were my feelings towards the ending of this wonderful trilogy. After searching for and now finding this book nearly 12 years later, I can honestly say, why oh why didn't I leave off at the end of the second part of the series (at least there was hope for a more happier ending and not the finality of destiny for Aeriel's future). But putting aside my romantic pentions, the writing of Ms. Pierce as always brought me back to an enchanting world of Darkangels and princesses. Thanks, Meredith Ann!"},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"A surprise ending climaxes a battle where all of the characters from \\"The Darkangel\\" and \\"A Gathering of Gargoyles\\" are brought together and rewarded or thumped, according to their allegiance or past misdeeds. As in her two previous chronicles of a terraformed Moon, Meredith Ann Pierce continues the story of her heroine, Aeriel with clarity and imagination. \`Pearl' contains a bit more future science than its predecessors, but not enough to disturb those who prefer their fantasies undiluted.Aerial, fourteenth bride of the redeemed darkangel, Irrylath (they literally exchanged hearts in volume I) continues her quest to save the dying Moon. All of her world's wisdom and magic (read \`advanced science') reside within the luminous heart of a pearl (read \`very powerful computer'). First though, Aerial must remember who she is and what she is trying to save. We learn through flashbacks that a minion of the evil White Witch inserted a silver pin into Aerial's head, and caused her to lose all knowledge of herself.Normally, I don't care for the \`amnesia' plot device, but it works well in \`Pearl.' The dedicated reader will know who Aerial is, even though the book begins:\\"She had no idea where she was---only that she was in a cave, the walls pressing close about her, all of white stone. Light came from somewhere, dim and diffuse, and the air was old: musty and bone-dry...She gazed at the featureless walls of the cave. She had been lost for a long time.\\"Aerial stumbles across a trio of unlikely allies while lost in the caverns of the Moon. The duaroughs (dwarves), after many adventures in the caves, help Aerial find the ancient Ravenna---one of the original humans who terraformed the Moon. Ravenna heals Aerial from the effects of the silver pin, but at a very high cost. Aerial regains her memory and her resolve to defeat the White Witch, but doesn't learn the price of Ravenna's healing until book's end.\`Pearl' enriches and deepens the entire darkangel trilogy. It is well worth reading, even though some of its more romantic readers may shed a few tears as it ends."},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"I read the whole sequel and the plot took my breath away.I belive it's changed my life in many ways.Ms.Pierce knows her stuff.The book was in enchanting.I honestly thought the ending was heartbreaking and just goes to show you that life must go on .Also,that love means loss and you must be willing to let go.I am literally praying that there will be a fourth book .I cried for three days for three different reasons,joy ,anger, and especially sorrow. I got my whole grade to read it (the hardest job I've ever done,they thought it was a stupied chic story)but, they all agreed that it was just sssssssoooooooooo beautiful.They all said they would pay up to thirty bucks for the fourth sequel. I have even decided (after 5 yrs. of thought) to become an author and write the fourth sequel (NO JOKE).I have even gotten a pubilsher to help .So I'm hoping Ms.Pierce will beat me too it.The is the best story ever made and I would recommend this to any teen ,child,and adult with the will to look deep inside themselves for the hidden emotions brought out by this book."},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"When I read the first book in this series, I was very young. I, like Aeriel, was swept up in the romantic fantasy of the darkangel, the beautiful and tormented young man whom only I could heal with my sacrifice.But life isn't that simple, and the second book began to show that. Irrylath's past could not be wiped away with a single act of kindness. He and Aeriel were married in name only - he never trusted or understood her. Just as when he had been a darkangel, he desired her and feared her in equal measure. His past haunted him; he remained violent and unpredictable, a danger to himself and others.Throughout the entire series, Aeriel has needed to grow and mature, to realise her own power and responsibility, to turn away from self-destructive impulses. Irrylath, as well, has a long journey still ahead of him.(ending spoilers follow)In an era where we have too many Twilights, too many romantic stories urging young women to stay with abusive and controlling partners because of their dark brooding sexiness, I applaud MAP for putting forth a story which is not willing to wrap it all up with a false happy ending. Irrylath and Aeriel cannot have a happily ever after - not now, and maybe not ever. They do love each other, and they get their brief moment of sweetness, but then they part, leaving behind adolescent fantasies for adult responsibilities.... also, there is far, far too little f/f, even as subtext, in fantasy and science fiction that I've found. Forgive me if I'm thrilled to my toetips at the quiet possibility of Aeriel ending up with someone who loves her freely."},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"Book 3 certainly reaches a dramatic conclusion. As for me? I will admit that at a certain point I threw the book across the room. Once again, you must read these books in succession. You will be completely lost if you haven't read the first two novels.Aeriel has lost her memory and ability to speak. She ends up being helped by duarroughs, who live under the earth. Then she travels to the city of Crystalglass. She meets an ancient being named Ravenna who created the world. She helps Rachel regain her memories, but Rachel must fulfill her destiny as well in destroying the White Witch, and her responsibility to the world afterwards.I was so disappointed with the ending. You get a glimmer of a happy ending that's dashed and in the end, not a satisfying conclusion. You just ask yourself why? They are powerful beings and should be able to do what they want. Shouldn't love be a good thing? They worked so hard to get there.So, the ending aside I thought overall the series was pretty stellar, but I just forewarn you to be very prepared for an irritating ending."},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"The Darkangel trilogy is truly one of the best YA fantasies out there. This book strays into more typical genre territory with the appearance of Ravenna, the Ancient sorceress who tells Aeriel all the secrets of their world and sends her to confront the villainess in her stead. I must admit that much as I love the series, when I first read this book I was initially a little disappointed to find the story opening up with an amnesia plot device. It seemed a bit trite, inserted just to stretch out the story. I was not pleased to have the heroine separated from her love interest for the entire book since it seemed at the end of Book 2 that they would work together.Pierce makes it all work, though, because Aeriel's amnesia allows for some interesting backstory to come through later and brings her to Ravenna. I loved the subtle parallels Pierce draws between Aeriel and the Witch, the struggles Aeriel must face at the end and the decisions she makes that ensure she will not in fact become like the Witch herself. The final confrontation with the Witch was possibly the most exciting, well written villain confrontation I've ever read in fantasy.What kept me reading these books was the uniqueness of the world, their emotional power, the terrific characters, and the promise of a developing love between Aeriel and Irrylath. I wanted it to work so badly, and it seemed as if Irrylath was finally starting to come around. Then the ending happened.It's absolutely shattering. I went through the entire series in my brain trying to find a way out, some point in time when the ending might have been altered. It is hands down the most devastating ending to any book I have ever read. I'll admit it: Erin never sat right with me. I don't entirely hate her, but I don't like her, and I felt that Pierce wanted me to. She's too needy, strangely attached to Aeriel (someone mentioned a homosexual subtext--you know, it did cross my mind), surprisingly bitter and jealous over Aeriel's love for Irrylath to the point where they outright hate each other.I'm not sure why Irrylath hates her, unless it's for the same reason I do: symbolically, she's Aeriel's shadow, her opposite. Was it the author's intention to endear Aeriel to her readers but make us uncomfortable with Erin's subtle intrusion? I don't know. For me at least it was small consolation that Aeriel could take Erin with her but not Irrylath.With all that out of the way: for all of you who hated the ending like I did, there is hope!Intrigued by R.M. Fisher's review and her quotation of Meredith Ann Pierce, I ran numerous internet searches and discovered a reference to a really old interview. I'm not sure if this is the same interview she found because the wording is different, but it's only one of 2 interviews that I could find (the other being a more recent interview at the Sequential Tart). Here is the bibliographic info:The Mage [#12, Fall 1989] ed. Richard Davis (Colgate University, $2.50, 62pp, large)And from the Locus Index of science fiction:THE MAGE (Colgate University, Hamilton, NY 13346): an interview with fantasy writer Meredith Ann Pierce.Fantasy writer Jeff VanderMeer interviews Meredith Ann Pierce for The Mage, a fantasy magazine published by Colgate University. It was issue # 12 and the article is dated to 1989. I couldn't find it anywhere, neither could I find The Mage magazine, so I have no idea if the magazine is still being published. I emailed Locus' archives asking after it and was kindly sent an attachment via email of the entire article. My most sincere thanks go to the Locus Index for sending me a scan of this article. Here is a direct quote from the article about the possibility of sequels (bear with me, it's quite long and I want to give you guys the full experience):\\"Jeff VanderMeer: Have you set any other pieces in the Darkangel world?MAP: No.JV: Do you plan to?MAP: I'd like to write a second trilogy which has to do with Irrylath, the male protagonist--of whom we really don't see much in the Darkangel trilogy. It's funny. The Darkangel trilogy is not really about the darkangel--it's about Aeriel, the heroine. The hero is either under a spell, in the first book, or in the second two books, out of his mind with all this guilt and angst and military problems. He doesn't really get much of a chance to come forward as much of anything but a wild-eyed madman. I would like to have a trilogy following the Darkangel trilogy which will deal with Irrylath because at the end of The Pearl...there is room for further adventures of Irrylath. Aeriel is pretty much all tied up pretty neatly, but Irrylath is still around and mobile and able to engage in heroic activities--and he needs to engage in some heroic activities because I've set myself such a tough task.My hero is a mass murderer....So, I've set myself a hero who is not wholly admirable and I'm working real hard [to change that]...I think it would be a great disservice to have Irrylath suddenly metamorphose into this nice person with his past, because you can't get away from your past.\\"What we have learned from this article: Meredith Ann Pierce expressed interest in writing a second trilogy about Irrylath redeeming himself, meaning the story can and should continue since it clearly did in the author's mind. There is however no mention of whether or not he will win Aeriel back as R.M. Fisher suggested (most troubling: \\"Aeriel is pretty much all tied up pretty neatly\\") and this article is from the 80's. Pierce was much younger then, the trilogy was new and alive in her mind. We don't know if she still plans to write it 20 years after the fact--or indeed if she has been writing it for the past several years. The reprints of this trilogy (Pearl: 2008) is promising, though the cynic in me says it was the Twilight craze that brought it on, not a possible sequel in the near future. The author is a recluse who won't offer any contact information to anyone, so this is all we have to go on for now.I hope people read this long review and actually see the part about the interview. If you would like to talk about this further, or see the article yourself, I'll be happy to email you the scan I received. I'm not posting it online because I'm not sure if I'm allowed to do that. If this information matters to you in any way and you too wanted a happy ending, please comment on my review! I'm interested in seeing what you think.We are free to imagine a happy ending, guys, it seems Pierce herself wanted it so."},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"I waited a long time for this book, and was certainly not disappointed.

I've gotten my siblings to read it, and they love it!"},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"This was a great book, it had me breathless from the start. But at the end I was disappointed. To make it so irrevocably and unbelievably hopeless is just awful. The book nonetheless was beautiful and touching. Ms. Pierce knows her stuff and I am sure she had her reasons for ending the story the way she did. And if you stop and think, how else could the book have ended? The whole atomosphere of the book was basically unhappy and readers should have been prepared for this ending."},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"This story truly teaches us of sacrifice, and duty. The ending is heartbraking, and heart-lifting at the same time. This conclusion to the darkangel trilogy is dramatic and climatic. I could not put it down. I strongly suggest that you read this book, even if the first two did not catch your eye."},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"This book was wonderfully written and was exactly the excellence that I expected after reading the first two books. I liked that Ariel was destined to do great things but the sense of loss that Areil felt was depressing. I felt like it had happened to me and I loved that but at the same time it made me really sad. I think it could have ended more happily but it might not have left the same impression on me if it had. I recomend this book to anyone who enjoys fantasy, adventue, romance, and suspense."},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"I loved this book so much that I cannot express it. I don't understand how everyone can say that it was the weaker of the three, beacause for me, this was the one book that showed the tragic love that took place between Aeriel and Irrylath. The ending not only left me without words and very short of tears, but it also left me with a deep feeling of loss, like I had lost Irrylath's love as well. Well done and brilliant. I recommend it to anyone who has read the first two books. I too was thinking of not reading it after the 2nd book, which was a dissapointment, but I am soo glad that I did. A masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"This story was in many ways an anti-climax to the previous two, however, I don't feel anything lacking in the trilogy, even in this book. It couldn't have ended any other way, or it would have dimmed the love Aeriel and Irrylath had for one another. Ms. Pierce captured the most poignant kind of love, the dark-edged, deep kind that a person can barely admit to oneself. Poetic, flowing, tragic, painfully lovely, a tale of the immortal quality of love between a man and a woman."},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"I, for one, am glad the author chose not to end this wonderful trilogy with the standard, sappy, happy ending. This ending stays with me much more than the alternative would have. Although Darkangel was prabably the best, all three are fantastic. The final battle kept me turning pages, and the identity of the White Witch was a surprise. All three books have superb imagery and are excellent reads."},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"This is the final book in the Darkangel trilogy by Meredith Ann Pierce. It was written in much the same style of the previous two books. I found the ending very disappointing though and didn't think this book did a very good job wrapping up the series.Aeriel has found all of the Guardians and is on her way to decipher the rest of the prophecy. Will her and her friends be able to defeat the water witch? In this book we finally meet the Ravenna and Aeriel finally faces the water witch.This book was much like the previous two in tone. Pacing is again inconsistent with periods of action and then long periods of waiting. The writing is still beautiful and the premise continues to be very creative. The characters are only somewhat engaging and I didn't find any of them to be all that likable. You definitely need to read the first two books of this series to understand what is going on in this book.I was very disappointing in the ending of this book. If you read the Publishers Weekly description on Amazon.com you will know what I mean. Aeriel is only briefly reunited with her husband before she has to go off to save the rest of the world. So, basically although the water witch is defeated, the book ends with the whole world still perched on the edge of destruction. Despite Aeriel's initial upset at having to leave her husband and her husband's initial comments about how sad he is; her husband has nothing to say about it in the last few pages of the book. It was like suddenly her husband fell out of the book and didn't have anymore say in the rest of the story.Overall the writing style is much like previous books and it is a creative book. If you read the first two books you will have to read this one. I found the ending to be extremely unsatisfying and disappointing and not in keeping with the characters previous decisions."},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"The final installment to this beautifully written dark trilogy. Uplifting, sad, challenging and just plainly a wonderful adventure.

However, it definitely leaves a possible opening for another series."},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"The last book in the darkangel trilogy is regrettably short but does a great job of tying together all of the lose ends of the series.

You will be surprised, and a little shocked, to learn all of what happens in this book.I loved this book as a kid and was surprised to discover that it translates very well as an adult fantasy novel.

Phoey!!!"},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"I would have listed this at 1 star, but I am still fond of her writing style, even if this particular book lacked the sparkle of the first two.The conclusion was woefully unsatisfying, but not because it's sad, because it doesn't actually bring everything together. It feels rushed and there's a heavy-handed \\"be kind to the earth\\" motif that wasn't there in the first two books and the amazing mythology she'd created is tossed aside for a jumble.I do like surprises and twists in books, but not these kinds of twists."},{"Title":"The Pearl of the Soul of the World (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"After reading Pierce's first two books I was enthralled beyond beliefe. It was disapointing how long it took for her to write the third book, but then reading how she ended this wonderfully written story I was sad and angry.I would be definately sugest reading the first 2 books, but unless you like horrible endings I would not suggest reading the third book.

I know that perhaps the lesson to be learned is that we all must make great sacrifices in our lives. But that is for the real world in which we must live everyday. In those precious moments that we find a story that enraptures us and takes us away from reality, we need a happy ending, it makes facing our plain daily lives a little easier.

Poor man had a miserable love life and some of his works show it (e.g. Manfred)."},{"Title":"The Selected Poetry of Lord Byron","review":"I'll start off by saying that this is an excellent selection of Byron's poems, from my view, so the rating applies only to Byron's merits as a poet.Byron is somebody who was ALMOST a great poet. He has some really good poems, some poems of true greatness, comparable to his superiors (Keats, Wordsworth, Blake, to limit myself to the Romantics), but he wrote a lot of crap too. Some of these poems are almost laughably bad, others are profound.I didn't always think this. Back in high school, Lord Byron was by far my favourite poet. In fact, he was the first poet I ever liked, which speaks to his enchanting power over those who have yet been introduced to many poets. As time went on, and I began to read his better contemporaries (mentioned above) and poets of other eras who tower over him, his spell began to wane, and I began to view him as I view him now: as a poet who might have been great, but never quite got there.Nonetheless, I recommend him, as he does have poems of value, and is good for studying the time period. Read him before you read the other Romantics (except Shelley, of whom I have never been that big a fan, though I admit I have yet to really read into him); reading him after becoming familiar with them will spoil your love for him! After you have read him, if you find him to your taste, read some Keats or Wordsworth for comparison. If you don't find him to your taste, read Keats or Wordsworth anyways. You will find in either case that there is an extra spark of magic in these latter two that is not present in Lord Byron."},{"Title":"Principles and Practice of Structural Equation Modeling","review":"Rex Kline easy writing style will take you through step-by-step in one of the most comprehesive yet accessible introductions to multivariate analysis and structural equation modeling.

Galbraith has contributed the term &quot;conventional wisdom&quot; to the world of economics."},{"Title":"The Affluent Society","review":"I just finished this book less than an hour ago, and already much of it is slipping from my mind. Considered a classic by many in today's world, as a trumpeted 40th anniversary reprint suggested, I always wanted to give this one a twirl to see what all the fuss was about. I was for the most part underwhelmed. This may be due in some part to the fact that most of the text is unchanged from its first printing in 1958. Since many of these ideas and theories have become the norm since I was born in 1970, it's a little difficult to see them as novel. It isn't difficult to see that many of Galbraith's conclusions are failures or completely unworkable.The book begins by laying out the idea of conventional wisdom, a term which Galbraith apparently coined, and which he crows about in his new introduction. Conventional wisdom, to Galbraith, is the big, burly force that blocks progress. Those in the know wrap themselves in the flag of conventional wisdom and refuse to acknowledge new ideas that might intrude upon their blissful solitude. Needless to say, Galbraith spends the rest of the book intruding. We get a history of economic thought from Adam Smith through David Ricardo, to Thorstein Veblen. Of course, Marx gets a chapter all to himself. Galbraith shows how their rather depressing view of the world always places the poor in the &quot;poor house&quot; so to speak, and is the basis for economic thought even in today's decidely less dismal world of affluence (hence the title). Galbraith proceeds to show how inflation, consumerism and poor public resources all stem from our dependence on production. In Galbraith's world, production is a roaring, runaway train that plows over everything it sees and leaves destruction in its wake. The last part of the book is a series of ideas about how to lessen production and eliminate poverty.I did give this book three stars, because Galbraith does manage to make a few brilliant observations and statements, such as this gem, found on page 199, &quot;However, an understanding of our economic discourse requires an appreciation of one of its basic rules: men of high position are allowed, by a special act of grace, to accommodate their reasoning to the answer they need. Logic is only required in those of lesser rank.&quot; This doesn't just apply to economics, in my opinion. This is every liberal describing their programs in the last forty years! Galbraith also writes a pretty lucid chapter on how the cycle of consumerism is spinning out of control.Too many times, however, the book falls flat. Galbraith seems to think of the poor as this kind of noble mass that has suffered titanic wrongs at the hand of society. What he doesn't say is that cultural pathologies contribute mightily to poverty. Many just refuse to play by the rules that most people follow. He also advocates shorter work weeks (which never worked) and redistribution of wealth, which found full fruition under Lyndon Johnson's &quot;Great Society&quot;, which did nothing more than breed great amounts of crime and dependency.Would I recommend this book? Yep. If nothing more than to give people a concrete target to point the finger of blame at every time they realize just how much government has intruded in their lives. There is some good information in here, though, if a person looks hard enough."},{"Title":"The Affluent Society","review":"it' s the first time I read something like that in economics."},{"Title":"The Affluent Society","review":"The Affluent Society is probably not read anymore, and for good reason, because it doesn't have a great deal to say today. It is an &quot;intervention,&quot; as the leftists like to say, and it doesn't translate very well to very different circumstances. Just for that reason, it is a snapshot of a particularly interesting time, the late 50's, in American history. What is most interesting about the book is the aristocratic disdain he holds for large gas grills, tail fins, televisions, and advertising. The idea that growth is not organic or spontaneous but generated by advertising--the book was written at about the same time as Vance Packard was big--is repugnant to Galbraith. How frivolous! Or even worse, how trivial. Because Galbraith was part of the strategic air command and was involved in the bombing of cities in WWII, he was intimately familiar with the consequences of that campaign, and he tells a story about how production actually increased after the bombing because all the people engaged in services, like waiters and housecleaners and barbers, went into production after the city had been destroyed. (Albert Speer, who organized that production, recalls meeting his American counterpart after the war and being very impressed with his professionalism. Speer and Galbraith are very similar, no the least in their relationships with charismatic leaders.) Galbraith does not argue, as one would expect, that quality of life is largely divorced from &quot;production&quot;--he is all for production, so long as it involves food, housing, steel, and other essentials. What he notes, instead, is that life went on as before after all the superfluities were stripped away. If only the masses were not so stupid! If only we could maintain a war economy after the war is over: that is the implicit message of the book (and of course Galbraith would be in charge). The idea that all those factories that once produced beautiful bombers would now be producing chrome by the ton was deeply offensive to sense both of discretion--wealth is not for display--and technocratic utility: production should serve a purpose, whether it be fighting Hitler or fighting poverty. Galbraith is also a spectacularly good writer."},{"Title":"The Affluent Society","review":"That JK Galbraith can write well in not contested. The arguments put forth in &quot;The Affluent Society,&quot; however, are spurious at best. Galbraith tends toward the socialist view of &quot;production for use, not for profit&quot; and ignores the reality of market economics, which allocates resources to their most efficient uses. While his argument for expenditures such as education and social services are direct and emotional, the insightful reader will be able to see why they are not feasible. To the insightful reader, the rational and indirect appeal of the market will become clear; to him I reccommend F.A. Hayek's &quot;The Road to Serfdom.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Affluent Society","review":"The lesson of the whole post-Keynesian world is that governments are now responsible for economic performance. Any notion that poor performance can't be remedied by the state is a reversion to 19th-century attitudes, which I'm not prepared to accept. -John Kenneth Galbraith to Mother Jones MagazineI have always felt a certain horror of political economists, since I heard one of them say that he feared the famine of 1848 in Ireland would not kill more than a million people, and that would scarcely be enough to do much good. -Attrib. to Benjamin JowettKarl Marx was so profoundly wrong about so many issues and the Left has clung to his mistakes so tenaciously that it is hard to decide which of his errors has had the most deleterious affect on human affairs. But I think it is safe to say that one of the worst ideas that he advocated, and which was swallowed whole hog by liberals, was the idea that materialism is the supreme and dertiminative motivation for human action. Thus, he proposed, all of human existence boils down to the yearning to live at a subsistence level, to be clothed, fed and housed. Now I'm not saying that these things aren't powerful motivators, I'd merely suggest that it is a failure of perspective to suggest that they are the be all and end all of life. Sure when you are hungry, feeding yourself seems like the purpose of life, but to a drowning man there's no higher purpose than treading water. Draw back from either of these immediate situations and you see that the sufferer has too narrow a perspective.However, Galbraith, who was apparently little more than a garden variety liberal with some height, some panache and a facility with the language, wrote this entire book as a protest against the growth economy, as if it is some kind of iron clad law that once men's most basic material desires are met, they are fed, clothed and housed, then their fundamental purposes in life have been fulfilled. He therefore assumes that any material consumption beyond this base level is unnatural and is created somehow by forces extrinsic to the individual and this consumption is a historical aberration that is being fostered by erroneous attitudes and insidious advertising. Moreover, since these mistaken or malicious factors can not prevail for long, eventually people will realize that they are consuming beyond their needs and they will stop. Therefore, since man, in his view, does not need more than the minimal requirements of existence and since modern society produces enough to satisfy these basic needs for every citizen, it is foolish to keep our focus on expanding the economy. Instead, we should concentrate on redistributing what we have, yadda-yadda-yadda.It is impossible to convey a sense of how incredibly misguided Galbraith's theories and his policy prescriptions have proven. Here are just a few inanities to ponder. He is totally dismissive of the idea that recipients of welfare benefits will be damaged by those very payments, scoffing at the notion that they will become dependents of the state. He concludes that, having reached the point where our needs are taken care of, modern man will necessarily do one of three things: work fewer ours and days; or work less hard; or fewer people will choose to work. He states with great confidence that operating the economy at capacity is per se inflationary, so he suggests that we build in a higher level of unemployment. He prattles on about the current imbalance between public and private production, averring that public &quot;goods&quot; are being neglected in favor of production of private goods. But what are these public goods? How about medicine, education, etc. ? He is so obtuse, or so trapped in a Social Welfare State mindset, that he can't even see that these too are fundamentally private goods. But perhaps the most incredible aspect of the book is his treatment of the American economy as a closed system; he never mentions our trading partners or the developing world and how they will impact the &quot;Affluent Society&quot;.So what we have here is a clarion call for the Great Society by a man who did not perceive, or foresee such basic megatrends as: the globalization of the economy; the massive entry of women (who by his definition would seem to have been fulfilled human beings when men were taking care of them ) into the workforce; the information age; the inflationary effects of government spending; etc...But folks like JFK and LBJ listened to him and we got the Great Society at an estimated cost of $5 Trillion. Not coincidentally, the Federal Deficit today stands at $5.6 Trillion. Finally, in the past few years, we have begun to jettison Galbraithean social programs and we are running a full employment economy with zero % inflation and the deficit will be gone in ten years. I think we can reasonably state that not only was this book spectacularly wrong, it actually did real damage to the United States economy and virtually destroyed several generations of Americans who became addicted to Welfare.This one may edge out Silent Spring for the worst choice on this list (Modern Library Top 100), but the inclusion of both provides a valuable lesson about the invulnerability of liberal cant to contradictory facts and experience.GRADE: F"},{"Title":"The Affluent Society","review":"This book was an optional reading assignment for my United States History class.

We have seen how general are the efforts to join the New Class and how rapid is its expansion. We are not here establishing a new economic and social goal but identifying one that as already widely if but tacitly accepted.\\" --- JKG'The Affluent Society' by John Kenneth Galbraith is a study of how modern nations have mostly eliminated absolute poverty and why the conventional wisdom is preventing human progress. It is only by defeating conventional wisdom that greater human happiness may be obtained.Galbraith begins with a lucid examination of the history of economic theory. How the original economists, Smith/Ricardo/Malthus, were quite dismal about the plight of the masses. Ricardo's Iron Law of Wages states that any gain in wages will result in greater competition for land. Malthus believed that any increase in the food supply would be eliminated by an increase in population. In both cases the laborer was forced to accept their fate and know that nothing could be done. Even Marx, who's economic theory was based off of Ricardo, believed that laborers were helpless as long as a capitalist system remained. The classical understanding of economics was government intervention inherently hurt the people it intended to help.Then came Keynes! With the great advancements in wealth due to capitalism and Keynesian economics it was finally possible to extend economic security to the masses. Nevertheless, conventional wisdom has resisted. People focus on production, specifically within the private realm, even though it is no longer the most pressing need. The country needs to focus on full employment. There needs to be a social balance between private and public production.Galbraith ends the books with a proclamation: We need to invest in human capital above all else. Anything that obstructs this and can be dealt with by the government should be dealt with by the government. We should greatly increase spending on education. We should eliminate rural and urban pockets of poverty (Slums/Appalachia). We should do everything reasonable to eliminate perpetual poverty.What this will mean in the long run is the creation of a 'New Class'. This New Class, today's white collar middle class, will not perform meaningless toil. They will find meaning in their work and a higher level of happiness. All the while the proletariat and peasant classes will slowly, but surely, be eliminated. No Marxist revolution is conceivable if everyone in society is comfortable.Sidenote: Most of what Galbraith discusses in the middle of the text is exceptionally outdated. His thoughts on inflation turned out to be justified but also rather pessimistic. Paul Volker showed that monetary policy does have the political will power to stop inflation. His fear that American consumers may eventually grow tired of frivolous goods also proved to be pessimistic. Changing American values have continually kept pace with expanding production. (Although his view on consumer debt turned out to be strikingly clairvoyant).Finally, Galbraith's writing style is... different. On a technical level his writing is as good as any other economist. He perfectly blends theory with accessibility. It would be easy to argue that Paul Krugman's writing style is largely an imitation of Galbraith. But his humor is another story. He constantly tells exceptionally dry, hokey jokes throughout his work. Only the wonkish will enjoy them."},{"Title":"The Affluent Society","review":"It is rare that someone is both an excellent economist and a gifted writer at the same time. J.K. Galbraith was such an economist-writer. This little book is excellent, in the intelligence and forcefulness of its economic arguments, and in the elegance and simplicity with which they are explained. And that is not even to speak of the colorful examples Galbraith uses, and even the occasional joke. Considering that it was written over 50 years ago (!) it is unbelievable that one can still read this work and feel its relevance even today. Production is still an end rather than a means to our society; the public sector remains underfunded, underappreciated, and intellectually under attack, while private entities that have filled the void are in some cases failing miserably; inequality continues to grow in the developed world...Sure, there are times when the book goes a little too far in its conclusions, but this should be seen as a work challenging the \\"conventional wisdom\\" (coined by Galbraith in the Affluent Society), and therefore it had to say controversial things.Overall, I highly recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The Affluent Society","review":"In this book, Galbraith speaks of broad strokes while we can only hope for small change. He talks about a government that modifies the very engine of production - the intake and the RPM, in order to best serve the people. This reads like brazen statements, in a world where we can't even get a modestly sensible health care system through the Corporate censors.This book ignores the politics and machinations that limit progress, and argues the core - the philosophical base - of liberal economic policy, something you don't find enough of. It also happens to make a strong case, to be sure.The crux of the book, and the primary application of the term Galbraith (arguably) coined - 'Conventional Wisdom' (to mean: accepted knowledge that is not true and holds back real progress) - is the fallacy of how production is measured, and the error of using the measure of production as a measure of society itself.Limits to productivity, Galbraith argues, was the limiting factor to man's advance according to 19th century economists -- Malthusian Theory for example. Now, we have mastered productivity, and rather then scale or broaden the gains, we choose to manufacture new wants to the detriment of our society.Galbraith writes with an elegance you rarely find. His writing can touch on every emotion and every point is arrived at with precise reasoning.This is the type of book where you can get a wealth of knowledge prima facie, but get even more once you analyze the possibilities.

I will make a few general comments about the book before providing a more detailed summary of some of the major claims put forward by Galbraith in this work.Galbraith is an exceptionally gifted writer. He has a gift for expressing his ideas with extreme clarity and force. The fact that his criticisms are also based on a fairly solid, and sound understanding of the ideas he is criticizing make this an extremely powerful book. The general thesis of this book is that the economic ideas which currently tend to determine our analyses of various policy issues and debates were born in a time of scarcity in which increasing production was not only important but was a matter of life or death for large segments of the population. This has led to our tendency to evaluate various policies in terms of the effects they will have on production to the exclusion of other concerns.Galbraith believes that these ideas no longer possess the same relevancy in relation to our current situation now that our society has moved to a state of relative affluence (hence the title of the book). While production is still important in some respects and serves important functions (its positive effect on economic security for example) in many ways we accord it more importance in our decisions than it deserves (and the important functions that it does serve can perhaps be met by other means).Now I will provide a slightly more detailed summary of the contents of Galbraith's book. Galbraith begins his book with a brief summary of economic thought. Economics as a discipline was born, according to Galbraith, at a rather momentous point of world history when, \\"the wealth of national communities began for the first time, to show a steady and persistent improvement\\" (pg. 18). Though the causes for this are complex they can generally be subsumed under the general title of the Industrial Revolution.It was precisely at this time that Adam Smith offered his own formula for economic progress based on free-markets coordinated by the invisible hand of self-interest rather than by the government. As Galbraith points out, \\"it was of aggregate wealth that Smith spoke. He had little hope that the distribution between merchants, manufacturers and landlords on the one hand, and the working masses on the other, would be such as much to benefit the latter\\" (pg. 21). David Ricardo carried on this pessimism in regard to the working masses when he formulated the iron law of wages and Malthus took that pessimism even one step further with his theory of population which forever branded economics as the \\"dismal science\\". The only worthwhile goal to pursue under these conditions was the increase in aggregate wealth through increased production. To attempt to ameliorate the conditions of the lower classes was at best pointless and at worst positively harmful to the first goal of increasing aggregate production.In the latter half of the nineteenth-century economic thought underwent a kind of revolution with the introduction of marginalism. Wages, in particular, were no longer determined based on the iron law of wages formulated by Ricardo but were formed within a competitive labor market based on the marginal productivity of labor. As the productivity of labor rose so did the real wage. This led to a slightly more optimistic view for the lower classes. It was possible, through increases in productivity, to gradually increase the laborers real wage and standard of living. It was still impossible, however, to increase a laborer's wage, if it remained low, through artificial (i.e. non-market) means. Increasing the laborer's wage above his or her marginal productivity would only increase unemployment.This concludes the section on the history of economic thought. There is more in this section than I have summarized. I have only summarized what I thought was necessary to the general argument.The economic theories of the central tradition of economic throught tended to celebrate the benefits of competition. There remained, however, a dark side to the competitive form of society which provided a basis for the critics of the central tradition of economic throught (such as Marx). There are three main problems with the competitive system that I think are central to Galbraith's general argument. The first problem with the competitive system is that it tends to high degrees of inequality (although as we will see Galbraith thinks this problem is ameliorated, if not solved, by increasing production). The second problem is more serious than the first and it is the problem of insecurity. The benefits of competition seemed to rely on maintaining a certain level of insecurity as a motivation for efficiency. Inefficient firms and businesses were threatened with bankruptcy and annihilation. The third problem is the problem of depressions or swings in the business cycle.All three of these problems, which are inherent within the competitive system, have, at one time or another, provided fodder for the critics of the competitive system. Increasing production tends to ameliorate to some degree all three of these problems. Increasing production does not necessarily reduce inequality but when everyone's standard of living is rising those at the lower end of the scale are less inclined to complain about the persistence of high inequality and focus instead on their own higher living standards. Increasing production also tends to promote economic security and economic stability by keeping levels of aggregate demand high. But, as Galbraith remarks, \\"There remains...the task of justifying the resulting flow of goods. Production cannot be an incidental to the mitigation of inequality or the provision of jobs. It must have a raison d'etre of its own\\" (pg. 114).This raison d'etre for production has been supplied by the notion that any increase in productivity from given resources necessarily leads to increases in welfare. This is the true pillar on which our obsession with production stands. If it were to be challenged the entire edifice would be cast into doubt (pg. 116). This is the point that Galbraith begins his critique.I will not be able to outline Galbraith's entire critique, or his general proscriptions for the future, but I can give a sense of where Galbraith is headed. This section will necessarily be a little bit more haphazard as I simply attempt to highlight what I think are some of the more interesting aspects of Galbraith's critique and his advice for how best to proceed.Galbraith begins by undermining the theory of consumer demand which he believes rests on two broad propositions, \\"The first is that the urgency of wants does not diminish appreciably as more of them are satisfied...The second proposition is that wants originate in the personality of the consumer\\" (pg. 117). Galbraith brilliantly uses the doctrine of diminishing marginal productivity, a cornerstone of the central tradition in economic thought, to undermine the first proposition. As more wants are satisfied it is reasonable to assume that the additional wants that are satisfied through further increasing production are of less urgency, \\"This being so, the production that provides the goods that satisfy these less urgent wants must also be of smaller (and declining) importance\\" (pg. 118-119). Galbraith undermines the second proposition by drawing attention to the importance of advertising as a manufacturer of wants, \\"A broad empirical relationship exists between what is spent on production of consumer goods and what is spent in synthesizing the desires for that production. A new consumer product must be introduced with a suitable advertising campaign to arouse interest in it\\" (pg. 127). Not only does this undercut the second proposition about the origin of wants in the consumer but it points to the growing superfluity of the wants that are being satisfied by increasing production. These wants, in other words, cannot be urgent if they must be contrived for the consumer through advertising.Galbraith has undercut the raison d'etre of production which was based on the belief that increased production always led to greater welfare. Galbraith has some rather brilliant comments on this particular topic. Galbraith writes, for example, \\"If the modern corporation must manufacture not only goods but the desire for the goods it manufactures, the efficiency of the first part of this activity ceases to be decisive. One could indeed argue that human happiness would be as effectively advanced by inefficiency in want creation as by efficiency in production\\" (pg. 213). One could argue that less advertising might increase welfare as much as increased production. If I might be so bold as to offer a few of my own thoughts on this subject I would say that in many ways decreasing wants, as opposed to increasing the number of objects available for want satisfaction, accords better with human nature. The notion that increasing production always leads to greater welfare is based on the notion that human beings are insatiable in their desires. At the risk of sounding overly philosophical I would say that while this may be true empirically I don't think it is true ontologically and that is because people are in general ignorant in regard to their condition and their own true good. Buddhism makes this ignorance the prime root of suffering. The realm of insatiable desire in the wheel of birth and death is the realm of the hungry ghosts. These people believe that they would be happier with more things but they are wrong. The more they eat the more they crave. Our society is built on the attempt to increase this craving to infinite dimensions which, in my opinion, is not a recipe leading to greater welfare.Galbraith also highlights some of the hypocrisy of those who claim to be concerned with increasing efficiency in production. Galbraith points out that in general there are five ways to improve efficiency in production: 1) the productive resources that are available can be more fully employed; 2) labor and capital can be utilized in the most advantageous combination and distributed to the greatest advantage for the satisfaction of human wants; 3) the supply of labor can be increased; 4) the supply of capital can be increased; 5) and, the state of the arts can be improved by technological innovation (pg. 102). Galbraith points out that economists tend to focus almost all of their attention on the second means of increasing the efficiency of production while ignoring the rest, while a serious effort to increase output would emphasize all five. Galbraith again traces this to our heritage. The major stumbling blocks in the way of increasing output during the time of Adam Smith were the impediments placed in the way of the free movement of labor and capital by government institutions. Increasing productivity in these conditions meant removing these impediments. The possibility of directly promoting the other four means of increasing production did not really exist at the time, but they do now. The state could be doing more to promote technological innovations and capital accumulation to give just two examples. It is only the irrational distaste we feel for public investment and production which stands in the way of more fully utilizing these possibilities. We have come to believe that private production, however frivolous the object, is a boon to society as a whole, while public services and public investment, however beneficial for society as a whole, are a necessary burden. This is utterly irrational and it stands in the way of what Galbraith promotes as one of the primary goals of social development and economic policy: social balance.Galbraith defines social balance as \\"a satisfactory relationship between the supply of privately produced goods and services and those of the state\\" (pg. 189). This concept is fairly easy to illustrate with examples. Certain goods require certain other goods as necessary complements if their full benefits are going to be reaped. It would not do us any good to increase our production of cars if we didn't at the same time build roads on which to drive them. Increasing diversionary activities such as comic books, movies, video games, narcotics, and alcohol will only lead to more violence and misery if they are not balanced by investments in good education systems, good recreational opportunities, and a good police force (pg. 191). The former goods are all privately produced and the latter are all public goods. There must be a balance between private production and public investment if we are going to fully reap the benefits of the former. Galbraith adds that increases in public investment will also tend to increase security by reducing the effects of fluctuations in private investment (pg. 208).One final point and I will bring this lengthy review to a close. We have seen that our obsession with production is not nearly as rational as it seems. That further increases in output increases welfare is not at all obvious. A consumer society is also unstable especially when consumption is funded with credit since maintaining levels of aggregate demand will depend on the maintenance of credit (a lesson we are learning right now). Production does, however, still provide a basis of security for the individual laborer. If a worker is laid off we might not even notice the drop in output due to their exit from the workforce but it is certain that the individual effected certainly misses his or her income. Production is the source of income for many people and it is often argued that high levels of production are necessary in order to maintain high levels of employment. But, as Galbraith argues, the nexus between production and economic security can be broken by greater unemployment compensation (pg. 218). The problem generally standing in the way of increased unemployment compensation was the fear that it would lead to increases in voluntary idleness. Galbraith is honest enough to admit that we might indeed see some increase in voluntary idleness if unemployment compensation were to be increase, but, he writes, \\"in a world where production is no longer urgent, we can obviously view an increase in voluntary idleness with some equanimity. And even if the unemployment compensation were close to the wage, it is not certain that the malingering would be great. Fears in this matter have always been extraordinarily exaggerated\\" (pg. 219). People react negatively to the idea of their taxes going to fund the idle and they call this a concern with individual freedom but I don't see any particular virtue in this attitude. It seems rather small minded and petty to me and rather myopic. People have an eye only on their immediate advantage and fail to see the sometimes hidden webs of causality which connect their own welfare with the welfare of others. The problem is not that people pursue their own advantage but that they have a far too limited understanding of their own advantage.There is a great deal more in this book than I have been able to summarize but that should give the interested reader an idea of what to expect."},{"Title":"The Affluent Society","review":"Galbraith's assessment of the 1950's economic scene, the populace's choices, and the then current reasons for the post-war boom, are particularly relevant to our choices today: Affluenza, the decaying environment, decreases in social services, worker rights, materialism, etc.I disdain economic dogma, the economic beliefs that are so commonly bandied about, and seemingly plausible, but generally unproven and with little merit. Economics abounds with such things, and Galbraith's insights then are wholly relevant now, both as a critique of the current administration's policies, and as a guidepost for a better future."},{"Title":"The Affluent Society","review":"One major idea of Galbraith remains with me, and I think has relevance for today also. It is that the private enterprise economy of the United States has not given enough of its resources to infrastructure needs. This is apparent in the United States today , and great investments are needed to shore up aging systems.Galbraith is a very fast- minded, and enjoyable writer with a real sense of humor. He made reading Economics in my college days a bit more pleasurable. It is unfortunate that the economic Abundance of the Affluent Society has not yet reached all Americans much less all of Mankind. But Galbraith did see that the dismal misery of the mass of mankind the hard economic reality which had applied through the ages no longer applied in America. This perception was true in the fifties and is even more true today."},{"Title":"The Affluent Society","review":"Galbraith's book is certainly thought-provoking &amp; worth reading. His arguments are well thought out, and his writing is wryly witty. Even if you disagree with his views, as many have, it's worth a read.Galbraith starts the book off by reviewing how many early economic ideas were created in periods of scarcity, and that the notion of scarcity may not appropriate for today's age of mass affluence. Those with vested interests in production (i.e. large businesses) still cling to the &quot;conventional wisdom&quot; that increased production equals progress, even though goods are now abundant and our basic material needs have been satisfied. To stimulate further demand, corporations must resort to salesmanship and advertising. If advertising stopped, demand would fall, production would drop, and unemployment would rise; thus, business continue to focus on increasing production to ensure their own survival.There are other threats to production. Economic cycles may result in a depression. Poorly managed firms may have to lay off workers. As a result, people -- and especially politicians --focus on economic growth to avoid these insecurities. Growth is something that both the rich and poor will vote for, since they both want to keep their jobs and acquire more goods. Growing out of a recession also seems promising. The net result is that society as a whole focuses on increasing production by private industry.Next, Galbraith shifts his view from private industry to the public sector. He does this by introducing the idea of social balance, which asserts that as private spending increases, public spending should increase to match. For example, if factories build more cars, more money needs to be invested in public roads. Unfortunately, private goods are sold via advertising by companies that can react quickly to changes in demand. In contrast, public investment by governments reacts much more slowly, and typically lags private spending and investment, due to regulations, bureaucracy, and voter's general aversion to new taxes. The result is a world rich in private goods but poor in public ones: beautiful cars driving on poor roads, well-dressed kids in the crumbling public school, neighborhoods with beautiful homes but polluted parks.So what to do? Galbraith's proposed solution is that we should invest in our economic infrastructure: our parks, our roads, our educational system, long-term scientific research, police, and the like. To fund this, he emphasizes sales taxes, which reduce consumption, and make those who consume a lot pay for it. To alleviate poverty and inequality, Galbraith also proposes to expand unemployment insurance so that one could choose not to work, yet still be able to get by. In his view, this would allow more people to reduce their work week, or not work at all, or to be able to focus on work they really enjoy.Although this is certainly a liberal view &amp; may not be feasible, his views certainly were eye-opening and thought provoking. For that reason, I recommend the book."},{"Title":"The Affluent Society","review":"If you agree with Galbraith's notions on economics you may find this a seminal work. If you disagree with him you will no where find a better spar for your own ideas. (Friedman spent an entire book analyzing Galbraith) Love it or hate it The Affluent Society looms large in American economic thought of the 20th century. The book itself is dedicated primarily to re-assessing the role of production in an economy of increasing affluence. Economics long ago acquired the unhappy designation as &quot;the dismal science.&quot; This was derived from the observation by all famous early economists that economic life for the masses was inevitably harsh. Ricardo, Smith, and Marx all agreed that while a minority might enjoy abundance the majority were doomed to struggle for their very economic survival. As early as the 1950s Galbraith made the very simple point that the economic prospects of the masses are no longer dark. The average worker could (and still does) expect reasonable wages, a constant supply of luxury goods, and free time to enjoy these things. The modern economy is no longer a battle for simple survival but rather one over what an individual's share of excess production should be. Some reviewers have commented that the specifics in The Affluent Society have become dated. Indeed automotive tail-fins are no longer the common automotive add-on they once were, but the underlying questions remain valid. In the economy of 150 years ago to claim that suffering was inevitable seemed fair, for it was the state of the masses. In the economy of the present where economic deprivation is no longer the norm, to claim some must suffer while the majority live in relative affluence suddenly appears cruel.A social scientist who argued the changes of the last 200 years were not relevant to analysis would be laughed at in any other field. Unequivocably our economic priorities have changed during that time. The Affluent Society provides a history of that change, a look at how our failure to adapt has led to a number of social problems, and suggests how we might better organize economic priorities in the present. It is no small acheivement."},{"Title":"The Affluent Society","review":"There is a glaring blind spot among Conservative economists who speak breathlessly about freedom and distribution of power yet completely ignore the threat brought on by the disparity of wealth. The growing gap was what Marx saw as the eventual destroyer of Capitalism. Conservatives, on the other hand, see the disparity not as a problem but as a solution to pure democracy where a street sweeper has the same one vote as a CEO. Extreme wealth puts the power back in the hands of the people most capable of wielding it.Mr. Galbraith takes a look back at the evolution of economics starting with the early belief that the average worker would always earn just enough to survive and perhaps raise a family. Later Herbert Spencer expounded his Social Darwinian view of economics that has shown a resurgence in the last few decades. The original view was that social programs literally allow inferior genetic lines to procreate and dilute society. It was the collapse of the stock market in the 1930's that put Social Darwinism on the back burner. Although Marx correctly predicted the collapse, the economy recovered and the increasing disparity never created a revolution in the United States. This, however, may have been thanks to the many wealth redistribution programs created after the Great Depression. The author also points out that there is more of a physical separation between the economic strata's and ostentatious displays of wealth have become at best pass&eacute; at worst vulgar.The book punches a hole in the theory that productivity declines as worker security increases. One need only look at the dramatic rise in both production and security after World War II. As Mr. Galbraith points out it's always the OTHER guy who should give up security. Corporations and corporate heads work to create a broad cushion of support for themselves while decrying additional safeguards for workers as wasteful of needed capital. Although the author generally supports growth over wealth distribution as a way to improve society he is far more pragmatic than Conservative economists. Unlike right wing ideologists, Mr. Galbraith recognizes that the market often focuses on the things society needs least. There will always be a need for balance between public and private funding in particular for large scale research projects and public goods like education that the market shows a lack of interest in. The author doesn't seemed to have the same mystical reverence for market forces that some economists exhibit. He also has little respect for the federal reserves ability to even out market fluctuations using monetary policy (conservatives) or fiscal policy (liberals). Even with his support of business growth Mr. Galbraith recognizes that growth obsession can be a dangerous thing for, among other things, creating increasingly unmanageable debt in a heavily consumption based society.There seems to be a definite slant in economics towards the desires of the business class which includes worshipping at the altar of deregulated, free market Capitalism. John Kenneth Galbraith is a refreshingly non-ideological view of economics which actually recognizes that perhaps it's better to offer opportunities to the poor rather than kicks to the teeth to encourage growth out of poverty."},{"Title":"The Affluent Society","review":"A true classic that is as relevant to explaining today's society as that in which Galbraith wrote it - and never more so than Galbraith's argument that we need a better social balance between private and public expenditure. As the gap grows between the urban rich and poor, he notes, more of the rich are able to opt out of public services such as schools, police and transport. With urbanization a dominant theme of the coming decades, it's worth being reminded of Galbraith's observations on how public expenditure on urban infrastructure is generally presented in political discourse - \\"at best, public services are a necessary evil; at worst, they are a malign tendency against which an alert community must exercise eternal vigilance\\" - which, as he points out, leads to some interesting contradictions - \\"Vacuum cleaners to ensure clean houses are praise-worthy and essential in our standard of living. Street cleaners to ensure clean streets are an unfortunate expense. Partly as a result, our houses are generally clean and our streets generally filthy.\\"Galbraith's philosophical arguments against extreme wealth inequality are both increasingly unfashionable and increasingly urgent; the trend he identifies - \\"few things are more evident in modern social history than the decline of interest in inequality as an economic issue\\" - has hardly been arrested as the world has globalized. Galbraith quotes Tawney as noting that people who think they should have unfettered enjoyment of their inherited money do not generally think that others should have unfettered enjoyment of their inherited physical strength or cunning - \\"Those who dread a dead-level of income or wealth... do not, it seems, dread a dead-level of law and order, and of security of life and property\\" - an observation that's highly applicable to inequality considered on the scale of the modern global economy.Galbraith's pithy and wryly amused writing style has stood the test of time as well as the arguments. Perhaps my favourite example comes when Galbraith is commenting on the concern that social security makes poor people idle: the \\"ancient art of evading work\\", he says, is not the preserve of any particular class or occupation, and \\"the art of genteel and elaborately concealed idleness may well reach its highest development in the upper executive reaches of the modern corporation.\\""},{"Title":"The Affluent Society","review":"Forget the fact that Galbraith is more readable than any other economist ever, this is an important work, full of insights into not only the condition of the post WWII economy, but also the history of economic thought and why economists think the way they do (and avoid thinking about real issues). Most economic theory is based on the notion of scarcity, yet we live in a society of generalized affluence. The economy changed, and continues to change, yet orthodox economists are, for the most part, still thinking about the economy as if it was 1800. As relevant today as it was when it first came out. I became an economist because of this book (though not an orthodox one).C.

Contains interesting discussion of the causes of the depression and businesses cycles and also, as a treat, amusing reflections on the habits and rationalizations of the rich through the ages."},{"Title":"The Affluent Society","review":"Marx said religion is the great opiate of the people. Rather, it may be affluence. Not a popular topic among economists (whose minds are on markets and scarcity), affluence/abundance is a powerful concept for understanding social and spiritual problems in the wealthy nations. Picture this: a sports utility vehicle with a lone driver talking on a cell phone. Enough said. Read Galbraith."},{"Title":"The Affluent Society","review":"I wish I'd discovered this guy's writing during his lifetime. What's striking is that economic and political thought still hasn't come close to acknowledging what was already obvious to JKG more than half a century ago - the need for a paradigm shift that comes to terms with an economy so productive it doesn't know what to do with itself, as our society is so used to poverty, it has yet to figure out how to handle and take full advantage of abundance.I've always thought there was something off when, in an economy with rapidly expanding productivity and the theoretical capacity to produce at least all the material goods all of us could want many times over, people increasingly feel overworked and like they're having trouble making ends meet. In the continuing aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent recession, something seemed fundamentally dissonant about all the talk - from across the political spectrum - about the need for \\"job creation\\" as the most important issue of the day, in a world of unprecedented production capacity. What seems lost in the anguish over unemployment and stagnation is that 1) the basic purpose of an economy, from a birds eye view, is to provide goods and services - stuff - for its people, and 2) that we have no shortage of capacity for production of a wide variety of stuff, enough to sustain our entire population at a very comfortable level. Why can't we focus on figuring out a sensible way to take advantage of our society's affluence? All the talk of \\"economic growth\\" seems divorced from any connection to actual improved standards of living for the average person; it seems to me nothing more than a very inefficient way of trying to reduce unemployment-driven poverty and individual economic insecurity, with many negative effects on the environment and on the lifestyles of people who ought to be able to relax a little and enjoy our wealth and ability to enjoy more leisure time.From the first page of \\"The Affluent Society\\", Galbraith assures me I am in fact not the first person to have had these thoughts, and goes on to express these ideas eloquently and elaborate on them in very interesting ways. He substantiates my suspicion that the widespread concern with economic growth is almost entirely a proxy for concern about poverty and economic security and a very ineffective way of addressing it at that,. He also explains how economic policy is not only highly inefficient at alleviating the income insecurity people care about, it's also not effective at maximizing long-term growth in overall production capacity (which few people are actually concerned with in developed countries, for good reason) OR in facilitating the innovation and investment of resources in the kind of novel consumer products and services that would most genuinely raise peoples' private living standards (an iPhone counts; another new brand of deodorant doesn't). Investments in the kind of basic, patient R&D; that yields truly novel consumer products is unaffordable by small and medium companies, and not very well incentivized even for the large, monopolistic companies that can afford it. [A lot of the breakthroughs in innovation that occurred in America in the mid-20th century were actually funded by research investments within the Department of Defense under the justification or guise of military necessity. The internet has unleashed a lot of valuable and exciting innovation in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, but much of it doesn't lend itself to the standard B2C retail model.] One can accept all of this and have differing views on what the best approaches are to the realities of an economy in which growth in the production of standard consumer goods is no longer urgently needed nor demanded by the market - but still necessary for \\"job creation\\" given that that's how we're used to distributing these goods. We should all, however, be able to acknowledge that the way we've been talking about the economy and about growth and jobs, is out of touch with our affluent economy.Galbraith paints a humorous picture of Americans so wealthy in personal goods (albeit not as wealthy as we could be if companies had better incentives to invest in R&D; that yields truly innovative and useful products) and yet relatively impoverished in public ones, especially those provided locally. As we're able to afford increasingly frivolous and abstract consumer products, we accept the need for painful cuts to our public budgets. Contrary to popular belief across the ideological spectrum, this contradiction is more applicable to the middle class than to the poor, but is most striking for the very wealthy, who've effectively maxed out any utility they can get from individual purchasing power and can be made more economically \\"wealthy\\" only through improvement in the \\"public goods\\" that affect them - or investments in R&D; in the private or public sector that will yield truly innovative utility for consumers. Of course, not all public spending is created equal. But Galbraith makes an irrefutable case that - though he doesn't put it in exactly these terms - a wealthy voter solely driven by material self-interest should be an even more adamant advocate for higher taxes and more government spending across the board than a wealthy voter primarily concerned with raising the living standards of the poor. This point seems lost on everyone from Grover Norquist to Michael Moore, from Ron Paul to Ralph Nader, from Warren Buffet to David Koch, from Milton Friedman to Paul Krugman.I'm inspired by this book to learn more about is how standard measures of things like productivity and utility are measured by economists in a primarily non-industrial economy - and then how they should be measured in terms meaningful to our well-being, even just in economic terms. I can conceive of cars and houses and TVs and even haircuts and restaurant meals having economic value for which growth can be meaningfully measured from one decade to the next. But what about a consultation with a financial adviser? That has value but it's a type of meta-value, or investment value not dissimilar to education and doesn't represent real end-user consumption, the way I see it. Facebook usage, on the other hand, does represent end-user consumption of a sort but is not paid for as such (the company's revenue comes from B2B sales of ad space and user data and it's operations are thus considered intermediate, not final, goods). \\"The Affluent Society\\" was originally written in the still largely manufacturing-dominated economy of the 1950's. Since then, the growth-driven, product-oriented economic framework developed by Smith and Ricardo amid pervasive poverty has no doubt become even more profoundly out of date in the post-industrial economy.I wish Galbraith were still around to share his thoughts on all these developments. And I hope at some point society will realize the opportunity afforded to it by its affluence to readjust its thinking about work, growth and economic value and to direct its efforts to higher-order economic and societal goals."},{"Title":"The Affluent Society","review":"John Kenneth Galbraith was one of the great public intellectuals of 20th century America. He advised Presidents and politicians, wrote best-selling books, taught economics at Harvard, appeared on TV, and served as the U.S. Ambassador to India. Nevertheless, mainstream economists looked down their noses at him. They scoffed at his sweeping generalizations. They questioned his technical prowess, noting that his books had no math. Many suspected that he was a \\"mere sociologist\\" masquarading as an economist.These critics may have been jealous of Galbraith's literary fame and towering public profile. In any event, they certainly misconstrued his significance in American intellectual life. Galbraith's great gift as a thinker was his razor-sharp eye for cant. He knew where economic ideas came from, how they supported vested interests, and where they diverged from the plain facts of everyday life -- and he conveyed these lessons to educated general readers in elegant prose. In the end, he may have been a gadfly and critic, not a model builder -- but so what? If mainsteam economists taught us how to think about markets, Galbraith taught us how to think about mainstream economics.\\"The Affluent Society\\" is one of his masterpieces. Written in the 1950s, ideas fly from its pages, touching on everything from Ricardian economics to oligopolies and inflation. The central idea, however, is arresting. Galbraith argued that modern economics was forged in the austere world of the 19th century, when national economies struggled simply to feed and clothe their populations. Sensible at the time, the core assumptions of economics were carried over to a different century facing a different set of problems. In the 20th century, supermarkets bursted with unnecessary soaps and cereals, car models changed every year, and billions of advertising dollars were spent on campaigns to convince consumers that they needed items they never even knew they wanted.Galbraith argued that, with the problem of scarcity more or less solved, society was free to loosen the connection between income and labor, and to spend more money on public goods such as schools, hospitals, and clean air. He rejected as anachronistic the objection that such measures would reduce economic efficiency by mandating higher taxes or rewarding idleness: what was the value of having an efficient economic system if the goods it produced answered no urgent human needs? Galbraith thought that society should focus on the development of human capacities and the building of decent communities and workplaces, and not fret unduly over allocative efficiency.Galbraith was wrong about many things, but he was always thought-provoking and mind-expanding. The continuing force of \\"The Affluent Society\\" will be clear to anyone who reflects on the crazy popularity of SUVs or tallies up the money we lavish on pets -- in a day and age when American cats get better medical care than most African children, it's safe to say that the supply side problem has finally been solved (at least for us and our pets). The book should be read by all serious students of economics or 20th century American society, and it belongs on any bookshelf of social criticism next to the works of Thorstein Veblen and C. Wright Mills."},{"Title":"The Affluent Society","review":"In this book, Galbraith speaks of broad strokes while we can only hope for small change. He talks about a government that modifies the very engine of production - the intake and the RPM, in order to best serve the people. This reads like brazen statements, in a world where we can't even get a modestly sensible health care system through the Corporate censors.This book ignores the politics and machinations that limit progress, and argues the core - the philosophical base - of liberal economic policy, something you don't find enough of. It also happens to make a strong case, to be sure.The crux of the book, and the primary application of the term Galbraith (arguably) coined - 'Conventional Wisdom' (to mean: accepted knowledge that is not true and holds back real progress) - is the fallacy of how production is measured, and the error of using the measure of production as a measure of society itself.Limits to productivity, Galbraith argues, was the limiting factor to man's advance according to 19th century economists -- Malthusian Theory for example. Now, we have mastered productivity, and rather then scale or broaden the gains, we choose to manufacture new wants to the detriment of our society.Galbraith writes with an elegance you rarely find. His writing can touch on every emotion and every point is arrived at with precise reasoning.This is the type of book where you can get a wealth of knowledge prima facie, but get even more once you analyze the possibilities. It's a book that will make you think and may well affect how you think."},{"Title":"The Wonderful Spirit Filled Life","review":"A wonderful, faith-based discussion of the Holy Spirit in the lives of believers.

In developing a real, lasting relationship with God, I failed so often as I put forth all the effort.

Great book to read!"},{"Title":"The Wonderful Spirit Filled Life","review":"I bought this book for two main reasons. First, I want to know more about the Holy Spirit, and the role it has in my Christian walk. Second, I have heard Charles Stanley preach before, and he seems like a reliable source for helping further my Christian development. This book confirmed both my reasons.In his book Dr. Stanley does an outstanding job of explaining how the Holy Spirit works in our lives. Although I do not agree with all of his conclusions about the Holy Spirit (most specifically when he talks about the limited availability of speaking in tongues for all Christians), overall, I think this book is right on target. Whether you are a new Christian, or have walked with God for years, I think that this book can help bring new light to a subject that is often misunderstood.Using a lot of scriptures, and his extensive research on the subject, Dr. Stanley has greatly increased my understanding of the Holy Spirit. I liked the book because he offers a lot of practical advice about seeking God's Holy Spirit. I really enjoyed the fact that Dr. Stanley shares his own struggle with grasping everything that the Holy Spirit has to offer us as Christians. I think that many Christian leaders in his position would perhaps be too proud to discuss their own journey towards a greater understanding of God's spirit. Lastly, I think that this book has helped further my quest for knowledge about the Holy Spirit. Dr. Stanley includes a list of the resources he used while writing the book, at the end of each chapter which will serve as an excellent guide for me in the future.I highly recommend this book to any believer who is wanting to learn more about the Holy Spirit. If you are like me, you want to learn the truth from a reliable source. I think this book will meet your need, if that is your desire."},{"Title":"The Wonderful Spirit Filled Life","review":"The Wonderful Spirit-filled Life by Charles Stanley is one of the most important training books you can have in your private library. It's simple, clear, lucid teaching. It is NOT fanatical or extreme in its presentation of how to have a Spirit-filled walk. It is very direct. Very accurate. If you follow the basic steps, by book's end, you'll have an empowered Christian life. As a Charismatic, there are a few doctrinal points Stanley made that I don't agree with. However, they were not large enough to deter me from growing through this book, nor ordering extra copies to give away. Overall, a very balanced presentation that can take you to a deeper walk with the Master."},{"Title":"The Wonderful Spirit Filled Life","review":"In an outstanding, well researched, &amp; documented book, Dr. Stanley identifies key factors contributing to the pervasive misunderstanding of the Third Person of the Trinity. In his no nonsense, yet comfortable style, he separates the wheat from the chaff. Through the use of personal dilemmas, exceptional Scripture referencing &amp; works of noteable authors (such as Billy Graham and J. Oswald Sanders), infused with functional strategies for application, Dr. Stanley presents a clear case for anyone interested in moving in the direction of truth. His logic is compelling. He captures problems with human emotion beautifully. With all of the confusion about the identity of the Holy Spirit, and the unfortunate trend of some to try to &quot;manipulate&quot; Him, for their purposes, this is a giant breath of fresh air. Upon completion one may find himself saying, &quot;Well of course! That makes perfect sense!&quot; As a result of this book, I'm currently reading Hannah Whitall Smith's classic 19th century &quot;The Christians Secret of a Happy Life&quot;. Wow! His generous in text referencing has whet my appetite. An amazingly brilliant, insightful, and honest piece of work."},{"Title":"The Wonderful Spirit Filled Life","review":"I read this book only two years after believing on the name of Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior. I thought the Holy Spirit was beside me. I never knew He was such an important part of me (inside me). It helped me not to fear the enemy any more. I mean, if the Spirit if within me, how could the enemy have any power over me? I live a victorious Christian Life and this book has helped me tremendously. Since reading this book, I understand how God speaks to me, and that means victory--if you surrender, of course!"},{"Title":"The Wonderful Spirit Filled Life","review":"Dr. Stanley provides insights that help a Christian to tap into the abundant life described by Jesus in the Gospels by showing them how to apply priciples that work. For example, he writes &quot;you will enjoy exercising your gift. You will look forward to the responsibilities you are given that call on you to use your gift&quot; (p. 137). In other words, being all that God intended you to be is an exciting adventure of discovery. It enables a person to discover who they are and the God who made them.In making a point about God's sovereignty, Dr. Stanley notes &quot;the Holy Spirit decides who gets which gifts&quot; (p. 134). As a result, the person is seeking to discover what God has already put in place in his or her life. The adventure continues as one uses those gifts for the kingdom of God and His purposes."},{"Title":"The Wonderful Spirit Filled Life","review":"Learning to walk with Christ is the adventure of a lifetime! It is, indeed, the reason we were made, and makes our lives full of purpose! To know Him intimately involved in each day makes even the trials that come have meaning, realizing that good can come from all that is allowed to touch us. It gives us hope and comfort knowing He is with us at ALL times, guiding and making the way for us, even when we cannot see anything except what is right in front of our eyes. Knowing He has all things under His control gives peace and comfort. He sustains and encourages, because He loves us more dearly than we can imagine and wants only good to come from even the adversities. Growing more deeply into Him, becoming completely dependent as children, makes us ripe for His best use of our lives, as others see Him shine through us. There must be more of Him and less of us. This book has changed my life and led to more answered prayer than I ever dreamed possible, even supernatural interventions that only He could have arranged or accomplished. Thus, I now have intimate stories of my Savior, Who leads me beside the still waters, even through the storms of life. That, and I am presently disabled from a series of traumas, but at peace, knowing I am in the center of His will for my life, surrendered to His Plan."},{"Title":"The Wonderful Spirit Filled Life","review":"Dr. Stanley has written an excellent book encouraging readers to not be content with a self-satisfied life and instead be transformed by God's Holy Spirit and be used for His glory.The book contains 18 chapters and are almost equally divided into three main areas:1. Looking Up (A personal journey into the Spirit-filled life)2. Looking Within (The ministries of the Holy Spirit in the believer)3. Looking Ahead (The Holy Spirit's role in decision-making)Stanley's underlying point throughout the book is that the believer can only experience a totally joy-filled life when truly under the leadership and authority of the Holy Spirit.Read, enjoy, and be challenged!"},{"Title":"The Wonderful Spirit Filled Life","review":"Charles Stanley touches on every aspect of what the Christian is to experience from the indwelling of God's Holy Spirit. He gives guidelines. He asks important questions, and then answers them. At the end of every chapter he reviews the chapter and asks the reader questions pertaining to his or her life. I would recommend this book to any Christian who is hungry for growth in Christianity. It's like a how to book. Only it teaches how to listen and know when God's Holy Spirit is speaking."},{"Title":"The Wonderful Spirit Filled Life","review":"Dr. Stanley writes in the easy way that he teaches on this sensitive subject. He shares his own experience of coming to understand that the more surrendered he was to God in his life; the more he gave up his &quot;rights&quot; and his &quot;will,&quot; the more the Spirit could fill him and lead him. The resulting joy and peace will leave you anxious to apply this new understanding to your own life. This book is not a lecture to the ignorant, but a sharing between friends. Inspiring in it's warmth and clarity."},{"Title":"The Wonderful Spirit Filled Life","review":"This book is an excellent read! It is both informative and practical as Dr. Stanley walks you through his personal discovery of the Holy Spirit in his own Christian experience. In his trademark conversational style, he helps you to understand why an understanding of the Holy Spirit is perhaps the most important component of your Christian walk, second only to receiving salvation itself. Dr. Stanley provides plenty of scriptural support and uses excellent analogies. He gives many actual, albeit safe, disclosures from from his own life. You almost get the sense that you are having a personal one-on-one conversation with him. One of the things that I really liked is that at the end of the each chapter, he gave a list of resources that a person could go to for additional information, as well as a list of thought provoking \\"think about it\\" questions.

For more depth on these topics Jerry Bridges and other authors have written books, but as mentioned this book is practical and not academic, so the content is not going to satisfy a seminary class, but will satisfy anyone wanting to learn how to better live their lives through the power of the Holy Spirit. I have three books on the Holy Spirit and this by far is the best. Living beyond your capacity by Paul Chappell was not very helpful and one I d not recommend.

I had never stopped believing in Him I just wasn't walking with HIm. I knew of the Holy Spirit but I had never really understood what He did or how He was supposed to Help me. Due to this I set out to do alot of things in my own strength and to completely fail. The more I began listening to Charles Stanley's radio show I knew he had something that I didn't. I always wanted to know more of the Holy SPirit and what He does in our lives. SO I finally invested in this book and I thank God ! THis book answers the very practical of how to be Spirit Filled. How to have freedom from temptation. And talks very straightforward about why we fail so many times. Quite frankly the Spirit Filled life is one of faith and in my searching for so lng I had heard it described as an experience in which you \\"just might\\" get it. It seemed up to me in this crazy works related way. But hte Spirit Filled life is a life of Faith just like Salvation is! Due to this book explaining so clearly I now see the importance of praying each morning (Whereas before I was praying at nigth) for the Spirit's help in all my struggles. And then because I prayed Ican now look back and just draw on His strenght. Another reason this book was so helpful is because He uses alot of scripture to explain how much Jesus wanted us to live inside of us and how much the Holy Spirit wants to help us. And reading this will increase your faith if you take the time to meditate on the verses. In order to walk by the Spirit we must know that hte SPirit Filled Life is available and effective and that He wants to Help us ...and in fact it was HIS idea! lol.

I am only about halfway through and I am seriously plowing through this book because of its information .

Each concludes that the other side has made a blunder by failing to see that commonality. Honderich argues that we, however, really partake in both attitudes. The attitude that involves origination involves beliefs and grounds that conflict with the truth of a determinism so Honderich then explores what we lose, what we can and cannot persist in, once we recognize these conflicts. A very subtle treatment, to which I cannot do justice in this space. Worth a look from anyone interested in determinism and free will."},{"Title":"Making the Web Work: Designing Effective Web Applications","review":"I want to thank Bob for writing this book.Although there are tons books written about &quot;web site&quot; design,there are virtually no books written specifically for designinguser interface for web applications.As a practicing UI engineer/designer for over 5 years, focusing on web applications,I still learned lot of useful approaches to dealing with common &quot;road blocks&quot; from this book.But, what I liked best about this book was the fact thatBob validated lot of web application UI best practices thatsome of us knew for some time.

He packs in a lot of information, but the book is so well written and organized that it's easy to digest. And, unlike a lot of design books that sound like they were written from a soapbox, there's no preaching or sleight of hand here. Baxley explains things clearly, and then provides real-world examples that crystallize his thinking and seal the deal.If you're looking for detailed advice, you'll definitely find it here -- from where to place controls on a table to how to write clear labels and explanatory text for the web. But I found the book's core strength to be the higher-level stuff -- it presents a way to think about UI design of complex, large-scale projects, and weaves in a range of topics including product vision, conceptual models, information architecture, and navigation. It's a great blend of high-level process and detailed strategies.The advice in Baxley's book is on target for anyone charged with designing or creating web applications, but could also apply to complex websites that aren't applications, and to applications that aren't on the web."},{"Title":"Making the Web Work: Designing Effective Web Applications","review":"A well-written and coherent overview of the web design process and the specific requirements of web application design.Some of the useful features of this book are- well-selected examples- a description of the product development process- an excellent description (with examples) of how to develop and use &quot;personas&quot;- guidelines for when and how to use specific models of interaction in a product- simple, bullet-pointed summary guidelines for solving interaction and display design problems- case studies at the end which are evaluated using criteria the author has developed throughout the bookI am a designer working in this field and this is the guide I would recommend for exploring and understanding the practice of web-application design."},{"Title":"Making the Web Work: Designing Effective Web Applications","review":"MAKING THE WEB WORKDesigning Effective Web ApplicationsAUTHOR: Bob BaxleyPUBLISHER: New RidersREVIEWED BY: Barbara RhoadesBOOK REVIEW: How many times have we been told HOW to build a web site such as defining the goals of what you want a web site to do? How many books have been written to go through all the steps of putting together a web site?Making the Web Work, Designing Effective Web Applications is another one of those books that describe the steps to building a web site. If you are a beginner in web design, this book will take you through those steps such as: Describing target Users and Product Goals, Prioritizing and Categorizing different aspects of an Interface, Selecting a Motif, and Understanding the Building Blocks of a Web Interface.All in all, there are 14 Chapters to putting together an effective web site with 441 pages of reading. There is no CD included with this book. If you have never had a plan on how to think through putting a site together or are a new designer, this would be a good book to add to your library"},{"Title":"Making the Web Work: Designing Effective Web Applications","review":"An impeccably-organized encyclopedia of web design.If I had to base an entire web design class on a single book this would be the one. Bob Baxley's \\"Making the Web Work\\" is easily the most comprehensive manual for applying good design to create a great user experience on the web. This book has both breadth and depth-just look at the table of contents. Regardless of your level of web design proficiency you will find more than your money's worth of useful insight here (even if you have already read just about every other web design book!).One thing I especially like about this book is that Bob doesn't provide a single solution for a design challenge, but takes time to present and evaluate (pro/con and why) several alternatives. He doesn't just feed you the \\"right\\" answers the way Jakob Nielsen does in his \\"Designing Web Usability.\\" Bob's approach will help you gain a thorough understanding of the options and make informed design decisions.The two case studies of Amazon and Ofoto included at the end of the book are the most comprehensive I have seen: they're about 30 pages each!About the only gripe I have is that Bob takes the liberty of using lesser known versions of some terms without providing their more known synonyms. For example, while Lou Rosenfeld and Peter Morville have all but established the terms \\"ambiguous\\" and \\"exact\\" for the two types of classification schemes, Bob prefers to call them \\"subjective\\" and \\"objective,\\" respectively, without providing the alternative terms. Similarly, \\"organization scheme\\" is replaced by \\"classification scheme\\", and \\"organization structure\\" with \\"model of association.\\" My IA students have enough difficulty keeping one set of terms straight!Overall, however, this one serious web design book. Highly recommended. Other books I liked: \\"Interface Design for Ecommerce Applications\\" by Paul Gokin (search for this one on the web), \\"Designing Web Site Interface Elements\\" by Eric Eaton, and \\"Submit Now: Designing Persuasive Websites\\" by Andrew Chak."},{"Title":"Making the Web Work: Designing Effective Web Applications","review":"Have you noticed how some web sites are warm, inviting, and easy to use, but using other sites can be a difficult and even frustrating experience? The difference lies in their design, the topic of Bob Baxley's seminal, well-researched book Making the Web Work: Designing Effective Web Applications.Good design is not a hit-or-miss issue. Mr. Baxley provides a comprehensive, in-depth framework for exploring the nine dimensions of web application design space: the Conceptual Model, the Structural Model, the Organizational Model, Viewing and Navigation, Editing and Manipulation, User Assistance, Layout, Style, and Text. Each layer is presented in an easy-to-understand manner, always from the point of view of what \\"works\\" for the user. Mr. Baxley uses examples taken directly from the web to illustrate his points: I found myself returning to some of my favorite sites to see how the designers handled issues ranging from their choice of conceptual model (magazine-style catalogs versus reference-style catalogs) to navigation choices to layout alignment.This book is much more than just a book on usability, layout, graphics or web page controls. It is rather a comprehensive approach to web application design, thoughtfully and humorously argued, and interspersed throughout with tips and techniques for the would-be designer. Although it would be a great text for a course on advanced web design, it will become a well-thumbed and indispensable addition to every web developer's library."},{"Title":"Making the Web Work: Designing Effective Web Applications","review":"Despite the ubiquity of the internet, the art and craft of designing web applications - defined by the author as a web site that stores and manipulates data unique to each of its users (for example online stores and sites offering financial or other on-line services) - is an evolving field. MAKING THE WEB WORK offers a thorough methodology for anybody tackling such a task, be that the actual designer of a web application, or the product managers and engineers working with (and sometimes without) the designer. Even experienced web application designers will find food for thought."},{"Title":"Making the Web Work: Designing Effective Web Applications","review":"This book is tattered from referencing it and has many passages underlined. Unlike some usability books it is organized in a manner that moves you through the design problem space. It begins with setting definitions and examining the possible forces behind these projects. Then Baxley dives into the meat of the design process through a 3 layered approach. He covers all the bases - from the user point of view to navigation, Help systems, forms, layout and shows how it alI fits into the models within the layers. It is well written, making points clear without repetitive passages. I would recommend this book for beginners and old hands. It is a great book, written following the usability rules he is propounding."},{"Title":"Making the Web Work: Designing Effective Web Applications","review":"As a veteran user interface design practitioner and university instructor, I found Bob Baxley's book &quot;Making the Web Work&quot; a valuable addition to my personal reference library, and a practical resource tool for Web design courses.He organizes the book around the elements of user interface design, which is structure, behavior, and presentation. Simultaneously, Bob leads the reader from conceptually organizing a Web-based user interface to interactive and layout issues. The numerous real-world examples within the book effectively illustrate the described design approaches and techniques, and many are applicable beyond the scope of Web-based user interfaces.Overall the book is a very readable and comprehensive look at how to design better Web-based applications."},{"Title":"Making the Web Work: Designing Effective Web Applications","review":"The back cover of the book states: &quot;Most people involved in the design and specifications of Web applications, whether they're visual designers, engineers, or product marketers do not have a method for understanding or prioritizing design issues.&quot; I agree - however, I would add that those of us who are involved in usability testing / user research should also be added to the list. As a consultant working in the field of user research, I give my clients this book - the main reason being that it gives us a common vocabulary and way to think about how to conduct usability testing or user research at any stage of the Web development process. While not written to do so, the book actually provides a &quot;template&quot; for what needs to be tested / researched at each stage. This type of organized thinking can only help those of us in the trenches provide meaningful feedback.

In particular, the chapters on conceptual, structural, and organizational models will benefit anyone who is embarking on designing a Web application.If you're new to Web application design, &quot;Making the Web Work&quot; is a great introduction to the field; if you're already an experienced designer, you'll find yourself referring to this book again and again for practical suggestions and reminders of what it takes to provide your users with a satisfying and effective Web experience."},{"Title":"Making the Web Work: Designing Effective Web Applications","review":"Mr. Baxley has an insightful perspective illustrated in his \\"Universal Model of a User Interface.\\" He simplifies the process of moving from conceptual to concrete interface design by deconstructing applications into two separate layers. The top layer contains the structure, behavior & presentation & the bottom layer contains more granular aspects of the top three. By explaining the key factors in designing each of these layers he makes it easier to understand & integrate all the aspects critical to interface design. If you don't have time to read Rosenfeld & Morville's Information Architecture, be sure to read this book as he covers a lot of key IA issues too, though he prefers to call it the \\"organizational model\\" behind an application."},{"Title":"Making the Web Work: Designing Effective Web Applications","review":"There are many rules to follow as you start the construction of a web page. However, they are still only a starting point, as much of what makes a web page work is in the realm of art appreciation. Both areas are covered in this book, as Baxley deconstructs the organization of web sites. He splits them into three main components: structure, behavior and presentation.The structure section is split into three subsections:* The conceptual model.* The structural model.* The organizational model.The behavior section is split into three subsections:* Viewing and navigation.* Editing and manipulation.* User assistance.The presentation section is split into three subsections:* Layout.* Style.* Text.The explanations of these principles are illustrated with examples of both the good and bad, which is necessary to get the point across. Each of the actions that you must allow the user to perform are covered, with solid pointers as to how to present them in a manner where all possible courses are clear to the user. Viewers of web sites show very little patience as they browse, and in this environment, subtle differences become magnified. Those differences that make a difference are described, as well as how they all relate to each other to make up the total experience delivered by a site.The design of web sites is still as much an art as an area of engineering, so while there are rules, they are only starting points rather than end points. Baxley shows you where to start and some of the main ideas of the possible branches to follow as you build a site. Web design is an area of art, where nontraditional approaches can generate new paradigms, and Baxley treats it like that."},{"Title":"Making the Web Work: Designing Effective Web Applications","review":"Excellent resource for Web professionals (both beginners and seasoned).The book takes you step by step on a very structured, methodical, consistent and yet very engaging exploration of what it takes to create a great user experience on the Web.Author strikes the right balance between outlining the general principles and providing concrete practical recipies.

But counting for nearly the entire population of Iran and 60 percent of Iraq's, the Shi'i have a crucial influence on Middle East and world affairs from their numbers in these strategically important countries. A professor of Islamic and Iranian history at the U. of Texas-Austin, Aghaie gives a view of Shi'i culture in Iran that is eye-opening and germane for Western readers. Basically, one sees that for the Shi'i there is no clear, or even worthwhile, distinction between religion and other aspects of society, including most significantly government. Whereas such a distinction is a part of the foundation of the U. S. and other democracies, Shi'i culture was founded with the defeat of the Prophet Mohammad's grandson Hoseyn and the massacre of his family by the caliph Yazidin in the 680AD battle of Karbala. Shi'i religious ceremonies, motives for behavior, social purposes, and community goals grew out of this defeat. A special intensity and commitment, as well as sacrifice, was called for so Islam as expressed by Mohammad and his descendants would not be lost. This branch of Islam faith is distinguished from that reflected in the institutional rule of the caliphs came about throughout most of the Middle East. Aghaie's subject is the relationship between Iranian leaders from the Qajars of the 19th and early 20th century through the Shah of Iran to today's Islamic Republic and the symbols and rituals of Shiism. The Shah of Iran was overturned in a revolution because in an effort to modernize Iran, he sought to minimize the symbols and rituals. The work brings an insight into the Shi'i culture that is timely and germane considering current events in Iran and Iraq and U. S. ambitions to institute democracy in this area."},{"Title":"The Martyrs of Karbala: Shi'i Symbols and Rituals in Modern Iran","review":"Professor Aghaie is my professor at The University of Texas at Austin and he's amazing! His book depicts eye-opening facts about the battle and is just as good as his teaching!"},{"Title":"The Martyrs of Karbala: Shi'i Symbols and Rituals in Modern Iran","review":"This book is the premiere comprehensive analysis of how the battlefield death of the Shiite's third Imam Hoseyn/Hussain at Karbala, Iraq, led to the development of Shiite religious rituals that were used by the Shiite imams in influencing their successful dethronment of Iran's Mohammed Reza Shah in late 1978. This book is really about the historical development of Shiite symbols and rituals commemorating the martyrdom of Hoseyn, rather than an expansive history of the 1970s-era of student demonstrations against the shah of Iran. The battle resulting in Hoseyn's martyrdom occurred on 10 October 680 C.E. (Ahsura Moharram 352 A.H.). The author presented two reasons as to why Hoseyn started his ride towards his martyrdom. The author clearly opined that Hoseyn rode towards Damascus to at least upbraid the new Muslim caliph Yazid for being cruel and despotic to his Muslim minions. [Yazid's father, Muawiyah had moved the Muslim government from Mecca to Damascus in 661-662.] This makes Hoseyn's adventure look really unselfish, and even highly moralistic. However, what is obliquely mentioned in the book (on pages 7 and 93), but not as clearly portrayed, is the contention that Hoseyn really rode forth in an armed coup attempt to unseat Yazid. Briefly, when the Muslim prophet Mohammad died, his successors were: (#1) caliph Bakr (Sunni), (#2) caliph Umar/Omar (Sunni), (#3) caliph Uthman/Othman (Sunni), and (#4) caliph Ali (while all Sunni respect Ali has the fourth caliph, as the Shiites regard Ali as the first proper successor to his uncle Mohammad, Ali is the first Shiite imam). As Ali attempted to consolidate his rule, he was opposed by the military-governor of Damascus: General Muawiyah/Moaviyeh (who had been appointed governor of Syria by #2 Sunni caliph Umar in 640). Following the Battle of Saffin, Ali defaulted rule to Moaviyeh, but with the alleged understanding/treaty/deal/agreement that upon Moaviyeh's death, the Islamic caliphcy would return to Ali's clan. Ali's oldest son Hassan/Hasan (the second Shiite imam) was championed by Ali's clan in becoming his successor. However, after realizing that the three previous caliphs had been assassinated while serving as caliph, Hassan apparently wasn't as divinely inspired as his predecessors had been, and decided that he really didn't want to be caliph. Thus, Hassan figuratively resigned and passed the Shiite-caliph baton to his younger brother: Hoseyn/Hussain/Husayn. Recognizing the weakness in Ali, power-hungry Muawiyah of Damascus agreed to become the ruling caliph. Muawiyah, most likely, had the hidden design of eventually turning the caliphcy over to his son Yazid, instead of returning it to the Ali lineage to Ali's grandson Hoseyn. Anyway, upon Muawiyah's death, his son Yazid seized the title of the caliphcy over all Muslims -- and ignored the 'agreement' to return power to Hoseyn. For power is what we are really talking about here; power to control the tax-treasury of the Muslim community. Muslims are required to pay 10% of their annual wealth by an annual tax to the Muslim treasury. Literally watching the coinage of the Muslim treasury slip through their fingers to Yazid, Hoseyn's clan took umbrage with Yazid's seizure of power and urged Hoseyn to travel to Damascus and remind Yazid of his father's 'deal' that Hoseyn was to be recognized as the next rightful caliph. However, as Yazid had no desire of turning the tax-treasury over to Hoseyn, Yazid sent a large army under the command of general Omar ibn Saad to repulse Hoseyn's upcoming 'invasion' of Damascus. When Hoseyn tried to parley with Omar at Karbala, he and most of his small retinue of 80 soldiers were surrounded and killed. While Hoseyn's youngest son Ali Asghar was killed, his older son Zayn al-Abedin (who was ill and incapacitated during the battle), Hoseyn's wife, and a number of other newly minted widows and orphaned children where captured and taken to Yazid. As radio personality Paul Harvey would say: \\"Now you know the rest of the story\\" -- and a very important part of it. Part of Hoseyn's motive in talking to Yazid to resign as caliph was most likely due his being repulsed by Yazid's highhandedness, but the clear motive was to restore and secure power for Hoseyn-Ali's lineage in controlling the caliphcy to control the Muslim treasury. This is my one little snit here that I believe the author \\"short changed\\" the coup explanation for Hoseyn's journey. Otherwise, Prof. Aghaie superlatively analyzed how the Karbala battle was ritualized into annual public performances (rowzeh khanis) and parades (dasteh) that were later used as rallying demonstrations for the Shiite imams to reassert their political power that the Pahlvai shahs had tried to curtail through their liberal Westoxification of Iran. Also, see the author's related book: \\"The Women of Karbala: Ritual Performance and Symbolic Discourses in Modern Shi'i Islam.\\""},{"Title":"Exceptions to Silence: A Trial Lawyer's Confessions","review":"Just an FYI - this does not give a \\"scholary\\" account of a real lawyers confessions, but if you are a white male from the south then you will probably enjoy it - sorry for the pun on stereotypes, but likewise this book is full of them... sort of misogynistic too.."},{"Title":"Exceptions to Silence: A Trial Lawyer's Confessions","review":"This book is a self-published memoir penned by Charles L. Parks, a retired Alabama attorney who came from humble beginnings and made quite a success of his life. The book is well written and has a conversational style that made me imagine I was on a big southern veranda in a rocking chair sipping mint juleps (or shots of tequila in my case) while listening to Parks' fascinating stories.This book covers Parks' experiences growing up in Anniston in the 40s and 50s, attending college and law school from 1959 - 1967 at American University, working for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee under Sen. William Fullbright, and summaries of some of his interesting legal experiences as a trial lawyer. Parks met, worked with, and has stories about several notable persons, including then Senator John F. Kennedy, and Bill Clinton, a co-worker with Parks on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee staff from 1966 - 1967.Parks holds forth on the unquestioned legal power of county Child Services bureaucraries in child welfare and sexual assault cases. Parks tells it like it is concerning his representation of several \\"guilty as hell\\" people - something I imagine many attorneys would like to shout to the world - and ends his book with a passionate plea for renewed ethical standards in the legal profession and court system.I think you will enjoy Parks' easygoing style and the amusing (and sometime scary) parade of characters - wild young bachelors, spoiled trust fund felons, racist white trash murderers, assorted connivers, and eccentric poor folks, who had the luck to know Parks or have the benefit of his services."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"Not one of Spark's best books. I love just about all of his others, but this one seemed much more shallow. I thought the plot was good, but I can never understand Lexie's reactions. It seems like she overreacts to everything, which makes her hard to realate to. I don't know...its a good book, read it if you love Sparks. But if its your first of his books...then I would read The Rescue, and A Bend In the Road, and The Guardian first."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"This is a love story, plain and simple and at times, a little too slow-moving and predictable for this reader. However, that said, \\"True Believer\\" can be an entertaining story for someone who just wants to relax and read and not be stressed by too much action, adventure or mystery. The story itself centers on small town life and legends and the people that make them. After reading \\"The Guardian,\\" I was somewhat disappointed by this Nicholas Sparks' work. I won't give up on him, however, because I know the talent behind the pen!"},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"After reading a number of his books, I know what I will get from a Sparks book. I know he will disparage anybody living near a town of more than 100,000 people, big-city people are shallow and self-absorbed in his world. Sparks' world is North Carolina and everyplace else beyond that is filler.You accept that, otherwise you don't have to read his books. And usually Sparks will temper the sappiness via something in the plot. You are not looking for real sanity or plausibility in a Sparks book, jsu some touches of credibility.But not in this book. Besides it being more sappy than any other book of his (why Jeremy loses his first wife), it seems Sparks does not like any of his characters. Plus the whole main story (what causes the lights) is given a half-baked treatment.By the end of the book I was hoping Rodney (the dim-witted police officer) takes his shotgun and shoots up the town."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"Last week, I was about midway through True Believer and popped in to check out a few reviews. At that time, the book was two stars or so in my mind. As it turns out, it couldn't even hang on to that second star....this is truly worthy of only one. Lexie's character is completely obnoxious and selfish in the latter third of the book, and her maturity level toward relationships struck me as somewhat juvenile. I didn't feel that she was so thoroughly \\"scarred\\" by her former relationships as the book tried to imply.Furthermore...my gripe about the way men and women's feelings in relationships are displayed. One section implied men aren't hurt by failed relationships the way women are. Additionally, Doris the grandmother tells Jeremy something to the extent that \\"women love a man who will give up everything for them knowing they may be hurt\\"Yes, love requires sacrifices in some cases....but it shouldn't be the goal or main attraction of that love.Cheesy, contrived, drivel, flat. Sorry...those words all describe True Believer perfectly."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"As a Nicholas Sparks fan, I expected this book to be a page-turner similar to The Notebook. But I found it to be a great cure for my insomnia as often I'd read through two paragraphs and be soundly asleep! The character development is poor, at best. You barely grasp the personality of the main character until the very end of the book. Much time is spent describing the inner 'thoughts' of the characters, but very little time is spent on what they're actually doing. Hence, the plot moves slowly. The storyline has good bones, however. If you must read it, skim the first couple chapters and then skip to the last third of the book.

The story in itself was ok, but tended to drag some. AND I hated the \\"explination\\" for the lights. With all the magic of words at his finger tips and he chose to use logic rather than magic.In a world with too much reality.. I was expecting some Far reaching belief to come into play.. so this really left me wanting."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"I'm only on Chapter 5, but I'm having a hard time getting into the storyline. I realize this is a \\"prerequiste\\" to First Sight, so, hopefully I can trudge through it. I've read 5 or 6 of his books and throughly enjoyed all of them, but so far, this one's not cutting it."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"Wow, I am really surprised at a lot of the negative reviews this book got. Much more, surprised that a lot of readers don't enjoy Spark's writing. Someone even said they enjoyed the MOVIES better?! I tell you, I read a LOT, and also am a huge movie addict and off the top of my head can't think of more than one or two movies that I liked better than the book. Anyway.....I am not afraid to say that in addition to reading many other authors and genere's novels, that I am always a sucker for a Sparks book. Maybe it's just because I can sit down and forget about all my problems or stress and just get lost in the story and characters.Ok, now on for my thoughts specific to this book. As always, I enjoyed the character development and the story. I actually really liked the story line because it was different than what Sparks has written before. Mainly because it focused a lot on Jeremy's job (as a journalist/ghost hunter) and there was a little bit of mystery involved. I suppose it is reminscent of Message in a Bottle, but in that case I felt like the love story was way more prominent. As for the characters, I didn't have a hard time accepting their attraction. Perhaps it is in part because often when I read I'm not a reader who asks a lot of questions- I sort of take things as they are and enjoy the story. Afterwards I might do a bit of thinking, but I guess I either like the book or I don't and I don't usually look for the authors to \\"convince\\" me of anything in their story. It's face value for me.I suppose that True Believer is not my favorite Sparks book, but I wasn't disappointed either. As always, he provided a fun, easy read. I guess if that's not what you're looking for, he might not be for you."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"This book was just okay. It is my second Nicholas Sparks book, and I am trying to figure out why he is so loved. Both the books I have read, \\"A Bend in the Road\\" and now \\"True Believer\\" were just okay. Both of these books seemed to follow the formula of boy and girl meet, boy and girl fall in love after some apprehension by one of them, boy and girl encounter snag in relationship, boy and girl work everything out in the end. Also, am I the only one that feels these are so unbelievably cheesy that they just want to gag?? The last line of \\"True Believer\\" almost had me lose my dinner it was so disgustingly cheese-ball."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"I usually love Nicholas Sparks' books but this one seemed to drag on and on.

Jeremy Marsh the main character in both books is the ideal man all women would love to have love them, the way he loved Lexie. The supernatural or unexplained happenings are an added bonus, but you don't really get the full impact of that part until you read \\"At First Sight.

Read both books, this one first, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"My first Sparks book was \\"Three Weeks With My Brother\\" and after that I was hooked he a great author and this book just proves it.

I am a man and I loved it."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"This was not my favorite Nicholas Sparks book, but it is a good read. It was a little harder to get reading. It was interesting to find out where the lights in the cemetary actually came from. Most books I cry before the end every gets there, but this one the tears were saved until the end. His next book, At First Sight, is a sequel to this book.

His journey to a small town to write about its ghostly lights brings him in touch with one Lexie, lacking in love and a future until Jeremy arrives in town: their relationship will bring both changes and challenges, inviting Jeremy to leave his old high-powered life to believe in something very different. Romance and faith come to life in this gripping story.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"As a writer of romantic, suspenseful mysteries myself, I tend to lean toward that genre for my own personal reading pastime pleasure. I latched onto Nicholas Sparks quite a while ago and I fell in love with his style, especially after reading Message in A Bottle and The Notebook. Those two, in my estimation, were his best ever books! True Believer was enchanting, as well, and it kept my interest throughout the story. I am continually amazed at his insight into the female psyche. Whoever his muse is, may he never lose her! You already know what the story is about by reading the other reviews here, so I won't duplicate it and bore you. It's a fabulous story and I was pulling for both Lexie and Jeremy to hook up at the end. You'll have to read the book to find out if they did. My only complaint is at the end of the book when the author gives us a sneak peek at the first part of his next novel, Dear John. The first word in the Prologue was supposed to be What...not That, but then, I'm a stickler for spelling and typos, and I'm my own worst critic. We all have them...even the greats like Sparks. True Believer was everything I hoped it would be. Good job, Nicholas!Joyce Marie Taylor-Author and Poet"},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"I have loved every single book Nicholas Sparks has written except for Message in a Bottle and now True Believer.

If I do, I will look for a used copy."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"this book was kind of slow going in the beginning, but has a really nice ending. can't wait to read the sequel \\"at first sight\\""},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"The book is sort of slow to start with, but it picks up in time. A lot of it is predictable, but by the end of the book I liked the story enought to buy \\"At First Sight\\", the follow-up. If you're looking for a good airplane book or something to read on the beach, look no farther. If you want a truely compelling story, why are you considering Nicholas Sparks anyway?"},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"This book brings out the best of romance, Sparks really knows how to make you care for the people he writes, and brings North Carolina to life for those that have not been lucky enough to have been born there."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"I don't know what to say about this book...Something was not quite right with the storyline...OK so, they meet and fall in love. I guess the hardest part of this story is the ending and how Jeremy decides to stay in NC with Lexie in the end...I feel like it was a huge sacrifice for him...The book also does not paint New Yorkers or Southerners in a positive light. Its very strange. I'm not sure what else is off with this book, but it is definitely not the best Nicholas Sparks book I have read."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"It was an okay book. It spanned a short time period. It wasn't very interesting and the romance wasn't nearly as intense as it was in \\"the notebook\\", \\"the wedding\\", and \\"message in a bottle.\\" That's what I love about Sparks though. I love to feel the passion and the intense romance in his writing. I didn't feel that here. I felt it dragged a little. I wish the lights had involved the lighthouse and not what the true answer was. I didn't like the ending too much. It was okay, but too cliche. I could have done without what Lexie said in the end. I felt like it wasn't necessary.thank you for your timeand feel free to comment my review,Loran"},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"Bits of interesting trivia scattered throughout this novel only add to the great work you've come to expect from Nicholas Sparks."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"I've read quite a few of Nicholas Sparks' books.

Kinda felt lukewarm....just like any other romance novel."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"Enjoyed this book, there were a few slow parts, but were made up for in later chapters. I spent summers on the Outer Banks as a kid and his descriptions of that area bring back many memories for me. I can almost smell the salt air!"},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"Nicholas Sparks has done it yet again. This book captured all the aspects that make Sparks' books amazing: good plot, characters, settings, and of course love. You never know whats going to happen next, and you definitely won't believe the ending! I can't wait for \\"At First Sight\\" to come out on October 18! It's the sequel to \\"True Believer,\\" so if you haven't read this one yet, get to it!"},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"okay, for the people reading these reviews, dont pay any attention to most of the other ones, htey have the story all wrong. True Believer is the story of a scientific-journalist named Jeremy Marsh who investigates a ghost story in Boone Creek, NC. There, he meets the librarian Lexie Darnell, the town psychics granddaughter. Her parents died when she was younger [and to one of the other reviewers she was able to guess the sex of babies.. nothing else really]. Jeremy and Lexie begin to fall for eachother but Lexie pulls back because she knows it wont work out, Jeremy insists that they can make it work. It's an adorable story. If you're looking for a mystery its only about 30% of the story and those of you who know Nicholas Sparks writes love stories. It was adorable and the ending was so cute. If you like Nicholas Sparks books than you will definitely like this one."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"I have seen a couple of Spark's book-adapted movies and loved them, so i thought i would take a chance on his writing. I felt no connection to his characters, the plot was slow, and i was very disappointed. The book wasn't worth the time it took to read. Sorry, nicholas. Maybe, hopefully, his other stuff is better."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"In true Nicholas Sparks fashion, he paints the picture so vividly you feel like you are right there in the story. Very good and enjoyable reading. I could not put it down."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"*Warning: Semi-spoilerish*As others have pointed out, one of the greatest flaws this two-book saga is the lack of chemistry between Jeremy and Lexie. In The Notebook and Message in a Bottle, you had two couples whose angst is so palpable, so real that you felt ensnared by the story from the moment you opened the book. Sparks tried to do the same thing here, setting up an \\"unlikely\\" pairing between a big-city journalist and small-town librarian. The problem was, there was nothing unpredictable here.Perhaps if Sparks had packaged their \\"love at first sight\\" story a little better, it would have been easier to swallow. However, as you plow through the book (and continue to the sequel, At First Sight), it's tough to buy a genuine connection between them with all the dishonesty (especially on Lexie's part). Without giving anything away, I really was disenchanted with Lexie's character after reading both books, and I got to the point where I wondered what sort of lie or secret Jeremy would uncover about her next.I did enjoy some of the small town characters, though there was nothing particularly innovative about his \\"North vs. South\\" approach to Jeremy's experience in North Carolina. Then again, there was nothing particularly innovative about the relationship between Jeremy and Lexie and, as I pointed out in my review for At First Sight, I was left wondering how the same author could have created such dynamic, engrossing love stories as The Notebook and Message in a Bottle. Those novels were in a completely different league than this disappointing release from Sparks.I give the book two stars instead of one because I enjoyed the characters of Doris, Rachel, Jed, and the mayor. I also ended up feeling rather sorry for Rodney, whom Lexie seemed to lead on (intentionally or not). Sadly, these secondary and tertiary characters were better developed than the protagonists of the novel, whose characters I never quite connected with despite the 600+ pages devoted to them in this series.If you want to see the best of what Nicholas Sparks has to offer, read The Notebook or Message in a Bottle."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"I saw two of the films based on Nicholas Sparks books (The Notebook and A Walk to Remember) and was emotionally manipulated (aka touched) by both. As such, I was curious to see whether Sparks was as effective in print as in the films. In this book at least, he definitely isn't.Jeremy Marsh is a science journalist from New York City out to debunk a ghost story in a small North Carolina town. While there, he meets the beautiful, strong-willed librarian. Guy meets girl. Guy kind of loses girl. Guy gets girl. Guy kind of loses girl again. Guy gets girl...and learns to have a little faith. In the course of this, we see the love interest's hair blowing in the wind a fair amount (the two leads each play with their hair quite a bit; that may be what ultimately draws them together), and we meet characters like Jeremy's agent, who repeatedly says things like, \\"Am I right or am I right? Of course, I'm right.\\"I only continued listening to the audio version because I was curious to see how the ghost mystery was resolved (not too exciting) and exactly how the love story played out (not too exciting). If I were trying out Sparks again (not in the immediate future), I'd go to one of the favorites, like Message in a Bottle or The Notebook. For the moment, I think I need some Toni Morrison.The audiobook isn't bad, except that the town mayor's voice sounds just like Ned Flanders from The Simpsons, and the love interest - when she's angry - sounds just like Dustin Hoffman's female alter-ego in Tootsie (which takes a bit of the romantic flair out of it)."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"I was given this book as a gift for my birthday. I have all his books, so I'd have it regardless of how I enjoyed it. It was so... well, I think he's written this book before. It's just okay. I don't recommend this book for those who want to try Nicholas Sparks for the first time. I recommend borrowing the book before buying it."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"I am a HUGE Sparks fan and can usually devour one of his novels in a day. It took me a few days (on vacation even!) to get through this one. It was boring, short on the romance and was actually a chore to get through. Since I'm familiar with all of his other work, I trudged on but c'mon Chapter 20 before it even got cracking?? I almost adopted the \\"50 page rule\\" and put it down but I'm far to anal to not finish a book. Let's hope his next one is more up to par..."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"As much as I hate to say it, I was really disappointed by this one. I am a huge fan of Nicholas Sparks and have read all of his books. This one was really kind of boring.

But I was really disappointed with this one. I usually whip through his books in a weekend (The Guardian was read in a day because it was such a page turner), but I really had to keep dragging myself back to this book. The characters lacked chemistry and I just didn't feel anything for them. The plot was anti-climatic, just a disappointing book in general. Hopefully his next book will be back on track."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"I loved this book. It was a real page turner. I cannot wait to read the sequal"},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"Jeremy Marsh is a famous magazine writer, well-known for his recent appearances on television. He gets a letter regarding a legendary haunted cemetery in Boone Creek, North Carolina. Jeremy is determined to go down there, debunk the mystery of the lights that appear at the cemetery on foggy nights and go home to New York. However as he commences his research at the Town Library, he encounters Lexie Darnell, the Librarian. Jeremy is intrigued and flustered by her beauty and intelligence. Jeremy quite readily reveals his feelings. Initially in their brief romance, Lexie does too. However by the end of the week, Jeremy is torn by her abrupt decision and heads home. Lexie's grandmother has a few things to say before it's all over between them. Most of the Boone Creek residents are written as one-sided cardboard figures; Deputy Rodney Hopper who has an blatant crush on Lexie, and immaturely takes to calling Jeremy \\"city boy\\", Jed the hotel owner, Pete Gherkin the mayor, Rachel at Herbs diner, and Tully at the gas station. Doris, Lexie's grandmother is the most interesting secondary character when she is in the picture. A predictable romance where the reader knows what will happen before the words are written."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"I am new to Nicholas Sparks. I wanted to give Message in a Bottle a whirl first, for I've heard that it is wonderful and emotionally moving, but I decided to give his latest and, as said by several of his devoted readers, less than impressive works first. I've decided to read the mediocre stuff by new authors (new to me, at least) before reading their best books because that way it won't feel as though I am reading the descending quality of said author's work. Having said that, I thought True Believer isn't as bad as the reviewers have made it out to be. Then again, I haven't read Sparks's earlier stuff. This novel has a wonderful mixture of gothic, paranormal and romance. It tells the story of a thirty-something New York science journalist and the trials he goes through when he falls in love with a small town young woman while he investigates ghost activity in a cemetery. Jeremy and Lexie fight against all odds, which includes the schemes of a local deputy who has a fancy for Lexie, and what transpires is a wonderful and moving love story that kept me enthralled from beginning to end.I was impressed with this novel and with Nicholas Sparks's writing and I so look forward to reading more of his work. I like the paranormal backdrop in this novel. I also like the glaring differences between big city and small town people, and how said differences can come between two people in love. Jeremy is a great protagonist and I enjoyed Lexie and the secondary characters as well. The writing style is very lighthearted and moving, not unlike a well-written romance novel by a woman. It left me with a good feeling and the desire to read At First Sight, which I think is a spin-off or sequel to this one. I also look forward to reading his earlier works, which I've heard have poignant language that pull at the heart strings. All in all, I enjoyed this novel and I look forward to reading Sparks's \\"better efforts\\" in the not-so-distant future."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"This book kept me up for hours after I intended to go to bed, and as always, it took me no more than 5 reading days to finish the book, but I found the book to be a little too predictable in comparison to other of Sparks' books. The end does leave you wanting to read the next (\\"At First Sight\\"). Overall, I definitely recommend this book, but expect more from his other books."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"True Believer is yet another wonderful book written by Nicholas Sparks. In the novel, the relationship between Lexie and Jeremy grows and develops into something beautiful. The plot becomes more interesting and Nicholas Sparks creates situations that are unexpected. This books keeps you guessing until the very end.I truly enjoyed this novel. I have read all of the books by Nicholas Sparks and this one is in my top half. I loved to see the relationship between Lexie and Jeremy grow, and to see how they deal with real life situations that occur to many couples. Once again, the emotions that I felt were overwhelming and wonderful: from happiness to sadness Nicholas Sparks had it all. I truly recommend this book to anyone in need of a wonderful story between a man and a woman."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"I actually listened to this book on tape. I was reluctant at first because I thought it was going to be purely a sappy romance novel. I was pleasantly surprised that it had a \\"haunting\\" mystery tied into it. However, the mystery was a template for a budding romance and was not the book's focus, which was somewhat disappointing. I still found it to be entertaining, enough so that I pre-ordered the sequel \\"At First Sight\\" just to see what happens. DO NOT read the blub for the sequel unless you've read \\"True Believer\\". It'll ruin any mystery and any what ifs."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"I am a huge Nicolas Sparks fan and I have to be honest that I wasn't too impressed with this one. Don't worry, I have't lost hope in this true romanitic author, but sorry, this one just didn't hold up to my expectations!"},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"Easy read and very entertaining. Kept me wanting more, enjoyable from cover to cover. Read it in less than a week, perfect book to grab and take to the beach!"},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"True Believer was a quick read for me. The entire story covers a time span of two weeks, thus, the pace was fast and never dull. Sparks has taken on a different type of love story--this one involves ghosts. Journalist Jeremy Marsh has taken on the task of clearing up the mystery of ghostly apparitions that appear in a cemetary in Boone Creek, NC. For Jeremy unravelling the cause of the reported mysterious lights should be a piece of cake. However, falling in love with Lexie Darnell, the granddaughter of Boone Creek's respected psychic, wasn't on his agenda. Will love change Jeremy's heart and will he become a true believer? Anxious to find out what happens with Jeremy and Lexie was more important to me than finding out if the mysterious lights were supernatural appearances or a huge hoax."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"I began reading and could not stop until I finished... in only a few hours. It's an excellent read, as are all of Sparks books. I found another one on the shelf immediately after- The Wedding- and read it the next day."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"I enjoyed this book!Having said that - I must confess that it didn't have the kind of romantic and deep abiding love story that I've come to expect from his other books. Generally, I can expect a good, heathy cry at least a couple of times during the read. I didn't get that this time.The book is about a writer who is famous for dis-proving the reality of ghosts and mindreaders and such - and reports his findings on television...etc. He goes to a small North Carolina (what else) town to prove that their \\"cemetary ghosts\\" aren't real and falls in love with the beautiful local librarian. I guess part of the dis-connect is the somewhat lack of chemistry I feel between the two lead characters. I actually felt more chemistry between him (Jeremy) and her grandmother! I'm hoping this changes in the sequel. I'm such a big Sparks fan (having read every single book he's written) that I want to love all of his works."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"\\"True Believer\\" is a nice love story that's plain just a good read!!!"},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"I kept reading this book in hopes that something unexpected, or really exciting, was going to happen. Well, it didn't. I did finish it, but it is so predictable. I gave it 3 stars because there was just enough interest to keep me going, but I was glad someone else had bought it and given it to me, as I would have felt like I wasted my money on it."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"Make sure you read these books in order, True believer then At First Sight, goos thing I read the book summaries as I had purchased them in reverse order, but did read them in the correct order. Great writing and wonderful story. Can't wait to finish At First Sight, half way thru it."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"In a small town, North Carolina, doesn't shock me anymore. The story plot is the same as most of his books, boy falls in love with girl, girl shy away from boy, boy woo the girl, girl kiss the boy, boy and girl go away, boy and girl sad, boy and girl get back together again, forever and always, the end. And the only reason why I continue reading it because I was curious about the mysterious lights that happens in the town's cemetery. Now I'm not saying I didn't enjoy this book but after reading so many of his other books, I'm starting to know what is going to happen in the end but always hope that somehow it might be different. I do enjoy a good love story, I'm going to read the next installment of this book. If your like me, I set goals in reading all of the author's books, and Nicholas Sparks is one of them. He does write a good love story but this isn't his best. They better skip on making a movie out of this one. I do recommend people to read this book if you don't have high expectations for this book to be any different."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"This is a great novel. It has suspense, drama , comedy ,romance , and some disappointments .Jeremy Marsh is a smart,sweet, likable guy.I especially liked the location ,as I'm from North Carolina and can relate to the beauty and humor of a small town where every one knows each other . It is amazing how Nicholas Sparks can capture the humor of the small rural community through a New Yorker's eyes without belittling the ways of soft southern small town residents .We don't mind being laughed at as long as its in a good hearted way , It was so riviting and realistic i couldn't find a stopping place, so I read it in a day . I plan on reading it again someday."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"Ghostly lights, people who are psychics, and romance. This was an interesting read, but not quite up to his usual style. Seemed slow in parts. It wasn't an \\"I can't put it down\\" kind of book. Needed some \\"umph\\"."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"This was my first time reading a Nicholas Sparks book. I wanted to pick a book that not EVERYONE had already read and talked about, and that wasn't a movie yet. It seems pretty typical Sparks-style from what I've heard. Sappy, slow, and romantic. It was a good book with a unique story, but not necessarily my cup of tea."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"True Believer is the first book in the Jeremy Marsh series by Nicholas Sparks, and is another great story.Synopsis:Jeremy has just pulled off the story of his career about a conman. Now what will he do next? A letter came to him by a lady named Doris from Boone Creek. She told him about some mysterious lights that take place in their cemetery and would be he comes down to investigate? Jeremy journeys to Boone Creek to start his investigation. He meets the people of the town but there is one special one in particular. Lexie Darnell is the librarian who helps Jeremy with his investigation but can she help him with more. What will the investigation discover about the lights?My Thoughts:Having been a fan for a long time, I found another great book by Nicholas Sparks. I was very much entertained by the author's description of this small town and its characters. I think my favorite character was the mayor of the town Mayor Gurgken who helped ad some humor to the story. The main character in this book includes an interest in science. Science personally is one of my least favorite subjects in school. I was as interested in the investigation but felt the story lagged a little.What makes a story great to you? What flavor does a story need? Do you like romance? What feeling do you need expressed by the author to truly enjoy a book?What I like is a great relaxing story that occasionally provokes some thought. Nicholas Sparks is great at evoking emotion out of his readers.I hope you enjoy Nicholas Sparks as much as I have.

I would say this can go back and forth and this book is a great example of how seeing is not always believing. There are always science to define how something happens but that does not mean something can mean something special for the person viewing the event. A journalist has to investiage some lights that have been reported to be spirits of the one thing or another and while he is there he falls in love with one of the residents and the rest of the story is history to say. Anyone who likes this book needs to read At First Sight right after."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"I love to be able to download books to my IPAD. Nicholas Sparks is my favorite author. The book was easy to follow. I love reading his books because they are written about places very close to my home."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"I rather knew what to expect from other reviews. The first half of the book kept me rather captivated, couldn't wait to get back to it. Even though other reviewers said the story wasn't really about the mysterious lights he went to investigate, it seemed to focus on that, which interested me. I think there was such a build-up of that, but when the source of the lights was revealed, it was handled rather off-handed and disappointing. The love story part wasn't all that good, it was rather juvenile in the dialogue between Jeremy and Lexie. I couldn't stand her at all. Even though this was not some great work of fiction and his other books have been better, I still mostly enjoyed it, for light reading. So that's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 3. One thing I like about the author is that he seems to be able to write from a woman's point of view, which most male authors can't. Too bad I just didn't like the female character at all. And the premise of the male character, whether to leave his life in NY to live in her small town wasn't handled with much depth either. I would think a decision of that magnitude would require a little more thought than the author put into it, a little more mental anguish and conflict. If you are looking for a light read, it would fit the bill. I'm glad I got it from the library and didn't spend money on it."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"Normally, I love Nicholas Sparks' books, but this one is not great.

This is a true love story as are most of his books.

The romance side of the story was utterly predictable, even for the second tier characters and down to who would be the catalyst for resolution be for the leads, but the characters were well drawn enough that this was OK.Having said that, the last chapter was awful - very sentimental and totally unbelievable. It is meant to make you believe in miracles but it is just sappy, really, really sappy!I certainly didn't get the heart thumping I can occasionally get when reading even predictable romance, and I guess that is down to the pace of the writing - it isn't rushed.What made it worthwhile for me were the lovely analogies Sparks draws and the insightful comments on life and relationships which are thrown in, without it feeling like you are being preached at by someone outside of the book - the things the characters say fit who they are and where they are in their lives; which this reader thinks is always good!"},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"i am a huge sparks fam and although this book was good,it was not one of my favorites. if you are a sparks fam, it is a little different but still worth the time and money to read."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"It has everything I could ever want in a book and I've been reading it slowly & purposefully so as not to miss one lovely word of it.Highlights are of course life in a small town, the town librarian, paranormal phenomenon and a love story that take place in a lovely North Carolina seaside setting."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"I've read all of the other Nicholas Sparks books and loved each and every one. But reading his new one, i was thoroughly dissapointed. I got halfway through the book and nothing was really going on. The characters disappointed me and alot of the thoughts and dialogues seemed highly repetative. The ending was absolutely predictable and during the entire book I caught myself cringing with the bad writing. I was hugely dissapointed because this was not what i would expect from Nicholas Sparks.

While it's a great story, there are some moments when you're disappointed.Jeremy Marsh is your typical New York Journalist. He lives in the big apple exposing fraud psychics all over the world. He travels a lot, and writes for a column called \\"Scientific America\\". Jeremy doesn't believe in psychics or miracles, and he makes it clear when he gets a spot on Primetime Live to talk about it.After his appearance on TV, he gets a letter from the small town of Boone Creek North Carolina, talking about ghosts and spirits in the small town cemetary. Jeremy, already sure it isn't real, packs up and heads to Boone Creek.Once Jeremy arrives in the small town, things get too weird for him. First he meets Doris at a cafe. Doris claims she's a psychic who can predict what sex your baby will be, and of course Jeremy doesn't believe her. He has no interest in hearing about Doris's abilities.But he does have an interest in Doris's granddaughter Lexie at the local library. As Jeremy spends time trying to unearth the mystery of the cemetary, he finds himself caring less about the mystery, and more about Lexie.Likewise, Lexie doesn't want to have anything to do with Jeremy, but then she starts thinking of him more and more and more. There's no question about it, they're in love. But Jeremy will soon have to go back to New York, and Lexie already feels lonely enough. Somehow, they'll have to make it work, and that in itself would be a miracle.Nicholas Sparks is known for creating strong characters, and this is no exception. Jeremy is a strong willed character, and Lexie is probably more interesting to learn about than him. The problem of course is that Lexie is your stereotypical lonely girl. She's scared of another relationship because she's had bad experiences in the past.Likewise, Jeremy is your stereotypical workaholic man who can't keep a steady relationship. He's been married once, and because of his journalism, he couldn't keep her.But while the roles are stereotypical, the characters are real at least. They blend and come together in a humanlike way. Sometimes the characters feel a little too real.When it comes to the love story portion, it's got a good sense of humor to keep you going further into the story. It makes it so it isn't boring, and it goes by smoothly.What I really didn't like about the story were some of the blatent cliches. This is what I mean when I say it's perhaps a little too realistic. Jeremy and Lexie have their fight, and it's a lot like watching a husband and wife fight (or for children, watching their parents fight). I began to want Sparks to spare me some of the drama. It didn't help much in keeping the mystery of the story going either.I began to grow enticed by the love story, but I was more interested in how Jeremy solves the mystery. When he DID solve it, I was disappointed. Not only that, but the whole \\"fight\\" left me rolling my eyes.However, as the story comes to an end, it gets better again. While the \\"fight\\" is nothing special, the aftermath of it is. It's tender, tear-jerking, and makes you understand that being a \\"believer\\" has nothing to do with psychics, ghosts and the like. Being a believer has to do with miracles.It's a good book. It has a moment where it begins to go down with all the cliches, but it picks up again and soars. A great book by Nicholas Sparks."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"I always eagerly await a new book by Nicholas Sparks, but was disappointed when I finished True Believer.

Just not as much as most of his others!"},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"I have been fond of Nicholas Sparks books that I have seen made into movies but I had never read a book by him before and I am so glad that I finally did. He writes in a way that keeps you intrested, hopeful, and wanting everything to turn out fine in the end. He does wonderful characters, that are real life type people, with flaws as well as goodness. True Believer made a BELIEVER out of me. Since reading this title I have purchased three more books by Nicholas Sparks and I can't wait to begin listening to them. Thank God for audio books on CD...I haven't enjoyed so many books in my life since I began listening to books on CD."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"Even though the Notebook and The Wedding may have been a little better, this book has all the charm and emotion one would expect from Sparks.

I look forward to reading At First Sight!"},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"I have read all of Nicholas Sparks novels, loving them all, until True Believer....It was a huge dissapointment to me, one of the most boring stories I've ever read and chapter after chapter, I kept WAITING for him to get to the STORY.....I knew much more about Jeremy, his job, etc. than I ever cared to know and so little other than the LIGHTS he was going to go research,the story seemed to end for me there.His love stories are always so wonderful with reading I can hardly put down but this one?? I could hardly stay AWAKE reading it.....I finished it last night, tomorrow it goes to the used book store as I won't even pass it on to my friends, who also are fans of Nicholas Sparks...."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"Well I just finished Nicholas Sparks' True Believer after having it for more than two months. I must say, it is by far one of his greatest works to date. While no one, not even he, can ever out do The Notebook, I loved the small, but poignant love story that his book offered. I laughed, sighed, and cried in all of the right places and enjoyed watching how men think about relationships and women. I loved the dialogue that Jeremy was having seemingly in his head about his interactions and conversations with Lexi. I never thought men thought so deeply into what seemed to be minute menaings behind the details of conversation.It was enjoyable and I can't wait to start At First Sight to see how this wonderful tale of new relationships, finding and keeping true love pans out."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"\\"True Believer\\" is a romantic novel presented in such a way that every chapter or section of a chapter is like a scene from a film... No surprise there, since Nicholas Sparks' books seem to be snapped up by Hollywood at a steady clip. This makes for pleasant reading, as one can visualize the settings, whether they are trendy bars in Manhattan or a sinking cemetery somewhere in North Carolina.Sparks has a way of presenting characters that are recognizable, too. They are distinctive and colorful without being too eccentric. Well, then again, there is that fellow at the gas station, come to think of it--he IS eccentric.The concept of a somewhat cynical but not irredeemable Yankee journalist meeting a bright and wary Carolina girl has just enough of the flint and steel quality to make the sparks fly and the fire smolder. Then there is the matchmaking grandma - well, you have to read it!People who enjoy Sparks' novels will find much to enjoy here, and will not be disappointed with \\"True Believer\\".If you find this review helpful you might want to read some of my other reviews, including those on subjects ranging from biography to architecture, as well as religion and fiction"},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"\\"True Believer\\" by Nicholas Sparks may take place in Boone Creek, NC but such stories take place in many such communities everywhere. Some of us barricade ourselves in endless activity; some of us do it with continual good work for others. Some may do it with scholarly work or 'business'. And there is always someone trying to 'debunk' strongly held beliefs. Getting folks to be up front with deep feelings is not so easy -- so a 'fairy grandmother' or aunt steps in and makes it easier. So many times the choices we make in our lives have 'forever' consequences; and to be led to make the best choice available requires a helping hand. And this book has it all. I really enjoyed it."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"I am normally a huge Sparks fan. However, this book...well, I was disappointed. I didn't buy the love story at all. Nothing made me feel like these two people ever fell in love. It could have been a very touching story and instead it feels very forced."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"A New York reporter visits a small town in North Carolina. He is searching for the truth behind mysterious lights which appear in the graveyard at night. These lights, as a result of their promotion by the major, have recently made the town subject to tourism which upsets many of the locals. During his research, Jeremy meets the eloquent librarian, Lexie, who is the source of the town gossip. As the story progresses, Jeremy and Lexie begin to fall in love; however, Lexie persistantly resists because she knows that Jeremy is leaving back to New York in several days. Furthermore, Jeremy is faced with the conflict of going home to a place where he has grown up or staying with the woman who he thinks he is in love with.This book is another beautiful romance by Nicholas Sparks. Sparks produces a realistic relationship which his readers can relate to by describing subtle body language and occassional awkward moments which nearly everyone has experienced. Additionally, Sparks depicts each character in great detail which allows the reader to fully understand their reasoning behind every action. The style of writing which Sparks utilizes is formal, but simple, creating an easy and enjoyable read. I loved every moment of the book because I can personally relate to many situations and specific moments; Sparks includes moments which a variety of readers are able to relate to. His novel conveys messages which a reader of any age will enjoy."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"Of all his books I found this one very slow and very boring and predictable."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"Although this is not comparable to Nicholas Spark's most memorable works...my favorites \\"The Notebook\\" and \\"The Guardian,\\" it was still a great book and well worth reading. I loved the story that he put together; it was very creative and the characters were believable and memorable!Nicholas Sparks is my favorite author, I only wish he wrote his books faster!"},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"\\"This whole place is beautiful. I can see why you love it here.\\"Instead of responding, Lexie took a long breath, trying to settle her turbulent emotions. \`What are you doing here, Jeremy?\\"What is Jeremy Marsh doing in the small town, Boone Creek, North Carolina? This true New Yorker; young, handsome and charming, was supposed to be researching the mysterious, ghostly cemetery lights. During his stay, he finds himself not only uncovering a simple explanation, but uncovering a deep passion for a pretty local. Although everything is working against him and his feelings towards her, Jeremy Marsh finds himself falling hard for Lexie, who is worried about her already fragile heart.My favorite part in the book was when Jeremy showed up at the lighthouse, which Lexie had taken refuge from him in, and Lexie sees him walking up the shore. She can't believe her eyes. Although she had ran away from him, her heart lit up with sparks when she saw that he had come to find her. This part really shows what Lexie is thinking, even though her actions might have shown something completely different. Also, the setting is described with great detail, making is twice as good.True Believer's main idea is that no matter what the situation is love always finds a way to shine through it. Being from a tiny, secluded town where everyone knows everyone, Lexie doesn't want to leave any of it behind. Especially for this handsome man who would probably end up shattering her heart in the long run.If you have ever lived in a small town, such as Boone Creek, then you should read this book. Nicholas Sparks captures the comfy feeling so well, you'll feel like you're living there, and have known the people who live there for years. To make this book just a tad better, I would drop some of Jeremy's thoughts such as, \\"Oh, I like her so much, but the elements involved make it so impossible...\\" It seems like that mushy stuff goes on forever. Besides that tiny detail, the book was very well written. It gave a good perspective on the entire situation, coming mostly from Jeremy's eyes. I think it gives a better image to the male gender, because it shows Jeremy's good feeling, not that stereotypical \\"Dude, that girl is smokin' hot!\\""},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"I really enjoyed reading this Sparks book. Sure, there was no great tragedy, but it's a nice read when you're not in the mood for a tearjerker.

Finding the truth behind that could be his big break, but Jeremy has discovered something truly magical; the way he feels about Lexie, the grandaughter of the town's psychic. She has a special bond with the lights, a memory about them too beautiful to shatter. Moreover, finding the truth could speed the little burg's demise. Jeremy is caught in a dilema. Will he chose his head, heart, or wallet?*** Though interesting and moving, this story lacks some of the heart found in Mr. Sparks' earlier works. There is intriguing trivia peppered throughout the story. You will not regret reading this story, even if it has a bit less magic than Walk to Remember or Message in a Bottle. ***Amanda Killgore"},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"For Sparks fans, \\"True Believer\\" was not much of a surprise.

I must admit, I have never read any of Sparks novels before, but I have seen the movies Message in a Bottle and The Notebook. Both were excellent, so I had high hopes for this book.It wasn't that the book was bad, it was just I almost felt cheated regarding the main story of the book (mysterious lights in a cemetery).All in all it flows very well, but the writing style seems more in the order of a made for TV movie than a serious work of fiction.Of course, that's just my opinion--then again, I could be wrong."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"\\"A Great Love Story\\"True Believer by Nicholas Sparks is really a moving novel. Jeremy Marsh, a well-known journalist from New York City, goes down to Boone Creek, North Carolina to investigate a so-called haunted cemetery. On his way to finding a solution for this mystery he gets sidetracked when he starts to fall for the librarian, Lexie Darnell. Lexie is very apt to not let her guard down and fall for this handsome New Yorker. She tries to stay busy to keep her mind from wondering, but she cannot resist. Throughout this story many twists occur that affect both Jeremy and Lexie.Personally, I have read many Nicholas Sparks books and I must say, this is one of his best. It's very touching story and there is no way you'll be able to put this book down. One of the book's only negative effects is that at the beginning it is a little slow. At first nothing really happens. They just tell a lot about his previous articles that he has wrote. But as the story progresses it gets a lot better.I would recommend True Believer to anyone that likes a good love story. Once you finish this book, you will want to rush out to get the sequel. If you're the type of person that likes a very predictable book, than this isn't the book for you. True Believer has many twists to it and will always keep you guessing. After you read this you will definitely believe in miracles.Ashley Lozon"},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"This book starts out with a new twist to a ghost-hunt. But the romance that builds overshadows what could remain an intriguing story. He also attempts to describe life in a small but dying southern town but his description is not especially flattering to what southern life is really like. The ending is predictable and leaves you nowhere. This does not compare to some of his earlier work, especially \\"Message in a Bottle\\" (a book I have read and re-read...) I wish I'd waited for paperback and not spent the hardback money."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"Okay. Here's the deal. I just finished reading the book around five minutes ago. The thing about this is I started reading it pretty much 22 hours ago.True Believer is indeed one of Nicholas Sparks' best. I won't go into details about the plot but I can tell you much regarding the style and what makes this book a must-read, especially for fans.Nicholas Sparks is truly talented in making his characters believable. Mind you, the whole book only took place in 2 weeks or so.. actually just pretty much 5 days if you skip fast forwards. But everything is so well put that you feel a certain attachment to the main characters. I find it hard to believe that such love could be formed in days, but with the way Sparks have put it, it worked.Of course, all fans of Nicholas sparks will be treated with the same wit, humour, passion, and not to mention the thrill he had in his previous books. If you've read his previous works and loved it, then stop reading my review and go buy it now.But for others who are still new to him, I recommend starting with The Rescue or The Guardian. Those books are more of the semi-epic kind of love stories most people are accustomed to. Although, by no means I am stopping you to give it a try.Like I said, having to believe that true love can be found within days is still a little distant to me. Yet this book actually caught me to somehow think that maybe it -is- possible. Afterall, this is a story about believers.And as far as predictability goes, I'm pretty sure a lot of, if not some, people have already guessed halfway what the ending would be. Not just what would happen, but the final words of the book in itself. It's almost given, actually. Yet when you read it, you still feel some strange sensation of accomplishment. Yes you may have wished for a more sudden, surprise kind of ending. But by the time you reach that far, it's just like Nicholas Sparks heard you calling for those words to appear.And that's what he did."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"another reviewer described this book as \\"forgettable\\". that is being kind...this book was one of the most annoying books ever. it was relationship drama... that's it. the context -- the lights in the cemetary -- was a joke. there was no real mystery there. the main character, jeremy, falls for a small-town librarian, lexie. the whole book was about unnecessary and unbelieveable drama. lexie has serious psychological issues. still, jeremy falls head over heels for her. why? well, she's beautiful... but that should only get you so far. other than that, she is sarcastic (in a bad way), mean-spirited, judgmental, moody and she makes assumptions about EVERYTHING... and then acts on those assumptions as if they are ultimate truths. and then, after knowing a guy for a couple of days, she gets seriously moody because he has not yet offered to drop his entire life and move to a small town in the middle of nowhere. what type of crazy do you have to be to expect that right away? lexie wasn't even mildly likeable, but you're forced to read about her for endless pages and, worse, read about how smitten jeremy -- who must have issues of his own to fall in love with a person like lexie -- is with her.if you have ever been in a relationship with frequent bickering, then you know the type of \\"drama\\" i'm talking about. but why, oh god why, would you want to read about it too?the ending was completely predictable also. i was just glad it was over."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"I'm writing this review in the hopes of dissuading anyone from buying it based on what the synopsis says on the back cover! Here's the part I'm referring to: \\"...Jeremy Marsh [Scientific American journalist hero of the story] specializes in debunking the supernatural and has a real nose for the strange and unusual. ...he travels to the small town of Boone Creek, determined to find the real cause behind the ghostly apparitions that appear in the town cemetery...\\" Based on this, I thought there would be some great ghostly intrigue interspersed with the promised love story.Well, we don't get the first glimpse of the ghosts until page 167! And in the whole book, perhaps 30 pages (of 322) have ANYTHING to do with ghosts. As a matter of fact, the whole ghost business is a limp, mostly lifeless subplot to an equally limp love story.And I like good love stories. But this is not one of them. Contrived and cliche, I never really cared much for the relationship of Jeremy and Lexie, the small town librarian he meets while investigating the 'ghost story'.I believe this book would never have been published had it been a first novel - the writing drags and winds, badly in need of tightening, and neither the love story nor the ghost story, by themselves, are worth the read.Lastly, I have to say shame on the editor for letting Mr. Sparks dish out erroneous science - a new moon is NOT caused by the moon being in the earth's shadow! That would be an eclipse. A new moon is when the moon is not visible because all of the light from the sun is hitting the side of the moon currently not visible. Google it. Amazing that such a silly error could pass the editor. But given the drivel of the rest of the book, I guess I'm not surprised.In summary: just another shallow sappy love story, with little bits about ghosts (which turn out to be nothing anyway) interspersed.

The first novel that I finished reading is \\"True Believer\\". I was expecting this novel to be a major tear-jerker, but I was wrong...however, this is a wonderful romantic novel nevertheless!

He enjoys debunking the fraudulent like Clausen who are conmen, but also knows his recent TV outing of this fake has made Jeremy a household name.His next assignment is visiting the real south, Boone Creek, North Carolina where allegedly ghosts of long dead slaves come out every night in the Cedar Creek Cemetery. Though Duke University sent experts last year they failed to explain the eerie lights. Jeremy arrogantly assumes the school failed because they sent true believers instead of a cynic like him. As he begins his inquiry Jeremy meets and falls in love with the librarian Lexie Darnell; she reciprocates. However, she is a TRUE BELIEVER while he is a true skeptic, but what makes their future together doubtful is he plans to expose her beloved grandmother Doris, the town psychic, as a fake though so far he has failed to prove this.A departure from Nicholas Sparks' tragic tale, TRUE BELIEVER is a fun paranormal romance starring two opposites falling in love. The sparks between Jeremy and Lexie would light up the Tarheel State as fans will enjoy their attraction that ignites into love. This is more for romance readers as the mystery of the cemetery spirits lacks suspense; Mr. Sparks' audience will appreciate his fine contemporary while wondering whether the New Yorker and the Tar Heel can forge a relationship.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"I have always been a big fan of Nicholas Sparks. However, I haven't enjoyed his last few books as some of his older novels. I bought this book several months ago just because I always buy his books. It sat on the shelf as I read other books first. Due to some bad reviews I was hesitant to read it. I finally decided last week that I was just going to read it and get it over with. Well, I was pleasantly surprised! I finished it in 4 days, I thought it was very well written and the story was very sweet. It was a perfect summer read and fans of Nicholas Sparks will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"True Believer failed to hit the bullseye, but by only a little. Nicholas Sparks has always been one of my favorite writers. I have always viewed him a step above most romantic authors. First, let me tell you what I did like about the book. There were many chapters where his brilliance shined through that will still touch your heart. Was it as gripping like passages in The Notebook or Message in a Bottle, unfortunately not. It did have his usual vivid descriptions and the attention to the smallest detail was impeccable like all his books. I sense what the story lacked was that of being believed. Can people fall in love at first sight, even in Boone Creek? Sort of like a Professor Henry Hill and the beautiful Marion the librarian in the Music Man. Well, I say yes, true love can bloom where there is sunshine or dark clouds racing above a cemetery where much of this story takes place. What the book lacks in my opinion is in order to be a True Believer you have to be a romantic before you start this book, whereas in his previous books, he made you a believer in true love. I found the book to be enjoyable but it does not measure up to many of his others. Never forget that this author has a heart the size of a lion when it comes to things about the heart. That is why we will all go on buying his books.Jack Vink, author Banished to the Ribbons of Concrete"},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"The novel True Believer by Nicholas Sparks has many literary devices which augment the readability and enjoyability of this work. There are many theme elements which serve to illustrate the point that Sparks is trying to convey. One of the major theme elements is that of the power of the supernatural and its ability to affect the lives of non-believers as well as believers.A novel regarding ghosts and demons and spirits has always been one that captures a reader's attention. It is interesting to read about strange encounters, especially in this day in age where it's not heard of often. Jeremy Marsh is the perfect character to play this role, a rock star who is also a journalist for a magazine that uncovers truths about myserious happenings. There exist many Science-Fiction novels today that were written long ago that have the same lure, but it really is different to read a story about haunted houses in a modern setting. Sparks doesn't take it too far, though. This is no \\"Constantine\\" in which the whole story seems too far-fetched to be true. The level to which this plot is taken also gives way for readers to accept it as realistic and a true possibility. Sparks has a way with taking something that seems illogical and making it into a truth or logic. Stories about the supernatural have been played out in the past as well, but Sparks knows just where to draw the line. A hilarious ending to the plot has also been added to relieve the reader of any awkwardness felt when reading about ghosts and demons. This theme was excellently done and well thought-out and it was truly a successful novel from cover to cover, and it deserves five stars."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"TRUE BELIEVER by Nicholas SparksMarch 25, 2005In Nicholas Sparks' latest novel, TRUE BELIEVER, Jeremy Marsh is a science journalist whose forte is debunking supernatural phenomenon using science and technology. His latest challenge is to solve the mystery behind the rumors of ghosts living in a cemetery in the small town of Boone Creek, North Carolina. When he starts to fall in love with the local psychic's granddaughter, she does her best to dissuade him, knowing they come from different worlds and that nothing would come of this romance.TRUE BELIEVER is a departure for Sparks, in that this is not a tragedy. It is a straightforward story of a man who is trying to solve the mystery of the ghosts in Cedar Creek Cemetery, and in the midst of working, he meets Lexie Darnell, a woman who has been hurt in the past and is afraid to love again. The two are worlds apart in terms of background, but he feels that they have a chance to make a go at it.Lexie believes in the ghosts, as do many of the town's people. If Jeremy finds the solution to this puzzle, it would change life in Boone Creek and possibly ruin any chances Jeremy has with Lexie. But he continues on, wanting to prove that yet again he can solve any mystery that involves the supernatural.I enjoyed this book, but it's not going to be a favorite. I have always enjoyed Sparks' tragedies (in particular MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE). TRUE BELIEVER was a well-written novel, but it lacks the \\"oomph\\" that is characteristic of his stories. The most enjoyable part of this story was the mystery behind the ghosts, but I in particular enjoyed the characters that filled the pages. Sparks always does a good job with the characters that grace the pages of his novels, and while the plot itself may lack something, TRUE BELIEVER is worth the read for any Sparks fan."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"If you are a Sparks fan, you were probably prepared for this. I was not. The PW description seduced me into thinking it was a story about journalist investigating mysterious lights. It isn't. The lights serve only to get Our Hero to the place where he meets cliched smart beautiful librarian, so that he can ultimately embrace the charms of rural life.Now, just about every romance formula is done over and over, and if it is done well, I enjoy it over and over. I did not think this was done well. The characters were all surface; there was no apparent reason for Hero to fall for this particular woman or she for him (except that pickings are slim in a very small town). And it struck me as being purely anti-moderniist/technological -- a tiny backwater town equated with all that is good. (the concomitant bad thinks about the small town did not figure in). On the whole, I would rate this similarly to a Danielle Steele, which is negative to me but of course, in the eyes of many, a high compliment."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"I became a fan of Nicholas Sparks about three years ago, when I read A Walk to Remember a few months before the movie debuted. I cried for a week. The Notebook reduced me to a sobbing wreck as well. So when I sat down to read his newest novel, True Believer, I made sure I was well-stocked with plenty of Kleenex. I was surprised to find I didn't need them.The story is typical of Sparks' tried-and-true style of star-crossed lovers: Jeremy Marsh is a hotshot New York journalist whose life revolves around his career. His current stories involve researching (and debunking) the supernatural-when we first meet Jeremy, he's working on uncovering the sly tricks of Timothy Clausen, a John Edward-type \\"spirit guide.\\" His next big story brings him to Boone Creek, North Carolina, to investigate a legend of ghostly lights in the town's cemetery. The small town of Boone Creek is pretty much the polar opposite of New York City, and Jeremy plans to get the heck out of there as soon as his research is complete.Of course, things aren't always as easy as all that. While researching, Jeremy ends up meeting a young girl named Lexie, who runs the town library. Over the course of the week or so that Jeremy is in Boone Creek, they become friends and Jeremy quickly falls head over heels in love with her. Of course, their relationship is ultimately doomed-their homes and lifestyles are completely different, and Lexie doesn't want to give up her small, quiet life in Boone Creek any more than Jeremy wants to give up his career and fast-paced life in New York. It would take a miracle for their relationship to work-the type of miracle Jeremy doesn't believe in.I generally like Nicholas Sparks' work, and I generally liked this book. It's not a cry-fest like some of his other novels have been, and it probably won't be one of his best-remembered books, but it's a sweet story. Despite its tendency to get a tad predictable (you can tell from the beginning that a schmaltzy ending is in store), it still works and leaves you with an overall good feeling. It's a quick read, and it's fast-paced enough to stay interesting. Overall, True Believer is a little something like an after-dinner mint-not much substance, but it's light and sweet and, in the end, leaves you generally satisfied."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"In TRUE BELIEVER, journalist Jeremy Marsh spends his time debunking the supernatural. He has just finished exposing a fake television psychic, proving that the man was not able to read people's minds or see into their pasts. When he hears about a phenomenon happening in the small town of Boone Creek in North Carolina, where ghosts are seen inhabiting a local cemetery, Jeremy knows he will be able to find the truth behind the lights that are seen glimmering on certain nights above the cemetery grounds. He knows that ghosts do not truly exist.When Jeremy arrives in Boone Creek, he experiences what small town life is all about. He's from the big city and feels like he's walked into a time warp. Everyone knows everyone, and gossip spreads like wildfire. His \\"hotel\\" is a hole-in-the-wall motel, filled with dead animals ranging from a bear to snakes and all sorts of wonderful critters that can be found in the wild. He's as far from New York as he can get, and he's not sure he likes it.The very day he arrives in town, Jeremy makes a quick visit to Cedar Creek Cemetery, where the ghosts are reported to have been seen, when he notices a young woman there who catches his eye. He later finds out that her name is Lexie Darnell. Neither of them knows it but soon their lives will be changed forever. Lexie is the granddaughter of the woman who had invited him to visit the town. Doris Marsh is the town psychic.As Jeremy slowly does his research in the library where Lexie happens to work, he gets to know her. Despite what he feels about the town, he finds himself interested in this woman who doesn't seem to want anything to do with him.Having read nearly every Nicholas Sparks book that has been written, it is safe to say that TRUE BELIEVER is quite the departure from his previous works. While Sparks tends to write tragedies as opposed to true romances, this novel is far from the tragedy that some of his other fiction books have been.This is not to say that TRUE BELIEVER wasn't enjoyable. But fans who are looking for the typical Nicholas Sparks book will not find it here. Instead of concentrating on the romance, this reviewer found the focus of the novel to be on the mystery behind the cemetery, and the high point of the plot was Jeremy's answer to the story behind the ghosts. The fact that Jeremy is dating a woman who believes her parents' ghosts have come to her in the cemetery makes the reader anxious to know what he finds, realizing that the answer will greatly impact the relationship that is central to the love story.One aspect of storytelling in which Sparks excels is his ability to create the characters who populate his books. His capacity to bring into being likeable, everyday people helps make this novel readable. The strength of the story isn't necessarily the plot, and the romance that is found here is not one that a typical romance reader might expect. For this reader, the characters were the highlight of the novel, and the process of getting to know some of the more prominent ones was a delight. One will find oneself chuckling over some of the antics of the townspeople. The brouhaha that the people make over Jeremy's celebrity is very cute, if not humorous.Overall, the plotlines are balanced between the mystery of the cemetery, Jeremy and Lexie's relationship, the aspect of small-town living, and the individual life stories of the two protagonists. Focusing on the individual characters is just one way of truly enjoying this book. It's a soothing type of read, and readers will feel comfortable with these characters.On that note, TRUE BELIEVER comes recommended. However, newcomers to Sparks should not think that this novel is characteristic of the type of writing that has popularized him over the years. His forte lies in the tragedy, and to read THE NOTEBOOK or MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE --- two of this reader's favorites --- is a must.--- Reviewed by Marie Hashima Lofton"},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"I am a huge Nicholas Sparks fan and am always first in line for his new books. I love the deep romantic aspects of his books and how attatched you get to the characters. Not so with this one. The entire plot of the book was well...weird. It was a pretty weak storyline with a disapointing explanation that made you go \\"was that IT?!\\" And this is the first time that I honestly couldnt care less about either one of the characters. I felt no real connection to either one of them and found nothing special or particularly appealing about them. I was so excited to hear that Nicholas had another book coming out soon and to my disapointment its the sequal to this one.

In short a cheap paperback romance bought at a drugstore is probably more entertaining."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"This was my first Sparks book and I was disappointed. The description led me to believe that the story would be about the investigation of the lights with a little romance thrown in.

I kept waiting for something exciting to happen but almost felt as if I was reading the condensed version of the book and in depth details had been left out.The story line had a lot of promise but didn't seem to be developed to its full potential."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"True Believer is about a guy named Jeremy and a girl named Lexie.

Lexie has lived with her grandmother since she was a child. Her grandmother, Doris, is the owner of the restaurant called \\"Herbs\\" and is very popular along the town's people as well. Doris is the one who called Jeremy down to have a look at the cemetery and Doris doesn't believe that there are any ghosts. Jeremy has a feeling she is not the only one but would like the rest of the people to know there are no ghosts.As Jeremy researches more and more he finds out that Doris is not the only one that knows there are no ghosts but she was just the only one that let on that she knew. Now the question is who all knows? Was this just one big scam or was it his imagination?I like this book because it is like a mystery-romance type of book. It is like no other book I've ever read and it is really good. This book can not fit into any other category like the rest of the books can because it is like it s own thing.

Not too heavy on characters or depth of plot, True Believer is a terrific escape from books where you have to figure something out. This sweet romance, where I patiently waited for even the first kiss to happen, provided a delightful distraction from the-LOL-exciting world of data entry.I could have done without the \\"mysterious lights\\" storyline, and I wondered why the psychic concept of determining a baby's gender wasn't further explored instead. That would have thrust this book into the page-turner category.For a better concept of Sparks' tearjerking abilities, I'd advise trying The Notebook or The Rescue instead.The narrator was soothing without being sleepy...I got the feeling he'd actually bothered to read the book in advance.

For some reason it was extremely hard to get into and didn't hold my attention as well as Mr. Sparks other books This defenitly isn't my favorite of his books."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"I'll admit it . . . from time to time, I'm a sucker for a love story,particularly if written by Nicholas Sparks (think THE NOTEBOOK,MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE, etc.).So when his latest came out, TRUE BELIEVER, I just hadto read it . . . and am glad to report that I was not disappointed . . . youwon't be, either.TRUE BELIEVER is the story of a New York writer who is an experton debunking the supernatural . . . when in North Carolina toinvestigate a story, he meets a librarian who forces him todo something he's never done before; i.e., take a giant leap of faith.As Sparks notes on the book's jacket, \\"One day, you're going tolearn something that can't be explained with science. And when thathappens, your life's going to change in ways you can't imagine.\\"Several other passages caught my attention, including:* The facts, after all, spoke for themselves. For one thing, Jeremyhadn't loved a woman in years, and though it had been a longtime, he could still remember how hehe'd felt back then. He wascertain that he would have recognized the feeling again, andfrankly, he didn't. And in light of the fact that hehe'd just met thewoman, the whole idea seemed preposterous. Even his highlyemotional Italian mother didn't believe that true love could blossomovernight. Like his brothers and sisters-in-law, she wanted nothingmore for him than to marry and start a family, but if he showed upat her doorstep and said that he'd met someone two days ago andknew she was the one for him, his mother would smack him witha broom, curse in Italian, and drag him to church, sure that he hadsome serious sins that needed confessing.* Deep down, she knew he was nurturing the hope that she would comewith him to New York, but she couldn't figure out why. Didn't heunderstand that she cared nothing about money of fame? Or aboutshopping or going to shows or being able to buy Thai food in themiddle of the night? Life wasn't about those things. Life was aboutspending time together, about having the time to walk togetherholding hands, talking quietly as they watched the sun go down.It wasn't glamorous, but it was, in many ways, the best that life hadto offer. Wasn't that how the old saying went? Who, on their deathbed,ever said they wished they had worker harder? Or spent less time enjoyinga quiet afternoon? Or spent less time with their family?* \\"You carry yourself with the sort of confidence that a lot of womenfind appealing. At the same time, I had the sense that you understandwhat women want, but that for some reason you're unwilling to giveyourself completely.\\"\\"What's this got to do with anything?\\"\\" Women want the fairy tale. Not all women, of course, but mostwomen grow up dreaming about the kind of man who would riskeverything for them, even knowing they might get hurt.\\" She paused.\\"Kind of like the way you went to find Lexie at the beach. That's whyshe fell in love with you.\\"The book's ending completely surprised me, and I say that as acompliment to the author . . . it brought TRUE BELIEVER to amost satisfactory conclusion."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"Reading this book leisurely, at home in my easy chair ...(I received my copy of the hardback 12/27/05 in my rural mail box from Amazon's entertainingly addictive \\"click-n-shop\\" free-ship carnival of convenience.)... gave me a different impression than reading it in spits and spurts, loitering against bookshelves at City-Market and Wal Mart during a series of grocery shopping sprees.What stood out in the leisurely read at home was the vivid reality in the settings, the sports bar TV scene in NYC, Lexi's library made out of a two-story old house, the local caf&eacute;, homes of characters, and small town base, including, of course, the old, seedy cemetery. In the stand up read I was focused on the plot rhythm, which seemed much faster than in the lamplit-living-room, luxury read.Either way, TRUE BELIEVER feels even more special than my early intimations of it led me to believe.Okay. So, what's so special about this novel?It breathes.Strutting in spontaneous steps over a paper page stage, it lives.As the last page lifted from fingertips, the settings in the novel did not begin fading into the archives of memory. Somehow they remained lit, like the glow of morning twilight as the sun edges slowly above the Eastern land-line, or like a never-ending sunset spreading golden mists over the edges of scenes, like a dollhouse or a small town diorama highlighted for future use.Does TRUE BELIEVER descend the reader to the absolute bottom of an emotional well, and keep him there, deep enough and long enough that a catharsis blossoms peacefully from an artistically sensual depression? It doesn't wander through exactly that type of soulful solitude of deep dark spaces of the healing heart that A BEND IN THE ROAD does. But TRUE BELIEVER has its own special magic. I believe it.It appears, based on reading many and varied reviews of TRUE BELIEVER (before and after reading the book), and after reading A BEND IN THE ROAD (see my review), that Nicholas Sparks's novels (other than TB) give an amazingly effective type of emotional therapy which descends deeper and cleaner than most types of psychological analysis can hope to accomplish. I see why a reader could come to compulsively anticipate that catharsis, and be disgruntled when it has been replaced by another type of reading pleasure, which, to me, is equal. But, of course, if accounts are to be measured, I'm 58 hellacious-years-old, so maybe that explains it.What is that equal pleasure?It's hard to describe, even for a girl with be-ribbon-ed pigtails hiding inside the broken down body of a wise old crone wearing a black-cone-hat, bent at the tip. But, it seems as if Lexi and Jeremy are older souls than Sarah and Miles. It seems that the relationships in TB have, almost imperceptibly, matured and mellowed compared to earlier Sparks novels. The character connections in earlier novels seem younger and fresher, more emotionally volatile (to me that's not \\"for better or for worse\\"; it's just different).I believe that if a reader isn't craving something he has been led to believe (and hope) a book will give him, maybe he won't be disappointed to receive a different, equally satisfying gift. Gifts are difficult, though. Even if a person's expecting a certain thing, and is given something he didn't expect, even if it's better or as good, it might take a while to see that the change is what he had come to need and didn't know it yet.(See my reviews of a few culinary cozy series where I sheepishly admit to only gradually becoming able to enjoy mysteries in which characters not only do not \\"sink teeth into the warm, steamy sponge of a freshly-baked slice-of-bread\\" they don't EVEN mention \\"taking a bite of bread\\" while discussing clues. Or, see my Miss Marple reviews on AT BERTRAM'S HOTEL and MURDER AT THE VICARAGE in which I begin growing into an awareness of the subtly sensual appeals of Agatha's mysteries, even withOUT my mouth being surged into watering or my stomach being triggered into a series of growls.)As one of his fan bases, Sparks seems to have established an appeal to sensitive yet feisty young women (probably mature ones, too, along with various types of testosterone bodies-of-water) who crave and seek what Miles Ryan describes as \\"sad and romantic.\\"Having recently finished reading (and reviewing) Sidney Sheldon's memoirs, I see an uncanny contrast between the appealingly youthful Nicholas Sparks's books, and Sheldon's intensely mature novels, written later in his life. I wonder what type of stories Sparks's would have offered had he been forced to wait until he was in his 50's to begin writing and publishing them. I wondered what type of novels Sheldon would have come out with if he had been allowed to write and publish his first novel shortly after his Hamlet choice against suicide at 17 years old.Soul paths are indeed fascinating, as Spock would say. Look at the convoluted road he traveled to get to a bare light bulb highlighting a Holy Book's invisible paragraph saying that the emotional richness in the intimacy of mature friendship is the brass ring which enhances rather than desecrates the power and clarity of Logic.\\"Live Long & Prosper,\\"Linda G. ShelnuttCRASHHHHH!!! Oh man. I KNEW a person who can't chew gum and walk at the same time shouldn't try that Vulcan hand-sign thingy. Sigh. I gotta quit being a HAM.

I liked most of Sparks' works, particularly \\"Eight Weeks with My Brother\\" and \\"The Rescue\\". But \\"True Believer\\" is the worst he has ever written. It is almost like listening to an old man murmuring to himself. Most of Sparks' books were based on his family or personal experiences. This time he is indeed out of his element and out of style writing a subject and characters that are not based on the familiar theme.It seems to me that the author has turned himself into a machine trying to produce books by schedule. Sadly, great literary works do not come out in this fashion. Even though I still look forward to his future better works, I cannot give a passing grade to this book. Save your money, time and frustration!"},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"I took this book out from the library because people told me that this is a must read. Why? I did not read his other works but I am sure it is not as good. It starts out with Jeremy Marsh who works for Scientific American. His job is to debunk supernatural myths. A woman named Doris wrote from her hometown, Boone Creek, North Carolina about mysterious lights in Ceder Creek Cemetery. Jeremy goes to this quaint little town and appears to stick out like a sore thumb. Doris owns the restaurant Herbs a very popular hangout for the locals. Jeremy quite the celebrity.However, Sparks is taking it to the extreme by depicting how pure and wonderful this remote town is and how NYC is evil. Yes, NYC can be rough at times but all of Boone Creek is wonderful? C'mon! It takes a while in fact almost to the middle of the book when the love interest Lexie Darnell, Doris' granddaughter, takes notice of Jeremy. She is the town librarian and apparently, most men in the town have the hots for her. She is independent, bright, and very coy. It turns out that she lived in NYC for a while. Does this mean when a woman is independent that they come from a crowded city?I had to stop reading because I expected a romance. There was no momentum. I wanted more than details. I wanted action! Why should it take half the book until Lexie is even polite to Jeremy? The characters interactions were never flushed out. How could we relate to the book, if it does not seem realistic to us? I do not like the broad strokes that divide Boone Creek and NYC. There is both good and bad in small town life and big city living. Oh well.I gave it 3 stars because it was a good attempt at a love story. I thought that it would be like a Danielle Steel or Nora Roberts novel."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"I am a big Nicholas Sparks fan...but this book was sooo hard to get into.

I have read everything from cheesy romance novels, to famous literary works, to recent pulitzer prize winning novels. I love this book.

This book is very easy to read without any complicated plot twists and turns. I found the story to be a beautiful tale of true love and belief in miracles. The characters are likeable and the story takes you from Small Town USA to the Big Apple. I actually found this story a refreshing change from some of Nicholas Sparks' other books. I found myself smiling as I turned every page. Unlike some of Nicholas Sparks' other books (which I liked as well) I didn't want to throw the book across the room when it was over because it made me cry so much I couldn't breathe.

Cardboard characters, predictable plot, and every cliche in the book. Ironically, the characters of this small town are very worried that the big-city reporter, Jeremy, will portray them as stereotypical southern hicks...they should have worried about Nicholas Sparks doing that instead. All of the characters are good ol' boys who like huntin' an' fishin' or sugar sweet gals with hearts of gold and heads full of air. You've got your brash small town mayor, your not too bright sheriff's deputy, your waitress from the local truck stop, and all the usual town gossips. They eat grits and say \\"LIB\\" (Well, I'll be!). The story is totally void of any emotional depth, and the writing is amateurish, at best. Shallow, insulting to the intelligence.

I always held out hope that he would write something more \`adult' with flowing sentences and a higher level of readability. Well, he certainly tried to do that with True Believer but, failed. I'm not a believer that this was a great story; the two characters are brought together haphazardly and without a foundation of friendship and respect. They spend a majority of their time tossing insults at one another and chasing \`ghosts' that turn out to be absolutely nothing in the end. The premise is ridiculous, and I wouldn't recommend this book. Although it's far better than some of his previous books, in terms of writing ability, the storyline now suffers and the characters just don't inspire any warmth."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"If you thought the Webster's Dictionary was a hit, you'll LOVE True Believer!

I think what Sparks was trying to do here, was introduce lots of characters to give you that rural town feel, but it fell through.As far as the rest of the books he writes, am I the only one that gets tired of reading about loblolly pines, shooting stars, New Bern, Greensboro, kudzu, azaleas, chagrin..(WHO uses THAT word anymore?) and wine? If you read his books, you understand. North Carolina is great Nick, we get it. Change some of your settings man...I feel like I'm reading the same book over and over.

A new moon is in fact when the dark or unilluminated portion of the Moon faces directly toward Earth when the illuminated half of the Moon faces directly toward the Sun and has nothing to do with the Earth's shadow (lunar eclipse). This is beside the fact that 26 pages earlier ( p225) he notes \\"In the moonlight her (Lexie) features were unreadable..\\"I'm all for a good story, but when it comes to scientific facts supporting the plot in this book I have to say that I am far less than a \\"True Believer.\\""},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"But I could not even get half-way through this book.

This one wasn't actually what I thought but it's still a good read"},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"I recently started reading Nicholas Sparks, and I can't get enough. My first read was Safe Haven and I was instantly hooked. Then the Guardian, and again I was very pleased. The Best of Me was my next choice very touching. Then I moved on to The Choice, oh my god I found myself crying and not beinging able to put it down. Now I'm on True Believer, and I must say another amazing read. He does it again Nicholas Sparks has a way of sucking me in, I find myself relating to his characters in such a way that even when I'm not reading the book their memory seems to linger in my thoughts. I highly recommend Nicholas Sparks novels to anyone looking for a story that makes you feel a rollercoaster of emotions, yet by the of it all you just want to keep on reading."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"What can you say about Nicholas Sparks, every book is as great as the other.

Turns out I should have borrowed this book instead of purchasing. This was my first Sparks book and probably my last. The character building was pretty good, the story line weak. Big let down as far as mystery goes."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"I haven't read all of Mr. Sparks' books, but I've read enough of them to know that he really is a hit or miss author for me. This one is definitely a miss. He has essentially written pretty much the same story he's written before, modifying it just enough to make it seem different from previous books. And, I confess, it's always bothered me a bit that because he's a male, his books are labeled \\"Fiction\\" instead of \\"Romance\\".I had a problem with the character of Jeremy from the beginning. I didn't dislike him, but couldn't quite figure out what Lexie's initial attraction to him was. Was it his good looks? I guess so. Sparks wrote him as being both a traditional guy wanting a family and a nightclubbing womanizer. It seemed too much of a contradiction for me. I liked Lexie much more (although I found the name Lexie a bit annoying.) However, I couldn't reconcile her wanting to remain in this small North Carolina town with wondering why she couldn't find an intellectually stimulating man there.There was also far too much interpersonal dialog going on. Pages of both Jeremy and Lexie reflecting on their past relationships, current situations, their attraction too each other and on and on. It made for a very boring read at times. And the cottage by the water was just another clich&eacute; I've already read in numerous other books.I would have like to have read more about the side characters. Lots of lost opportunities there. The solving of the mystery was very anti-climatic. By the time it was revealed, I honestly didn't care. As for the ending, no big surprise there, either. I suppose if you are a fan of this author, you will enjoy this book quite a bit, but I could not recommend this one to someone not already familiar with the authors' previous books."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"Who loves a love story? We all do. Who knows how to tell a love story? Nicholas Sparks, author of The Notebook, Message In A Bottle, The Wedding, and now True Believer, a reminder that love may be able to conquer all.Voice performer David Aaron Baker gives a sterling reading, easily slipping into the voice of Jeremy Marsh, a quintessential young New Yorker, successful, on the fast track, and master of all he surveys. Jeremy is a writer for Scientific American, known for bringing to light mysterious supernatural claims. This is a man who has earned a modicum of fame in his work, making TV appearances and read by many.He's intrigued when he receives a letter from the owner of a restaurant in Boone Creek, North Carolina. She invites him to come and witness the ghostly lights prevalent in their local cemetery. He's sure this is fodder for another of his exposes.What Jeremy didn't count on was Lexie Darnell, the town librarian, a position she holds just as her mother did. Lexie has not spent all of her life in Boone Creek. She left once to follow her heart, only to learn that she really belongs in Boone Creek, safe and secure among those she loves.The attraction between Jeremy and Lexie is almost immediate, but the question is how will the twain ever meet? Lexie is committed to Boone Creek and Jeremy is a dyed in the wool New Yorker. While Jeremy may uncover the reason for the ghostly lights, can he also discover what he wants to know about Lexie?- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"Ok I have only read one other book by Sparks and that was \\"The Notebook\\" (which I very much enjoyed). So I picked up this book, True Believer the other day I admit because I love lighthouses and this one had it prominantly on the cover.So this afternoon (er... yesterday afternoon) I started reading it... and kept going.. I couldn't stop. I read the entire book in one sitting! I don't usually do that but I was like, oh who cares if I have work tomorrow.. I have to see how this turns out!I don't want to say much about the book spoiler-wise. I am surprised at some of the responses on here. I mean everyone has their opinions on things, but I came here thinking I would read some reviews after I finished it and see what others thought.Anyways... for what it's worth, since I can only speak for myself.. I REALLY enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone. I didn't think the romance in it was unbelievable like some people, and I thought the characters were fabulous, and had many laugh-out-loud moments while reading it. Lots of witty and playful banter.. I was just drawn in.Ok off to sleep now as like I said, read it one sitting on a work night... cannot give a higher endorsement then that."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"This was my first and LAST Sparks novel. The characters had no depth and the story was flat. I have not seen any of his Novel-turned-Movies. I read this book as part of my neighborhood Book Club selections for Nov. and was excited for the pick as I had not read any of his books before. Usually, if I start a book, I like to finish it. If it weren't for my book club, I would have happily not finished the book. I felt NOTHING for the characters. Many of my book clubbers felt the same. Even the ending was dull. I can't imagine that he wrote a sequel to this story. Yawn. NO THANKS. I get the distinct feeling he wrote this book with a Movie deal in mind."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"Nicholas Sparks has once again found a way to touch the reader's heart while keeping the mind intrigued with an interesting plot. My favorite Nicholas Spark's book is whatever one I have just put down. He has never disappointed me and I don't think he ever will. I am a True Believer!"},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"Very \\"cranked out\\" feel.The editors were very sloppy too...did no one even bother to fact check this book? The main character was raised by her grandmother, a woman in her 60's when the story takes place. The main character is in her 30's. Therefore, the grandmother had to have been in her 30's when her granddaughter was born.I kept waiting for this to be mentioned in the story, that the main character was born to a teen mother, or something. However, we find out later that the main character's mother grew up, became a libarian, married, and worked \\"for years\\" at the local libary before the main character was born. The grandmother's history is also mentioned...she grows up, marries, has the protagonist's mother. Neither of them was a teen mom.But if the grandmother is only in her 60's, and the main character in her 30's, this time line is technically impossible.Were both the editors and author asleep?Given the content of this book, I wouldn't doubt it."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"True Believer is my fourth Sparks story: Message in a Bottle (movie); The Notebook; and A Bend in the Road. Again I am impressed by Sparks's ability to portray a man as manly, yet vulnerable and genuinely caring. In this effort, I found Jeremy more appealing than the object of his affection, Lexie Darnell, who was far too rigid in her desire to have Jeremy come to her (more than once) to profess his love and sincerity. But then....Investigative journalist, Jeremy Marsh, is in the business of using science to debunk the self-proclaimed authenticity of psychics, spirit guides, faith healers and mediums, who work to make true believers out of those who put their trust (and their hard-earned dollars) into their divinations, prophecies, insights, etc. He receives a letter from a woman in North Carolina about a cemetery in Boone Creek, which legend holds is haunted by the spirits of former slaves. Ms. Doris McClellan invites him to Boone Creek to see if he can make sense of what the lights are all about. Arriving in town, Jeremy sees, and soon meets, the lovely Lexie Darnell, who turns out to be Doris's granddaughter. (Jeremy learns upon meeting and talking with Doris that she has a special gift, which Jeremy rejects out of hand and plans to debunk as well.) Lexie, has a sad past, mistrusts men totally and, hence, is utterly unimpressed by handsome, city boy Jeremy Marsh. She is certain Jeremy is in town only to make fun of the country hicks she believes Jeremy thinks they all are. However, her insides have a very different feeling about Jeremy, and therein lies the rub.The book is well-written, intriguing, beguiling, and certainly hits one's 'dreams of romance' buttons. One aspect of Sparks's storytelling that I appreciate is that the reader can learn some interesting facts from his novels. For example, in this one, what about those horses? Enjoy and learn.Carolyn Rowe Hill"},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"Oh how I waited with bated breath for Nicholas Sparks' new release! And oh how disappointed I felt as I struggled through this \\"Danielle Steel\\"-like book. The Notebook and Message in a Bottle rank as 2 of my all time favorite books. True Believer, however, did not make a true believer out of me. The whole story was unbelievable from the very beginning. Too much for me to believe that 2 people that have just met can instantly know that they are in love, oh please. There is no depth to this book. The characters are implausible, shallow, and very predictable. It seems as thought Mr. Sparks is trying to follow a formula that he thinks will sell, a la Danielle Steel. He should spend more time visiting the truth in life and love-as in The Notebook-and less time giving us this pulpy mess, and expecting us to swallow it..."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"I usually love Nicholas's stories but this one just wasn't great.

It just got to be boring after a while for me."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"This book came to me by mistake, I did not order it, but have read two other Nicholas Sparks books, so I thought, why not?

Do not waste your money or time on this book."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"I always have high expectations from this author, but this book was by far his worst ever. The Notebook, Message in a Bottle, The Wedding...all wonderful! In True Believer the romance was boring, and the plot to uncover the \\"mysterious lights\\" was unsuspenseful. Sorry everyone, but Nicolas has let us down this time."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"I admit, I have not yet finished the book... but only because I can't seem to excited about it. The romance in it is forced and fully spelled out. Whatever happened to letting the reader discover the characters. This book tries to force them on you. The mystery... not nearly as good as in the Guardian of Bend in the Road. Please Nicholas... go back to your basics and don't feel that you need to release a book a year. We will wait for your best. It doesn't have to make a great movie... it just needs to make us love the characters and plot."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"I am a big fan of Nicholas Sparks and will read his new books without even knowing what they are about but was let down with his newest effort, True Believer.Jeremy is a resident of New York City and is a divorced freelance science writer. He is always looking for a new story to uncover the truth about the great mysteries of the world.Lexie is a lonely 31 year old woman who is living in a very small town in South Carolina. She has been burned one too many times by falling in love with the wrong man.Put those two characters together and a weak back drop story about mysterious lights in the Boone Creek cemetary that could be ghosts and you have True Believer. Nothing exciting, and nothing that makes you want to turn the pages except to reach the ending.I am willing to bet that if you are a Sparks fan, you wont mind reading the story but my best advice is to wait until it comes out in paperback. Its just not worth the HC price."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"Nicholas Sparks' latest novel is a book that I am sure you will forget as soon as you finish it. Not that this is a bad thing in this case - given the undeveloped characters, the \\"twists and turns\\" that broadcast themselves from the first chapter, and the ridiculously sappy tacked-on ending.Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time - read Gilead by Marilynne Robinson, or Baker Towers by Jennifer Haigh, instead."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"Loved the audiobook! I am a NC native which makes N. Sparks' stories even more enjoyable. The people are exactly as he describes and anyone wondering about buying this audiobook should go ahead and buy it - if you don't, you will miss a very moving story. Mr. Sparks has the great knowedge of knowing what all people have in common."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"I chose this book from the public library because I plan on attending a luncheon later this year where Sparks will be the guest speaker, and I have never read any of his books. I was expecting something at least good, maybe great, but all I can say is, I am glad I didn't have to pay for this trite, predictable, sophomoric excuse for a novel. Dull doesn't begin to cover it. And I thought the Twilight books were bad. Any Amazon reviewer produces more interesting reading than this rubbish. I read the first few chapters, then skipped to the end. No improvement. I might still try The Notebook, but from the library because it's free."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"There was a lot of damage to the cover an some pages were riped the back cover was riped as well."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"for SOMETHING to happen in this book! One of the first rules of fiction writing is to start \\"in medias res\\" in the middle of things. I'm past the middle of this book and nothing has happened that makes me want to continue. Jeremy has seen the lights, but even THAT was boring. It would be more interesting if we were in on Jeremy's research, rather than just \\"didn't find anything interesting. I want to see Lexie\\". He's reading diaries, newspaper accounts, all of which would prove interesting to his ultimage findings, but we're treated to internal agonizing about what Lexie might be thinking. Or doing, or saying, or not saying. And with Lexie, what Jeremy is thinking, doing, saying or not saying. If something doesn't happen soon, I am going to quit and put it in my donate pile. I may revise my review, but I paid for the darn book and I'm going to try to stick it out. The only thing I have to add is that Lexie is rude and unlikeable in the extreme."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"I love Nicholas Sparks. I really think that he is an amazing writer but this was a complete let down. I really wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I feel compelled to read the sequel because I am curious if he can redeem himself. I didn't feel like I actually like any of the characters. When I read The Last Song, I wanted to hang out with Ronnie and Will. And I wanted to meet Blaze so much. I thought Jonah was so cute and so funny. Some of the things he said were just so funny and he was clearly trying to be cute, which is what I liked about him- he knew how to get what he wanted. And in Dear John, I just want to run up to Savannah and tell her not to do it, don't marry anyone- John loves you. But in True Believer I really didn't even care if Jeremy or Lexie ended up together, part me wanted her to be with Rodney and Jeremy to be with Rachel. I didn't like the storyline of the ghosts and really thought it was all pushed. I just ask anyone who reads this book- don't judge Sparks on it. He has written 17 books and will most likely write many more- he just didn't hit the mark on this one. Don't read it. It barely deserves a star."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"Ugh! Not only was this story boring and predictable but I wasn't even rooting for things to work out between the two main characters. I felt like they both would have been better off if they'd just given up on the relationship. Neither one seemed like such a great catch, and the author never made me feel like their love for eachother was deep or geniune. Then there was the whole thing about the lights in the cemetery which I initially felt had some potential to be an interesting plot point, but which turned out to be a boring dissapointment (which the author, strangly, aknowledges through Jeremy's character.) The solution to the mystery was so mundane that it was insulting to all small Southern towns that the residents of this, otherwise typical one hadn't been able to figure it out. I am torn between wishing the author wrote more descriptively (of the characters and the setting) and being thankful that he kept the thing relatively short. The story was devoid of any intrigue, excitment or passion. I couldn't wait for it to be over, and then when it finally was, the cheesy and predicatble ending was enough to illicit an audible groan. A completely forgettable book."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"New York journalist Jeremy Marsh goes to small town Boone Creek in North Carolina in order to find out the reasons behind the mysterious lights that appear in an ancient cemetery.In addition to talking to several people in town, he studies lots of old diaries and documents at the local library. Most of what he finds, is of no importance whatsoever. Theories based on wishful thinking and imagination. Until he finally finds the truth, on one single sheet of paper.Why is it then that we have to read through all this boring documentation together with Jeremy? Uninteresting and repetitive as it is. A few colourful townspeople at the local caf&eacute; do little to brighten the gloomy undertaking.A love story has been thrown in. It is well known that love works in mysterious ways, but when Jeremy falls for town librarian Lexie, the wonder of love is stretched mighty far. Super attractive Jeremy lives in New York, which is full of gorgeous and NICE!!! women, and he picks Lexie. The most annoying, stubborn, peculiar \\"heroine\\" there ever was. I wanted to hit her more than once, downright impertinent and badly behaved as she was.I managed a third of the book before I gave up, skimmed through the rest, peaked at the end - yess, the lovebirds do finally shake hands - and closed it with a sigh.I got this book in hardcover, and based upon previous experience was looking forward to another excellent read. What a total waste of money.Mr. Sparks, you owe me big time!"},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"The characters are not only flat, but the little development there was made me dislike them. I just cannot understand what Jeremy sees in Lexie. To me she comes off as boring, sarcastic, aloof, fickle, and arrogant. Jeremy is insipid, avoiding and cowering from the deputy marshall and taking all of Lexie's flack. Maybe that's why he was attracted to her, but c'mon, who wants to read a book about a mealy-mouthed man falling in love with a harpy?And if the focus was supposed to be plot, I'm very sorry to hear that. Because the plot was nothing to write home about either. The conflicts were mediocre at best. Sparks had a lot of opportunities with his subject matter - he could have made it much more suspenseful and spooky, he could have played up the benefits of small-town life, he could have made his characters flawed but likeable. He totally missed."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"This book seemed to just drag on and on and the two main characters just never jelled in my opinion. How does one fall in love in one week? Two such different people? Not very realistic and the interaction between them always seemed more strained then loving. In the sequel, At First Sight, this smaller book was the true ending to True Believer. The sequel should never been a book alone but the way True Believer should have ended in the first place. The abrupt ending had me saying \\"huh?\\"in the first book and the second book was more of the same for me with these two characters and I won't ruin it for those who haven't read At First Sight yet by telling the ending but the ending for me just didn't sit well. It just made the both books seem pointless."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"I'm a big romance reader, but new to Nicholas Sparks. I picked this book up on a hunch that it'd be a good wind-down read, and I was pleasantly surprised! I read it every chance I got, and finished it within two days! I haven't read other Nicholas Sparks' books, so I can't compare, but I do love this one. Very good for us romantics at heart who still believe true love is out there for everyone."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"I've read other Sparks books, and I found this one to be my favorite. Sparks has created realistic characters and a beautiful story line that will keep you guessing. New York journalist Jeremy Marsh travels to Boone Creek, NC, for an assignment on the mysterious lights appearing in the cemetary on foggy nights. He sees Lexi Darnell and finds her to be like no other woman he had ever met. He gradually falls hoplessly in love with her. She cares about him, however, she is afraid of getting hurt. This beautiful romance keeps you turning the pages, curious to see what will happen next. I recommend this book to anybody who enjoys a good love story. I would also recommend reading the sequel, At First Sight."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"This book is not like any other nicholas sparks book i've read.

I am already waiting for the movie to come out!"},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"I have read a Walk to Remember and this title by this author and have enjoyed both of them tremendously, I am sure in the future I will pick up another book of his in the very near future. When I read the sypnosis and found out that a reporter was investigating mysterious lights in a small town, I was definitely interested,I was hooked line and sinker. Plus, I work in a library, like one of the main characters. Suspense and romance are what I enjoy reading though. I admit that I was somewhat disappointed that the lights were explained at the end of the novel though, I had enjoyed the spooky effect of them throughout the novel. Other then that the novel was great, besides the corrupt mayor of course. I also suggest reading Robert James Waller too, the Bridges of Madison County is a wonderful read."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"I try not to judge a writer until I've read everything they've produced. I've done the same over the course of the past year with Nicholas Sparks. I've often found his works saccharine, or too much like a cheesy Hollywood movie. This novel, however, I found to be much more well-written. In fact, I couldn't put it down, and finished it in 2 days' time. This, of course, isn't to say that I haven't enjoyed Sparks' other books. I just wasn't as drawn in by them as I was by this particular novel. Glad I didn't wait for it to come out in paperback."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"I was disappointed in Spark's newest story. It was not near as good as the others and felt like he had to really stretch to come up with this one. It was very slow moving with a lot of unneeded conversations. The story was a little hard to believe and didn't seem likely. The relationship between the journalist and the small town girl he meets was stiff and just did not mesh. I have read all of Spark's books but I am sorry to say that this one was just not as likeable as the rest."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"I thought I would never \\"diss\\" a Sparks novel, but I am. This was a disaster. It almost seemed that Sparks just cranked out something for the sake of cranking. Totally boring, predictable and yucky! If I say anymore, I'll just annoy myself further. Please don't waste your time unless you want something to bellyache with to the neighbors over the fence."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"Ok, I'll admit, I read Nicholas Sparks' books when I can't find anything else, and I don't expect a lot from him, but this book is ridiculous. Nothing more than a poorly written romance novel."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"Maybe it's my fault for not clearly reading more about it but I bought this as more of a mystery, or at least for it's mystery elements and I ended up unwrapping a love story. Now I have nothing against romance but it's not really my cup of tea. Jeremy Marsh is a typical, young New Yorker, brash and successful as a writer for Scientific American who is known for exposing supernatural claims as hoaxes. He is invited to North Carolina to investigate mysterious lights that come from a small cemetery. so far so good. Jeremy is determined to find out what's behind the lights just as he has with so many other mysteries but then the unexpected happens...he finds himself first attracted and then falling head-over-heels in love with Lexie Darnell, who just happens to be the granddaughter of a local psychic. How's that for irony! Now Jeremy finds himself torn between the woman and the work he loves.Jeremy wasn't an easy character to like and I really found the Big city boy falling for the small-town country girl just a bit too pretentious. For me it fell short of expectations and relied on too many cliche's and plot contivances. Not horrible at all but not as good as i expected and certainly NOT what I expected, either."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"Not a bad beach read but nothing in this story is unexpected. I didn't really connect with the main characters. I was interested by the description in the supernatural aspects (the lights) it seemed like a mystery/love story that may have been unique but instead was a way too predictable love story."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"I really enjoy Nicholas Sparks' books, and liked True Believer, but was disappointed. I agree with other reviewers that it lacked the \\"oomph\\" of his other books. It is lacking the tragedy that really tears at your heart. His other books have been tear jerkers and this one is not. At least not to me."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"I have to say I love Nicholas Sparks and I have read everything he has written. I am not sure what happend here. I am so upset by this book.

Great storyline, and you really won't be able to stop reading it.

Having endured the film of \\"Nights in Rodanthe,\\" my nominee for Most Obvious Dumb Plot of the Year, I would not have done so without a very strong recommendation from a friend. I end with mixed feelings.The conversations are frequently brilliant. The several pages spent trying to get simple road directions out of a local mechanic are some of the funniest I've ever read. The quirkiness and sheer likeability of the minor characers is undeniable. Boone Creek ends up being a place you'd at least want to visit, even if you can't quite picture living there. And, quite frankly, I am delighted to encounter a happy ending these days!One of the tags given to this book is suspense, which baffles me except for the fact that by the time the nature of the cemetary hauntings was revealed, I would have been willing to beg for the secret.It's a fast, easy, and mostly entertaining read, marred only by the main characters. Saint Jeremy Marsh is simply too good to to be believed, even by the Truest of Believers in the nobility of the male romantic lead. Lexie needs to be treated for bipolar disease, if not schizophrenia, or possibly just to be \\"slapped up side the head\\" once.If you like this author, definitely buy this book. If you are dubious about the entertainment value of Mr. Sparks' works, you aren't going to Believe in this book, either."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"I have to start by saying this is the first Nicholas Sparks book I've read. I have watched Message in a Bottle and The Notebook movies, and really liked both. I thought I would give one of his books a try. I apparently picked the wrong one. This book is slow, repetitive, and there is not much going on. The \\"ghost story\\" part of the story is lame. The \\"romance\\" between Jeremy and Lexie reads like a high school romance."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"A twisting tale about a man searching for a scientific answer only to come across a miracle, and a small city girl doesn't want to make another mistake in love. Nicolas Sparks not just writes a true-to-life love story who makes his settings and his characters come to life, but as he writes, he analyzes two people, their relationship and how they can make it work. He even can get inside the characters head, and make you feel as you would in a complicated situation. With a dash of romance into his brewing pot of reality, you feel as if this story could, or already has, happened to two people. I highly recommend it to anyone, romance lovers or one who just want to read a story where you want to feel like the characters you read about."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"I had read a few Nicholas Sparks books and was looking for some good reading.

It is one of those books that you enjoy while you read it, but forget it almost immediately after you are done with it. It has a good story to it, but it is a little disappointing.

Small town in NC, someone is getting over another someone, stranger comes to town and falls in love with someone from NC. Said someone doesn't want to get hurt, so there is a back and forth struggle until the end when everything is peachy again.True Believer is even WORSE! There just wasn't much of a story at all. Albeit it is the same story again, but at least with most of his other books there is another back story. This one was very weak and not very interesing. Save the time and pick up something else"},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"This was a very enjoyable and easy summer read. Certainly not his best book, but still one I would highly recommend. I can hardly wait for the sequel to this book to come out in October!"},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"This was an enjoyable book, and would have received a much higher rating from me had it stood alone. However, as a Nicholas Sparks book, I was holding it up to some very high expectations set by his previous masterpieces, and quite frankly, it fell very short. It simply wasn't up to the calibre of his previous books and lacked the very qualities I love most about his writings. It reminded me of a Danielle Steel novel rather than something from the deeper, more engaging, Nicholas Sparks.In a word, the story was superficial. The supernatural premise that drew the characters together was ridiculously hokey, and pitting New York city-life against life in sleepy small town America didn't capture my interest the way it could have had it been presented better, with more exciting characters and plot development.Noticeably absent: there was no deep emotional connection between the two protagonists. Even though I easily buy into the soulmates, meant-to-be concept of love-at-first-sight, I did not find the romance and coming together of these two characters to have that kind of depth or energy. I'm not convinced they truly belong with each other, or their relationship will last much beyond the end of the story.As well, there was no emotional connection between the characters and the reader. There wasn't a deep passion for me to feel alongside them. I didn't grow to care for them as people nor did I become as emotionally invested in their relationship, as I have with other Nicholas Sparks characters. These two will be easily forgotten, whereas Noah/Allie, Jamie/Landon, Theresa/Garrett, Paul/Adrienne, Miles/Sarah, and all the others have continued to live in my heart long after I put those books down and moved onto other reading material.On the positive side, there were flashes of Nicholas Sparks's brilliance scattered throughout the book. His use of vivid descriptions and attention to detail was impeccable, as always. The dialogue flowed naturally, with the right blend of wit and seriousness, and sounded realistic (very important to me in a romance novel, as most don't have this quality and instead use incessant and annoying bickering so the conflict/tension comes across as abrasively hostile instead of deep and abiding love).All-in-all, although I was sorely disappointed, it was still a pleasant story and worthwhile reading. I hope Nicholas Sparks goes back to novels that draw the reader into an emotional investment into the characters and their story, with their bittersweet tragic endings (or even happy endings as in The Wedding). I prefer to feel strong emotions and intense passion when I read a Nicholas Sparks."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"I'm glad it was short! Sooooooo predictable and typical of Sparks.

Any time he comes out with a new book I automatically get it knowing it will be great without even reading anything about it. Not so with True Believer.

(I don't like Steels' books)"},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"I thought True Believer was a okay story, but the writing was just simply beautiful. True Believer is about Jermery Marsh, a investigative reporter from NYC who writes for the Scientific American and he get's a letter from this woman named Doris in North Carolina telling him about these mysterious lights in this old cementary, so he investigatives and he meets Lexie; the local librarian who has been burned in the past by a stranger who came up from Chicago and left, so when she first meets Jermery, she is cautious that he is only going to be here a week and he is going to leave, that is it. So as Jermery investigates though the rare-books he finds at the library, he gets to meet the people of Boone Creek; the town it takes place in. He is then given the key to the city and it is a local celebrity in the town. Eventually as he gets to know Lexie, he is slowly falling in love with her, but she is keeping her distance and sometimes cold in the relationship. So one day while at the library, Lexie is not there, and since he knows her a little more and where she goes, he finds her on an island where a lighthouse is; this is where Lexie's parents got married, but where killed in a car accident when Lexie was two, so she lived with her grandmother Doris. Jermery goes to the island and meets her there, and there they finally make love. From there, Jermery finds out where the lights come from; it comes from the local paper mill and the train tracks that past by there. This makes Jermery mad because he feels that he was lied to by the town and by Lexie, so he storms out of the library like there was no tomorrow. Lexie and Jermery had their first fight inside the library and the news gets around town. But in truth, Lexie actually loves Jermery and he does not want him to go back to NYC, but she makes a stupid move by telling Jermery that she is going to marry the local sheriff Rodney, so Jermery goes back to NYC and does film the lights but decides to leave out the paper mill and the trains. Then in NYC, Doris comes to NYC to talk to Jermery and to tell him the truth; Lexie loves Jermery, and Jermery loves her back. So he goes back to Boone Creek and decides to be with Lexie after all.The reason I gave this book four stars because I thought the writing was beautiful like Nicholas Sparks always does, but it lacked the emotion his other books have, and I thought Lexie was a cold and bitter person. If you are starting out with Nicholas Sparks, first read A Walk To Remember first, and work your way through his books, but read this later on."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"This book takes you on a journey to a tiny town, in North Carolina called Boone Creek. Jeremy Marsh travels there to dispell the myths and legend regarding supposed ghostly lights that plauge that cemetery. During his visit there he meets many of the locals some of which are real characters. This book started off slow, but you find yourself not wanting to put it down when he meets the town librarian. Can love concur all read it and see. Also I recomend Sams letters to Jennifer by Nicholas Sparks."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"The book was a snooooooooze..... It took everything in me not to fall asleep. This is not a book that I could tell you in good conciousness to buy because I would be a liar. If you want a romance that will keep you turning the pages until you finish the book then you MUST..buy Whispers of the wicked saints. Don't be fooled there is a typo on the cover, but don't let that stop you from an awesome romance.. You won't believe the twist and turns. As for Sparks?? I just don't know what to say. I hope this is not the end for him, because I have enjoyed his work, but I have to admit I am a little worried."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"I've read nearly all of Nicholas Sparks' novels (I still haven't read \\"Message in a Bottle\\"...only because I thought the movie was boring), and I looked forward to this one, his first novel in a year and a half (since \\"The Wedding\\", released in September 2003). The premise was intriguing...a hotshot New York City journalist who specializes in debunking myths and other supernatural phenomenon travels to a small town in North Carolina to investigate a haunted cemetery. With a premise like that, I really looked forward to reading it.After finishing it, I did feel a little bit let down, as the story didn't amount to much. The love story was reminiscent of \\"Doc Hollywood\\" (as one reviewer correctly pointed out) and it seemed as though Mr. Sparks was looking for any way to debunk his \\"ghost story\\" with some confusing bits of logic to explain the phenomenon. What I gather is...does he not believe that there are actual hauntings? That anyone out there who claims a haunting is automatically to be assumed to be a fraud? I thought it would be more interesting to go that route and explore it in depth, but this is a LOVE STORY first and foremost, with the plot secondary.Mr. Sparks gives every reason why the two main characters should not be together (they are opposites in practically everything, so that means one of them will have to make a huge sacrifice to be with the other). Jeremy Marsh lived all his life in New York City and his family and five brothers all live close to their parents in Queens, each having families of their own. Lexie Darnell lived in New York City for a short time but didn't like it, so she returned to her small town in North Carolina and works as a library. She is adamant about not wanting to leave, so that means Jeremy must do all the sacrificing to \\"prove his love\\". While there are some cliches straight out of the \\"romantic comedy genre of films\\" (the climax is always some crisis that drives the couple apart, until one or both realizes that they can't live without the other). In this case, I didn't totally buy it at the end, that someone had to prompt Jeremy to return to North Carolina one last time.Mr. Sparks' writing is improving though. I found this novel funnier than his previous ones, with fresher dialogue and crisper writing. He avoided the cliche of the white picket fence, and that got a huge boost for me to like this book. I'd rate this one as my second favorite Nicholas Sparks Novel (after \\"The Rescue\\" and before \\"The Wedding\\"). I didn't even try to predict the ending of this novel as I usually do with his other ones, because I wanted to read this with an open mind and let him take us where he wanted us to go. If anyone is unsatisfied with the ending...it probably has to do with the fact that its a cliffhanger ending on purpose. \\"At First Sight\\" is the sequel to this one and will be released in September and I do look forward to reading that one."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"Though pales in comparison with his previous novels, True Believer was an enjoyable read. I completed the 300+ pages book in about a day.This would be the first Sparks' novel that I did not cry in any section of the book. But what makes up for it would be the laughs that came from the sub-characters and also the witty exchanges in speech between the two main leads.Maybe not as emotional as most of his previous books, this one still held an idea that will keep you in suspense. The urge to find out whether the ghosts that appear in the cemetery of Boone Creek is true or false and whether the occurance can be scientifically explained would be enough to keep you turning the page.However, the love story is a bit cliche: two individual falling in love, but had an entirely different background, one trying to find a way to work things out, one is haunted by a past of the-love-that-went-wrong relationship, etc. Nevertheless, Sparks choice of words, descriptions on the scenery, the way the two main characters meet up, and how their feelings progress cover up any flaws in the book.The pacing at some point seemed rushed, but that's simply to prove how love can create miracles, and time had nothing to help or prevent it from happening."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"If you are a Nicholas Sparks fan like I am you will not be disapointed by his novel \\"True Believer\\". Love and sparks fly for the hero and heroine. Generous story line and believable characters make this book perfect. You have got to read it.[...]"},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"The premise of this book somewhat reminded me of another that I recently came across and loved: Bark of the Dogwood. Both books deal with a New Yorker going to some place else (the south in both cases) on a mission. But once there they both find more than they bargained for. I do have to say that the Sparks book was much more acessible and easy to read. While I loved them both, I'm been N. Sparks fan from way back. Jeremy Marsh is the main character in this latest Sparks novel, and his background in journalism and his interests make him a fascinating character enough without the journey to a small North Carolina town being thrown in. But it all works wonderfully and whether you like Mr. Spark's novels or not, there's NO WAY you'll want to miss this one. It's really more along the lines of a good Grisham novel than his usual fare. Highly recommended to book lovers of all genres."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"True Believer provides another solid showing from best selling author Nicholas Sparks. However, this is not the best Sparks work out there. Here, Sparks uses his typical love story plot to take the reader to the rural North Carolina, where psychics, ghosts, and premonitions are a normal occurrence. Jeremy Marsh is, as the main character, a critic who focuses on debunking the strange. As his writing takes him to North Carolina, Jeremy has to decide what is real, and what is worth risking everything for. Fans of Sparks will recognize his \\"Can their love survive?\\" themes. True Believer provides an enjoyable read, but is not as successful in drawing the reader into the love story as other Sparks' novels have been. Too much time is spent laying the groundwork for the supernatural for the reader to become fully engaged in the underlying love story."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"I have to agree with many of the other reviewers. The premise had me interested then the story did not amount to much. I was let down at the end. The problem is I finished the book because I already bought the next one At First Sight. I think Sparks really dropped the ball on this one. It was such a let down from his other novels that I was surprised."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"Wooo! This book was a total snoozefest. The romantic connection between the two main characters is barely made by the author. The element of any suspense regarding the lights in the cemetary is not there at all. I skimmed through the majority of the book trying to sledge my way through it thinking it would pick up at some point. Unfortunately I ended up tossing it away around chapter 16. Dreadful read.I normally enjoy Sparks' tales, but this one was by far his worst book, and not worth your money. We won't be seeing this one made in to a movie."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"Nicholas Spark's, you have let me down. TRUE BELIEVER reads as if it was written by a teenager who has had little experience when it comes to love. The story is totally unrealistic and unmoving.

Those two are worthy!!"},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"Please don't tell me that this is the new Nicholas Sparks. This new book is totally BORING.

Goodness....I really hope Nicholas goes back to writing well-respected love stories like The Notebook"},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"This was the biggest waste of time I've experienced in a long while. The romance was so far-fetched and unrealistic it was laughable...like he would really be so gung ho about a girl who wouldn't give him the time of day after just meeting her. And the whole mysterious lights thing was a MAJOR letdown. I teach special education and I'm positive most of my students would be able to come up with a more creative and interesting explanation that Sparks did. Nicholas Sparks has always been one of my favorite authors but this book was just ridiculous. He better step it up for the next book or I won't be spending my cash on any more."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"Jeremy Marsh is a handsome young journalist who is assigned to cover a story about mysterious lights which appear in the small town of Boone Creek, North Carolina. When he arrives, he meets the town librarian, Lexie Darnell, who soon lets him know that she has been hurt by romances in the past and she refuses to get involved with a big-city man such as himself. They spend the rest of the book falling in love and trying to resist each other because they are so different and they lead very different lives. Usually the best part of Nicholas Sparks novels is the depth of his characters, but somehow Jeremy and Lexie don't become as well-developed or as loveable as many characters in Sparks' other books. He has written some memorable books with somewhat tragic endings, but this book is all fluff and not much substance. Hopefully Sparks will return to what he does best in the future."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"What happened? Where did my amazing author go? This was a disappointment for me. In every Sparks book I am SO glued to it I can't put it down. This one I bought the day it came out and FINALLY finished it a week and a half later. I couldn't absorb this story. I could read the ending right after meeting Doris and knowing about her 'power'. I NEVER guess Sparks endings. I am usually the one crying my eyes out, smiling that he blindsided me with something I did NOT expect! This was like every other romance novel. Nothing spectacular. I didn't like Jeremy. He seemed to perfect in that 'stud' way, I couldn't tell how genuine he was. Lexie just struck me as being the 'let's feel sorry for me' type. Too sappy and I just didn't get into it.

I read The Notebook and thought at that point there was some type of slant to his writing. However, the slant is now as level as the monitor of a patient whose heart no longer beats. I once interviewed a well-known writer who told me that he would quit writing before he would write just for the sake of seeing his name in print. I know Mr. Sparks has a decent track record to date, but the familiar plots and repetitious characters are beginning to tire his public. Perhaps it's time to take a respite from writing and come up with something original for a change. Just a suggestion."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"This book was not in any way dissapointing.

Everything in him is too simple and too perfect even in it's misery. No meaningful reason for anything happening.

All other nicholas sparks books pull you in and you can't put them down. It took my two weeks to read the whole book, all other books I read in two days. My thought is to skip this one."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"It is indeed unfortunate that after Nicholas Sparks spent so much time constructing a really interesting and nuanced storyline, he utilized it simply as the setup for the conclusion of a true \\"feel good\\" romance, with the final chapter best characterized as five-star schmaltz. Thus, while I realize that some of Sparks' readers will be delighted with a simple love story that eschews the bittersweet nature of much of his work, and I certainly enjoy a well written story examining the mystery of romance, my rating of only three stars reflects my reaction to a plot that had so much unrealized potential. If the author had put a little more effort into providing a conclusion consistent with the earlier complexity of the story and had also provided more closure regarding all the wonderful secondary characters who he made the effort to infuse with life for the reader, he would have made me into a TRUE BELIEVER that his story deserved a full five stars.The universal question explored by this novel has been asked innumerable times before in story, play and verse - can a young man and woman of very different backgrounds and who have made very different lifestyle choices find enough common ground to experience more than a temporary attraction to each other? In this case specifically -what happens when Jeremy Marsh (a sophisticated and successful young scientific investigative reporter who enjoys life on the Upper West Side of New York City) travels to rural Boone Creek, North Carolina to debunk the supernatural explanation of ghostly lights that recurrently appear in a local cemetery and meets the charming and aloof Lexie Darnell? The setup is leisurely, interesting and complex, and Jeremy is soon drawn into the complex history of the town and finds himself increasingly as intrigued by Lexie as by the mystery which he professionally wants to explain. The inhabitants and their relationships are drawn well enough to make the town come alive, especially Doris McClellan, the aunt who had raised Lexie and whose letter had piqued Jeremy's interest and drawn him to Boone Creek. And while most of the humor is low key, there are a few real laugh-out-loud moments, mostly with regard to Jed, the local taxidermist and proprietor of Greenleaf Cottages, \\"the Museum of Natural history transformed into a horror movie and squeezed into a closet\\". As the novel proceeds, while the threads of the mystery are gradually being unraveled, the background details of Lexie's and Jeremy's previous romantic entanglements and their emotional baggage which remains add depth to the story.So, what's not to like? There are interesting characters, some humor and a little mystery, to add color to a romantic backdrop. Unfortunately, it is the promise of all these elements which made the abrupt conclusion such a letdown for me. The table was set, a delicious meal served, and then the final course was an overly sweet confection with no substance. In addition, a further minor complaint involved was one major flaw in the rush to conclusion which should have been spotted and corrected by the editors, who were apparently in as much of a hurry to keep to the publishing schedule as was the author. I can't provide details without including a spoiler, but it was disappointing given the attention to detail throughout the rest of the book.In comparison to Spark's other recent books which I have read, I much preferred this book to THE GUARDIAN (two star review 5/27/2003) but felt that it lacked the spareness, simplicity and emotional power of the excellent NIGHTS IN RODANTHE (four star review 10/24/2002). I also acknowledge that TRUE BELIEVER would make a wonderful movie with the right director and actors. My criticism would be less valid given the visual storytelling nature of that medium; such a goal may well explain Spark's rather summary conclusion. However, I in fact am disappointed by the increasing tendency of authors to shortchange their readers with books which are actually screenplays in disguise and hope that my suspicion is wrong in this case.Finally, lest you think that my reactions are too ambivalent and criticisms overly harsh, the following statistics provide some indication that other reviewers share my conclusions. There are 81 reviews that have previously posted, certainly enough to provide a valid statistical sample. My observation (admittedly anecdotal) is that in most instances of a fiction bestseller by a popular (and noncontroversial) author, the reviews will be overwhelming favorable. Yet in this case the distribution is almost even, with only a few more five star reviews than the other categories and less than half the reviews being four or five stars. (The totals are 5*-21, 4*-16, 3*-16, 2*-14, 1*-14). Obviously, a lot of readers felt even more disappointed as I was.Tucker Andersen"},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"Do NOT read the review of Nicholas Sparks's upcoming book \\"At First Sight\\" if you haven't finished reading True Believer.I just did and it pretty much gives away a smidget of what happens in True Believer.With that aside, all of the books from Nicholas Sparks are worth it.

This unfortunately is a slow and boring story that is very predictable! But it had great potential."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. I feel that all of Nicholas Spark's books are amazing, and I have read them all. This one had a happy ending, which was really nice. I enjoyed the characters, they seemed very real."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"This book was just okay. It didn't take very long to read, but it didn't grab my attention either. The plot was weak and the characters weren't nearly as memorbale as Sparks is obviously capable of making them. An okay book that will disappoint most of his fans, but for the most part not bad."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"Does anybody write so beautifully about the romantic love between a man and woman like Nicholas Sparks? This is not my favorate story of his, but miles and miles above the rest out there. I would start with The Notebook if I were new to him, then Message In A Bottle."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"As a fan of Nicholas Sparks, I've come to appreciate the predictability his stories provide. I enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone looking for a light-hearted, quick read. If you're looking for intense characters and plot lines, this is not the book for you... but if you're just looking to unwind, you will enjoy it!"},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"True Believer is the fourth N.S. book I've read. While it is a good book there are parts in the book that are just not enjoyable. You have to force yourself to get past those parts to move on to more exciting parts. The overall story is cute and I really liked the ending but, it is not my favorite N.S. book."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"This was a really relaxed book for Sparks -- this was a nice, easy read but not a page-turner for me. I like some of his other higher-drama selections a little better, but found this book to be fun and interesting."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"I listened to this as an audio-book, so my experience may differ from that of other people.I've read/listened to a few Nicholas Sparks books over the years and this one didn't strike me as anything special. Usually, by the end of the book I have some tears in my eyes over some tragedy or reunion that has happened, but with True Believer...nothing.This is the story of Jeremy Marsh and his experience in Boone Creek, NC. Jeremy is a reporter from the big city (NYC) who comes into town to do a story on the \\"ghosts\\" in the cemetery in town. Jeremy is the kind of reporter who likes to debunk hoaxes like people who \\"talk to the dead\\" and ghost stories. This visit to Boone Creek is no different.Jeremy gets to Boone Creek, the kind of small town where everybody knows everybody's business, and he meets a girl named Lexi; surprise. They don't hit it off at first and are quite sarcastic to each other; surprise. The rest of the story unfolds as Jeremy and Lexi (who happens to be the town librarian which means he needs her to do his research) get to know each other and Jeremy tries to figure out if the ghosts are real or not.Like I said, the book just seemed kind of ho-hum to me. There is a sequel which I will be listening to next, so we'll see if this picks up the pace on the drama or not. Nothing particularly wrong with the book, just nothing particularly engaging either."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"This was the first book by Nicholas Sparks I have ever read so I could not compare it to his others. I, however, did enjoy this book. I wasn't as interested in the love aspect of the book, as I was in what he did for a living. Trying to figure out what the lights in the cemetery are intrigued me, and I think that is why I liked the book as much as I did. If it was just a love story, I wouldn't have enjoyed it so much."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"I got this product used so I was a little nervous.

Though it does take a few chapters to get your mind racing, What happens next? What just happened? , the book is a page turner from there on. It kept me guessing until the very last sentence. I have read many of Sparks other books and this book is something special. I believe this book tells a story that, in many of his other books as well, can really happen. This story isn't a piece of fiction with dragons and ghosts but has a taste of reality which makes it very believable. It touched my heart! If you are fond of his other novels such as The Notebook or A Walk to Remember, you will definitely enjoy this one. Even if you have never picked up one of his stories, I recommend that you do so. It doesn't hurt to try."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"This book started out a bit slow for me but as always, it ending is always worth the ride."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"Another well written book by Nicholas Sparks. I have not read one yet that I did not like."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"Three-fourths through the book I knew that he was going to return with the girl at the very end, somehow. In this case, Doris was the one who brought them together. If she hadn't gone to New York and told Jeremy that she wasn't really going to marry Rodney, and that it was a lie, them he probably would of kept on wondering what would have happend between them. But overall, great story.I recommend this book to everyone who enjoys reading romance novels. Take my word, I guarantee it."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"Wasn't my favorite but definitely another good book!!

Nicholas Sparks is a great writer!"},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"I have read almost all of Nicholas Sparks books. I am a HUGE fan. After reading the back, I was thinking this was going to be my favorite one....wrong. There isn't anything thrilling about the paranormal stuff going on as you may think. I think the \\"love\\" part of this story is the most unrealistic plot yet. Jeremy fell so hard for her within a few days of just speaking to her....yeah right.(It worked in \\"Dear John\\", but not this novel) I didn't connect with either one of the main characters. I didn't feel butterflies or any kind of emotion like I usually do with Sparks. I strongly disliked Lexie. She is a snob and she is so stuck in her ways. Hopefully,\\"At First Sight\\" will be better. Out of all of his great books why did he make a sequel to his worst one?"},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"This Is One Of The Best Books I've Read.

But it is not like the others, the love doesn't come till later so hold out because it is s poo good!!!"},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"I think Mr. Sparks is channeling Danielle Steel. This trite piece of \\"literature\\" was not even a good enough to classify as a \\"light summer read\\" (in my humble opinion). I mean, how many times can a writer have his character \\"roll her eyes\\" to indicate flirting, exasperation, etc.? When he had the main male character roll his eyes as well, it was simply irritating. This is so NOT the Nicholas Sparks I had come to love through his earlier works. I feel as if Mr. Sparks has sold out...is he required by his publisher to churn out a specific number of novels in a time frame? If so, he is doing this with complete disregard to substance, quality, and plot."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"After reading The Notebook and The Wedding, I was an instant fan of Nicholas Sparks. However, this book was a dissappointment. The love story (and other plot lines) were completely predictable and stale. I found it hard to believe that true love was found in a matter of five days for Mr. Jeremy Marsh and that the beautiful Lexie was 30 something and happily single, living in a small town. The ending is also somewhat cheesy, but I won't ruin it for you die-hard fans that still want to read this sappy book. Do yourself a favor and buy the Time Travler's Wife if you want a love story that is effective and romantic!"},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"I just want to know, who is going to take the Jeremy Marsh role to the movies, because this has been done before and Michael J. Fox isn't available.The silly little charming movie \\"Doc Hollywood\\" pretty much covered all the bases that Mr. Sparks touches here. When I saw the title I briefly thought of the searing trial movie \\"True Believer\\" but . . . . wasn't that either.This is a nice little love story. You don't have to work at it. It's not irritating as a James Patterson cereal book is nor as complicated as LeCarre. Or preachy like Crichton. Or bloody like Connolly. It's real simple. If you feel in the mood for the love story of the cynical Jeremy Marsh leaving the trappings of NYC to go to Boone Creek to woo the beautiful girl almost in the clutches of the town . . . whoops, I'm giving you the whole book.Nice read. 4 stars. Larry Scantlebury"},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"Don't get me wrong, I loved \\"Doc Hollywood\\", but because I knew it so well, it made this book seem very predictable. Guy from a big city comes to a small town in the South. Finds the people who live there to be very quirky. Sees a woman and is attracted immediately.Yes, there is a side story about ghosts in the cemetery, which starts off really interesting. However, by the end of the book it loses its punch.Overall, the book was okay. But I felt like the whole time I was reading it that I had already heard this story before in \\"Doc Hollywood.\\""},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"As an avid Nicholas Sparks fan, I have waited a long time for TRUE BELIEVER to come out. However, after completing the book, I am left with an empty, unsatisfied feeling.A true departure from his other works, TRUE BELIEVER ranks somewhere between \\"Okay\\" and \\"Good.\\" (His books usually rank in the \\"Best Books I've Ever Read Category.\\") Fans of Sparks will like his engaging characters, flawless settings, and realistic dialogue, but the plot will probably bring disappointment. Predictable and way too informational/want-to-be mysterious, for Sparks' regulars, the book just doesn't compete with some of his other works.Read one of Sparks' romantic genre stories--love proves to be his gift."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"When I picked up True Believer, I was anticipating a good mystery as well as the chance to empathize with sensitively drawn characters. Neither panned out. This book is boring. The characters are one-dimensional and there is no mystery. Too much detail and not enough substance. Not sure what the point of the story was as I didn't get it."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"This book proves once again, that you don't necessarily have to be a good writer to make lots of cash and sell huge quantities of books to the mass market. \\"True Believer\\" is an all-star team of cheap, shallow cliches. There is no plot. No one really believes anything, and everything is a contrived, superficial mish-mash. The dialoge has no depth, and when you've had too much dialoge, there's paragraph after paragraph of the main characters, \\"thinking\\" to themselves. Wow, is this bad. \\"Message in a Bottle\\" was a great plot idea, but its been a slow, steady descent since then. You might have a good laugh at it like I did, but otherwise I was very disappointed."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"The last good Sparks book that I read was Nights in Rodanthe. I mean, what's with all the spooky stuff, why not follow the path started?. Mr. Sparks, I know new material is hard to come by, but to an author with your potential this work is mediocre!! I hope Nickolas delivers more of his old work. They were facinating."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"I thought this was a good book, and the way the two characters fell so quickly for one another (in a matter of days) reminded me of Nights in Rodanthe (which is my fave). Nicholas Sparks has done it again, with another novel that shows that miracles can happen when you least expect them, and that love conquers all."},{"Title":"True Believer","review":"I have read all of Sparks books. Some are great, others are well, not.This book was a HUGE disappointment. The first 170 pages say nothing that the other 169 haven't already said. I couldn't figure out the point. He introduces characters we could care less about. His writing is dull. He doesn't say anything of interest, just rambles on.The story goes no where for the first 2/3 of the book. My high school daughter could've written a more interesting book.Save your money."},{"Title":"They Found Atlantis","review":"This book, published in the 1930s, is somewhat different Wheatley fare. For one thing, it's unusually imaginative, with Wheatley's descriptions of aquatic and other life found by the protagonists during deep-sea explorationn in quest of lost Atlantis believable and lively. Likewise enjoyable is the adventure the characters undergo when, saved by chance from stultifying death on the ocean floor, they encounter a race of horrible, fish-eating humanoids who chase them until they finally reach the lost island of Atlantis, now existing in a submerged but beautiful state, with a race of pleasure loving, peaceful survivors. The legend of Atlantis has fascinated many, and the book reveals how even decades ago people believed the lost continent to have stood on what is now the Azores. They Found Atlantis demonstrates the fascination that continues until today with the tale of a perfect world that was destroying itself before being destroyed."},{"Title":"My Saviour; or, Devotional meditations in prose and verse, on the names and titles of the Lord Jesus Christ,","review":"This little gem from John East is a treasure for all who hunger and thirst for the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

The writers state that if you see birds or other animals eating something, it is safe. If you follow this recommendation, make a good will first. What is poisonous to one animal is safe for another. (Like dogs are poisoned by chocolate.) Know your plants! Also, I object when they recommend burying your used cans after burning them first.

He knows whereof he speaks, as he is a former Detective Inspector for the Amsterdam Police, with a career which spanned thirty-eight years. He features Inspector Dekok in at least sixteen addition mysteries which have been translated into English.This volume includes two Inspector Dekok mysteries: Dekok and the Sunday Strangler and Dekok and the Corpse on Christmas Eve. Both stories deal with the murder of women: the first is a killer who preys on prostitutes, and the second is a killer who preys on the office workers at his company. Both are excellent studies in human nature. Dekok is the epitome of the grizzled veteran detective, and his sidekick, Vledder, is in awe of Dekok's experience and intelligence:&quot;Of course, you didn't dare tackle it on your own, I bet. You thought: come, let's call Dekok out of bed. The old man will take care of it, right? You thought: Why should I take a chance on messing it up, when I can lean on the old man. Isn't that so? That's what you thought, right?' Vledder looked at him searchingly. Was that a reproach? Did it sound as a reproach? He did not know. The expression on the face of the experienced photographer was unreadable.&quot;Baantjer's writing style is smooth and flowing. Dekok is a superb character...sort of a combination of Columbo and Hercule Poirot. He is intelligent; is a family man; has a good heart; and is very forgiving of the blunders of his prot??. The plot lines are steady and believable, and the dialogue is full of interesting witticisms and give-and-take between Dekok and Vledder. One feels as if Dekok is very much of a master detective, shaping Vledder into what will eventually be a fine detective to take his place. At the same time, Dekok is very much in control of his own emotions as he navigates through the world of murder and intrigue.Baantjer is a expert narrator who takes the reader deep into the world which police have to inhabit as part of their jobs. He even makes funny little asides to the reader about people who love mysteries, almost as if he is reaching out to touch his audience and give them a tweak on the cheek. This is an excellent and entertaining mystery from a skillful writer and profound thinker.Shelley GlodowskiReviewer"},{"Title":"Murder in Amsterdam","review":"Mysteries that take place in other countries, othere cultures are enjoyable on two levels.

Over the past two years I have lost people I loved. My mother died suddenly when I was not present, my father had alzheimers and died after a long illness in the hospital. We were on deathwatch for a week before he was removed from life support. This book touched me in ways I cannot explain and yet were so powerful I considered giving a copy of it to everyone who told me \\"this is for the best\\" or \\"it will be okay\\". As Joan Didion said in her equally powerful book The Year of Magical Thinking, in times of sadness she \\"turns to the literature\\" to make sense of it all. This is what I also do and I found The Farewell Chronicles does not deal with \\"petty\\" reactions to grief at all. It cuts through the gloss and fat and confronts the reader with difficult situations and emotions, she writes how our culture has erased traditional reactions to grief, the months of public mourning, the dress code, and how for thousands of years a funeral was something attended to by the whole tribe. She writes about how relief contrasts with guilt after years of caring for a chronically ill loved one, about how our apathy as a child turns to grief as we get old enough to understand death's impact. I could go on. This book brought me to tears many times. Perhaps this is because it is still so soon after my parent's death but it is also with a sense of relief that someone has put all these difficult emotions into words so eloquent I couldn't express it better myself. And of course, as my title says, I may just be different and this work is valuable for me in a different way it might be valuable for someone who has not experienced a recent loss. I'm just glad she wrote it and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Farewell Chronicles: How We Really Respond to Death","review":"An excellent perspective on death and grieving.

With everyone telling me of their sympathies and how \\"it will get better\\", I wasn't feeling much but a sense of relief. Both he and I had prepared and expected his death, it came as no surprise. I needed this book and plan on giving it to another friend who recently suffered a loss of a loved one.

It was great."},{"Title":"The Farewell Chronicles: How We Really Respond to Death","review":"So much written about grief is well intended but trite, or else, in some way or other, an evasion of the horror that has happened. But in this book Ms. Rufus, a professional journalist and author skilled in the use of humor for serious purposes, has explored our reactions, both to loss and to dealing others' reactions to our loss, with exactly the seemingly mundane ironic tone that hits right on into our emotions. This one's a keeper--and also for giving to friends who have suffered loss."},{"Title":"The Farewell Chronicles: How We Really Respond to Death","review":"This book was an interesting read.

Almost every page offers some (real life) anecdote about a person who responded in a petty fashion to grief. There's a stoy about a girl who was mocked behind her back, and then after her death as well. There's a story about a woman who manipulated her mother's will to get the best possessions. And so it goes. Not very appetizing, however true to life such reactions may be.Do people really feel all these things when their loved one dies? Perhaps, but isn't it a sweeping assertion to say so? And will giving this book to someone who is grieving really make them feel any better? Somehow I doubt it."},{"Title":"Great Quotes from Great Leaders","review":"This book doesn't cost very much, but it doesn't provide a lot either.

Traven, about the birth of the Mexican Revolution. The story centers around the exploitation of slave-laborers on a mahogany plantation, known as a monteria. There is little in the way of a conventional plot. Traven assumes the role of anthropologist as he explains the layout of a monteria, its power structure, the brutal methods used to exploit the Mexican Indians, and details of the daily grind they suffer as they cut down the trees, haul them with the aid of oxen through dense humid jungle which is infested with mosquitoes and biting flies, poisonous snakes, scorpions, panthers, and the cutting whips of the overseers. Though Traven's focus is on the corruption of the Diaz regime (1876-1910), the events that brought about his downfall, the social structure which places the illiterate dark-skinned Indians at the mercy of exploitive light-skinned Spaniards, the scheming-as-matter-of-policy among the local officials - from the police chiefs, judges, and tax assessors to the doctors, priests, monteria contractors and fincerias (the powerful landowners)- ultimately the book powerfully illustrates man's inhumanity to man. I was shocked and outraged - as I turned the pages - at the social structure which allowed this injustice to exist. (It is clear if one watches Mexican television programs - with light-skinned European looking men and women holding political office and on the soap operas and news, as well as the vast numbers of dark-skinned Indians migrating north to the U.S. in search of opportunity, that sadly little has changed since the Mexican Revolution). Trozas is also about human dignity in the face overwhelming suffering. Trozas is a grim book in a grim series of books, but an important one that needs to be read, for it enlightens the reader not only about Mexican history and the rise of the Mexican Revolution, but about the politics of evil and one aspect of the human condition. Traven has an easy, flowing style. He creates vivid characters and memorable scenes. He has an excellent ear for dialogue. Long after reading the book one can see and feel and hear the jungle and the pitiless human struggle for existence within it. This is a truly classic series of books which are gaining in popularity, especially on college campuses in Latino and ethnic studies classes. Traven for years languished in semi-obscurity, though he was once nominated for the Nobel Prize in literature. As the wave of class, race, ethnic, and gender studies has grown over the past two decades, Traven is being re-evaluated by critics and readers and is justly gaining in popularity and prestige."},{"Title":"Trozas: A Novel (Jungle Novels)","review":"I don't think I could add more than the Julian Barham review except to say, I love this book! This is the fourth book of the jungle series. I would recommend that one read the jungle series in order (i.e., Government, Carreta, March to the Monteria, Trozas, Rebellion of the Hanged, General from the Jungle). It is not absolutely necessary to read them in order but some characters show up in the later books (e.g., Don Gabriel from &quot;Goverment&quot; is referred to quite often, and Andres from &quot;the Carreta&quot; is present in the March to the Monteria and Trozas, amongst others). The characters from previous books are not necessarily covered in detail, so having this background of info about them sort of solidifies the story. The path of the characters is intertwined throughout the series.I usually don't assign myself to such reading, like it's some sort of required reading for a class but in my opinion this is some of the most insightful and compelling writing I have ever read.

Traven around the economic class structure of Mexico during the dictatorship of Porfirio Diaz.The book is short on plot and short on character development, but it gives almost a case study version of the inhumane conditions that peons endured on the debt slavery mahogany plantation.Andre again plays a role, as he did in The Carreta and March to the Monteria. He wishes to return to his common law wife but must toil under unbelieveable conditions to work off his father's debts.Celso also plays a role, as he did in March to the Monteria where he was the primary heroic figure. He is strong, heroic, dignified, and yet caught in the web of jungle, insects, disease, and violence along with all the other Indian men slaveing for the Spaniards.Whereas man's injustice to man is certainly the major theme of this book, the theme of survival under incredible conditions also runs throughout the book.In March to the Monteria, Cleso is a strong young Indian male, working nude in the jungle, hacking down tons of mahogany a day. He tries to escape once his debt is paid and due to his skill, the owners always find a hidden charge and bring him back. In Trozas he tries to maintain his dignity and raise the consciousness of the other men.In The Carreta, Andre is an oxen cart drive with a young common-law wife. InTrozas these skills are put to use as the drags mahoganylogs through muddy swamps to the the river where they can be floated to the lumber mills. He also is trapped.The reason I did not give this book a 5 star rating however is that it really had little plot or character development. It was best described as a study in the economic injustices that allowed much of Mexico's dark Indians to be suppressed and exploited by the white Spainards. Victor Hugo always had a tendency to engage in social studies in his work, but he always returned to the plot. I wish Traven had been more of a novelist and less of an anthropologist."},{"Title":"Trozas: A Novel (Jungle Novels)","review":"Yet another good story of hardship and triumph of the human spirit in old Mexico."},{"Title":"Elegant wits and grand horizontals;: A sparkling panorama of \\"la belle epoque,\\" its gilded society, irrepressible wits and splendid courtesans","review":"For an excellent view of upper class Paris of the 1890s you can look no further than this exciting and colorfully drawn book. Skinner sketches portraits of the people that darted in and out of the Parisian papers in a very human, dry and truthful touch. From the elegant wits of Boni de Castellane and Robert Montesquei to the Grand Horizontals of Liane de Pougy and La Belle Otero, and the equally fascinating society women in between, you'll be taken on a dazzling world that you won't wish to abandon.Filled with 20 pictures from the times as well as details on the social round of Belle Epoque Paris--which rivaled that of late Victorian England--this book is a must see for fans of the English period who wish to know what was happening on the other side of the Channel(the French called it \\"The Sleeve\\"), as well as longtime Belle Epoque fans."},{"Title":"Elegant wits and grand horizontals;: A sparkling panorama of \\"la belle epoque,\\" its gilded society, irrepressible wits and splendid courtesans","review":"Elegant Wits & Grand Horizontals, Cornelia Otis Skinner; Houghton Mifflin Co.

Its about a cowboy that smokes weed, and gets into a lot of crazy situations. Wish I could find it so I could reread it and see if it was as good as I remember.

I bought this book in March 2005 for the list price, now that the price is reduced, it might be a better deal. Still expensive for a paperback of only 208 pages, almost half checklists and exhibits. It is authored by Hildebrandt International, which provides consulting advice to merging law firms. I felt I was reading a promotional brochure for the consulting service. There is some useful insight but at a common-sense level, not so much that is penetrating insight. Obscure topic, so if you want information you might have limited choices, hence my purchase. Another book (not purchased by this reviewer) Law Firm Mergers : Taking a Strategic Approach is also by Hildebrandt; why do they have two books on the same topic?"},{"Title":"Anatomy of a Law Firm Merger: How to Make or Break the Deal","review":"This book contained a few moderately useful lists, but for the most part contained little of particular value. It is too superficial to be of much use to a large firm merger, and bears little relevancy to the needs of a small firm merger. The most useful part of the book is not the book itself, but the accompanying forms disk, which can help provide a little structure to your thinking when evaluating and planning a law firm merger."},{"Title":"LASTING IMPRESSIONS: WEAVING LITERATURE INTO THE WRITING WORKSHOP","review":"Shelley Harwayne really captures the importance of exposing children to literature, involving them in it, and relating it to their lives. She encourages sharing their family stories, forming a bond with a literate adult and reading together. She says you should let the children laugh, cry, support, and gently nudge one another to build a community of learning and sharing. Her book is best summed up in her words, &quot;Fill them up. Read aloud, read silently, recite, do choral readings, tell stories, dramatize, sing. Fill them up some more. Then step back and watch what happens&quot;(page 1). She goes on to discuss literature as a seedbed for discovering topics and for the writer's notebook, listening, mentors, booktalk, confering and record keeping, and mini-lessons. A great book! A must buy!"},{"Title":"The Day of St. Anthony's Fire: The Suspenseful, True Account of a Medieval Plague in Modern Times, and of the Scientific Detective Work that Traced it to a Suprising Cause","review":"This is an extensive analysis by a journalist of the outbreak of ergot poisoning in Pont St.Esprit, France (Provence) in 1951. It is based on personal interviews and documents, as well as on discussions with the doctors involved. It is perhaps the most complete case study of mass ergot poisoning in literature. It is very valuable to any historian wishing to understand one of the most feared and puzzling diseases of the Middle Ages."},{"Title":"The Day of St. Anthony's Fire: The Suspenseful, True Account of a Medieval Plague in Modern Times, and of the Scientific Detective Work that Traced it to a Suprising Cause","review":"This book caught my eye in the college library while I was researching the topic. I didn't put it down for the two days it took me to read it. It covers not only &quot;historical ergotism&quot; (which has been deemed the culprit of the Salem Witch trials and other witch hunts by some) but also the case of the 1950's Pt. St. Esprit poisoning in France, which was attributed by the local authorities to a mercury pesticide. Read it, be absolutely amazed, not only at the events, but at the &quot;official judgement&quot; and subsequent injustice of the later rulings towards the poisoned survivors of that fateful night. I also recommend Mary Matossion's Poisons of the Past for more info on historical ergotism."},{"Title":"The Day of St. Anthony's Fire: The Suspenseful, True Account of a Medieval Plague in Modern Times, and of the Scientific Detective Work that Traced it to a Suprising Cause","review":"This is an amazing book. The historical account is fascinating. I am also floored by how well Fuller wove in a multitude of personal stories, gave a rich account of a very complex incident, then beautifully encapsulated the 15-year legal tragedy that followed the original tragedy. You don't come across stories like this every day, and you certainly don't often come across treatments of them that are this good.It's not written at a sixth-grade level -- a plus for me -- but nowadays I doubt an editor would let Fuller get away with all the French phrases and excerpts he put in the book. Back then I suppose authors could assume they had a more sophisticated readership. I liked the sprinkling of French, sometimes even original letters (translated to English, of course), but if you don't know any French at all, you might want to read this with a dictionary at hand."},{"Title":"The Day of St. Anthony's Fire: The Suspenseful, True Account of a Medieval Plague in Modern Times, and of the Scientific Detective Work that Traced it to a Suprising Cause","review":"This is a fantastic read about the discovery of the psychedelic drug LSD and the town that endured that horrific event."},{"Title":"The Day of St. Anthony's Fire: The Suspenseful, True Account of a Medieval Plague in Modern Times, and of the Scientific Detective Work that Traced it to a Suprising Cause","review":"Read this book many years ago and was amazed at the detective work of one French doctor who got to the bottom of the botulism poisoning and changed French laws regarding the monopoly of buying flour in various regions of France. It made sound \\"dry\\" - it is not. I could not put it down. It certainly puts to the test the practice (admirable) of buying local goods. Okay, if the product is good - deadly, if you have no choice on where you get your goods."},{"Title":"The Day of St. Anthony's Fire: The Suspenseful, True Account of a Medieval Plague in Modern Times, and of the Scientific Detective Work that Traced it to a Suprising Cause","review":"I won't go over the story, as other reviewers already have.

Amazing story of the source of death due to war - but not guns and weapons."},{"Title":"The Day of St. Anthony's Fire: The Suspenseful, True Account of a Medieval Plague in Modern Times, and of the Scientific Detective Work that Traced it to a Suprising Cause","review":"John Fuller wrote a few ghost and UFO books - this is none of them, but rather an intriguing description of the incredible events which happened in the French countryside in the 1950s.Ergotism is a form of poisoning stemming from a parasitic fungus growing on rye. By means of improper storage and an incompetent central flour distribution bureaucracy, a small town in France, Pont St. Esprit, ended up with a big chunk of poisoned flour. Bakers baked their bread with it, and the townspeople ate it - disaster ensued. Depending on the amount of bread they ate, different people received different dosages. Some became simply sleepless and wired, while others died and some experienced full blown hallucinations.Yes, hallucinations similar to those evoked by LSD - a substance which only a decade earlier had first been synthesized not too far from Pont St. Esprit, in Switzerland. And LSD is chemically based on the active compound in the ergot fungus. Ergotism ravaged Europe regularly in the middle ages - the 1951 outbreak in Pont St. Esprit was likely the last of this strange episodes, throwing whole communities into a psychedelic rage they did not understand. Only a few years later would LSD make its way out of the Sandoz laboratories into the brains of the 60s enlightenment seekers. In a way, the episode described in this book is a passing of the guard of the role of ergotamines in human culture.Fuller writes very well. He describes some of the history, village life and landscape surrounding Pont St. Esprit, and gives vivid, personal descriptions of the intoxication that caught the villagers. He also describes in a lot of detail the struggle against the ignorant bureaucracy in their quest for compensation for their suffering. A well written book about a highly unusual episode."},{"Title":"The Day of St. Anthony's Fire: The Suspenseful, True Account of a Medieval Plague in Modern Times, and of the Scientific Detective Work that Traced it to a Suprising Cause","review":"I read this book in the early 1970s, always remembered it.

Muir's description of Carpenter as auteur, a modern-day successor to Howard Hawks, provides a wholly satisfying perspective that opens up Carpenter's career to a much needed reevaluation. With in-depth and genuinely interesting commentary on all of Carpenter's films (including those films Carpenter has produced, written, and executive produced), Muir really shines in putting each film into the perspective of Carpenter's entire body of work. His analysis of Halloween is probably the finest thing you'll ever read about a film that has been analyzed for a generation by anyone writing about modern horror.Strongly recommended not just for Carpenter buffs but for anyone really wanting to understand what it means to be an auteur and not just a director. While many film critiques take the reader through familiar paces on films to which he or she is already familiar, Muir adds much to his subject, adding luster to Carpenter's films (and all but compelling the reader to grab some popcorn and take a fresh ride through Carpenter's world).As a John Carpenter fan for nearly a generation, John Muir's book only made this reader appreciate Carpenter more -- there's an accomplishment. A fine job, worthy of real estate in any film buff's book case, and not likely to be surpassed."},{"Title":"The Films of John Carpenter","review":"Perhaps the greatest research and analysis of any filmmaker (let alone of Carpenter himself) I've had ever the joy of reading. Muir certainly gave me a completely different perspective of Carpenter's films. I actually found myself going back and re-watching scenes of his films I've watched a million times in a new light (After learning of Carpenter's motivations for &quot;Escape From L.A.&quot; in this book, I went from seeing it as a so-so sequel, to terrific remake!). I can't reccomend it enough to anyone who, like myself, would call Carpenter their favorite director. His reviews and insights are both honest and insightful (his critique of the Carpenter produced &quot;Halloween III&quot;, a guilty pleasure of mine, had me roaring with laughter). Don't balk at the price, it's absolutley worth it as it is packed full of fascinating information. If you-re a die hard Carpenter fan, you'll be missing out if you pass this up."},{"Title":"The Films of John Carpenter","review":"Muir's comprehensive analysis of the works of John Carpenter moves even the dilettante to review them with a more appreciative perspective. Muir reveals interesting sociological and psychological themes within Carpenter's works that compel the reader to truly re-evaluate Carpenter's talent.The book was obviously written by an author who &quot;knows his stuff&quot; and appreciates the full value of the subject matter. This is what makes reading this work enjoyable and entertaining. I recommend this book to any fan or critic of the works of John Carpenter."},{"Title":"The Films of John Carpenter","review":"I ordered this book after buying and enjoying three others by this author and found this one to be another excellent addition to my library. This book contains detailed information on each of Mr. Carpenter's films including a synopsis,list of cast and crew,critical reception for each film and a section with the author's commentary. This book is extremely well written and a very enjoyable read. I find myself looking through it often and it has led me to pick up some of John Carpenter's movies to add to my collection.For anyone who is a John Carpenter fan or a horror fan this is one book they should not be without and for the casual movie fan they would enjoy adding this book to their library.The other books I have by John Kenneth Muir are: Horror films of the 1970's, Wes Craven: the Art of Horror and Eaten Alive at a Chainsaw Massacre: the films of Tobe Hooper.
