This collection, with selections from her previous books including Now, Talking to Strangers, and UXB: Poems and Translations, displays mastery of an array of literary genre and influences, including the postmodern, satire, Romanticism, and (as this reader detects) a hint of Native American literary tradition. For example, many of the poems within the beginning of the collection reflect her unique, individual style that incorporates qualities of Native American symbolism and emphasis on man's close and beneficial connection to nature.Repeatedly, Dobler reflects upon the fact that she, like most of humanity, is influenced by her past-her German heritage proves to be an overriding theme in many of the poems-and her present state of consciousness. In many ways, the poems that muse upon her anthropological history suggest a desire to be both separate from and inherently connected to her German ancestry. In fact, Dobler urges us in \\"Train Platform: Munich to Dachau\\" to examine all parts of history and be \\"of a mind to understand.\\" In her reflections on Germany, which includes concentration on the elephant in the room-Nazis and concentration camps-and traditional German idealisms, Dobler hopes to maintain her heritage and, in doing so, to encourage others to realize that they are not just of the present, but also of the past. We are who we are because of where we and our ancestors have been.Additionally, Dobler presents a refreshing sense of humor containing underlying wisdom in several of her poems. Perhaps the best of these poems is \\"The Penelope Interview.\\" In this poem Dobler introduces us to the \\"real\\" Penelope. Her witticisms, sarcasm, and candor cause the reader to laugh out loud. We are given the inside scoop behind Penelope's view on the suitors, Odysseus, weaving, and the folly of psychoanalysis. In this poem, the persona of Penelope reminds the interviewer and reader that she is merely a fiction, but Dobler creates a fictional character more real and tangible than that created by Homer. Dobler also hints at her ideas on literature and literary analysis in addition to what it means to be a woman now and in Penelope's time. With the interviewer's slight ignorance, Dobler presents a metaphor for the average human, who lives in misconceptions about the lives and attitudes of women and the importance of artistic creation. Perhaps this is just a personal bias, but \\"The Penelope Interview\\" is reason enough for a reader to pick up Dobler's Collected Poems. This poem proves Dobler to be the excellent writer she was known to be and a wise teacher to us all.The poems presented in Collected Poems contain a variety of styles, from prose-like syntax and diction to a stream of consciousness, in-the-moment style of writing. In any case, in all of the poems, Dobler tells a story. Some are connected. Some could stand alone in their power and construction. She captures the varied rhythm of jazz and the burning heart of the blues. She expresses the secret powers and wisdom of women, and she expounds upon the immortality of poets like Sappho, Eurydice, and all those poets who have gone through true and trying experiences, have expressed them in the written word, and have been extolled and rehearsed by generation after generation. Though a reader may have never met Pat Dobler face-to-face, her expressive narrative poetry tells us much about her: she was a woman and a writer proud of her German and literary heritage-a heritage that goes as far back as Sappho and beyond. In her poetry, we learn about ourselves and the society that surrounds, often overwhelms, and either makes or breaks us. These collected poems will triumph the test of history and life. She is the Sappho of today's age."},{"Title":"1453: The Holy War for Constantinople and the Clash of Islam and the West","review":"My rule of thumb for predicting that a presentation, sermon, political speech, or even blog post is going to fall flat: it begins with the phrase \\"Webster's dictionary defines the term as blah blah blah blah.\\" I may as well turn my ears off after I hear that.This book starts with about the same dynamic -- an hypothetical bird soaring over the city to give us a bird's eye view of the gathering foe. It's hard to read when you are rolling your eyes at such a lame beginning.But the book gets going. It's well written -- it does a good job setting up the personalities of Mehmet and Constantine, and their cultures. Crowley includes maps, illustrations, and a center section of portraits and sketches. He develops the various ethnic groups and their roles and conflicts.As the story of the seige gets going, the book gets jumpy with dates. We read what happens on May 14, then May 6, then May 3, then May 13. It happens again -- we get information about May 14, then May 16, then May 21, then May 19. A couple of nice details get repeated almost word-for-word (for example, the information about John Grant, and the detail of how the bronze for the Turks' cannons came from melting down churchbells), so that what was interesting the first time became sloppy writing the second time.The chapter titled \\"The Present Terror of the World\\" is best skipped altogether; it is basically incoherent. Crowley believes that the response in Christendom to the fall of Constantinople was massive overreaction and hysteria. Those silly Westerners had nothing to fear... then Crowley lays out Mehmet's annual campaigns pushing further and further West. Mehmet saw himself as a meesianic warrior, taking jihad across Europe. But when Europeans see Mehmet as a messianic warrior bringing jihad across Europe, Crowley pooh-poohs their fearful responses. It wasn't overreaction or hysteria the West was feeling; it was the plain, reasonable truth. Crowley does this back-and-forth between Mehmet's own goals and conquests and the Westerners' being superstitious about the whole thing -- three times in one chapter. Skip reading it.The last chapter details some of the mysteries surrounding the seige and the fall of Constantinople, and the Note about Sources goes into further detail.This book is good in some parts, but ok at best in others. Read Runciman."},{"Title":"1453: The Holy War for Constantinople and the Clash of Islam and the West","review":"Perhaps it was the publisher who put the provocative subtitle on 1453: The Holy War for Constantinople and the Clash of Islam and the West. Roger Crowley is so evenhanded in his account of what happened at Byzantium in 1453 that he refers to the event as both the \\"Fall of Constantinople\\" and the \\"Capture of Istanbul.\\"I enjoyed the book very much. It is fascinating and engaging with a good deal of drama and a minimum of irony. As I read, I kept looking for clues for solving the current cold war between Islam and the West. That pesky subtitle. Should the West fight or surrender? Cooperate, forgive or concede? After taking the city, Sultan Mehmet rebuilt it as a multicultural metropolis where Latins, Greeks, Muslims and Jews were all free to worship and trade. But that was within the context of Islamic domination, so that's not quite the answer either.Crowley is too good a scholar to presume to offer answers. Don't let the publisher tease you. Read 1453 because it's a really good read."},{"Title":"1453: The Holy War for Constantinople and the Clash of Islam and the West","review":"I've been reading books about Contantinople for 40 years and Mr. Crowley has done a wonderful job.

I'm on the lookout for a new book by this very talented author."},{"Title":"1453: The Holy War for Constantinople and the Clash of Islam and the West","review":"What? No reviews since 2005???!!! You've got to be kidding me! This was by far one of the best history books I have ever read. The author manages to recreate the events leading up to the siege and the siege itself, with accuracy and passion. Reading the book truly felt like being there! A few times, as I was reading it, I put the book down, overwhelmed by sadness about the desperate ploy of the defenders of Constantinople: it was like watching the Alamo with John Wayne, or reading about the destruction of the German forces at Stalingrad. The Greek emperor Constantine XI shines as a genuine hero, just like several Italian leaders (from Genoa and Venice) in charge of the city's defense. I cannot wait to read Crowley's new book!!!"},{"Title":"1453: The Holy War for Constantinople and the Clash of Islam and the West","review":"The name Constantinople has always conjured up vague images for me - mystery, grandeur, historical wonder. However, 1453 has expanded my understanding of the city as well as the role it played in world history. Crowley covers the siege and attack of Constantinople by the Turks in 1543. The invasion has truly changed the geopolitical landscape of Europe and Asia since that time. This was truly a Holy War - a fight both between Islam and Christianity, as well as a fight within factions of Christianity. It also highlights the great differences between the understandings of the human condition between these world religions. Neither is innocent and neither is patently evil, but they are very different. Crowley speaks about these differences and the background issues in light of the battle, placing them all in an easily accessible light.After reading 1453, I find myself realizing that the battles of 1453 have similarities to the battles of the 21st century. The cultural battles are still very similar. The geopolitical issues are still in flux. This view helped make the book even more meaningful today."},{"Title":"1453: The Holy War for Constantinople and the Clash of Islam and the West","review":"this book really does a good job of telling the story and focusing both upon the personalities involved and the way that life was for the people in constantinople at the time. it has the right level of depth for someone who's interested in history but is not a specialist."},{"Title":"1453: The Holy War for Constantinople and the Clash of Islam and the West","review":"The book discusses with a great detail the turkish military campaign against Constantinople. Furthermore, the author provides a quasi- psychological profile of S. Mehemet. But the book does not provide a socio-political research of the events that have preceded the Fall of Constantinople and it doesn't discuss the aftermath of this major event. I have expected a clear discussion of the implications of the city's downfall; something similar toThe Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World OrderThe author attempt to create a balanced picture of the event is irrelevant, albeit the result of the turkish occupation of Constantinople, according to the book, is that they all \\"lived happily ever after\\", the attack of an army of 150,000-200,000 strong against the impoverished city that had a defense of 7000 strong had fatal consequences that affected not only the fate of Byzantines but also the fate of Europe."},{"Title":"1453: The Holy War for Constantinople and the Clash of Islam and the West","review":"I just finished reading this fact fill and well written book about the fall of Constantiniople to the Ottomans. I thought the Author has done a right proper job telling us about one of the turning points of History. When the Armies of Islam had reached the height of their power as a convential military power. This siege was to prove the last time that they could completely defeat an entrenched & determined European power. Soon after they would be stopped cold at the Gates of Vienna and at Malta.I also thought that the Author did a very good job describing the various facts and Characters of this battle. Especially those of the Sultan and his great drive to reduce the last bastion of the Roman Empire. (He was also one hard character that I would not want to met in a dark alley unless I was heavily armed and not alone!) Altogether I just wish I had this book with me when I was at Istanbul last."},{"Title":"1453: The Holy War for Constantinople and the Clash of Islam and the West","review":"Crowley vividly resurrects the human drama, the bitterness of the struggle, the despair, the hope, and the resourcefulness of a people pushed to the brink of despair.The book is also an excellent review of medieval history from a different angle: The empires in the Near East. Crowley does a superb job expanding on the economic, political, ideologic, religious, social, geographic, technological, and military dimensions of a conflict that in a sense still rages on to our date.I found the book hard to put down from the beginning to the very end.

Many of the other reviewers have already emphasized the lucid, insightful, and verily entertaining writing. Crowley handles his source material not just even-handedly and scientifically (like a historian should), but even artistically, making this not just great history but a great read as well! As Crowley himself puts it, his aim was \\"to capture the sound of human voices - to reproduce the words, prejudices, hopes, and fears of the protagonists firsthand - and to tell something of 'the story of the story'\\" (page 263 in the hardcover edition). Sharing \\"the story of the story\\" with their readers is something that, alas, many scholars omit in favor of dry lists of facts and analysis. Crowley transports the reader into a lost, forgotten world, resurrecting the past from the dust and ashes of time and space to speak vividly and directly for new generations.I warmly recommned this book to anyone; it will certainly always hold a special place on my shelf. If only I could give it an infinite number of stars!!! ..."},{"Title":"1453: The Holy War for Constantinople and the Clash of Islam and the West","review":"I read this novel for a study on Islam. I could not put down this book as it details the actual battle in magnificent detail. I do not believe the novel is inherently biased in favor of muslims (as viewed in previous post). Crowley describes the ideal muslim code for a conquering army, as depicted through Hadith and the Quran, but he makes sure to point out the inconsistencies that actually occured in practice. He shows the brutality of the Muslim ruler Muhmet and the visciousness of a turning point in human history."},{"Title":"1453: The Holy War for Constantinople and the Clash of Islam and the West","review":"Fantastic account of an amazing event in world history. Not only does this book cover the pure history of the events that took place, it paints many colorful pictures of the participants on both sides. Prior history of the region, technology of the siege weapons, and biographies of many of the major players are weaved throughout. Considering that the events played out 550 years ago, it is astonishing that there are actual day by day (and sometimes hour by hour) accounts of individual battles, naval attacks, and other fascinating events. Granted there was a lot of material to build from, this book does a great job in tying all of the pieces together in a very entertaining and informative rendition."},{"Title":"1453: The Holy War for Constantinople and the Clash of Islam and the West","review":"\\"In the jihad against Constantinople, one third of Muslims will allow themselves to be defeated, which Allah cannot forgive; one third will be killed in battle, making them wondrous martyrs; and one third will be victorious.\\"Speaking as a High School student, I was not completely thrilled when I received this book to read and review for my AP World History class. Nor can I say that I started this book but a few days before it was due. I give all of my thanks to Roger Crowley, who created a historical text that wasn't a terrific chore to read in two days.The book, overall, was very interesting and was structured much like a fictional novel. The story of Islam vs. Christianity and their struggle for \\"true faith\\" had the classic elements of suspense, disappointment, and the \\"I really shouldn't find these so funny\\" Ottoman tactics of punishing a captive by \\"sticking a stake through his anus.\\"All in all, I would recommend this book to any student or adult who is willing to dive into a vast sea of knowledge. Though 1453 contained some descriptions of artillery that rivaled the length and interest levels of those in Greek mythology, it effectively told the tale of Constantinople and added historical allusions and comparisons throughout the story that further added to its appeal.Furthermore, how can you rival a book that talks about a sea commander named Dolfin Dolfin? This book is definitely the best nonfiction, historical story that I have encountered thus far in my educational experience."},{"Title":"1453: The Holy War for Constantinople and the Clash of Islam and the West","review":"The Roman Empire actually fell on May 29, 1453. Roger Crowley's book is decent popular history but Sir Steven Runciman's \\"Fall of Constantinople\\" is a much better history and better written. Crowley's book also suffers from a rather pronounced anti-Byzantine/pro-Ottoman slant which does present a slightly skewed picture of reality. Still, if this best-selling history increases knowledge of and interest in the events of 1453, of Ottomans and Byzantines in general, that is not a bad thing.For an enjoyable fictional version of the siege of Constantinople as seen from inside the walls of the great city, try to find Mika Waltari's 1953 novel \\"The Dark Angel\\" (out of print)."},{"Title":"1453: The Holy War for Constantinople and the Clash of Islam and the West","review":"Crowley has written this story on the fall of Constantinople at a level that will satisfy all but the highest academic, but at the same time, it's very readable for the novice. He does a fine job at giving background to the Byzantium Empire and specifically in presenting the failures and weaknesses of the Emporers who preceded Contantine IX Paleologus.By the time we reach 1452, we know how the Theodosian Walls were built, and also how they have prevented anyone from successfully attacking Constaninople. There is also a fine description of how the Fourth Crusade in 1204 (who attacked through the Golden Horn) destroyed much of the economy of the Empire and left it bereaved of enough hinterland from which to recruit a strong enough army to defend it.Intertwined with the story of Constantine, is the story of Mehmet the Conqueror. We learn how the Ottoman Turks had become a major power in Asia Minor, and a danger to not only Constantinople but to Europe as a whole. Crowley also explains the machinazations that were involved in Mehmet coming to the throne at 19 and successfully eliminating all other rivals and siblings.In the end, there is a stirring description of the defense of the city by 8,000 soldiers (almost half who are Italian volunteers, it starts to sound like the Alamo after awhile), against a tide of Ottomans (a low estimate is 100,000). We learn strategy of defense against a new weapon (cannons that throw stone balls weighing up to a couple of tons), that the walls were never designed to stop.In the end, the loss of the city is blamed on a soldier leaving a sally-port open, that allows the Ottomans to finally break into the city. The epilogue is a round-up as to what happened to all the principal fighter."},{"Title":"1453: The Holy War for Constantinople and the Clash of Islam and the West","review":"The Fall of Constantinople was a watershed mark in history and Roger Crowley does an excellent job in retelling the story. Accordingly,many past and modern versions of the fall of Constantinople are deeply intermingled with both myth and religious narrative; narratives that blend what actually happened with notions of perception and what they believe may have happened.According to the author, (in his notes about the sources), his aim in retelling the tale of Constantinople has been to construct out of the various conflicts of blame, agenda, and religion, a robust central version of events.He does an admirable job of presenting a very objective story as told from both victor and vanquished.This is an excellent book that is very readable and paints a very vivid word picture of the events, actions and actors.Dr. Terry Tucker, Adjunct Prof History"},{"Title":"1453: The Holy War for Constantinople and the Clash of Islam and the West","review":"A more technical treatment of the subject than Sir Steven Runciman'sThe Fall of Constantinople 1453 (Canto), but I have to admit that I prefer the style of Sir Runciman. What Sir Runciman neglected in detail, Mr. Crowley has provided. But, at the same time, there were points where Mr. Crowley seemed overly concerned with parallels to today (implied somewhat in the subtitle). Despite that minor criticism it is likely the very thing other readers will enjoy about the book. Mr. Crowley also recently did a fine article in Military History magazine concerning the fall of Constantinople and I would recommend that as well for thorough technical detail. This is a thorough and enjoyable work and an important contribution to understanding the last days of Constaniople."},{"Title":"1453: The Holy War for Constantinople and the Clash of Islam and the West","review":"I lost sleep because of this book, LOL! Crowley packs his history of this important event with so much information that one gains a very clear impression of what transpired, as if from a bird's eye view. One gains as well a strong sense of the personalities of both Mehmet II and Constantine XI, as well as those of other key persons.A masterful job."},{"Title":"1453: The Holy War for Constantinople and the Clash of Islam and the West","review":"I enjoyed this book, and learned from it as well. The description of the siege was excellent: sufficient detail to provide context, not so much detail that the tempo was lost.Some fascinating facts about fortifications and arms, as well as some of the people involved.While as the title suggests this was a holy war for Constantinople, and a clash between Islam and the West, it was also a battle for a strategic trading port and a significant cultural jewel.Alas, much of the latter was lost in pursuit of the former.Highly recommended to anyone who seeks more knowledge about both the city we now know as Istanbul and 15th century power struggles.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"Title":"1453: The Holy War for Constantinople and the Clash of Islam and the West","review":"I came across this book when it was mentioned by another Amazon reviewer in connection with a different book, and thought I'd check it out. I'm glad I did. I'm a fan of this type of popular history, and \\"1453\\" is one of the finest I've read. Author Crowley tells the story of the epic siege of Constantinople the way it deserves to be told: With excitement, suspense, and a dose of horror. He manages to work in the complex history of the 1,000-year-old Byzantine Empire and the rise of the Ottoman nation in a lively and informative fashion, and concentrates on what the reader really cares about: Would Sultan Mehmet II be the first to do what no one had done for a millennium, and breach the walls of the greatest Christian metropolis of the Middle Ages? At times the book reads like a spy thriller, and I found myself unable to stop turning the pages, dying to know what happened next. Crowley is a fine storyteller and his grasp of the various aspects of the history -- including military, geographical, navigational, religious and cultural details -- is impressive. I learned more from this book than I have from several more comprehensive histories of the Byzantine Empire, and had more fun along the way. The author also does what so few historical writers remember to do, which is that when he refers back to one of the many hundreds of supporting characters who played a minor role in the story, he reminds the reader who they were and why they were significant, so you don't have to constantly go paging backwards or check the index to figure out who he's talking about. I wish more popular histories were this enjoyable. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"1453: The Holy War for Constantinople and the Clash of Islam and the West","review":"This book is absolutely amazing.

The book is very well written and its an easy read."},{"Title":"1453: The Holy War for Constantinople and the Clash of Islam and the West","review":"Did Roger Crowley write a great book? Perhaps not. Is it a good book? It definitely is. I certainly enjoyed reading it. What is significant about the year 1453? Well, ask any Turkish school kid. He will tell you. That is the year the Ottoman Turks captured Constantinople. The city became a focal point of all that is Turkish after that. But you know the ending, so how can even a good writer sustain the suspense through this 300-page book? Well, Mr. Crowley did that for me. It may have not have been quite as exciting to read as Ken Follett's \\"Pillars of the Earth,\\" a book that has both mystery andInformation about cathedral construction in the 12-13th centuries. Nevertheless, it was hard to put down 1453, once I started reading it.As the author notes, \\"Given the huge significance of 1453 to the history of the Turkish people, it is surprising that there are so few contemporary Ottoman accounts of the capture of the city, no eyewitness narratives, almost no personal reports of the feelings and motivations of the Muslim soldiers....\\" The reason: \\"The society was predominately preliterate; transmission of events was largely oral, with no tradition of recording individual stories... so that the Ottoman perspective often has to be constructed by reading between the lines of Christian accounts: 1453 is unusual in being history largely written by the losers.\\" Actually, in those days, even in the west, literacy was almost exclusively the province of churchmen.Given my enjoyment of this book, I cannot stomach a review like that of \\"Clubbeaux\\"? He obviously does not care for his fellow Englishman, for he calls him an \\"apologist for the Turkish-Islamic cultural myth,\\" whatever that is. He accuses Mr. Crowley of being unfamiliar with Bernard Lewis of Princeton University and his research. Really? Let's see what Professor Lewis says in his 2004 book, \\"From Babel to Dragomans:\\"\\"Religious ill-will usually outlives religious belief. Western travelers in Turkey, who were the major source of information to the Western world, with few exceptions reinforced these prejudices. Western hostility to the Turk was perpetuated by the enthusiasm of the philhellenes who, in their just admiration for Greece, did less than justice to the Turk ... forgetting the famous words of the Byzantine dignitary Lucas Notaras, \`It is better to see in the city the power of the Turkish turban than that of the Latin tiara.' \\"After establishing his \\"credentials\\" as someone who has lived in Turkey for many years, Clubbeaux accuses Mr. Crowley airbrushing the viciousness of the Ottoman soldier.\\"Mobs targeted the merchant communities who lived in the city's main harbour on the shores of the Golden Horn...the old and the infirm were caught and slain. Churches were burned and churchmen were captured and tortured. A hospital run by the Knights Hospitaller was attacked and the sick slaughtered in their beds. A papal legate was seized and killed; his head was cut off and tied to the tail of a dog...Many other westerners were taken prisoner and sold into slavery.The mob? No, they were not Ottoman soldiers. They were Christians, and these misdeeds were committed two centuries before the Ottomans stepped foot onto Constantinople soil. (Johathan Phillips, \\"The Fourth Crusade.\\")Sultan Mehmet had promised his soldiers three days to plunder the city when they succeeded to conquer it. However, he would not allow them to destroy the city's historic churches and other landmarks. In fact, he stopped further plunder beyond the first afternoon. Actually, all the looting had been done two centuries earlier by the Crusaders. They had taken away nearly everything worthwhile. What they did not steal, they destroyed. Here is an eyewitness account by Nicholas Mesarites of crusader greed and violence: \\"They slaughtered the new-born, killed prudent matrons, stripped elder women...They tortured the monks, they hit them with their fists and kicked their bellies, thrashing and rending their reverend bodies with whips. Mortal blood was spilled on the holy altars ... many were dragged like sheep and beheaded, and on the holy tombs, the wretched slew the innocent.\\"Precious metals were stripped from public buildings and monuments. The crusaders even broke open imperial Byzantine tombs and stole valuables. As Niketas searingly observed: \\"They displayed complete indifference and irreverence to all.\\"When he entered St. Sophia after dismounting before its front door, Sultan Mehmet caught sight of a soldier who was smashing away at the marble pavement. Infuriated by this visible defiance of his orders to preserve the buildings, Mehmet had him dragged outside by the feet.Contrast that with this: \\"The Hagia Sophia, Constantinople's greatest, most glorious building and the spiritual heart of the Byzantine Empire, was ravaged and defiled. Within hours, centuries of precious offerings were gathered up. It was not just movable objects that were taken, for the fabric of the Hagia Sophia itself was attacked. For example, as the crusaders stripped the silver overlay from the pulpit gates, the carefully deployed workmanship of years was destroyed. So huge was the haul that the holy thieves had to bring pack animals into the building. The excrement of mules and asses fouled the smooth marble floors of the house of God; men and beasts slipped and fell as they struggled to move their burdens away. The pollution of the great church was absolute.\\" (The Fourth Crusade).Religion saturated the medieval period in a way that is hard for us to comprehend today. So, does 1453 deliver what its subtitle promises? Frankly, it does not. For a more thorough examination of \\"The Holy War for Constantinople and the Clash of Islam and the West,\\" you have to look elsewhere -- perhaps Bernard Lewis's recent book on \\"What Went Wrong?\\" Nevertheless, Crowley's 1453 is well written, colorful and exciting to read. If, in the process, you learn a few things about Islam and Christianity, consider that just a bonus."},{"Title":"1453: The Holy War for Constantinople and the Clash of Islam and the West","review":"I have read this book from cover to cover and found it to be accurate, insightful and well researched. I did not see any bias as some reviewers have stated. I believe the author has approached this very sensitive subject (especially to Greeks) with the aim to tell the story \\"as it was\\" without the usual Turkish/Greek propaganda.I will not go into every single detail of this book as other reviewers have done a good job in pointing out the specifics of the book. Where they believe the author has either done a good job or where he has failed. I will simply say that as a person of Greek heritage i did not find this book at all offensive or onesided as some have accused the author of being.I would recommend this book without any hesitation to anyone who is interested in learning more about the fall of the Byzantine Empire and the campaign to take Constantinople by the Ottoman Turks."},{"Title":"1453: The Holy War for Constantinople and the Clash of Islam and the West","review":"1453 is worth a reading even by those, like me, that knows the history about the fall of Constantinople and not only that, but from the pen of masters as Runciman and Norwich. As I probed to myself with the other - second- great book by this author, that treats about the world war between imperial Spain and Imperial Turkey in the XVI century, in the Mediterranean, Crowley is a magnificent storyteller that offers a mix of serious data and most entertaining reading. Isn't this one the best possible mix for this kind of stuff?"},{"Title":"1453: The Holy War for Constantinople and the Clash of Islam and the West","review":"I think the book is terrific. It is briskly written, with an emphasis on using quotes from sources wherever applicable to improve the texture of the story. It is easy to follow (even if a Dramatis Personae would have helped with all the names that start to run together), and the author does a terrific job of both opening and closing the book, explaining the siege in a historical context that improves our understanding. He does all this without miring the book in too many details. As other reviewers have said, I think a longer account of the siege would not have been amiss, the book is such a good read I believe it could have been longer.I also appreciate Mr. Crowley's attempt to resurrect Giovanni Giustiniani Longo (of Genoa) from the fate he is so often consigned to, that of the man who abandoned his post and thereby consigned Constantinople to capture. In this account Giustiniani approaches almost heroic status, keeping the defenders working together and continuing to frustrate, nearly to the point of failure and collapse, Mehmet's army. However, Mr. Crowley never dips into hero worship, he is fully aware that all the characters were men, and all of them had corresponding weaknesses.I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"1453: The Holy War for Constantinople and the Clash of Islam and the West","review":"At the outset I wanted to state that I do not profess to be an expert on military strategy and tactics, nor knowledgeable about the history of Constantinople (that is before reading this book). Although I am not an expert in this field and I cannot comment on the strengths of the research, I do think that I have some comments that would be valuable for readers. For starters I can say that the references to many primary resources adds power to the writing. Secondly, although the reading can initially appear dense, on further analysis the reader will note the great amount of information that lies in the text. Thirdly, I think this can be used as a good introductory textbook for military strategy and tactics, specifically siege warfare.This book, 1453: The Holy War for Constantinople and the Clash of Islam and the West, recounts a great war between the Turks and the Greeks in the historical city of Constantinople during the year 1453. This was a war in which the Turks laid siege to the great fortress city of Constantinople. The author, Mr. Roger Crowley, depicts the city of Constantinople to be on the brink of two worlds, Europe and Asia, and how these worlds collided at this time in history. Having lived in Istanbul (formerly Constantinople), Mr. Roger Crowley is able to provide a great description of the historical city. The reader can readily observe that the book was thoroughly researched.At times in some sections the military strategies and tactics can be highly descriptive. It might appear heavy to absorb, and slow reading. These sections contain good information although it might require more time and patience from a reader. Below is an example of this attention to detail:\\"The seashore was guarded by a single unbroken wall at least fifty feet above the shoreline interspersed with a chain of 188 towers and a number of small defended harbors.........The Horn itself provided an excellent sheltered anchorage for the imperial fleet; 110 towers commanded a single wall along this stretch with numerous water gates and two substantial harbors, but the defenses were always considered vulnerable.\\"Furthermore, the author's inclusion of sketches of people, and major military landmarks such as fortresses throughout the book was a helpful aid for the reader to visualize the historical time and assisted in bringing the story of the siege war to life.I feel like I want to visit Istanbul after reading this book. Although, not being proficient in military strategy it did take me a long time to read this book, which may not be the case for others more versed in the subject matter. I would recommend this book to those avid fans of history and also those interested in studying military strategy and tactics."},{"Title":"1453: The Holy War for Constantinople and the Clash of Islam and the West","review":"The Fall of Constantinople has been the subject of many histories over the years from Gibbon onwards. This particular tome seems to be slanted towards Mahomet and the author has definitely turned \\"Turk\\". Its as though the author is trying to be sensitive to Arab and Islamist feelings in these trying times and has presented a watered down view of the conflict remnants of which can still be seen in the Greco-Turkic conflict over Cyprus.Even the anti Christian Gibbon was more favorable in his depiction of the Last Emperor than Crowley who fawns over the Turks and what a grand people they were. Supposed Roman atrochities are highlighted and Turkish ones glossed over.The Fall of Constantinople opened a new wave of Jihad by the Arabs into the West which did not end until Jan Sobieski raised the siege of Vienna in 1683 (63 years AFTER the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth) destroying the Sultan's large army encompassed around it. Crowley barely touches the results of the fall of Contantinople on the rest of Europe which in the Territories of the Balkans were about to be in a state of subjugation and war for the next 260 years.The overland trade routes to the Orient were cut off after the Fall causing the great Age of Exploration by the Spanish and Portugese. In a way the Fall of Constantinople expedited the discovery and foundation of America."},{"Title":"1453: The Holy War for Constantinople and the Clash of Islam and the West","review":"Five years ago, this book might have been relegated to the dusty shelves of those interested in an obscure bit of ancient history. But after the events of 9/11 revealed the intensity and fury of the Islamic insurgency, the events of 1453 become very relevant to contemporary readers.1453 is the poignant story of the Islamic conquest of the last outpost of the Roman Empire, Constantinople. Most people think Rome fell in the fifth century. In fact, the city of Rome was capital of only the Western portion of the empire. After its conquest by barbarians, the Eastern portion (known as the Byzantine Empire) survived, albeit ever diminishing, for another millenium.Its decline and ultimate demise was largely a function of the rise of militant Islam, which drove the devoutly Christian Byzantines out of the holy lands in the first millenium CE, prompting repeated, papacy-inspired counterattacking crusades wherein the devolved West, allied with Byzantium endeavored to recapture them, ultimately to no avail. In fact, the antipathy between East and West emanating from the schism that divided the church into the Roman Catholic and Orthodox factions eventually led to a crusader sack of Constantinople itself in the 1200s that left the weakened city easy prey to a reenergized militant Islam.Crowley magnificently lays out this historical background, including the several failed militant Islamic attacks on the city, which represented the bulwark of Christianity's defense against a militant Islam bent on world domination. He details the elaborate defenses and how they deterred a millenium of onslaughts and the reasons they ultimately gave way. Chillingly, technology provided to militant Islam by Christians was key-an ominous parallel with today's militant Islamic obsession with nuclear technology. He goes on to detail the ramifications of the fall of this last line of defense, including militant Islamic incursions into Europe as far as Italy, which continued until the ultimate defeat of the invasion at Vienna.This was indeed a world war, which the West thought it had won so long ago and so decisively that it had virtually forgotten it. But the events of the 21st century indicate that for militant Islamic insurgents, it seems like just yesterday that they were the dominant military forces in the world, reducing the crown of Christian civilization to rubble. For them, the struggle is endless. It was 700 years after the first militant Islamic attack on Constantinople that they achieved final victory. Another 700 years passed between that victory and 9/11. Western readers will gain valuable insight into the mindset of the Islamic insurgency by reading this important book."},{"Title":"1453: The Holy War for Constantinople and the Clash of Islam and the West","review":"Well written book that will draw you in.

XVI century Europe and Ottoman's Emporium had unfortunately both."},{"Title":"1453: The Holy War for Constantinople and the Clash of Islam and the West","review":"Roger Crowley is a superb narrative historian specializing in matters Mediterranean. He is especially adept at taking a \\"god's eye\\" view of history, incorporating everything now known about the events depicted, so the reader is often better informed than the participants were at the time. Normally, I find an approach like that lacks immediacy and keeps the reader very much apart from the story. Not so with Crowley, who gives us vivid characters from both sides.The author also successfully overcomes another obstacle for historians covering the distant past. The siege and capture of Constantinople depicted here took place almost 600 years ago and often times getting at the truth means sifting through multiple layers of religious propoganda from Christian and Islamic writers. Crowley not only solves this, but he sometimes turns it to his advantage. For example, while we will never know exactly how Emperor Constantine met his individual fate, Crowley's summary of the multiple stores that surfaced is insightful.I do want to remind readers that this is largely a book of military history. Some might want or expect more on the two culturs than clashed here. While 1453 focuses on a conflict between two armies of differing religious believes, the focus is pretty much on the fighting. While we get some more detail as to how Islam and Christianity differ, there is a higher level of detail in describing how sailed ships took over control of the sea from orred gallies, the development of gunpowder, and other military developments.Crowley is more an heir to C.S. Forrester than Bernard Lewis, but this is the work of a serious, dilgent scholar, who just happens to be able to write swashbuckling history."},{"Title":"1453: The Holy War for Constantinople and the Clash of Islam and the West","review":"Well written history book.

I actually feel like I've learned something by reading this book."},{"Title":"1453: The Holy War for Constantinople and the Clash of Islam and the West","review":"This is an excellent accounting of the events leading up to and culminating in the fall of Constantinople. There is enough drama in the events themselves to hold anyone's attention with a modicum of imagination! It appears to be well-balanced and researched. It's the kind of book that makes history accessible to the average person or student. I found it in the local college bookstore as a class required reading, so evidently at least one history professor agrees with me!"},{"Title":"1453: The Holy War for Constantinople and the Clash of Islam and the West","review":"Byzantium. Constantinople. Istanbul. Intellectually, it is easy enough to remember that these three cities are in fact the same, sitting on the Bosphorus, straddling the border between Europe and the East. However, it is difficult to get a visceral feel for the fact that the current city of mosques and minarets was for over a millennia one of the centers of the Christian world. Fortunately, there is a book like 1453 to take us back and let us experience how such a transformation takes place.In his book, Mr. Crowley takes us back to the year of the title, when Sultan Mehmet II, a man barely out of his teens but who has survived the intrigues that barred his way to the throne, lays siege to Constantinople. Despite the fact that the city has resisted sieges many times before thanks to its natural water defenses and ancient western wall, Mehmet is willing to take the risk. Constantine XI, the aging emperor who guards the city, is weak and his city and empire is only a shadow of its former glory. So, Mehmet gathers his armies and vassals and heads to the walls.Overall, Mr. Crowley's descriptions of the siege are absorbing. He points out the very important advantages that Mehmet had over previous would-be conquerors: he brings cannon and a navy. The walls of Constantinople were impregnable to a classic mediaeval attack but the arrival of gunpowder to the West and the development of cannon made the walls vulnerable. Plus, no attacker had ever brought a navy to bear on the city before and its very existence cut off the possibility of resupplying the city, making a successful siege a possibility.But Mehmet's victory was by no means assured and, in fact, he could have easily failed. His guns could only fire a few salvos a day and his navy was basically outclassed had his enemies ever being willing to meet him directly in battle. The lengthening siege made it difficult to manage his vast armies. Plus, the city was defended. Mr. Crowley shows great respect for the defenders of the city, their strategies and valor. As Mehmet's guns brought down sections of the wall, the citizens of Constantinople would sneak out at night and rebuild. Down to the last battle, the people of Constantinople seemed to believe their city could not fall.Of course, fall it did. Mr. Crowley quickly gives us the final successful push into the city which, be it through luck or valor, went to the Turks in hours once the walls were breached. As Mehmet enters the city we get to see both the good and bad of a city defeated in the Middle Ages, mercy and spoils, revenge and glory. And we get a brief account of the spread of the news through the West and its effect on subsequent history.All in all, this account of an important moment in the history of the Western world is a great read. It is informative and insightful, managing to build tension and excitement despite the fact that the reader knows the outcome. And Mr. Crowley's fairness to both the Christian defenders and the Turkish conquerors makes it palatable and not strident. There is no doubt that this defeat after 1000 years of successful defense was a tragic time but this fading star of the Christian world rises to become the center of the Muslim world, maintaining its glory for centuries more. This city deserves its story to be told."},{"Title":"1453: The Holy War for Constantinople and the Clash of Islam and the West","review":"When I was a young Infantry officer, I recall a tactical instructor telling us that,\\"The best defence is only as good as the willingness of an enemy to make the necessary sacrifices to overcome it.\\" I can think of few better examples of this principle than the Ottoman siege of Constantinople. I have read many books about this event and in my opinion \\"1453\\" by Roger Crowley is far-and-away the best. The book is chock-full of interesting facts about the siege and where the facts are unclear, Crowley (like Herodotus) gives us the opposing stories and lets us decide. In addition \\"1453\\" is a very readable, fast-paced history. It's one of the few history books I've read where I can honestly say I wished it was much longer. It's like an excellent novel but it's all true and a heartbreaking story to boot. I just wish I'd been able to read it before my visit to Istanbul earlier this year. I'd have kept it at my side."},{"Title":"1453: The Holy War for Constantinople and the Clash of Islam and the West","review":"The historian brings people to life by telling the story of their historical times - illuminating them and their deeds, judiciously treating that which he is not certain of. The novelist brings history to life by telling the stories of the people who lived it - real and imagined, creatively (and judiciously, one hopes) filling in history's voids.Further, as Napoleon said, \\"history is the agreed version of events by the victors.\\" Before photographs and sound/picture recording, much of what is taken as historical fact can be disputed. With all that in mind, Roger Crowley has done a commendable job. What gives me the right to say so? Well, I have encountered the very same task!I am a novelist and my first book, \\"The Lion of St. Mark (St. Martin's Press, 2005), was written before I read Roger Crowley's 1453. I only wish I had had it by my side when I was toiling over disputing sources as I wrote my fictional (but historically accurate, I trust) account of the great siege of Constantinople and what happened afterwards.I appreciate his decision to go with his gut when versions of what happened irreconcilably collide and avoid the use \\"perhaps\\", \\"possibly\\", and \\"might have\\", which can drag historical story-telling to a crawl.Crowley's style is highly readable and skillfully blends history with many illustrative anecdotes to bring the siege to life. Who could not feel the courage and fears of the Christians and the Ottomans as they fought and bled in the fosse and on the walls in their supreme struggle?Like the old Mad Magazine's Spy vs. Spy, their contest presaged the modern-day technological battle in the Battle of the North Atlantic that saw the Allies and Germans constantly one-up each other as each strove to gain supremacy.Traditional histories suffer from the readers' knowledge of how things end. Only first-rate historians are able to \\"make it read like a novel\\" to maintain the suspense and show, as Wellington said after Waterloo, that it really was, \\"a near run thing.\\"I understand from his website that Crowley's next work will detail the continuing struggle between the Ottomans and the West that culminated in the epic battle of Lepanto in 1571 and a decisive Christian victory.I'll definitely buy it before beginning my third novel in my Venetians series. Thank you, Roger!"},{"Title":"1453: The Holy War for Constantinople and the Clash of Islam and the West","review":"1453 is one of the turning points of history. Mr.Crowley did excellent job to describe events, person, and facts related to capture of Istanbul. Two main characters Fatih Sultan Mehmet and Constantine XI are well biographied in the book. Especially Fatih's desire to take city and his preparations are very well given to the reader. Also the other characters like Zaganos Pasha, Halil Pasha, and Giovanni are given with enough detail with their contributions to the historical event.Book starts with Arab siege in 7th century and Muhammad desire of Istanbul. But the walls of Istanbul and successive defense strategies gave Byzantium a victory against them. After that Turks started to hit walls of Istanbul at the beginning of Ottoman Empire but they failed as well.Fatih Sultan Mehmet's obsession with the city starts with his early age and grows by the time. His successive use of technology, superior logistic planning, and strategy were the biggest advantages of Ottoman side. On the other hand, very charismatic and successful soldier Constantine XI was dealing with the problems of the Christianity like unity of the Church and Pope. There was big hesitation of help to Byzantium by Vatican.Mehmet's use of biggest cannon of their time and landslide of his war ship to Golden Horn were the most important points of the war and helped the Ottomans capture the city. Cannons were designed by Hungarian cannon founder Orban who offered defense of the city to Constantine XI but he got refused to due his high price. Mehmet accepted this Christian Scientist offer and paid him very well. Also Zagonos Pasha from Ottoman army was also another Christian who helped Mehmet with his aggressive offense mind.That's why I do not agree Crowley's definition to this event as Clash of Civilizations. During that time era Ottoman was also war with other Turkish and Arabic neighbors and Vatican did not make enough effort to save Istanbul due to his own interest. Istanbul was the biggest prize of their time for every commander regardless of religion.As Crowley mentioned after the fall of Istanbul there was flow of people from west to Istanbul due to free practice of religion and wealth of the city. Churches and synagogues were free to operate. Because, Mehmet's goal was not to create Islamic Empire but global empire like his idol hero Alexander the Great.In short, very well written, informative, and emotional book for the year of 1453. Everybody must read who live in Istanbul and who will visit Istanbul."},{"Title":"1453: The Holy War for Constantinople and the Clash of Islam and the West","review":"Living in Istanbul and working as a journalist, as I did for years, and living on Turkey's Mediterranean Coast as I do now I've run across individuals such as Mr. Crowley -- although I've never met him to my knowledge. Europeans -- oddly, particularly Brits -- who are attracted to Turkey and its history, its people and culture and self-generated mythology and who seek to, in some way, identify with it, or at least appoint themselves its expositors to more benighted cultures, such as (fill in home country).Mr. Crowley's a good writer, let's be clear about that. He does take what could be a dry subject and write in clear, easy prose without condescending to his reader. Thankfully he avoids the novelist's style, which is inappropriate to the subject and which in my estimation rarely adds lucidity or \\"readability\\" to military history, he does well to avoid it here. Think William Manchester or Barbara Tuchman for the style.But he's clearly not a scholar. Not that you have to be to take up a pen to write history, William Shirer wasn't a scholar yet his history of Nazi Germany has not been improved upon. What Mr. Crowley is, however, is an apologist for the Turkish-Islamic cultural myth.It's clear by about page 20 that Mr. Crowley has no patience for the Byzantines, their religion, culture or empire. He speaks of them with barely-concealed contempt, and writes admiringly, almost fawningly of the Islamic armies which defeated them. At times his lack of objectivity is embarrassing -- he uses the term \\"martyr\\" to describe Muslims who die in combat, and he unquestioningly repeats the discredited canards that Balkan and European peasantry preferred Islamic to Christian rule. He adopts only the most superficial and derogatory to the West interpretation of the Crusades, and is clearly unfamiliar with Bernard Lewis, Bat Ye'or or Paul Fregosi's scholarship -- an unforgiveable omission for someone sitting down to write a history of 1453.At times his almost dewy-eyed admiration for the Islamic armies at the heart of the Turkish Islamic myth overwhelms his good sense -- page 32: \\"The laws of Islam required mercy to conquered peoples [Right, like the laws of America require adherence to a speed limit]... No attempt was made to convert Christians, who formed the bulk of the population, to Islam...\\" Page 33: \\"A levy of Christian youths was taken [by the Islamic sultan] at regular intervals, converted to Islam...\\"Later on the same page: \\"But to Christians watching the process from afar, it evoked rigid horror... the prospect of turning captured Christian children against Christians was fiendish and inhuman. It was to form a powerful ingredient in the myth of the Savage Turk.\\"I'd say \\"fiendish\\" and \\"inhuman\\" are pretty accurate adjectives for the practice of forcing slaves to go to war for their captors, yes.Note that, the \\"myth\\" of the savage Turk, which as Mr. Crowley correctly notes was the shorthand for the Islamic forces conquering the historically Christian lands. Again, Mr. Crowley unavails himself of some less \\"mythological\\" reasons why Europeans might have considered the Islamic armies savage:Muslim historian Ibn al-Athir (1160-1233) in his The Complete History, on the Islamic invasion of Spain and France in the eighth and ninth centuries, writes \\"In 177 [17 April 793] Hisham, [Muslim] prince of Spain, sent a large army... into enemy territory, and which made forays as far as Narbonne and Jaranda [Gerona]... For several months [the army] traversed this land in every direction, raping women, killing warriors, destroying fortresses, burning and pillaging everything...\\"Bat Ye'or, in the highly-respected 1996 book The Decline of Eastern Christianity under Islam writes \\"Sophronius [Bishop of Jerusalem]... bewailed the destruction of churches and monasteries, the sacked towns, the fields laid waste, the villages burned down by the [Muslims] who were overrunning the country. In a letter the same year to Sergius, patriarch of Constantinople, he mentions the ravages wrought by the Arabs. Thousands of people perished in 639, victims of the famine and plague that resulted from these destructions.\\"I could go on and on -- Ye'or reproduces an eyewitness to the Islamic armies conquering the Egyptian Christian town of Nikiou: \\"They seized the town and slaughtered everyone they met in the street and in the churches - men, women and children, sparing nobody. Then they went to other places, pillaged and killed all the inhabitants they found...\\"The pattern was repeated, as Constantinoplians had good reason to fear, when their city was taken in 1453. Steven Runciman, the preeminent historian of the Crusades, reports that Muslim soldiers hewing to the by now well-established pattern \\"slew everyone that they met in the streets, men, women and children without discrimination. The blood ran in rivers down the steep streets from the heights of Petra toward the Golden Horn.\\"All this is carefully airbrushed out of Mr. Crowley's book, in which the final taking of the city is described in the most bloodless yet gloating terms possible, and here he can't even pretend to keep his bias under wraps -- on page 239 he laments that the fall of the city \\"was just the start of a huge renewal of anti-Islamic sentiment.\\" This is so ludicrous, to blame the victims of military conquest for being \\"anti\\" their bloody conquerors, as to beggar honest belief.In the end the book is useful only insofar as someone is curious about what a pro-Islamic, anti-West non-scholar would daydream what happened in 1453, with noble, benevolent Islamic heroes, some of whom were cruelly martyred by the evil Western Christians opposing their glorious destiny, marching in to succor a city wracked by Christian malfeasance and ignorance... you can write the rest, can't you?"},{"Title":"1453: The Holy War for Constantinople and the Clash of Islam and the West","review":"Although military history is one of my favorite subjects, books on military history often fall into one of two traps: either they lay out their subject in mind-numbingly dry detail, or they present an entertaining narrative at the expense of the facts. If you agree, then I can happily report that \\"1453\\" is a delightful surprise, for rarely do history books of any sort combine scholarship, good writing and a compelling story as well as this one. Roger Crowley weaves together a number of story lines - the Ottoman fixation with Constantinople, the various obstacles to cooperation between Byzantium and the West, and developments in military technology, to name a few - into a seamless narrative that moves forward as propulsively and inexorably as the Turkish advance on the great city itself. The writing is so good that even though I knew how the \\"story\\" would end, I found myself in suspense, as Crowley managed to convey a sense of immediacy and uncertainty about the final outcome until almost the very end. Despite the wealth of information provided (which is documented with endnotes), I also never found myself overwhelmed by data or bogged down in minutiae. Crowley unfolds the big picture clearly, yet without sacrificing detail about the various armies and personalities involved. Contrary to what a previous reviewer said, I also did not pick up any sense of pro-Islam or anti-Western bias. Crowley makes no attempt to gloss over Mehmet II's ruthlessness or the savage nature of the fighting on both sides. Constantine XI also comes across as one of the most sympathetic, if tragic, figures in the book. If you're at all interested in the fall of Constantinople, military history, or Islamic-Christian relations, you owe it to yourself to read this book. It's an epic story filled with memorable figures, and is unlikely to be better told than it is here."},{"Title":"1453: The Holy War for Constantinople and the Clash of Islam and the West","review":"I came to 1453 after Empires of the Sea. I have no pretensions about Crowley or his work: it is popular history. I do not mind, and that is what I read instead of Fiction. With that said, 1453 does contain some embarrassing biases and apologies. Crowley goes out of his way to defend the Turks from charges of barbarism, saying things like \\"everybody was doing it.\\" He seems to think little of Europeans who would not give the Turks credit for the Victory and claim that European technology and expertise brought down the walls of Constantinople, but he does the same thing in talking about Turkish barbarity: they learned it from Europeans. \\"Impalement, especially as a means of demoralizing besieged cities, was a widely practiced shock tactic that the Ottomans had learned in the Christian Balkans.\\" Oh, that makes it better. It was part of the cultural milieu of the time. How about when the Turks later in the book saw their captives in half because they promised not to behead them? Treachery learned from the Franks? If only they had stuck to the purity of the Koran.It is an understatement to say that it is disingenuous to lay Ottoman success purely in its own lap and then blame its vices on the Westerners.He later defends Mehmet from charges that he had a family killed because they would not hand over their 14 year old boy for the pederastic pleasure of Mehmet. Why does he feel the need to do this? This makes a guy who routinely killed his own advisors look better? Look, sieges are nasty business, as is war, and anyone who engages in such activities knows that he will get his hands dirty. It is part of the picture. No need for an author to defile his own soul defending these things. Men are capable of good and bad. The historian's role is to point out instances of both."},{"Title":"1453: The Holy War for Constantinople and the Clash of Islam and the West","review":"I am a widely-read amateur historian and was familiar with the outlines of the fall of Constantinople. Crowley sets the stage for the Ottoman conquest and brings to life many details about the long siege, the politics, and the local customs which, in the descriptions of impalement, are not for the faint-hearted. Crowley seems pro-Byzantine, as I probably am, but by current standards most of those folks were not nice people.A related book I also found fascinating, that provides important background, is \\"The Fourth Crusade and the Sack of Constantinople.\\" It examines the events in the early 13th century, what became the moral bankruptcy of the Fourth Crusade in 1204, and the eventual sacking of Constantinople by fellow-Christian crusader armies. A very sad tale indeed."},{"Title":"1453: The Holy War for Constantinople and the Clash of Islam and the West","review":"This exceedingly well-written book gives a concise narrative history of the many years of conflict between the Byzantine Empire and the Ottomans, and then gets down to the business at hand, which is the retelling of the siege and fall of the city of Constantinople. There is much detail in an almost day-by-day account of the siege, but the book is written so well that it is never boring. Many new wrinkles to this old story are included in the book, so even those who knew the outline of the tale will find something they didn't know on almost every page. It's a tragic story, but there is heroism on both sides in this conflict. It is a good idea to read a book such as this these days when there is such a distance between Christian and Muslim. Both sides will learn something valuable for themselves."},{"Title":"1453: The Holy War for Constantinople and the Clash of Islam and the West","review":"This book brings to detailed life the story of the siege and conquest of Byzantine Constantinople in April-May 1453 by the Ottoman army under Mehmet II. It takes the reader from Constantinople's mystical beginnings as the New Rome, through several sieges by Muslim armies in their wave of conquest through the Mediterranean culminating at Tours, to Mehmet's obsession with seizing the \\"Red Apple\\" and making it the center of his world empire even though the target of his desire is crumbling and no longer the economic powerhouse it had been before the Fourth Crusade. And then the siege itself is covered extensively, as well as its messy aftermath. Good pacing, good stories and the author's dedication to explaining some of the Medieval concepts and technology (especially the parts concerning the split between the Catholic and Orthodox churches, and the chapter on the Ottomans' massive cannon -- the biggest gun was 27 feet long and 75 cm wide at the mouth and could fire a 1200 pound ball!) to the reader make 1453 a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"1453: The Holy War for Constantinople and the Clash of Islam and the West","review":"Over the years, I must have read several books about the fall of Constantinople. I found this one to be the clearest, and most exciting of all of them. In many places, it becomes apparent how the author has actually walked the walls of the fallen city, touched the cannons that shot at them, walked the streets and churches where these events took place. He is fair to both sides, neither pulling any punches nor needlessly villainizing. He also has delved deep into accounts of the battle, bringing out both the courage and the bloodiness of Medieval combat, as well as the importance of faith in understanding this clash of Islam and Christianity. This book is well worth a read, to understand both the history of Europe and the Middle East, conflicts between the East and West, and the conflicts that continue to shape our world today."},{"Title":"1453: The Holy War for Constantinople and the Clash of Islam and the West","review":"The author writes with knowledge and panash.

It's action-packed and brimming with detail about the city and battle. By the middle of the novel, we get almost day-by-day blows of the fighting, as if written by a war correspondent who had witnessed the scenes. Crowley did a great service in making such a readable account of a crucial event in history. Hopefully, his engaging account will attract even readers who don't normally both with history. I would highly recommend this to anybody interested in history, or even adventure novels!

My only complaint is that it felt too short, though that may be because it read so well. At only a few hundred pages, I'm sure much more could have been added to the narrative, but the preciseness of the book made it that much better. Very well done."},{"Title":"1453: The Holy War for Constantinople and the Clash of Islam and the West","review":"This book is emblematic of popular history writing today on two accounts. First, it tries to examine a classic Muslim-Christian struggle in order to symbolize what the author perceives as todays struggle between Islam and the west. Second, after finding the event to write about and emphasizing its religious overtones, it then tries to show how perfect and merciful Islam is and tries to reveal how racist and brutal the west is. Under the guise of popular history and \`revealing' something new about \`why fundamentalist Islam objects to the West' it is merely propaganda on the subject, almost fictional. This book fills the same gap.With this in mind its is not a bad read, not accurate to be sure, colored, deeply biased, but well written. The essence of the subject is the fall of Constantinople, the city which was the center of Eastern Rome and then Eastern Christianity, withering on for far too long before it died, like Turkey became the \`Sick man of Europe' surely Byzantium was the \`sick man' of the 15th century. The author does a good job of explicating the previous sieges of the great city. However its downfall came because it had allowed the Turkish immigrants, principally the Ottomans to settle on the Western side of the Bosporus, so that the Turkish immigrants came to surround the city, which by this time relied on western European mercenaries(Venetians and Normans) to defend it from the Greek Christian slave soldiers who the Ottomans used against it. Byzantium was the center of Eastern \`Greek' Christianity, a rich city more renowned in tales then in reality, a point made in the book. Far from the books view that it was \`intolerant' and only the Islamic sacking of it, the Islamic selling of half the cities inhabitants into slavery and colonizing the large Church Hagia Sophia and converting it into a mosque made it \`tolerant' the city was in fact very tolerant, full of many cultures and traders from around the world. In fact its tolerance for unfettered immigration led to its destruction. An interesting, almost totally inaccurate and colored read when it comes to religion and the treatment of the Christian minority, however it has a few good points.Seth J. Frantzman"},{"Title":"1453: The Holy War for Constantinople and the Clash of Islam and the West","review":"1453 is the story of the siege and conquest of Constantinople, capital of the Byzantine Empire and last remnant of the glory of Rome, by the Ottoman Turks.The story revolves primarily around two men, Mehmet II, Sultan of the Ottomans and the dominant Islamic leader; and Constantine XI, the last of the Byzantine Emperors and champion of Eastern Orthodox Christianity. The personalities of the two men are well drawn and are symbolic of the characters of their two realms: the Ottomans were forward thinking and dedicated to the triumph of their faith while the Byzantines were fatalistic, just as dedicated to Christianity but obsessed with a seemingly unavoidable doom. There are many fine depictions of various events during the siege: the hauling of cannon and even entire ships for many miles across rough terrain by the Ottomans, the ceremonies of the Byzantines as they prayed before their icons for one more deliverance. There are also many excellent descriptions of the changes in technology and weaponry that made the siege one of the first \\"conquests\\" of the gunpowder era.The final chapters wrap up the story of the main characters and hint at future developments like the eventual decadence and decline of the Ottoman Empire. This is an essential addition to the library of any historian."},{"Title":"1453: The Holy War for Constantinople and the Clash of Islam and the West","review":"I chose to read 1453: The Holy War for Constantinople and the Clash of Islam and the West for my World History book review because I have always been interested in the history of Constantinople, especially its fall. Roger Crowley introduced the story with an attention-getting prologue that gave me an overall idea of the actions to come. When I began reading the book, I was surprised that Crowley began the story from the very beginning of the attacks on Constantinople in 669 by Caliph Muawiyyah. The book continues to depict all of the action Constantinople was a part of. Crowley clearly explains the origins of Constantine XI, the Emperor of Byzantium at the time, and Sultan Mehmet II, the Ottoman leader at the time.I was very satisfied with this book; the amount of detail, illustrations, and pictures is incredible. The final attack on Constantinople is depicted play by play beginning in 1451 with Sultan Mehmet's plans. The following chapters provide month by month and then day by day details down to the hours. The weapons used and the military strategies are all delineated in great detail with illustrations. Crowley definitely completes his purpose of educating about the history between the Ottomans and Constantinople. He also unravels the relationship between Christianity and Islam that surrounds the history of Constantinople. Overall, this book was a great historical and action read. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys all the details that history has to offer and doesn't mind being sucked back in time to be right in the middle of all the action."},{"Title":"1453: The Holy War for Constantinople and the Clash of Islam and the West","review":"A slow revival in the interest of Byzantium has recently been sweeping our era and Roger Crowley shows particular interest while writing this book. The book begins with the first couple chapters detailing the history of Islam and the Byzantine empire. The book soon wraps of this introduction though and begins an in depth account of the siege. Starting with the preparations Mehmet had to make to take the city and ending with the sack of the city, though another chapter details the rise of the Ottomans in Europe after the taking of Constantinople. I found the last chapters about the 28 and 29 of May to contain invigorating detail and more told as a story with few interruptions to the views of primary sources. I completely recommend this book to anyone who is looking to find out more about the Ottoman conquest of the city and it is a good read for anyone who already has somewhat of a prior knowledge of Byzantine history"},{"Title":"1453: The Holy War for Constantinople and the Clash of Islam and the West","review":"I came across this book when it was mentioned by another Amazon reviewer in connection with a different book, and thought I'd check it out. I'm glad I did. I'm a fan of this type of popular history, and \\"1453\\" is one of the finest I've read. Author Crowley tells the story of the epic siege of Constantinople the way it deserves to be told: With excitement, suspense, and a dose of horror. He manages to work in the complex history of the 1,000-year-old Byzantine Empire and the rise of the Ottoman nation in a lively and informative fashion, and concentrates on what the reader really cares about: Would Sultan Mehmet II be the first to do what no one had done for a millennium, and breach the walls of the greatest Christian metropolis of the Middle Ages? At times the book reads like a spy thriller, and I found myself unable to stop turning the pages, dying to know what happened next. Crowley is a fine storyteller and his grasp of the various aspects of the history -- including military, geographical, navigational, religious and cultural details -- is impressive. I learned more from this book than I have from several more comprehensive histories of the Byzantine Empire, and had more fun along the way. The author also does what so few historical writers remember to do, which is that when he refers back to one of the many hundreds of supporting characters who played a minor role in the story, he reminds the reader who they were and why they were significant, so you don't have to constantly go paging backwards or check the index to figure out who he's talking about. I wish more popular histories were this enjoyable. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"CAPTAINS CHAIR","review":"This book is an inspiration to those who may have an interest in finding information about the history of those who have come before us.

Here is an introduction to much more than the writings of an obscure ancient poet; the book is a primer in ancient Christian spirituality (perhaps just occasionally with some anachronistically modern &quot;spirituality&quot;; for that, maybe the book should get 4 1/2 stars). Great themes: paradox, e.g. God hidden and revealed in the Incarnation; the &quot;two witnesses&quot; of Scripture and nature; spirituality, sacrament, and symbolism; patterns of complementarity and contrast in the sacred scriptures; role of the intellect in the life of faith; theosis and exchange, etc. If you admire the writings of Dante, George MacDonald, Charles Williams or C. S. Lewis, you will find a true forbear of theirs here. British composer Sir John Tavener has drawn on Ephrem for texts of at least three of his compositions, including the superlative &quot;Thunder Entered Her&quot; of 1990. I included some of Ephrem's verse in a course and after that, students were coming by my office to tell about how moved by or interested in Ephrem, etc. they found themselves to be. I also recommend Brock's book of translations, HYMNS ON PARADISE. Buy both, and read them. They help Christians to contemplate the Mysteries."},{"Title":"The Luminous Eye: The Spiritual World Vision of Saint Ephrem (Cistercian Studies)","review":"This book provides an accessible entryway into the fascinating and sometimes mystifying world of early Christian theology, symbolism and poetry. No author could be better qualified to write it than Sebastian Brock, one of the greatest living scholars of the Syriac language and literature. The book concentrates on the works of the greatest theologian-poet of the Syriac language, Ephrem of Nisibis (ca. 306-373 CE).Ephrem is well known for his fluid and dynamic use of a wide range of symbols and metaphors as he expounded his faith. Most of his poems were written for the common people of his time, specifically, for use during church services. Thus, they were not designed to be esoteric, but rather artful and memorable. However, his view of the spiritual universe was so different from any modern western view that we moderns can easily get lost without a guidebook such as this one.Brock helps us understand Ephrem's use of paradox, symbols and the way Ephrem deliberately moves around the periphery of certain concepts while avoiding careful definition of them. Ephrem's symbols come from ancient Mesopotamian literature, from Jewish traditions and from Scripture itself. A chapter each is devoted to the key images of the \\"robe of glory,\\" the \\"medicine of life\\" and the \\"bridal chamber of the heart.\\" Many other symbols and concepts are dealt with, including: the hidden and the revealed, the one and the many, historical and sacred time, free will, the divinity as fire, the pearl and the lance.After surveying Ephrem's symbolic world, Brock discusses several other important issues. In chapter 8, he explains the kind of proto-monastic movement of which Ephrem was a part (sons/daughters of the covenant). In chapter 9, he discusses Ephrem's relation to contemporary Church Fathers who wrote in Greek (while Semitic and Hellenistic were poles on a continuum, they were not a sharply distinguished dichotomy). Finally, in chapter 10, he discusses how Ephrem and his writings are relevant today (you might be surprised to see that a 4th century Christian churchman felt that women had an important role to play in the liturgy of the Church).If after reading this little volume you want to read a whole cycle of Ephrem's poems, I highly recommendSt. Ephrem the Syrian: Hymns On Paradise, introduced and translated by Sebastian Brock. If you are ready for a more thorough introduction to Syriac Christianity,Symbols Of Church And Kingdom: A Study In Early Syriac Tradition, by Robert Murray, is essential reading.(Review completely rewritten, and greatly expanded, June 20, 2009)"},{"Title":"The Luminous Eye: The Spiritual World Vision of Saint Ephrem (Cistercian Studies)","review":"The Luminous Eye is one of the best studies on Saint Ephrem the Syrian symbolic thought.

Scholarly, unbiased, and betraying no hint whatsoever of any kind of agenda -- pro or con -- regarding abortion policy, the book is nevertheless revelatory concerning the development of abortion law in this country. From the colonial and early republican period, when abortion was perfectly legal (partly because doctors, hampered by inadequate medical knowledge, -- the difference between a pregnancy and some kind of uterine &quot;stoppage&quot; was unclear -- frequently administered medications that caused abortions) to the 1890s, when virtually every state had a system of laws prohibiting abortions, the story is capably told. And the truth ought to startle anyone who thinks religious activism was in any way responsible for the late 19th-century wave of anti-abortion legislation. I'll leave it to prospective readers to discover who or what was actually responsible, and how self-interest (as opposed to an interest in the unborn) played a crucial role. An eye-opener, and an important read for people for either side of the debate."},{"Title":"Abortion in America: The Origins And Evolution of National Policy, 1800-1900","review":"Mohr's groundbreaking work is a history of abortion in the United States from the colonial days until the present (as of the late 1970s). What is fascinating about this book is how the medical establishment railed against the increased use of abortion in the 1800s but became among its foremost advocates a century later. Mohr also shows the reader how legalizing abortion in recent years was not a result of lax morals but rather was a return to the past.This is a brief book, but it is one of the very finest books on this controversial issue."},{"Title":"Abortion in America: The Origins And Evolution of National Policy, 1800-1900","review":"How did legal access to abortion become THE domestic political/cultural issue that decides elections in the USA?

If for no other reason, please publish this review to set the records straight)The first thing I need to point out is that this book does not include any actual music theory, no chords, TABs or the like.Secondly I must point out that each of the currently 6 reviewers on here who gave this a one-star review have shown through their review that they have missed the point entirely.Although the book can indeed be summed up pretty easily, some of these reviews over-simplify the book by doing so. The depth that the author goes into in each of the sections is amazing and whereas I can see how it might be more value to performers rather than hobbyists, any open-minded, honest and unconceited guitarist can take something of value from this book regardless of why or where they play.The main objections I have seen to this book are from people who have become lost down the path the book warns about - playing needlessly flashy stuff with no spirit or emotional content, likely just going through the motions, over-focussing on their technique rather than giving a moment's thought to what notes they are playing or why they are playing them.One reviewer says he plays for a living and that this is the worst book he ever read. If he puts 100% of his spirit into every performance and plays for purer motivations (i.e. not money or to feed his ego) then he is already practicing Zen Guitar and just doesn't know it!This book changed my life and summed up what I believe to be the perfect approach to music-making so well, that I am currently planning to run seminars and workshops on the subject.Quite honetly, if this book doesn't mean something to you, you need to check why you bother playing guitar in the first place. If you can honestly say that it is for the joy and love of the instrument, you cannot possibly dislike this book."},{"Title":"Zen Guitar","review":"As the book states from the get-go, it is not a how-to book.

If you've ever practiced guitar (or anything), and run into obstacles like distraction, lack of focus, lack of confident, frustration...you name it. This book brings these elements of guitar learning into focus.One suggestion (from me)is not to look at all the concepts in the book as rules (as 1 reader got caught up doing), but as suggestions. Give them a try. You will no doubt stray from the path. That's natural. Don't get frustrated and just get back on it.

The songs you play can be presented in many different ways -- sweet, salty, peppery, spicy, tangy, sour, bland, etc. Just like the processed food on our grocery store shelves, one shouldn't pack their music with salt or sugar just to commercialize their product or appeal to a bigger audience.There are different opinions on what constitutes \\"good taste\\" or \\"bad taste.\\" The list of tasteful players was interesting. That's because we develop our sense of taste in much the same way as our sense of hearing. It can also change over time. Hear someone whose taste you like? Listen more to them. Listen also to their influences. Break the music apart. What's their recipe for moving you?If you incorporate principles of Zen instrument playing into your own music's presentation, then people will be moved by it. However, taste is only one factor to consider. To be a Zen player, there are many other focal points to contemplate and ponder.From the table of contents of Sudo's excellent book, his \\"Twelve Points of Focus\\" are:* Spirit * Rhythm * Technique * Feel * Perfection * Mistakes * Stage and Plateaus * Discipline* Limits * Follow Through * Taste * CollaborationA recent discussion I had with some others about fastest players was enlightening because speed is one of the twelve common missteps to Zen playing.

The gist of it seems to be that the main thing is to approach guitar with the right attitude - and it details what the author thinks that attitude should be. Basically, don't sell out, play from heart, don't cut corners, respect the audience, etc.. The authors Zen approach has something of a martial arts feel to it (not surprising as Zen was also the philosophy of the Samurai warriors). It reminds me of that Japanese meticulousness that is evident in the Tea Ceremony, Hondas, and martial arts Katas.

Great job!-Dr. Kenneth"},{"Title":"Zen Guitar","review":"This book seeks to inspire one to practice more and to be more focused on one's music and musical goals. But the problem is that the author tells you to do this, to do that, to watch out for this, but not for that, to think like this, and not like that, to try this, but not that, to be humble, yet at the same time intrepid, etc. ad infinitum. I want so bad to follow a wise path in my music, and the author of 'Zen Guitar' seems to have a lot to offer in that respect- TOO MUCH to offer, actually. I find myself getting so worried and caught up in following the authors many rules, noting his exceptions, avioding his stated pitfalls, and trying to be follow his fine-line, 'one mistake and you're out' path, that I am just going crazy trying to remember it all when I am playing. So I find I am not in zen at all. On the contrary, when trying to follow the authors well-intended advice, I get confused about just what kind of person the author would like for me to be, and I am full of self-doubt when I realize that I can not be as perfect as the author would like for me to be. It's hard enough practicing for a few hours each day. I just can't concentrate on what Philip Toshio Sudo wants me to do all the time, especially when I am playing. So sorry Philip- I know you mean well with 'Zen Guitar', but it's just too hard-line for me."},{"Title":"Zen Guitar","review":"I found this book to be a total waste of time. How many times do you need to be told &quot;find your own song inside you&quot;? Well, here you'll be told about 50 times, and it doesn't get any deeper than that. The author tosses in Zen phrases without in the least bit making them applicable to guitar playing. To save you some time and money, I can quote a few lines and you'll have the entirety of the substance of this book. &quot;The process of Zen Guitar is simple: Wear the white belt, pick up your guitar, tune, and play. Focus on putting your spirit into each note and you do not have to worry about landing a record deal or how many records you sell. If the fish bite, they bite.&quot; Yes, indeed, if they bite they bite, can't argue with that at all, and it's as profound and useful as the advice in this book gets. Useful? &quot;Acquire the technique you need, and no more. That is the Way of Zen Guitar.&quot; You know, I seriously had never thought of it that way---and won't ever again, either.I seriously think this book was written only because the title hadn't been taken. &quot;Hmmm.

No one's done a book about guitar and Zen.&quot;"},{"Title":"Zen Guitar","review":"I know I'm in the minority here, but I was very dissappointed in this book. The fact that many of the topics were covered with only one paragraph shows that the author is merely tacking on Zen quotes and &quot;soundbytes&quot; to the art of playing guitar, without any serious or in depth discussion of playing guitar.

For one thing, the author pretty much tells you straight up that you shouldn't make music about anything negative. So, if you want to be a \\"Zen Guitarist\\" you should avoid metal, punk, rap, and even a lot of country. He doesn't name any genres, but he definitely disparages music that \\"glorifies\\" guns, violence, suicide, hate, misogyny, ignorance, ect. The author seems to be proselytizing his own tastes in music.Like I said, there's a lot of condensed wisdom in this book. Metaphors and parables, catch phrases and common sense, but I could probably have done without the Zen stuff. It made me chuckle at times since I'm not sure I buy it.The book is almost like a self-help book for guitarists, putting you in the right state of mind to actually accomplish something with your playing. Here's what I got out of it:Don't waste any time doing anything half-hearted.Try to find what you're meant to do and find your limitations.You will never stop learning.The Zen stuff is mostly about stopping your mind from getting in the way. Other artists and authors speak about doing the same thing without the Zen stuff.Of course, even the Zen parables contain plenty of wisdom and stuff to make you think. Just don't take every single thing the book says as gospel."},{"Title":"Zen Guitar","review":"Honestly, this book is the biggest waste of $6 I've ever spent.

It was pure cosmic coincidence that led me to buy this book.

This book immediately caught my eye as I was searching for something profound to buy as a present for my musician brother-in-law. The price was right and the message was clear.Seeing as how his birthday was a few weeks away, I started to read it. I couldn't believe how much it addressed my style of playing and composing. I have always considered myself more of an artist than a musician.

Very pleased when he opened present. Received well packed and on time for Christmas."},{"Title":"Zen Guitar","review":"Philip Toshio Sudo is not Mel Bay--if you buy Zen Guitar looking for scales and chord charts, then yes, you will be disappointed. But the book's concept--the &quot;path of Zen Guitar&quot;--is not how to play, but _how_ to play and, depending on your interpretation, _why_. It's about motivation and fulfillment, not technique.What the book does--or did for me, at any rate--is help you evaluate why you play guitar in the first place and gives you some food for thought as you go about achieving your guitar goals. I am a sloppy, self-taught player, I have no experience with Zen teachings, and I'm not big on books that offer fun new dogma--but I found the book's focus on the spiritual and emotional aspects of creating music on a guitar as well as the musician's unique and personal relationship with the instrument both fascinating and extremely valuable. I feel I'm a better player now, practicing with sharper goals and better intentions; the book's advice has helped both broaden my outlook and focus my efforts. At no time does Zen Guitar neglect the importance of practice; it is, in fact, at the heart of the book (its First Point Of Focus: &quot;Don't ask, practice&quot;). Many of its concepts are direct from Zen teachings and beliefs, but the book neither preaches nor drags.Zen Guitar is a difficult book to describe, but I didn't find it difficult to comprehend--and I was able to apply its wisdoms to my playing immediately. As long as you *want* to explore the spiritual aspect of playing guitar, the book can be an invaluable tool."},{"Title":"Zen Guitar","review":"If you can only play one string - then play it! That is the spirit of this book. it connects the basics of guitar playing to spiritual development. Start with the basics, play what you enjoy, do what you are good at.

All chapters start with a quote from famous guitarists, people who know, and is worth listening to."},{"Title":"Zen Guitar","review":"Someone who is a great guitar player recommended this book to me. I study art and very interested in philosophical interpretation of music, art, life etc.Once I started to read it, I could not believe how many great thoughts it had. This book has SO many valuable sayings written in such a simple language! Take for instance couple of these, \\"if you can't play what you hear, then hear what you play\\" or \\"do it [practice] as much as needs to be done, as well as it needs to be done, when it needs to be done, and do it this way every time.\\"I don't like to read it too fast though because I need to put it through my own \\"filter\\", well, I just like to chew on :).I would say that \\"Zen Guitar\\" is for anyone who is interested in philosophy or/and any kind of art. I play some music instruments as well, and I think this book will help you depending on what you are looking for. For some it is strictly for that specific instrument (read: GUITAR) and will put some more soul in their sound but for others it just can be a starting point to many exciting discoveries in LIFE... enjoy!"},{"Title":"Zen Guitar","review":"In this age of mainstream music and synthesized music and voices, and [disappointing] boy bands, VERY few musicians, unfortunately, carry any passion at all for their instrument, or even their craft.Since the first time i picked up a guitar back in 1995, i've been completely and utterly awed and inspired by Johnny Rzeznik of the GOO GOO DOLLS. His songwriting and guitar playing always amazed me, and in one interview i read, he had spoken about this book and how it had helped him.Now, i have been playin guitar for 8 years now...and i'm pretty damn good! I've played for professional theatre productions, various bands, i even played in the band for Late Show with David Letterman. I thought i was good ~ Then i read this book and realized just how much i was MISSING!Don't get it wrong ---> this book isn't going to poison you with some strange new dogma. All you need to do is believe that there is in fact a spiritual connection between what your fingers are doing on the fretboard and what is going on in your heart. This book teaches you how to harness that and use it to your advantage. I honestly believe, and dozens of my co-workers and friends have agreed, that my guitar playing has been taken to a whole new level.ALL YOU GUITAR PLAYERS OUT THERE, I URGE YOU TO DO THE SAME.

However, I forced myself to keep reading and soon found myself caught up in the flow. I soon found myself picking up my guitar with &quot;intention&quot; and paying much more attention to what sounds were coming out. Looking back about a year after reading this book I suddenly realize that my playing has improved, I now practice 1-2 hours a day on average instead of 1-2 hours a week. I have a deeper emotional connection to my music than ever before. Just read this book and do what it says. Don't think about it because it will just make you laugh."},{"Title":"Zen Guitar","review":"I was pretty much gushing about this book for a while..., it felt life-changing..., but things usually do, and the initial excitement wore off, and i forgot about it for too long. i need to make sure that i read this thing every night..., or every morning when i wake up..i am a musician who has always had a profound problem with laziness.., then inability to focus on practice, and embarrassment at the prospect of performing.this book is a guide for me to confront many of my personal issues and overcome them..., though it's what i need to do with my playing..., not just reading this book..anyways... i later read\\"the secrets of succesful practicing for guitarists\\" by k downing or some such name..., and it was dry and boring in comparison, with rules etc...,this book's attraction is that it is not really about playing guitar..., but it is more about guitar than any other book.... it is not a book with \\"information' as the author states..., i am working throu leavitt's modern method for guitar and countless supplementary materials for that now..., but this book is like...,i hesitate to use the word spirituality...but many would call it that..it's just that it deals with the psychology of playing guitar... the feedback loop that is your mind..., and inserting these words into that feedback loop is bound to do good things for your playing.everything in here i agree with. the name zen is misleading to many peopple..., as it has been with his other books..., but this is more of a practical manual..., still, i must regret that so many people feel as though a spirituality with such history and power is being gradually lost and forgotten to a bunch of misinformation.. whenever i read this book i feel so incredibly happy and motivated to play music and live in a way that will promote my ability to make sound and be creative and happy..., without being embarrased of sounding sappy or new-agey. i am the anti-newagey person, a skeptic..., who believes in pure science as a governing principal..., but there is a grey space of unknown and this book is a guide to this unknown for me, in this area.--Daniel Page"},{"Title":"Zen Guitar","review":"There really isn't much I can add to the reviews already here. They are all right. I bought this book based on these reviews and I didn't like the book at all, at first. I thought it was just a bunch of esoteric eastern jibber jabber...and it is. It's rather silly at points. Sprinkled with quotes from artists most of whom have sold out whatever musical spirit they had years ago. All of that given, there are tons of books out there designed to tell you that all you knew before was completely wrong. You're holding your fingers the wrong way, real guitarists don't play those guitars, this style is better than that, you'll never be as good as so and so, etc. etc. Sound familiar? There is no end of people out there who live to tell other people their technique is wrong. This book dosen't do that. This book says if you feel it inside, then it's good music. This book says that good technique is important too, but the wrong note in the right spirit is better than the right note in the wrong spirit, and I have yet to find another book that just made me feel good about playing and learning, and not inadequate. Buy it for inspiration. Put it on your amp or music stand and just read a page of two when you feel like you'll never get there. Then you'll realize you're there already."},{"Title":"Zen Guitar","review":"I really dug this book. It inspired me to get an old guitar out of the closet and start plucking away again. It is really an approach on life in general but applied to guitar. It makes you want to play guitar, not for the glory but the love of music and a spiritual connection to the music within."},{"Title":"Zen Guitar","review":"I like this book quite a bit. Some find it lacking as a zen text, which it doesn't really claim to be. Others find it comes short as a guitar instructional, which is also not its intent. To me it seems like a book which tries to place a guitarist ina relatively zen state of mind. It does so without going into the type of rigor that would require the reader to be a student of philosophy, religion, or zen itself to understand.Its greatest triumph is its ability to focus a guitarists on self-expression and fulfillment through guitar. There's no competitive, flashy workout mentality, no boistrous 'do everything the way I do' bullying. Sudo comes right out and says that you'll need other resources for the nuts and bolts.In short, this is a great book to help a guitarists get into a good guitar state of mind."},{"Title":"Zen Guitar","review":"I've been playing guitar since I was 14 (I'm a lot older than that now -- a LOT), and was put onto this book by my friend Rosie Flores at a show we did with Wanda Jackson in Cleveland not too long ago (Wanda was being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame that weekend). I read it in a day -- couldn't put the thing down. The author put into words so many things I'd been trying to tell students of mine over the years, but couldn't quite get across somehow. If it doesn't help you, you're either not paying attention or aren't ready to hear what Sudo is saying. Excellent, perceptive, and right on the money, in all sorts of ways."},{"Title":"Zen Guitar","review":"This book really will change the way you play, but only if you play 'follow the leader' for a moment. The author applies Zen practice to the study of the guitar. It is done so brilliantly that one might not even suspect that anything particularly special has happened. But, if one records a typical practice session before reading this and then records a practice session after reading this book, I'd bet a lot of money that the guitarist is more happy with the sound of the second recording. If you are a classically trained guitarist, this book will help you break out of your caged way of thinking. That said, if you've never practiced Zen meditation, or you haven't a clue what Zen is before (or after) you read this book, the effect will be less powerful.

A must-read for all musicians."},{"Title":"Zen Guitar","review":"\\"Zen Guitar\\" is one of the best instructional books that I have found for the guitar. Although this book will not teach you how to make a 7b5 chord or how to play a Mixolydian scale it is not any less important. \\"Zen Guitar\\" teaches the way of the guitar, the mental aspect needed to play the guitar. There are so very few souls that are born to play the guitar. Many may have the technical ability to play like Stevie Ray Vaughan, but few could ever hope to radiate music like he did without help.Philip Toshio Sudo provides that help by exploring Eastern philosophies in respect to playing guitar and making music. There are over sixty lessons contained in this book, each short and containing only one point so the simple meaning is not lost in the explanation. Many guitarists become hung up on stupid, meaningless things that prevent one from fulfilling their guitar ability. The lessons that Sudo teaches point out these hang ups and explain the mental attitude that is required to reach your full potential.Not only will Sudo's work help a guitarist to see the light, but the lessons that he teaches can be used in every day life. He has done a good job in distilling the complicated thoughts of the Taoism so a Western mind can readily understand this foreign way of thinking. Every guitarist who ever talks about becoming better, or hack that just \\"doodles\\" on the fretboard, should buy this book and take the lessons to heart. \\"Zen Guitar\\" will open your mind and let guitar flow from your heart. You will become a better player, and if you take Sudo's teachings to heart, you will notice improvement outside the realm of guitar as well."},{"Title":"Zen Guitar","review":"This is a truly inspiring superb book for guitarists who desire to connect with their own inner creative selves as well as with the music and, with their audiences. The references and quotes from guitarists and creators we 'know' are extraordinarily insightful and motivational, and even surprising at times, and are so well used by the author for helping direct us through contemplation and exploration. This book would be ideal for 'dipping-into' daily or weekly for meditation and inner suggestion-starting material!

His instructive little book teaches that the mastery of Zen, as well as mastery of art, requires concentrated practice rather than simple instruction.For the student of guitar, Sudo's book offers important insights into what separates adequate musicianship from mastery; and, for the student of Zen, it illuminates a side of Zen practice not often discussed clearly and practically.--Publisher's Weekly, Jan 13, 1997, pp. 68-69"},{"Title":"Zen Guitar","review":"I... eat...think...drink...everything Guitar...

You really can learn the basics of Zen by playing the guitar. But the lessons don't stop with the guitar, it applies to all facets of life.

Most Zen books are chock full of Zen parables that people &quot;think&quot; ought to be included in a Zen text, ...many folks read them and accumulate an abundance of clever stories, but fail to realize that each story is a tool designed to inspire a particular state of mind. This book splits the difference and gives your head what it actually needs...the essential state of mind needed to make truly heartfelt music.To truly appreciate this book, one must be willing to explore, in depth, on a spiritual level, the reasons that one is drawn to making music.

And I'm betting you'll enjoy the guitar more than ever."},{"Title":"Zen Guitar","review":"This is a great book that combines music with martial arts, western and eastern philosophies. The chapters are short and insightful. So pu ton your white belt, tune your guitar and play."},{"Title":"Zen Guitar","review":"I've had this book for years, since the late 90'sI have it in the hard copy!I have given it as a gift about 23 times.Its a wonderful book that applies to life in general!A MUST READ for musicians as well as non-musicians!-Steve Amaral"},{"Title":"Zen Guitar","review":"To put it simple this book is amazing. I read it over avain often, and even had the zen guitar from the cover tattooed on my forearm."},{"Title":"Zen Guitar","review":"Item was what I expected....took 3 weeks to get it because it got lost in the post office, but didn't pay alot..so am satisfied.."},{"Title":"Zen Guitar","review":"I have a bookshelf of guitar books. All good in their own right. Techniques, theory, scores, tab and even luthier books. I was looking for a book that would help me with my approach to the guitar. Something that would help me with what I was thinking about as I was playing, how to be better focused and how to play more intentionally while deriving more satisfaction from my mostly fumbled beginnings. For me, this book was just the ticket. I'm on my third reading now. I pick it up every now and then when I get frustrated or start to feel hurried in my practice or feeling unsatisfied with my progress.I've read all the reviews so far and agree with them all. The book isn't for everyone. But, if you're like I am, looking to find satisfaction, some inner peace, and an inner approach to the guitar so that you can enjoy it at whatever level you play, I highly recommend this book. I'm not a zen type of guy. I haven't studied it and don't plan on it. I have my own life philosophy, so I don't need to apply the lessons of this book to life, but they could be. But, when it comes to how to think about playing, how to approach playing, how to think about improvement, how to let the guitar become an emotional outlet and to feel a sense of close harmony with your music, wow. This is a great meditational on guitar playing.I will probably read it for the rest of my guitar playing life."},{"Title":"Zen Guitar","review":"After hearing a lot of good feedback and reviews about this book i decided to find out for myself. I haven't been able to put it down since I got it. The book is focused on guitar, but from a positive spiritual/philosophical perspective. Because of this, the lessons in the book can be applied to anything, not just playing guitar. Although, the book has some philosophy, it is by no means the focus of the book to dispel any concerns there.You should get this book if: You have any interest in playing guitar, or a guitar player of any level with an open mind and a positive attitude about music and guitar playing. This book is packed with great quotes and perspective to help you form or reinforce your perspective.You should NOT get this book if: You are looking for a technical book with music theory, sheet music, or exercises etc.In summary, I have really enjoyed this book and recommend it to anyone with a positive attitude about music or playing guitar."},{"Title":"Zen Guitar","review":"Finished this book in about two days and loved it! It presents a beautiful philosophy for music and life. As a begginning classical guitar student ( age 52) this book was just what I needed to help me relax and just play or as the author says.. just pickup[the guitar, tune, play.[ASIN:068483877X Zen Guitar]]"},{"Title":"Zen Guitar","review":"\\"Zen Guitar\\" is a beautiful, short book that takes Zen principals and applies them to guitar playing. A long while back, there was a series of books called \\"Zen and the Art of ________\\" which I think may have influenced Philip Toshio Sudo to write this book. I am glad that he did, because as a fairly young instrument, the guitar lends itself particularly well to a Zen approach since even if you play classical guitar, you are still dealing with a fairly recent canon of acceptable works. To differing degrees, all creative guitarists are still pioneers thanks in part to the guitar's tradition of being a \\"folk\\" as opposed to a \\"fine\\" instrument. (This is not a distinction I agree with, but it's a perspective that many still hold to.)\\"Zen Guitar\\" is not a guitar method akin to what Hal Leonard or Mel Bay would publish. Instead, it is an exceptionally philosophical approach toward the act of creativity. Zen is about living in the moment, and living your experiences with integrity and with devotion to a positive approach. Philip Toshio Sudo's advice on practicing, for example, is that perfect practice makes perfect and so it is important to try and get the most out of practicing by playing notes with passion and with careful attention to detail. There are inspirational and illustrative quotes from (mostly) spiritually-oriented masters such as George Harrison and Carlos Santana. There's also a degree of wry humor - if you know that the Ventures were thought of as instrumental gods in Japan, the usage of a Mosrite-type electric guitar in the graphics will not only make sense but make you smile, too.Sudo also points out many of the pitfalls that many of us guitarists face, such as falling in love with technique, choosing to play music purely for commercial reasons, using our music to feed our egos, denegrating others, etc. I've seen these flaws in many players, including myself, and it is a challenge to remove them from your life. Suso also suggests that if your playing lacks true passion, perhaps it is because you are not playing guitar for the right reasons (a great insight). We are also prepared for the fact that our development will eventually hit plateaus and that these plateaus can be very discouraging unless you perserve to improve.Like the very best Zen books, this one is written in clear and easy-to-read language but this can fool the reader into browsing only at a superficial level. You need to take the time to drink in each of the short chapters and apply them to your own playing if you are going to see results.Zen is a largely Japanese philosophy in which devotion to mastery of a craft can lead to spiritual enlightenment. I have played guitar for about 20 years, and I have been fascinated with Japanese philosophy and Zen for even longer. I believe that Philip Toshio Sudo has given us a perfect meeting of the minds between the world of guitars and the world of Zen."},{"Title":"Zen Guitar","review":"This is a great little book for musicians or music enthusiastswho enjoy metaphysical inspiration.Don't just read it, live it."},{"Title":"Zen Guitar","review":"This book is a real gem if you have an open mind. The zen principles may seem weird or even silly to some people but they really do help a lot. I've adopted some of the principles to my practice & even some aspects of my life. This book can really help you to be your own pep squad-college (& sometimes life) is a drag & this some of the ideas in this book help to keep me on track-could do the same for others (not just guitarists)."},{"Title":"Zen Guitar","review":"This is an interesting book, sort of a hybrid between Zen philosophy and the reasons one decides to learn to play an instrument. At times vague (maybe the author's intention), it urges the reader to determine his/her motivation and approach to playing. I feel the reader would have a better perspective progressing through this book if he/she had some basic knowledge of Zen philosophy. Without that, some concepts may come across as unnecessarily simple or off point. Overall, this is a very good work....it compels one to become more introspective and realize ideas such as motivation and personal reward."},{"Title":"Zen Guitar","review":"This book has allowed me to take my work in meditation and centering prayer and apply it to my restart of learning the guitar. It has been essential in grounding my guitar practice into my preexisting rhythms. My guess is that it will allow a similar crossover for the guitarists who wishes to take up a meditative practice. Overall it is a great introduction to noncompetitive existence through playing the guitar. The juxtaposition of famous guitarists quotes, samurai maxims, and zen poems proves again and again how these world are interconnected and the bridges just have to be pointed out."},{"Title":"Zen Guitar","review":"PROS: a sentimental, warm fuzzy, encouraging, inspirational read.CONS: unlikely to make one a better guitarist or deeper person, and often reverts to Taoist cliches.RECOMMENDATION: If you have a contemplative personality and play guitar, by all means, read this book. You will enjoy it. If you are more of the pragmatic sort, let it pass. Whether or not you get much out of this book will be determined more by your own personality than the quality of the book."},{"Title":"Zen Guitar","review":"This is a wonderful book, but it is not used to teach guitar, as some reviewers have tried to convince you. It is meant to find the song within yourself, which will make playing the guitar more worthwhile and enjoyable.The premis is simple enough, that everyone has a song within them that makes them human. This book is meant to be a tool to come closer to that song. The path goes through a complete circle (white belt, black belt, and white belt again).To go through the full circle, you must work for it. With the work, your belt will become soiled and turn black. After it's black, the work will wear off any color, returning the belt to white.This is an excelent tool to be used, but it is meant for people who are serious about their guitar playing. Trust me, I play guitar, and it was a great help to enjoy guitar playing even more."},{"Title":"Zen Guitar","review":"I bought this book hoping it would add a spiritual dimension to my practice of zen, and my practice of the guitar. I don't believe it did much of either, primarily because I'm not a performer and this book is definitely geared toward performers. I found the treatment of zen to be somewhat diluted as well. I guess it was just not for me! However, it's a wonderful topic and I'd like to see the author give it another go, this time perhaps with the guitar hobbyist/wannabe (e.g., moi) in mind, and a more rigorous treatment of zen."},{"Title":"Zen Guitar","review":"This is one of the best books I've ever read. I own thousands of books on virtually all subjects, and I rank Zen Guitar certainly among the top five in my library.The book is packed with profound wisdom which applies to all aspects of life, not just guitar. I won't be surprised if I read this book over and over again for the rest of my life.The book is also very clearly, economically, and artfully written in short, easily digested, sections.Sudo was, without a doubt, a very deep thinker and it's a real tragedy that he passed away. I'm sure he could have given so much more to the world, but at least he left us the gift of this book."},{"Title":"Zen Guitar","review":"I get something out of this book everytime I read it. What I \\"got\\" this last time is an understanding and appreciation for my own playing. It has really helped me to silence those negative and overly critical thoughts that plague so many aspiring musicians."},{"Title":"Zen Guitar","review":"As a previous reviewer mentioned, don't expect technical details on how to play from Zen Guitar. Instead, use this book to help you get into the right mindset. Develop the right attitude towards your instrument and towards playing, and that is half the battle. I played guitar for about a year, then let it collect dust as life became more hectic. When I received this book as a gift, I also let it collect dust. When I finally read the book, it reignited my interest in the guitar, and has provided me with the spirit to continue, and also to set appropriate expectations for myself. I don't need to be as good as anyone else, as long as what I am playing makes me happy. Three things to remember: Pick up your guitar. Tune. Play. That is all there is to it!"},{"Title":"Zen Guitar","review":"I'm a keyboardist, but I found myself entranced by this book while browsing the music section in Borders. It may not be entirely accurate to Zen teachings; I'm not qualified to say. But it inspired me to take on my playing with a whole new attitude. It's honestly changed the way I look at things. Because it's fairly short, I wasn't intimidated by it in the store. But every page seems to mean something. I'm not exactly sure how to describe it, but I've tried.Go to a bookstore, and read a bit of it. You'll probably know whether you like it or not within the first ten pages. If you're like me, it'll inspire you."},{"Title":"Zen Guitar","review":"I have had this book for nearly two years, and it has been an interesting read, to say the least! Sudo's book is inspirational and thought-provoking. If you're a guitar player, you might think it's just another &quot;become a guitar god in one hour&quot; by Shred Johnson; to stop there would be to deny yourself a spiritual insight into an instrument that conveys such soul and emotion. From my personal experience, I can say that my emotion has come out more in my music than before I read this book- my playing has become fluid and relaxed! I still &quot;rock out&quot;, but I do it with much more openness. Do what the greats do: go into this book as a child, and come out as a master of your musical soul!!"},{"Title":"Zen Guitar","review":"This is the most helpful book I have ever read about how to approach learning anything which takes time and discipline. I am not even a musician, I'm a visual artist, but everything in here can be applied to any discipline one pursues--even business or science, or daily living itself. The chapters are short, but to really internalize them and put them into practice takes time and conscious effort. Thus it's not a book to read through once and then set aside, but rather to digest slowly through many readings......I love this book."},{"Title":"Zen Guitar","review":"This book is my favorite book about playing guitar in the same way the June 1978 Guitar Player magazine interview with Carlos Santana is my favorite interview with a guitar player.Learning specific techniques, scales, chords, etc. and applying them mechanically is one thing. However, employing various techniques, scales, chords, etc. so they actually mean something is another matter entirely.This excellent text focuses on the gestalt of guitar playing and musicianship. Of course it's incredibly important to learn about specific techniques. However, this text covers the other half of the game-- how to play meaningfully with thought and spirit. The best musicians have both bases covered.A must-have. Excellent text for musicians playing other instruments, as well. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Pooh's Little Etiquette Book","review":"I thought the book would be a story where pooh learned about manners, like excusing your self before you leave the dinner table, but it's not. On one page there is one to two etiquette tips about two sentences long. On the next page there is a quick little skit with pooh and his friends, that in my opinion could have been written a little better to explain the tip on the opposite page."},{"Title":"Pooh's Little Etiquette Book","review":"I can't think of a reason why this book was printed, except to attract the attention of Pooh fans such as myself to purchase a cute-looking but overall rather irrelevant book on Pooh's etiquette. It's one of those coffee-table books that looks nice and is fine to browse through, but will not really start any meaningful conversations. A Pooh fan will already be familiar with the quotes in the book, and I found myself rolling my eyes at some of the summaries of the quotes. Regardless, it is a cute little book but do not expect anything monumental, nor should you expect to change your etiquette upon reading this book."},{"Title":"The St. Gregory hymnal and Catholic choir book;","review":"After I download this, I tried to go in and see if I can get to a song by looking in the table of content. This has a text table of content that doesn't do anything. For example: It says, a song is on a certain page. However, there is NO PAGE NUMBER in the Kindle version. So to get to the song I want, I pretty much have to search for it using the search tool. Looking at the table of content only helps you know that the song exists. You cannot touch the song title to go to that song. GO TO Page number is not available, so I can't \\"go to\\" the song I want to get to unless I type it into the search.

Unfortunately, the sheer amount of information can also be a detriment: finding the right fix often requires significant digging.\\" Enter CSS Hacks and Filters: a book intended to save readers some time googling their CSS/cross-browser compatibility problems by compiling the most common solutions all in one location.For the beginner, it covers some of the basics, such as why use CSS at all, the notorious box model, the tan hack and the workarounds for floats. For the more advanced user, it covers some familiar ground, but goes into more detailed topics, including advanced layouts, navigation structures and using server-side solutions (ASP, PHP and ColdFusion) to control CSS. For Macromedia users, there are two chapters devoted to using CSS with Dreamweaver MX 2004 and Contribute 3. While now a version old with the release of Dreamweaver 8, most of the information is still relevant.Lowery also overviews a few topics that can be used in conjunction with CSS, including JavaScript. One that caught my eye in particular was the section on scalable flash replacement, which automatically generates flash headings to replace CSS-styled text for those users with Flash Player 6 or later. As with most of the topics covered in the book, he provides links to the original sources of the information on the Web to supplement the explanations provided in the book.In such a recent book, I was surprised to find an entire chapter devoted to hacking Netscape 4 (with a section concerning IE 3 and 4), considering that the only thought most designers give to Netscape 4 nowadays is pitying the poor fools still stuck using 9-year-old software.While probably not the best book for the absolute beginner with no CSS experience or the very advanced Web developer for whom these hacks have become second nature, it's a useful resource for those of us in the middle... particularly for those who prefer checking an index in the back of a book as opposed to sifting through a few thousand Google hits."},{"Title":"CSS Hacks and Filters: Making Cascading Stylesheets Work","review":"I know that all of this information is available online, but it is nice to have it collected between two covers. As far as I can tell, Lowery gives full credit to those CSS pioneers who've discovered these hacks, so I tip my hat to him for that.

Links are provided to go straight to the source for most of them though, so you can read more if necessary.Another great, useful book from Joseph W. Lowery.

Stone offers startling insights into the complex world of one of the 20th century's most captivating journalists. This book, obviously the result of years of dedicated research, says as much about I.F. Stone as it does about the author Cottrell. Not only does the book depict Stone as a central character in the radical left, but also it places Cottrell as one of our most significant biographers of left-wing intellectuals (also see Cottrell's other biographies about Roger Nash Baldwin, the founder of the ACLU, and Nicholas Comfort). A biography should be assiduously researched and fair-minded, coveying its subject's contributions and conflicts. Cottrell accomplishes this, but the biography goes beyond a factual depiction, in that it also conveys both its author's and its subject's passion for left-leaning ideals. This is a brave work about a brave man."},{"Title":"Izzy: A Biog Of I.f. Stone","review":"The review you have unstarred was delivered by me to offer a sampling of positive analyses about Izzy. I gave my own book 5 stars, not 0, as you have indicated."},{"Title":"Izzy: A Biog Of I.f. Stone","review":"Izzy offers a not always objective look at its subject, and one that couldhave benefitted from tigher editing. As a stylist, Cottrellseems to borrow from certain sections of Numbers, listing name aftername. He also makes the same points repeatedly, which can wearon the reader at times.Stone himself is made out to be a hero, and the author presentssome good reasons for supporting this -- Stone almost neverfollowed the pack blindly during his long career as a journalist,and by following his instincts, rather than seeking approval ofsources, he was able to break big stories, on Vietnam in particular.Cottrell, in his efforts to make Izzy a hero, sometimes glosses over some of the questions he raises aboutStone's character, such as his reluctance to treat left-leaningnations with the same acid-test he applied to right-wing nations.Cottrell does not ignore Izzy's inconsistencies, though. Readers willwill understand why Stone was at one time or another at oddswith not only the Establishment but his own friends on theleft.Perhaps the real value of Izzy comes from the context it gives toIzzy's times. One follows the rise of Liberalism in the '30s,and gains perspective on why it faded as a force in Americanpolitics and society, and how McCarthyism evolved."},{"Title":"Izzy: A Biog Of I.f.

Think of Ezra Pound, his vitriolic and poisonous braodcasts,and hgow he has been tarnished.Or Lindbergh.To be preached to on moral responsibility from soemone who ignored the atrocities that were day to day life in the Soviet Union is bizzare,if not wilfully ignorant.We have a responsibility to satnd up for all victims, as Albert Camus said,not to be on the side of the exucutioners.

Everything he wrote in Hidden History is not just wrong, but despicable lies...and Soviet records confirm this. If Stone had been an independently-minded journalist with a different slant, there is no way he could have been so far off on the origins of the Korean War. The only explanation for his take on it was...surprise!...it was the view being promulgated by the Soviets/Chinese/North Koreans.To call this guy an independent journalist is like calling Rush Limbaugh a socialist. He was, if not a spy, an agent of communism. And if you missed the launches of NK missiles and their nuke test lately, you missed the fruits of Mr. Stone's labor."},{"Title":"Izzy: A Biog Of I.f.

If you don't believe me, read the decrypts yourself (do a search here on \\"Venona\\"). He worked to spread propaganda in America for a brutal Soviet regime that killed tens of millions, and he was paid to do it. When he died, his family burned all his private papers to conceal the truth, but ultimately he was exposed by Venona in 1994.I read this book with morbid fascination at how the liberal media touted this guy as \\"a Gibraltar of journalistic integrity\\" and \\"The most honest reporter in America\\" even as he worked to destroy our country. It's sad that even today few people are aware of the truth about this evil man who hated our American democratic, free-market values but embraced the monstrous totalitarianism of the Soviets."},{"Title":"Gus Loved His Happy Home","review":"Gus is a very friendly ghost. He lives in an attic apartment of the Historical Museum. His attic-mates are a cat called Cora, and a mouse, aptly named, well, &quot;Mouse&quot;. Cora is refered to by the author as &quot;a very nice person&quot;, although she is obviously feline through and through. The reference to her being a 'person' is quite endearing, and not the lest bit odd. Mouse is rather cranky, but he knows his place, as anyone who has read &quot;GUS WAS A FRIENDLY GHOST&quot; would certainly know. Mr. Frizzle runs the museum, and he allows Gus to board there as long as he helps tidy the place and keep burglars away. Mr. Frizzle is a bit cantankerous, but deep down you know he has a good heart, as evidenced in &quot;GUS AND THE BABY GHOST&quot;. Gus is generous, patient, funloving, charming and a hard worker as well as a dear friend. He has a positive outlook and loves to try new things. This story begins when Frizzle leaves the museum in Autumn, for vacation, and returns in the Spring. During his absence, Gus is in charge and learns some new things. He tries his hand at various hobbies and passes the time exploring new interests. Sometimes he has a mishap and needs a ghostly bandage on his ghostly finger or toe. The story ends with Gus learning to fly like a kite, (the season is Spring now) and then spotting Frizzle on his way home from his vacation in a jet plane. Gus makes a mad dash home through the clouds, goes into a cleaning frenzy, and barely finishes as Frizzle walks in.As always, the story ends happily and everybody is satisfied. I love Gus, his gorgeous sheets, his bang clank equipment, and his zest for life! Well, his ghostly life, anyway! I remember fondly the Gus books, mostly looking at the pictures in the waiting room of my pediatrician's office, when I was 7 and had the jitters as any child waiting to see a doctor does. The books were a happy distraction for me, and for others I know. Now I'm 32 and love reading Gus to my own 5 children. It was so nice to see another Gus book in print recently. We never grow tired of reading these happy adventures. Enjoy~!"},{"Title":"Gus Loved His Happy Home","review":"I have fond memories of the \\"Gus\\" books as a child. The stories were among my favorite - the books own much wear and tear on the cover and pages for I still own the original books that I had as a kid. This one was not only a pleasure to read and enjoy (I hadn't owned or read it before) but I was glad that I could contribute yet another to my own children's collection."},{"Title":"Heirs of the ancient Maya;: A portrait of the Lacandon Indians","review":"Loved it. It is so sad to see the culutre of this incredible people disappear and see how the different religious, political and special interest groups are destroying them."},{"Title":"Topoi, the Categorial Analysis of Logic (Studies in Logic and the Foundations of Mathematics)","review":"When Goldblatt's book first hit the stands, it was blasted by reviewers who had a geometric predilection. They claimed that Goldblatt had trivialized this essentially rich geometric subject by giving a set-theoretic treatment.I became fascinated with topos theory in the summer of 1989. My only experience with category theory at that time was some dabbling that every graduate student gets in studying modules and in functional analysis. I didn't have much background in algebraic topology where the subject is usually developed considerably further.Frankly, I found Goldblatt's &quot;gentle&quot; approach to categorical concepts and the concept of a topos very rewarding. I worked through most of the book in a summer, and was fully prepared to take on the more advanced texts at that point. Later, I had the opportunity to teach topos theory at the graduate level to people with backgrounds similar to mine (i.e., without a strong background in category theory). We worked through most of Goldblatt's book in the first semester and I guarantee that all the students were very grateful, as I had been, for Goldblatt's approach to the subject.The book is well written, accessible to graduate students, filled with fun and often challenging exercises, and packed with references. In my opinion, it is the right place to start if you want to become proficient in topos theory (and you don't already have significant proficiency in category theory)."},{"Title":"Topoi, the Categorial Analysis of Logic (Studies in Logic and the Foundations of Mathematics)","review":"I have only read the first seventy pages of this book, but so far it is excellent. The character of the book can be likened to Kleene's \\"Introduction to Metamathematics\\" or \\"Mathematical Logic.\\" The subject is well motivated by brief philosophical discussions, but the philosophy is not allowed to interrupt the flow of mathematical development. There are few exercises, but enough for the casual reader to check from time to time that he or she is understanding the material. The exposition itself is perfectly clear and concise, by my lights. Nothing important is skipped--one does not need to fill in the blanks in proofs--yet the book moves at a good pace. The focus of the book is on the development of Category theory in relation to its applications in logic. For this reason it is probably of more interest to a logician or a philosopher than to a computer scientist. Indeed, for the logician who is interested in Category theory this book cannot be missed. To put it bluntly, Goldblatt strikes me as a superior mind, even his brief remarks on set theory were enlightening. The book has been (to this point, at least) a very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Topoi, the Categorial Analysis of Logic (Studies in Logic and the Foundations of Mathematics)","review":"I came to this book with an interest in philosophy of mathematics, formal semantics, and non-classical logics, attracted to the author's stated goals to make category theory and its implications available to both the mathematically and philosophically inclined by requiring very little background in set theory or mathematics. I have a fairly good grasp of first order logic, and know enough set theory to talk about things like Kripke semantics in a general fashion, and I find this book challenging. The author defines things like a limit on a diagram (fairly early in the book) and doesn't make it clear to me what the significance of the concept is supposed to be.I do still find it full of suggestive and interesting ideas, and the author is clearly knowledgeable and enthusiastic. A general picture does emerge in the less formal discussions at the beginnings of the chapters, so flipping around a little can help you get an idea for the context. But ultimately I think this is still more accessible to graduate level math students, and I'm giving it a four star review because so far as I can tell, it succeeds in its technical aspects, and mainly fails only in reaching its entire stated audience."},{"Title":"Topoi, the Categorial Analysis of Logic (Studies in Logic and the Foundations of Mathematics)","review":"very well written book starts with nontechnical chapters to technical ones. I would recommend this book as an advanced reading for students and researchers in the field of philosophy of mathematics and foundations of mathematics and logic."},{"Title":"Topoi, the Categorial Analysis of Logic (Studies in Logic and the Foundations of Mathematics)","review":"I bought this book because I was interested in applying topos theory to quantum mechanics but I had no knowledge of category theory. Looking for books on Amazon this seemed to me perfect because it not only explains topos theory but also offers an introduction to category theory. This introduction can be followed without problems for those who had no prior knowledge of category theory, in addition the book's style is clear and concise, motivating each concept introduced. Of course you can not read it like a novel, the reader must work each example and exercise to gain mastery over the issues."},{"Title":"Fatigue Testing and Analysis: Theory and Practice","review":"It is a well written book on fatigue-theory, methods, and testing process. It also contains numerical examples to demonstrate the theory in time history loading as well as spectral. I was working on fatigue due to random vibration. This book contains theory, recent advances, and few step by step numerical examples; that helped me to easily implement random vibration fatigue or fatigue due to PSD and ASD."},{"Title":"Fatigue Testing and Analysis: Theory and Practice","review":"This book does an excellent job covering many topics in fatigue of metals from simple uniaxial constant load to complex damage accumulation theories.Two specific topics motivated me to buy the book. First, this is one of the few books to do a decent job of summarizing how to use statistical methods to generate an appropriate typical and design curve from a set of SN data. Whether you want to characterize the whole range of fatigue life or just the endurance limit, several test design and the statistical analysis of those test results are well covered.MMPDS, Chapter 9andAnalysis and Representation of Fatigue Dataare more extensive on this topic but also overkill for many engineers.Second, this book has the best explanation I've ever read of the double linear damage rule. Only Gary Halford, himself, ever explained it better to me. Both of these subjects included theory and practical examples to ensure adequate understanding of the material.But I can't give it five stars because of organizational problems. Each chapter is written by a different author. Everything you need to know for a chapter is not necessarily covered within that chapter or the ones before it. This wouldn't be so bad except that the index is awful. Major important topics are not even listed in the index (e.g., double linear damage rule). Page numbers are incorrect; I just spent 5 minutes looking for a good example but EVERY entry I picked from the index was incorrect.This was not a problem when I read the book cover-to-cover after I bought it. But I work for a living and when trying to use this book as a reference I always have to go looking for the info I need and that wastes time."},{"Title":"What Our Children Teach Us","review":"Through a series of anecdotes about what it is like to interact with young children, WHAT OUR CHILDREN TEACH US shows us how much we have to learn from kids, especially about honesty. It left me smiling. A nice gift for young fathers (or mothers)."},{"Title":"What Our Children Teach Us","review":"I would recommend this book to any father or mother commmitted to being a fully present parent. Has the flavor of real life and the feeling of being with children during the &quot;small&quot; everyday moments that really count. It's also very amusing to see how the author discovers important things about himself and adults in general from his son's reactions."},{"Title":"What Our Children Teach Us","review":"What a wonderful little book!

It is pre-punched so that you can carry it around in a three ring binder with you. I have had my Latin Grammar Card for many years and it's still in great shape! Yes, you can certainly find any of these grammar rules on the Internet for free, but can you condense them all down so that they fit on a 2 sided card? It won't replace a good Latin grammar book, but it is definitely easier to carry and will certainly help you tell your declensions from your conjugations!"},{"Title":"Latin Grammar (Barron's Card Guides)","review":"I bought the card because I need a [very] quick reference for the rudiments of Latin grammar, and didn't want to carry a larger book. What you get is a single two-sided sheet of laminated cardboard, about Letter Size (8.5x11 in^2) with holes on one side to place in a ring binder. The card is very useful and nice, and while, as a reviewer already pointed out, the information is available for free over the internet, the whole point of this card is in its extreme portability, compatness, lightness, and most importantly -- ease of lookup and use.Now for the bad news: The card arrived with a nasty sticker glued onto its lower right corner. The sticker had some information about the \\"book\\" including a barcode, etc. The problem is that the card is so packed with information that the sticker covered it. The sticker is almost impossible to scratch off! I hesitate to try any solvent, like alcohol or acetone; I'm sure they'll do a good job of erasing the card as well. If you buy this card, I suggest you also by a soft white eraser (\\"rubber\\", as it's known in British), and spend a good 15 minutes rubbing off the sticker. You'll need to nudge it a bit with a fingernail or a knife, and then rub the eraser over it repeatedly until some of the sticker comes off. Then scratch it some more with a knife, and go over it again with an eraser, and so on. Be patient, and prepare to spend most of the eraser on the task -- I've never seen stickers like that sold to civilians... This sticker is probably certified MIL spec or something. It would have been so much better to have used a sticker with weaker glue, or otherwise glue it to the wider edge and let it extend beyond the card."},{"Title":"Latin Grammar (Barron's Card Guides)","review":"This is a great ready-reference all on one card. To be honest, I photocopied the card on front and back (which also has information) and pinned both up to the bulletin board above my desk so that I could quickly glance and see the information as I work on translations of Vergil and Augustine. Here you will find the basic endings for the nouns and adjectives of the major declensions, the primary structures for verbs of the major conjugations, discussion of active and passive, indicative and subjunctive, and a bit on irregular verbs.This is no substitute for study, and no substitute for a proper grammar. In regular reading of Latin, one encounters exceptions to almost every rule as a matter of course, and those are far too numerous to fit on a card such as this. This brings me to the one drawback of this card -- the print is very small, and I find that it can be a bit difficult to read on its own. The above-mentioned photocopy was also an enlargement to 11x17, which makes the reading much easier. However, to have such a ready reference available for most (if not all) one needs to learn Latin while standing on one foot is a very good thing, despite the minor drawback."},{"Title":"Latin Grammar (Barron's Card Guides)","review":"(...) I thought it was flash cards for studying. Don't buy it.It's a laminated piece of paper. Don't buy it.It is a yellow 8.5x11 paper with a barocde and holes in the side for putting in a binder. It has some grammar rules that can be had from the internet for free."},{"Title":"The Book and the Brotherhood","review":"Murdoch establishes a tone entirely different from those of her other novels. The characters seem more disturbed and more strained than those of her other works, yet their conclusions become more meaningful. In this novel, Murdoch may come as close as she ever does to the &quot;real&quot; world that we experience. It shows how difficult it is to be good, to throw off the tendencies towards self-delusion that keep us from seeing what is really going on in the world. Jenkin and Gerard are especially interesting characters in the contrast they create, and Crimond is fascinating because Murdoch allows him to remain vague for most of the novel. Also, the complex beginning that hints at A Midsummer Night's Dream is ingenious. Besides The Green Knight, this could be Murdoch's most ambitious work."},{"Title":"The Book and the Brotherhood","review":"This novel may be Murdoch's finest. It has a wonderful and large cast of memorable characters; their sufferings are both moving and laughable. It has the finest parrot in all literature. The problem I first had with the novel was discovering what it was about. There were so many major characters and so many bizarre incidents that I could not easily find the book's theme--and I had been taught to look for themes. I think that at the heart of the novel, often unnoticed by its readers, is Murdoch's narrator. The narrator is almost never intrusive, but her presence makes the novel hang together."},{"Title":"The Book and the Brotherhood","review":"Iris Murdoch's \\"The Book and the Brotherhood\\" is a marvelously droll novel of manners that has the audacity to explore the philosophical and moral issues that have effectively paralyzed a group of \`60s-era Oxford graduates. The novel opens, appropriately enough, at Oxford, where, in the shadow of their former classmates and professors, the friends have gathered some 25 years later for a Ball. The narrative follows the movements of the group in a Mozartian roundelay, as each is, in turn, humiliated by revenants that appear to mock the potential they have, with one notable exception, so ingloriously squandered. The title refers to a pact the graduates once made to underwrite a philosophical treatise to be written by David Crimond, the most charismatic of their set; to the consternation of each, however, it now appears that the book might actually become a reality, and the prospect of its publication leads the group to an orgy of self-reproach and soul searching. The event of the Ball also inspires one wife to leave her husband and to take up with Crimond, a decision that leads to unexpected complications in all their lives. The novel is full of comic and tragic moments whenever the principals, whom Murdoch likens to a chorus-line of snails, attempt to emerge from their shells. A second generation of thirty-somethings is headed down the same path of dalliance as their elders, or so it seems, until, in the final pages, Murdoch offer an affirmation, of sorts, in the form of a pending marriage. Readers familiar with earlier novels by the late Dame will not be disappointed by this weighty offering from 1987, which can only enhance Murdoch's already-secure reputation as one of the great novelists of her generation."},{"Title":"The Book and the Brotherhood","review":"Ah, it was a happy day in Beaumaris library in 1993 that I came upon this, my first Iris Murdoch novel. The characters in this book actually live in my head - and many of the set-piece scenes too - the opening Commem Ball with music by the appropriately-named band The Treason of the Clerks (puctuated by Gerard's disturbing interview with his old tutor Professor Levquist), Jenkin Riderhood's London flat with the windows open year-round, the squalor of Violet and Tamar Henshaw's quarters with the television permanently on (the mere presence of a televison is a sign of utter moral depravity in Iris's world!), Gerard's love for his parrot, Duncan Cambus's leonine mane of dark hair, the menacing ideological purity and commitment of David Crimond, half the cast of the novel ice-skating on Rose Curtland's pond, the tower in Ireland where two of the characters take refuge as lovers, and then the dark night that they deliberately drive their cars at each other along a country lane... I have written all of those from memory. If you seek a highbrow soap-opera about the liberal conscience in Englan just before the Wall came down, with some ice-skating thrown in, look no further."},{"Title":"The Book and the Brotherhood","review":"A wonderful blend of politics and Murdochian love-intrigue. It's a portrait of an enigmatic man on whom everybody projects his/her angst. Somehow moral progress emerges in small but meaningful ways."},{"Title":"The Book and the Brotherhood","review":"Unlike the randomness that is usually at play with Iris Murdoch's novels, The Book and the Brotherhood sees a group of Oxfordians on their quest not only for a better world but to the betterment of each other. What is the Good and how mortals stray into playing at God find unexpected insight and horror to both characters and reader."},{"Title":"The Book and the Brotherhood","review":"I wonder if this book was the best way to start becoming familiar with IM? As a comparison my favorites are Charles Taylor and Isaiah Berlin (at the moment) and they do not write novels. Wending my way around the frivolous soap opera like manage has me wondering where the philosophy is. Sure it must be reflected in the attentions and characterizations of the book and I must say I loved the constant failures of Duncan - poor Jenkins - this is great British humor. But for all of that it is he that ends up in France. Perhaps had Peter Sellers lived to play the role of Duncan in a film ... but that is an incomplete thought. Love must be the philosophical connection - I hope. But this is not Platonic. Perhaps another will be more interesting? If anything is unusual here it might be the plethora of interesting references. Who would have thought quoting Dostoevsky could give someone away? German and French come in handy occasionally."},{"Title":"The Book and the Brotherhood","review":"As is her practice, Murdoch starts the novel with a dialogue among the characters making the reader to find out the relevant context.Too many characters disturbed in one way or the other compel the reader to go back in the story to find the link. The novelist's description of the chacters'views on God, Good and Reality compels admiration because, the tendency of the human being in this technological era is also not to arrive at a sane conclusion immediately on morals or philosophy.The moral and philosophical concerns of Iris murdoch in this novel are too heavy to grasp initially. As the work progresses, the reader realises the need for some soul searching to understand the relationships.The characterisation of Crimond and the homo-sexual relations of characters like Gerard, Jenkin etc provide much food for thought.The novel set in midsummer ends with the spring time of happiness in the life of Gulliver and Lily."},{"Title":"Meg's Monkey (Surprise, Surprise)","review":"I recieved this book recently and if you can find it I have not seen a better book for a baby.

It is so well written and presented that I felt like I was reading a terrific story. At t he end I knew I'd done that and more!"},{"Title":"Elementary lessons in logic: Deductive and inductive","review":"Jevons has succeeded in writing a great introduction to logic. With that being said, Elementary Lessons in Logic is not an easy book to read. It requires a lot of discipline to get through. However, if properly studied, this book will be highly rewarding and well worth your effort.Jevons starts with the very basics by defining what logic is: \\"Logic is the Science of Reasoning, or the Science of those necessary Laws of Thought which must be observed if we are to argue consistently with ourselves and avoid self-contradiction\\" (p. 9). He then goes on to cover all the various topics (terms, proportions, induction, etc.) that are necessary to obtain a basic comprehension of logic.If completely unfamiliar with logic as a theory, perhaps read Thinking as Science by Henry Hazlitt, which can give you a good foundation to build upon. For further reading, also recommended is John Locke's Essay Concerning Human Understanding, and Thinking for Oneself by Arthur Schopenhauer.In short, this book is highly recommended. The only fault in my view is the exercises at the end of the book, which I found to be not very useful."},{"Title":"Making the Bride's Father's Speech: Know What to Say and When to Say It - Be Positive, Humorous and Sensitive - Deliver the Memorable Speech (Essentials)","review":"Overall, the best book you could possibly want on the topic of writing and delivering the \\"father of the bride\\" wedding speech and toast.

I think that the book would of been better if it was based in the US."},{"Title":"Banner in the Sky","review":"This book is scarring. Usually books kids are forced to read in school are disliked simply because the children don't want to read them. Rarely do these books scar the child so much five years later they still consider it the reason they never loved reading again.Books generally need a few things. They need conflict, characters, and motivation. This book certainly has characters, it has motivation... but there is no conflict. Anything that begins to happen that could conceivably be interesting is thrown to the side and discarded with more dull descriptions of the mountain. This adds to the droll proceedings as the mountain is the main and only plot, and conceivably the only villain. It's never described in anyway that makes it feel dangerous, nor beutiful, interesting, or unique. in fact any description of the mountain is more confusing then enlightening.The characters themselves are utterly forgetable and cliche. The main character certainly has motivation but that's pretty much it. He climbs a mountain. Surely it's a high, dangerous mountain, but he climbs it. At one point there's some snow... and then he has to stop climbing... and everything else is less interesting then staring at a blank white page.The fact the reader doesn't care about the main character at all makes his failure at the end like a small victory. Of course then the others on the mountain climb it for him and put his red jacket up top to symbolize what he accomplished. Heartwarming? Perhaps in another story. Here it makes the entire book pointless.There's no moral message. Trying his hardest to climb the mountain only yields to failure and though his freinds hanging his jacket seems like a happy end... it represents his own failure still. In fact the main character proves nothing over the entire course of the book. It makes an already boring book wasted paper. There's no tragedy as a result of this, no change, no character development. The main character could have just sat at home drinking hot chocolate and he'd still be in the exact same place as he was when he began.It's hard to describe in analogy what this book is because anything it could be described as similar to is inherently better and more interesting. In fact I have had more character development and conflict over the course of this review then exists in the entire book.Do yourself a favor, turn off your computer and watch television.

If Rudi Matt can do this, if he can climb the Citadel, he will be the first one ever to climb it. But in all good stories there's a catch, Rudi's mom and uncle won't let him climb the mountain because of his father's death. Plus Rudi is not built to climb! Along the way Rudi meets Captain John Winter, the best climber of his day. The Captain gives Rudi his chance to climb, but will he? Banner in the sky is a gut-wrenching story about sheer will and determination. My recommendation, simple, if you ever have had parental problems (and I know you have) then this is your book!"},{"Title":"Banner in the Sky","review":"\\"Banner in the Sky\\" brings you to the summit of excitement and beyond.

He would rather be scaling mountains, something that he is forbidden to do because of the death of his father. After saving a great mountain climber, Captain John Winter, they become close friends. On a mountain climb with Winter, Rudi is proved to have some greatness, but still has a lot to learn. Rudi's dream is to climb the Citadel, believed to be the only unclimbable mountain in the world. One night, Rudi decides to sneak out to climb it and adventure comes.I liked mostly everything about the book except how Rudi's conflict with his family about the not climbing mountains is resolved. Rudi's mother just decides that she will allow him to climb the Citadel when she finds out that that's what he's doing. I do love that Rudi conquers the mountain, though."},{"Title":"Banner in the Sky","review":"Banner in the Sky is an extraordinary book.It's about a 16 year old boy named Rudi whose father died on the most dangerous mountain in Switzerland, only when Rudi was a baby.

Between the ages of 6 and 7 there were 3 deaths in my life and all my grandfathers died before I was born.I suggest you read the story. It has a great ending!"},{"Title":"Banner in the Sky","review":"A few years ago I taught developmental reading to 8th-graders. Most of them were kids from low-income homes and had developed an &quot;attitude&quot; about their lack of reading skills. I searched for a book that might speak to them about their own issues: single-parent homes, discrimination, daily struggle, etc. In &quot;Banner in the Sky&quot; by James Ramsey Ullman, I found what I was looking for. Even though this book was somewhat beyond their reading level, they soon became so absorbed in Rudi's life that they were using the dictionary on their own to find words that they didn't understand.All too often, the families of these students don't show up at school for Open House Night. That year, my students built the Citadel from crumpled, painted newspapers in the center of our room. It was constructed on top of an old dining table I had bought at Goodwill Industries for $5 and stood 4 feet above the table. The detail was wonderful where they created the &quot;needle&quot; and cravass, the cave, the ghost, and even a red shirt made of felt as the banner. They were so excited and proud of what they had done that most of them came and brought family members to see it.This book was such an inspiration to my students because it showed them that other people in other parts of the world in other times than now struggled with the same issues that many of them were facing. The courage that Ullman portrays through Rudi gave them some of their own. I would highly recommend this book to people of all ages who want to experience the thrill of adventure and a lesson in courage."},{"Title":"Banner in the Sky","review":"This book is the best one I have read in months.This book has a lot of action in it, and has suspence on almost every page.This is a great book for people of all ages!"},{"Title":"Banner in the Sky","review":"Banner in the Sky is one of the best books I have ever read. James Ramsey Ullman is a very talented author and his use of discriptive words is amazing.

It is about a young boy, Rudi, who lives in Switzerland and dreams of climbing a mountain called the Matterhorn. His mother did not want him to do this because his father had died trying to climb it and no one had attempted the climb since. Rudi climbs to the base of this mountain everyday to try and find the best way up and dreams of the day when he will climb it. HE finally gets his chance when an american comes to climb the mountain. I won't tell you the whole story but on the climb up Rudi learns what it is to be a hero and how much it an hurt to do the right thing. I recomend this book highly. I think it would be a nice book or a family to read together because readers of all ages can appretiate the good story"},{"Title":"Banner in the Sky","review":"I thought this book was okay. It was scary when Rudi was in the cave with a ghost. It made me laugh when Old Teo was talking about Mt. Dishpan.

I would recommend this book to people who like to hike and climb."},{"Title":"Banner in the Sky","review":"This book was boring but exiting at times like when Rudi the main character lied to his mom to go outside and climb the Citadel to avenge his father who failed to climb the Citadel.

I think that millions of other people with tons of other opinions on this novel will like it especially if they enjoy a sci-fi fantasy."},{"Title":"Banner in the Sky","review":"This book is .......terrible. I love reading but I found my mind wandering and dreading going to bed because I would have to read banner in the sky. This book needs more bad reviews that warn people. I honestly don't see how any person, let alone the kids from my generation who have to be entertained every minute, could enjoy this. This is about a kid who wants to climb a mountain because his dad died trying to climb it. Sound mildly interesting right? Wrong! Somehow the author manages a story where *nothing* happens. Just skip this and read one of the thousunds of children's books that are better than this."},{"Title":"Banner in the Sky","review":"I thought this book was okay.

The story touched me deeply for many reasons, not the least of which was the loss of my father at the age of 4 and my identification with the youthful protagonist, Rudi, who was also a fatherless boy. Somewhat later, while living in Berkeley, I read Jack Kerouac's 'Dharma Bums', in which Kerouac's chaotic ascent of Matterhorn Peak in the Sierras with Gary Snyder and Allen Ginsberg is detailed. Both of these books had an important role to play in fostering my life-long love of mountaineering. In the case of Ullman's classic fiction, based loosely on the first ascent of the Swiss Matterhorn, an identification was created with this symbolic mountain of fears, hope, and dreams. Later in life, I had occasion to spend frequent visits to Zermatt climbing in and around the Matterhorn. Having by this time become ferociously familiar with the whole history of the early Victorian 'Golden Age of Mountaineering', I frequently stayed in the Hotel Monte Rosa, erstwhile headquarters of the English Alpine Club of that era, and reveled in my vicarious associations with the history of both the mountain and its famous climbers. This culminated in an ascent of the Matterhorn via the standard Hornli Ridge route in 1984, which was one of my peak aspirations in life (no pun intended). Today, looking back on my life-passions, I have James Ramsey Ullman's fabulous tale of youthful adventure to thank for giving my life this important and life-sustaining vision of the beautiful, immortal mountains as symbolic trail markers through mortal life. As Ramsey's version of Edward Whymper (Captain Winter) states so perfectly to Rudi in the book's opening chapters, &quot;Youth is the time for dreams, boy...the trick is, when you get older, not to forget them.&quot; Amen and &quot;Berg Frei!&quot;"},{"Title":"Banner in the Sky","review":"this book is not the best book i ever read but it got better as i read on in the book it is a suspense book"},{"Title":"Banner in the Sky","review":"This was a read-aloud for our homeschool and it was wonderful!

It was great. It started out with Rudi wanting to climb a mountain called the Citadel in honor of his father's death. His mother won't let him because of his father. I really liked how his uncle and dhis mother finally let him climb it. I recommend this book for everybody."},{"Title":"Banner in the Sky","review":"I think this book was excellent and I liked how Uncle Franz Lerner did finally change his attitude toward Rudi about climbing the Citadel. And I value Rudi's courage for his expedition on climbing the Citadel in Switzarland and climbs it for his unfinshed quest from his father who died on the Fortress helping Sir Edward stay alive. Especially Old Teo who helps Rudi to go out on his mountain climbing even if his mother and Uncle want him to become a successful business man, Teo knew that it was not meant to be. So I encourage you to read, &quot;Banner in the Sky&quot; for it shows real courage and what you really want in your heart or mind to happen."},{"Title":"Banner in the Sky","review":"I read this book in 4th grade for school and LOVED it. Later I gave it to my little brother when he was in 6th grade and we had a lot of trouble finding books that would hold his attention enough for them to be worth the effort for him to read them. This was one of the first \\"breakthrough\\" books that helped him really start to read fluently."},{"Title":"Banner in the Sky","review":"When I was in 5th grade I was forced to read this book by a teacher I hated. I remember not really enjoying the book at first (mainly because it was about a boy and I found them highly uninteresting), but by the end I begrudgingly began to appreciate it. I told my teacher I hated it though, of course.I always remembered the story though, and I believe it sparked my interest in Everest and the other high peaks and especially in all the people who've died on them. Now, 22 years later, I've finally re-found this book and can't wait to read it again from a new perspective.My point is, sometimes things we don't like initially can still teach us something and give us something valuable we won't even recognize until later in life. Sometimes 'boring' is just a matter of perspective.:)"},{"Title":"Banner in the Sky","review":"Banner in the Sky rates among the top adventure books ever written and is in a style that is tightly composed, gets promptly to the point, and provides realistic and exciting descriptions. This marvelous book rates with the likes of the writings of Hemingway, Steinbeck, Fitzgerald, S. Crane, etc. in its presentation and impact.As a newspaper editor who examines millions of words of text each year, I give Banner in the Sky a solid five stars as the best I have read thus-far this year. It is funny how I, at age 58, had never heard of the book except through accidentally watching Third Man On The Mountain (Disney)on TV recently. The movie was astounding, among Disney's greatest work. I have always been a big Disney fan, too, and even wear a Mickey Mouse watch and wedding ring and did not know that movie existed.Long story short, both are superb. The love interest in the movie is not in the book, which does not detract from it at all. In fact, both the book and the movie are must-see, must-read items for me. I will be re-reading the book and I have already in the past two months seen the movie 18 times."},{"Title":"Banner in the Sky","review":"Rudi Matt is a 16-year-old boy who has dreamt all his life to reach the top of the magnificent yet harsh Mt. Citadel, the remaining mountain located in the Alps that has yet to be climbed to the peak. His father, Josef Matt, tried to climb the Citadel but failed with his bitter death. Rudi wanted to accomplish what his father never did, but his biggest obstacle was his mother. Rudi's mother forbade him from climbing the mountain no matter how much he pleaded. Instead, his mother had the vision of him going into the hotel business which he loathed. He defies his mother and tries to climb the mountain anyway. The result is truly breath-taking. This story is about courageousness, compassion, ambition and following your dreams. I recommend this book for people who want to be taken on an adventure of Rudi Matt's strive to reach the top of the infamous Mt. Citadel."},{"Title":"Banner in the Sky","review":"Do you like climbing and adventure in a book? If yes you should try reading Banner in the Sky. It is 285 pages of climbing, sneaking out, and it will keep you on your toes throughout the book. James Ramsey Ullman was inspired to write a true story about Rudi Matt trying to climb the Citadel, but we now it as the Matterhorn. This book might be hard to find, but if you try and succeed, you are garented to love this book to the end.In the story, Banner in the Sky, the main character's name is Rudi Matt. Rudi's dad, Josef Matt, tried to climb the Citadel, but sadly died. Know at age sixteen Rudi spends his time washing dishes at the Bue Site Hotel staring through the window looking at the Citadel. Though all Rudi wants is to work as a climber like his father was. Rudi saves Captain John Winter's life by getting him out of a crevasse. If this book sounds good to you try and find Banner in the sky.My favorite part of the book is when Rudi want on to the Fortress alone. The Fortress what was keeping everyone back from climbing the Citadel. Rudi had to spend the night on the mountain with no food or water, tents or anything you would need to spend the night on a mountain. What made it so exciting was that Rudi was on the mountain and you did not know what was going to happen next.One of the most important thing I learned was that it is not a good to do something you are not suppose to do when know one knows you are doing it.Other books by this author are High Conquest, Lippincott, The White Tower, River of the Sun, and Windom's Way. These all will be hard to find also because they were copy righted before 1954.My recommendation is if you are looking for a book with lots of climbing and adventure, then read this book, Banner in the Sky. I also recommend if you have to read a book about climbing or adventure, ask for this book."},{"Title":"Banner in the Sky","review":"As expected, the book turned up in great shape.Being an instructor, this helps to know original, published copies can be obtained without any negative surprises.

Every day of his life he's stared up at the Citadel, the one remaining unclimbed peak in the Alps. Fifteen years ago three men tried that climb. One, the hotel cook who is Rudi's boss, came back crippled. Two were carried down dead: Guide Josef Matt, Rudi's father, and his \\"herr\\" or client, a great English mountaineer.Rudi understands why his mother forbids him to follow his father's profession, even though her brother - Rudi's Uncle Franz - is one of Kurtal's most successful guides. Rudi will learn the hotel business, first in Kurtal and later in Zurich. His mother has already given one man to the Citadel and its fabled demons. She won't risk giving another. But Rudi can't help himself. He has to climb. When he meets another famous English mountaineer, Captain John Winter - and proves his strength and skill by saving Winter's life - it's only a matter of time. The Citadel waits to be climbed, and Josef Matt's son knows he's the man who must climb it.This is another re-read for me, a book I loved in girlhood and find myself loving even more many years later. BANNER IN THE SKY started me reading mountaineering books despite my personal hatred for both heights and cold weather, and I've savored many such tales - some true life, some fictional - since then. This remains my personal favorite in the latter category. It's smoothly yet colorfully written, and anyone whose youthful dreams a careful parent couldn't share is sure to experience Rudi's coming of age right along with him."},{"Title":"Banner in the Sky","review":"I gave this book, Banner in the Sky, five stars because it was very absorbing and suspenseful. I liked this book because it showed how much a little boy was dedicated to climbing a mountain. He wanted to climb the mountain because his father wanted to prove it could be done, and in the process he died. What made me read faster and faster was that at every time I turned the page questions kept popping in my head. The questions were, \\"Will he listen to his mother or will he not?\\", \\"If he doesn't listen to his mother will his surprise acquaintance help him?\\", and, last but not least, \\"If he doesn't listen to his mother will he succeed?\\" My heart was beating faster and faster by the second as I read. It's a book you won't want to put down until you read from cover to cover."},{"Title":"Banner in the Sky","review":"A Banner in the Sky is an adventure about a kid named Rudi who tries to climb the greatest mountain in the world. His father, who was the greatest mountaineer even attempted to climb it 15 years before him but failed and died. Rudi's father died when Rudi was very young so, Rudi didn't have any feelings for the death.This book was the best book I've ever read. Every page was fulled with excitement, and interesting events. I never wanted to put this book down it was so good. I read it as fast as I can and finished it in one day.This book reminded me of a few things. The mountain that Rudi climbed was like present day Mt.Everest. Also this book reminded me about when my aunt died I was very imature and young and I didn't understand her death; kind of like how Rudi's father died and he didn't understand his death.The setting of the book took place in multiply places. The main setting was on the mountain. Mr.Ullman used great description to describe the mountain. I good picture the mountain so clearly in my mind. The book also took place in the town under the mountain. The town contained a hotel for tourists, many mountaineer shops, and houses for the people living there. The people living in the town got all their money form the tourist. There was only one main character in Banner in the Sky. The main character is Rudi. Rudi has a lot of heart and courage. The mountaineers said that he was to small to climb and he would never be like his father but he never listened to them and climbed the greatest mountain of all time. Banner in the Sky has one Newberry award and it also been a movie. James Ramsey Ullman was born in NYC in 1907. He is a write, world traveler, and a mountaineer. He was on the 1st voyage on Mt.Everest. I would recommend this book to kids over 5th grade that can read long books.Banner in the Sky is a great book. I could read it several times. This book shows the courage of a boy on a voyage that no man can do; climbing the unclimbable mountain."},{"Title":"Banner in the Sky","review":"Banner In The Sky is an amazing acount of a fictional mountain climbing expedition based in historical accounts of the conquer of the Matterhorn. The protagonist, 16-year-old Rudi Matt, is forced to wash dishes in a hotel instead of following his true dream; climbing the Citadel, the very mountain that had claimed his father's life fifteen years ago. The antagonist is, obviously, the Citadel herself, the last unconquered peak in the area. Although an overprotective mother and uncle also get in the way of Rudi's dream. When Rudi finally gets a chance to join the expedition up the mountain, he shows everyone that he is determined to complete the journey his father started. Rudi's journey is a journey of faith and stamena and also forgiveness and loyalty. These values are all summed up in the red shirt that Rudi carries with him to place at the peak of the Citadel; the very shirt his father wore the night he died before giving it up so that another man could live.This book is all about following your dreams, but also about the fact that one must work hard to achieve those dreams. James Ramsey Ullman combines history with an extraordinary account of the happenings in the small village of Kurtall in the Swiss Alps.For me the highlight of the book was a Rudi's nighttime encounter with the spirit of his father as he sits in the very spot that claimed his father's life. A chilling and magical scene."},{"Title":"Banner in the Sky","review":"I think this book was pretty awsome. This book can be exciting at times and also sad at times.

It captured my interest so I went to the library and found it there and I was hooked. After reading \\"Banner in the Sky\\" I developed a tremendous interest in climbing and would often imagine myself in Rudy Matt's climbing boots scaling the mighty Citadel. I went on to become quite a rock climber and while I never conquered any major peaks, \\"Banner in the Sky\\" led me to appreciate not only climbing but everything invloving the outdoors. That was 37 years ago and I still have a copy of this book that I open every so often to read and remember the lift that this book gave to my spirit. I highly recommend this book to young people."},{"Title":"Banner in the Sky","review":"I think that this book was an awesome book and the suspense will keep bringing you back and the amazing things that happen in this book raise the suspense when you have to stop reading. But what amazes me the most is how much happens in the small town where this book takes place and how the main character Rudi Matt and his family take the death of Rudi's father. Another reason I think this book is great is all the mountain climbing and how it describes the main idea of the book and how to climb mountains. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to get an idea of how mountain climbing works and anyone who wants to read a book that has lots of suspense.BY RYAN DAVID CRACKLE"},{"Title":"Banner in the Sky","review":"Banner in the Sky is a very exillerating book with the odd cliff hanger. Rudi Matt, the main character, demonstrates honour, courage and plenty of strength throughout the novel to overcome the challenges he faces. The novel includes both happiness and sadness as it is a bit of an emotional roller coaster, especially for Rudi and his mother. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes rock climbing and a thrilling book that keeps you on the tip of your seat for most of the ride."},{"Title":"Banner in the Sky","review":"Many years ago, a teacher read this book to my fifth grade class. I loved it so much, I read again on my own in 7th grade. I'm now 34 and came looking for it again - to share with my nieces and nephews. It's one of the best books ever written about the triumph of the human spirit."},{"Title":"Banner in the Sky","review":"My friend told me that Banner in the Sky is a very good book, well I'm here to vouch for that. Banner in the Sky is the most intriguing story I have ever read. James R. Ullman's book is about a legend, named Josef Matt, whose son is determined to climb the mountain that Josef died on. If Rudi Matt can do this, if he can climb the Citadel, he will be the first one ever to climb it. But in all good stories there's a catch, Rudi's mom and uncle won't let him climb the mountain because of his father's death. Plus Rudi is not built to climb! Along the way Rudi meets Captain John Winter, the best climber of his day. The Captain gives Rudi his chance to climb, but will he? Banner in the sky is a gut-wrenching story about sheer will and determination. My recommendation, simple, if you ever have had parental problems (and I know you have) then this is your book!"},{"Title":"Banner in the Sky","review":"I just finished reading Banner in the Sky and really liked it. It was a quick read and hard to put down. Some of the things I found exciting were, without giving away the story, the setting and characters. They made the story exciting. The setting was in the Swiss Alps in 1865. Rudi Matt lived in Kurtal and wanted to climb the Citadel. In real life Kurtal is Zermatt and the Citadel is the Matterhorn. One of the main characters, John Winter, is a lot like Edward Whymper, first man to climb the Matterhorn. The way the author told the story was realistic, because he was a mountaineer himself. He climbed Mount Everest in 1965. My two favorite characters were Captain Winter and Rudi. They both wouldn't give up when they ran into problems. I recommend this book to anyone who likes adventure books and mountain climbing."},{"Title":"Banner in the Sky","review":"I really liked the book. It had a juicy beginning, middle, and end. I think Emil Saxo told Rudi to go down the mountain, but he didn't so Saxo lunged toward Rudi and fell 20 feet down the mountain. Rudi was a tough and nice guy to do all the things he did. I think the onlyh sad part was when they told us that Rudi's dad died tryiing to climb the mountain. I hope more people read and buy this reat, exciting book."},{"Title":"Banner in the Sky","review":"I read this book several years ago as a school assignment, thinking I would be bored out of my mind with this book. Quite the contrary, I was amazed by the reality of this story. James Ullman does an excellent job, making the reader feel like he's in the story himself. I still get remniscient thoughts of this novel every once in awhile, and I'm thinking of buying this book for myself and reading it again."},{"Title":"Banner in the Sky","review":"Banner In The Sky was an excellant book. It's about a boy named Rudi Matt, Captain Winter,Franz, and Old Teo,also. That's some of the charactors in the book. James Ramsey makes the moutain come alive.

Read and you'll find out!"},{"Title":"Banner in the Sky","review":"I read like crazy. I can finish a book this long in one night. Instead it took me 4. This book is pointless. I like rock climbing but this has almost nothing to do with it. It just talks about how this boy is sad. His mom is sad. He wants to climb the mountain. His mom does not because she is afraid. He climbs it anyway. The mountain is big. The mountain is there. This has got to be one of the most pointless books I have ever read. It rivals summer of the swans. A cereal box label is more exciting because at least then you can be disgusted by what they put in you food. I highly recomend skipping this book. Do yourself a favor and read something more interesting."},{"Title":"Banner in the Sky","review":"This book is one that I really enjoyed reading. It was a fast, fun read. The end of every chapter consists of some &quot;on the edge&quot; situation that keeps the reader wanting to hurry and continue on to the next chapter. The ending was surprising to me, and I never saw it coming. The entire book is very suspensful because it is based on real life. The author himself was a part of the very first American team to climb Mt. Everest, so he obviously drew from his personal experiences to write the story. I absolutely recommend this book. There is a movie that was made in 1959 about the book, but it's under a different name, &quot;The Third Man on the Mountain.&quot; I have not been able to locate the movie yet, but I'm sure it's just as good as the book!"},{"Title":"Banner in the Sky","review":"I first read this book in the 5th grade.

Oh yeah, and it had the perfect ending, I was very impressed.Recently, I went back and re-read this (age 18), and found that yes, it definitely is a children's book, but that did not prevent it from being nearly as riviting the second time around, and it is written well enough that with my more critical, older eye, I could still find almost nothing to complain about, except that I wished it was longer."},{"Title":"Banner in the Sky","review":"I first read Banner as a boy and was so taken away with the drama that I read it so fast and didn't even understand the ending.

But now that I have, I am very glad that I did so. Rudi's story is very moving and you can easily relate to him. Growing up in the shadow of Mt. Ranier, I can understand the strong desire and need to be on the top of that mountain. There would be no finer thing. The scarifice he made in the end, brought me to tears. He made the right choice and that's what was so painful. Even so, the story had a good ending, and I came away from it satisfied. Captain Winter is a favorite character also. Such a strong man, he deserved to reach the summit almost more than anyone. He was willing to reach for his goal, even when all other's refused to help."},{"Title":"Banner in the Sky","review":"&quot;Banner in the Sky&quot; is a very exciting book about a sixteen year old swiss boy, named Rudi, who with his uncle, a guide from another town, and an English captain, strives to reach the summit his father had died in the attempt to reach. This is the most exciting book I have ever read! After Rudi's father died, his mother decided Rudi should become a hotel manager and his Uncle (a mountain guide) agreed that there had been too many deaths in the family for Rudi to take any chances. When Rudi defies his mother and starts up the mountain on his own, he finds himself in a snow storm at the very place where his father died. It is then that he realizes the true meaning of his ambition. Climbing back down the mountain he discovers that his Uncle who had been looking for him has decided that he too wants to conquer the mountain that took his brother-in-law and left the whole village in fear. Together with Capt. Winter and another guide they struggle upward encountering many close calls and times when they feel they can not make it. Rudi's determination to fulfill his father's lifelong wish, which was to put a red shirt on the top of the mountain, and, to show his villiage and the world that he had accomplished what had seemed impossible, keeps him going. The author was able to make this book very realistic because he himself was part of a group that succeded in climbing Mount Everest. I recommend this book for older readers who like gripping realistic adventures. This book is great!!! I hope you read it and enjoy it like I did."},{"Title":"Banner in the Sky","review":"This was one of the best books I've read, and I've read some really good books,but this was probably the best.It was so good, I plan on reading it again. It's about a 16 year old boy named Rudi Matt. His dream is to climb a mountain called the Citadel in the Alps. His dad died on it right after Rudi was born.He wants to get to the top to put his dad's red shirt on the summit.The ending was the most tense spot in the book. If you like mountain stories, this is the book for you,but even if you have never read one before, like me, I still recommend it. If I were you I would plan on buying it."},{"Title":"Banner in the Sky","review":"I have mixed feelings about this book, so I'll deal with the positive first, and then the negative.The book is about a young man, Rudi Matt, who lives in the village of Kurtal, a small village at the foot of the Alps. Mountaineering is in the blood of every man in the village, and every nearby peak has been conquered...except for the last and greatest peak, the Citadel. No man has succeeded in climbing this one perilous peak that dwarfs all others around it. Josef Matt led an expedition fifteen years ago, but of the three men, two died in the attempt (including Josef) and the third was badly injured. Despite popular beliefs and fears about the mountain being cursed, Rudi dreams of conquering the mountain and fulfilling his father's quest.In the past fifteen years, no one has tried to climb the mountain--and anyone who gives any serious thought about doing so is considered crazy and foolish--and no one besides Rudi gives it serious thought. However, things change when renowned climber Captain John Winter arrives at Kurtal: he is determined to climb the Citadel, and Rudi is equally determined to go with him. Thus the catalyst for the adventure.It's a great read, and the literal cliff-hangers held my rapt attention, even though I'm nineteen. The trials and obstacles of mountain climbing are presented well, and the reader walks away (or should I say \\"climbs down\\") from the book with a good sense of what it's like to be a mountaineer. That is, as close as one can get to actually clinging to the near-vertical edge of a rock with a few fingers and the toe of one boot--with a yawning mile-deep empty space below.The above praise aside, the book is nevertheless tainted to some extent. Rudi is obsessed with climbing the mountain, to the point where his attitude ultimately becomes, as I see it, mountain-worship--resulting, unsurprisingly, in lying to his mother (who specifically does not want Rudi to become a mountaineer because of what happened to her husband, Josef) on multiple occasions. And not just Rudi, either: other characters also lie to cover up the Citadel endeavor. Mrs. Matt's wishes are not taken seriously, and are in fact blatantly disregarded in favor of Rudi's desire to be a mountaineer.Unfortunately, these issues are not resolved. I was holding out hope that somehow the author would deal with them, but as I drew nearer and nearer to the end I realized that even if there were going to be a reconciliation, it would be a rather shallow resolution (forced so because of the ever-shrinking remainder of the book), with a sort of \\"Oh, by-the-way, I'm sorry\\" afterthought effect--almost tacked on to the end.It's unfortunate that all these elements taint the book. Were it not for them, I could wholeheartedly recommend the story as a great tale of manly mountaineering and adventures in exercising dominion over Creation. However, I won't specifically not recommend it; I think there is a place for books like these in a library (though I won't expound that idea here).With all the preceding in mind, I recommend this book as a solid, manly, adventure story--with some negative elements worthy of discussion.INDECENCY: None.LANGUAGE: Three or four occurrences of d--n, and three or four instances of the Lord's name being used carelessly.DISCUSSION POINTS: As a parent (or an older sibling), you can talk with the reader about the lying that goes on in the book.--What does the Bible say about it?--Are there situations where lying is acceptable?AGE RANGE: I'm nineteen, and I enjoyed it. That said, because of the language I'd let my children read this book somewhere around twelve years, at the youngest. (Ultimately, though, it boils down to the potential reader's maturity.)"},{"Title":"Banner in the Sky","review":"I read this book with my 13 year old son as part of our homeschool curriculum. My 15 year old daughter kept listening in as we read and soon was so absorbed in the story that she made us promise not to read it without her. This is a very well-written, realistic adventure story that illustrates the value of character and integrity over personal ambition. It's not often that I come across books of this quality. Part of what makes this story so realistic is: 1. the author based many of the details on the original ascent of the Matterhorn, and 2. the author himself was a mountaineer and part of the first American expedition to Mount Everest. What I learned about the author from research I did after we finished the book made me all the more impressed! Very highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Banner in the Sky","review":"Back in the days before all the peaks of the Alps were conquered, this is a story about a young man who will help conquer the last unclimbed peak. Son of a mountain climber who died on that last peak, Rudi is forbidden to climb. But it is in his blood and he obeys the call to brave the peak.This is back in the days before polartec fleece, belaying equipment, or retractable hooks. Rudi and the other men climb sheer mountain cliffs in freezing weather with only a rope holding them together and special hobnailed climbing boots to give them steadier footing.I'm sweating just remembering how terrible was the drop below them. It took real courage.Rudi earns the respect of his village and the men with him, but not in the way you think.

Excellent read. While the movie had extra plot line, characters--the book goes into the thoughts and feelings of this young man who is going to climb the mountain that his father died on. The memorable moments for me were when he took shelter in the cave his father died in while heroically trying to keep his friend from freezing. And the prayer of course that drove away the terrors of the mountain. The local climbers believed that demons ruled that mountain."},{"Title":"Banner in the Sky","review":"This book is so well written and has such good character development that the reader can forgive the melodramatic, predictable story line. The novel takes place in Switzerland and centers on Rudi a sixteen year old boy whose father,a famous mountain guide, died during Rudi's babyhood while trying to reach the top of \\"The Citadel\\" ( a fictionalized Matterhorn). Rudi's mother wants a safe life for her only child and sees a career for him in the hotel business. Rudi of course dreams of conquering \\"The Citadel\\" and fulfilling his father's interrupted destiny. This book is a good choice for fifth graders and up looking for an adventure story with an interesting setting and memorable characters."},{"Title":"Banner in the Sky","review":"Banner in the Sky is about following your dreams and accomplishing your goals.

Rudi's father froze to death while helping a climber, but Rudi lived and made it safely home.I highly recommend this book and rate it as one of the best books I have read.

In 1941 when they started, they were relatively safe, only one ship was lost out of the 103 that were sent out. 1942 was another story. The most famous, or perhaps infamous, convoy was PQ-17 which lost 24 out of 33 ships to U-boats and the Luftwaffe.This book is a novel of the northern convoys. Commander Graham Martineau is still haunted by the ship he lost as he takes command of the crack Tribal Class destroyer Kakka and her weary crew to excort the cargo ships on the long run across the northern ocean.He knows whereof he writes. This is an excellent book.

I enjoyed this book but it seem a bit roughly finished and ended without adequate resolution. In some ways I enjoy the Bolitho series (under pen name Alexander Kent) a bit more since they seem to be a bit more consistent in style and story development. This book (For Valor) has some well turned writing but is somewhat difficult to follow (at least in the Kindle edition) because story segments seem disjointed and it seems that Reeman did not join nor weave the pieces of many sub-plots well and some are just left hanging (like what does become of Seaman Forward?) even the love story and the various character development threads with the major characters seem dissatisfyingly and abruptly terminated. Some story lines seem to just go dead (like what did happen in Iceland, when and too whom?).An interesting and previously under-served subject (Russian convoys). Good but fragmented characters, formulaic plot (where it holds together), some good technical stuff but not deep. All-in-all it seems to be a collection of pieces of a novel that has not matured and been polished up to Reeman's professional abilities.

If you are looking for fiction that portrays humans dealing with their own feelings and the feelings of others, look elsewhere - the emotional content is stiff and similar to that found in the Kent series.After knocking Mr. Reeman for his human content, I would like to say he has given me a better picture of the Royal Navy over 200 years than any other author, including the sainted Patrick O'Brian. The shipboard scenes have a smell of authenticity - fuel oil, sweat, the smell of people living in close quarters, the overall funk of life in a metal box in horrible conditions - Das Boot to a 'T'. These are invaluable and a tribute to the people who gave us our present world - free of the threat of Nazism and Stalinism due to the sacrifices of thousands of un-named sailors and naval servicemen. His portrayal of the women serving in the WRNS (Women's Royal Navy Service) - more commonly 'WRENS' - is to be commended but the details seem less than authentic - I don't know where to find their real story; perhaps Reeman is spot-on but somehow I doubt it. All in all, the sacrifice of all who served in the Royal Navy during the war years cannot be forgotten and Reeman does a great service in recreating their lives and inner existence."},{"Title":"For Valour (Charnwood Library)","review":"Top quality Reeman naval action novel.. as good as the best he has written....unusually well developed characterizations of the people."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Studying Popular Culture","review":"For anybody who is interested in studying contemporary popular culture, then Dominic Strinati's lucid and well organised book provides a perfect introduction.There are many areas in which his work does not necessarily prove conclusive. To a certain extent I was disappointed that, despite much academic rigour, Dominic did not reveal his own voice, particularly in the position that modern popular culture currently occupies in our modern social society.However, for somebody - A' level or undergraduate - who is looking for a well written and accessible account of Hollywood, the importance of genre, or the significance of 'reception theory' in current media and film studies debate, then this is certainly an excellent first point of contact.Thoroughly well recommended and wholeheartedly endorsed."},{"Title":"Kidnapped for My Faith","review":"As a Jew who converted to Christianity a few years before this guy did, this could have been me. It's a great book. I guess the four stars is because it is simply factual, without the great wit and poetry, let's say, of Robert Service, or humor of Joel Salatin.This is an account of what happened to a young Jewish man who dared to become a Christian. His parents had him kidnapped by Orthodox Jews, who tried to deprogram him. He says that Orthodox Jews don't usually do this. He's not the only one to go through something like this. (No, I did not). Find a copy in a church or Christian school library if you cannot buy it. It is easy to read, and hits people like me quite close to home."},{"Title":"Kidnapped for My Faith","review":"I read this book many years ago, when I was involved with either Jews for Jesus or Messianic Judaism. It was a very powerful book. In fact I'm pretty sure I read this book twice, which is extremely rare for me. I know I gave at least one copy away as well.I may now see Ken Levitt's story from a different perspective as I see more clearly the faults of Jew for Jesus. Ken Levitt who had become a Jew for Jesus was kidnapped by Hasidic Jews at Ken's parents bequest. He managed to escape and it is a harrowing and powerful story. I think it would make a very interesting movie. Of course I prefer non-fiction drama movies and this would certainly be one."},{"Title":"Watercolor and How","review":"This book is, by far, one of the best teaching texts I've seen for a beginner in watercolor painting. Graham Scholes fairly oozes enthusiasm for the medium and encouragement to his student. He clearly explains and shares dozens of practical clues and hints and leads one by the hand as he instills confidence to make those first attempts with this difficult medium."},{"Title":"A Thanksgiving Wish","review":"A Thanksgiving Wish by Michael Rosen has become a family story time tradition begining this year! The story relates to all ages and became a favorite the first time I read it to my eight year old daughter. I gave a copy to our minister and he used it as his sermon the Sunday before Thanksgiving! The story of family and community coming together combined with John Tompson's beautiful illustrations makes this a wonderful book! I love it!"},{"Title":"A Thanksgiving Wish","review":"Michael Rosen read this story to us last Spring at the West Coast Literacy Conference in Anahem before it was published . There was not a dry-eyed person in the room when he finished. The story of a young girl and the relationship she has with her grandmother will touch your heart. How the family overcomes difficulties and celebrates a truly memorable Thanksgiving will renew your faith in tradition as it did the young girl's. I plan to read this story to my class if I can get through it without tears. I highly recommend it as a holiday read for both children and adults."},{"Title":"A Thanksgiving Wish","review":"Bubbe always made Thanksgiving dinner. Now that she has passed away the family tries to recreate that dinner at the request of the youngest member of the family.

This book has a true spirit of giving and remembrance. Good read aloud at home or for classes. Excellent writing."},{"Title":"A Thanksgiving Wish","review":"I read this book last year to my third grade class who absolutely LOVED it! It was on loan from the library, however this was one book which I needed to purchase for my own personal collection. It is such a heartwarming and wonderful story that depicts the true meaning of Thanksgiving!"},{"Title":"House With Two Doors","review":"We need more fiction like this. Ricardo Pimentel's ear for dialogue is pitch perfect and the novel is a beautiful evocation of a place and time. I hope this is not his last work of fiction."},{"Title":"House With Two Doors","review":"This story started out at the Orange Show in the 1960's. That caught my attention right away. I remember the Orange Show in the 1960's quite well. That is where all the ruca's went either with their boy friend or to find a boy friend.This book is somewhat poetic, somewhat nostalgic. The life and times of the Rivera family bring so many memories flooding back about the way we were in the Mt. Vernon barrio. This story really hit home. The places Pimentel mentions in the book such as Esperanza Tienda and The Mitla Cafe are places I frequented in the 1960's.I've read other reviews and they all seem to focus on machismo or feminism. I focus on the realism and familiarity.Hats off to Pimentel and his simple writing style. I was really drawn into this story and it's characters, especially Soledad and Gabby. My heart went out to Gabby. I know he had it rough being the youngest child and watching the infidelity of his parents and the only other male figure in his home life (Bert) going off to war.Bert was the emotionally stronger, older brother. I have seen many vatos from the barrio who have that same feeling that they have to get out of the rut that the barrio brings. A friend of mine used to say, &quot;I feel like the world is passing me by.&quot;This book is &quot;a toda madre.&quot; I highly recommend it. I've already told others about it."},{"Title":"House With Two Doors","review":"I absolutely adored this book. I agree with another reviewer; we need more fiction of this nature. Like Steinbeck, Pimentel knows the art of using his word palette sparingly to create realistic scenes of easily recognizable family function--and dysfunction. I loan my copy of this novel only to very trusted friends; it is on my Top 20 list of favorites. Whatever your cultural background is, if you love a good novel, you will find this one hard to put down once you begin. Bravo, Senor Pimentel!"},{"Title":"Too, Too Solid Flesh","review":"I bought this book when it first came out in 1989, and have since had to rebuy it through several local bookshops no less than six times, because the people I lend it to always want to keep it afterwards. That alone seems like a recommendation to me, but you probably want to know a little bit more...In a futuristic, Orwellian society, populated by strictly divided haves and have-nots, a troupe of Shakespearean androids, the last troupe of actors on earth, perform Shakespeare's Hamlet night after night after night. Their personalities programmed to BE the character they portray, they act their lives and live their lines, both inside and outside of the play.Art mirrors life, and the creator of the troupe, Dr. Capek, is murdered. Hamlet, looking upon his creator as father-figure vows to find out how, and why. Aided by his companion, Horatio, who houses a dark secret of his own, he embarks on a quest to find out what happened. Can a synthetic, a created robot with little understanding of human illogic and frailty, but with the same capacity...the same HUNGER to learn...to know...as Shakespeare's Hamlet did, break the pattern established by the play and see to it that justice is carried out?Hey, don't ask me...read the book. :-)The more times I read Too Too Solid Flesh, the more parallels I find between the book and the original play, and these fascinate me, and make the final explanation of what is really going on all the more chilling. O'Donohoe has taken such well-defined characters (as they exist within the confines of a strictly defined play) and moved them beyond themselves to make them seem far more like PEOPLE than has been done in some of the great filmed works of the play itself. You get to watch Hamlet learn, and EVOLVE to far more of a degree than Shakespeare explored.Much like Hamlet, there is little mystery to the murder itself, but it's the WHY that keeps you interested. That and the stunning extrapolation of the characters themselves. Several of the scenes between Hamlet, Ophelia and Horatio near the middle of the book are quite astounding with the complex philosophies they are exploring.But enough of the long words...I'm not Shakespeare. But, if you like Shakespearean themes and are not averse to seeing how much they improve with a little sci-fi and social commentary thrown together, you should try hard as you can to get a copy of this book.Or, better yet, get two...just in case."},{"Title":"Too, Too Solid Flesh","review":"This book doesn't resemble Asimov's classic Caves of Steel much, but there is definitely homage paid to that classic throughout, and if you've never read Caves of Steel, you will be the poorer for it. In both books, we have a human and an android trying to solve a murder mystery. In Caves of Steel, it was sometimes necessary for R. Daneel to pass as human in order to do his job (even though that's illegal); in Too Too Solid Flesh, we have a human trying to pass as an android. Horatio can't find work as a human actor - there are no jobs for human actors any more, in this future. So he's masquerading as an android - even during sex.At the same time, if you don't have a passing familiarity with Shakespeare, and with \\"Hamlet\\" in particular, you are going to miss a lot in this book. I try not to be too snobby about my opinion that the world would be a better place if more people read and re-read Shakespeare just for fun, but, well, the world WOULD be a better place. And you'd get more of the sly references/in-jokes in this book. You would notice when the characters accidentally fall into iambic pentameter while conversing, for instance. (from a source I've forgotten: \\"Oh who is writing poetry sublime? I am, I am, I am, I am, I am.\\")The interplay between the characters' roles in the play and their roles in the \\"real life\\" of the book is fascinating. All sorts of questions arise over whether humans' actions are any more the product of free will than androids' - or are we as much shaped by the roles other people have envisioned as our destiny before we were old enough to make choices?And there's the question of whether being human and having the free will to make choices - often bad ones - is necessarily better than being an android. When the real reason the theatre project exists is finally revealed, one would have to doubt that humans have the wisdom to make good choices. This part of the plot hinges on technology (I won't give away what) outstripping our ability to deal with it rationally - just as the entire book up to that point hinges on our ability to build androids outstripping our ideas of what they are for and how they should be used.I first discovered O'Donohoe through his Crossroads fantasy series, about veterinary students who get to practice on unicorns and griffins. This book is quite different, but still displays O'Donohoe's talents at humor and intricate dialogue. I don't know whether they were meant to appeal to entirely different audiences, but I find myself quite glad that my interests are broad enough that I thought to read both."},{"Title":"Too, Too Solid Flesh","review":"I'm only marginally familiar with Shakespeare, so many of the book's charms and references were often lost to me. I did find it an enjoyable read, and considering the book was written in 1989, some 22 years ago, the author touched on some pretty out their topics for the day, like thinkware, stimula, androids, organisms as products, just to name a few which alone make this book a great read. I give it four stars for introducing some cool topics into the virtual world / augmented reality / robotics / cybernetics genres. If you are a Shakespeare fan, it most likely will be a five star book for you. At essentially free except for the price of shipping, the book is well worth the read."},{"Title":"The girls","review":"Vintage Edna Ferber. Delicious command of English.

However, a family member has hidden the book as it's for me for Christmas, so I can't really say much about it, but I have typed in 5 stars as I'm sure it will be,as I have read Stephen Mills articles in the BBC Wildlife magazine & they are great."},{"Title":"Ringing For You: A Love Story with Interruptions","review":"Intrigued by the VOGUE magazine review, comparing this book to Bridget Jones' Diary and Jane Austen, I began this book with pleasant anticipation. I'd suffered through a bad stint working as an over-qualified receptionist at a small-town newspaper and was looking forward to a witty romp through the world of pompous executives, witchy office managers, strange gnomes from accounting, etc. I love Jane Austen, and Bridget Jones' Diary was one of the funniest new novels of the 90's so Ringing For You seemed promising.What an abject disappointment. The narrator, a receptionist, writes about her life and loves as she sits at her desk at work. This cute plot device wears thin almost immediately due to the constant travel back and forth in time and place along a space-time continuum apparent only to the author as the receptionist recounts her exploits. To compound this problem, the author tries to affect a clever conceit whereby the receptionist is completely confused to the point of brain-death over every aspect of her messed-up life one minute, yet in the next she can smugly quote Proust and wax profoundly on subjects of wonderful complexity. Far from making the receptionist a well-rounded modern woman, the heroine appears schizophrenic!The worst aspect of this book is that the plot devices above, as well as the cutesy little technique of using WingDing symbols to represent events that occur in the course of the receptionist's day (think Highlights) do not obscure the fact that the writing never opens up to allow you into the characters, the place or even the general vicinity of the book. I never cared about the protagonist nor any of the supporting cast. The entire reading experience was superficial and trite. The height of my emotional experience was vaguely wondering if the receptionist would end up with the MWMM or her boyfriend. I shut the book at its end and have never once wondered what was happening now to any of the people in it.This book seems to have been hacked together as a way to capitolize on the popularity of Bridget Jones' Diary. Read the real thing and skip this trumped-up attempt to introduce Jane Austen to WingDings. Better yet, go find your old copy of Persuasion and dig in."},{"Title":"Ringing For You: A Love Story with Interruptions","review":"When the heroine of this book claims that you may recognize some of the people in it by thier descriptions, she was right!! There was so much of myself in her I felt like we were sisters from the first page. I thought the book was funny, thoughtful, and yes - a little crazy at times...exactly like we all are. The book jumps around and the funny symbols for phone calls and packages and the MWMM can get a bit tiresome...but overall...the voice is a clever and engaging one. I read this book over the weekend...a perfect way to read it...in a relaxed, casual atmosphere. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Ringing For You: A Love Story with Interruptions","review":"While, I don't think Ms. Forrester has written the great British novel here, I think it is an intelligent and, at times, witty book. Yes, it can be irritating with it's cutesy fonts and initials, but she makes some good observations here. One can see her writing style emerging and there is a definite voice. I think we should keep a watch out for future books from this author. Once she masters some character development, she could be a force to reckon with. I found the novel fun even if the ending was a little unsatisfying. I say give it a chance."},{"Title":"Ringing For You: A Love Story with Interruptions","review":"I feel especially priveledged to write this review as I read this book while I was working at the same place as the author wrote from. It sounds totally implausable and I didn't believe it myself until I found a bullitin board with press clippings of Prince Phillip's visit in the office. What the real place is called is the Institute of Materials and I worked there for three months while working abroad with a student work permit in Britain (I'm American). She brilliantly contained the decisively strange place that the Institute of Materials is. I found it absolutely bizarre and I'm glad that I'm not the only one, as I thought it was all of Britain that is like that. I found her novel to portray something original (then again, I have refused to read Bridgit Jones' Diary) and with true intelligence. It may be that I was moved by the sheer coincidence of the novel, as I am also fresh out of college and the Institute was my first job. Nevertheless, she portrayed the frustration of the exploited excessively-intelligent temp with wit that I fear I could not.This is a book for the intelligent among us. Being a temp sucks with such a biterness that I cannot express, but she can and I depend upon her for that. Much like a drugged out rocker to Stairway to Heaven, this book saw me through some rough times. (I kept trying to tell the people at the Institute, &quot;No seriously there's this book about the Institute and she talks about Paul and Mike - listen to me&quot; but they didn't because the English are like that.) Basically, this is a book for the frustrated, under appreciated, intelligent young women with awful temp assignments as receptionists or what not and should be appreciated as such. In addition, its a really fun, easy read."},{"Title":"Ringing For You: A Love Story with Interruptions","review":"I was attracted to this book's subject about a receptionist who writes a novel during work hours. As a receptionist myself, who has also considered writing a novel during my work hours, I was eager to hear what she had to say. It turns out, exactly what I had hoped she would say! As a temporary position, her job gives her a chance to tell the story of her quirky days, her steamy relationships and her humerous insights into the human condition, inside and out of the office. The book becomes interactive with the reader as she lets us know when she needs to pause to answer the phone, sign for a package, etc., using symbols which quickly become crucial to understanding her world. She is another young person who is capable of so much more than the job she is stuck with, and her painfully true descriptions of the office and her relationship to it helped me to see the humor in my own position. She became my best friend and I was sad for her to leave me when the I finshed the book. Anouchka Grose Forrester is a fun and energetic writer, perfect for the gen-x crowd and I can't wait to see what she comes up with next!"},{"Title":"Ringing For You: A Love Story with Interruptions","review":"Don't believe those reviews that say the book is unfunny-- this short read is both witty and intelligent. I laughed out loud on several instances. It's a great weekend indulgence."},{"Title":"Ringing For You: A Love Story with Interruptions","review":"The notion of a receptionist writing a novel as she sits around waiting for the phone to ring and packages to arrive isn't a bad premise for a smart romantic comedy. Unfortunately, Forrester fails to deliver any kind of interesting plot, nor does she offer up any startling insights into the role of a receptionist. The book starts out peppered with little icons indicating telephone, package and visitor interruptions--a cute conceit that even the author realizes wears thin as the book goes on. The people she works for/with, start as mysteries, and more or less end that way, aside from one highly predictable character. The main subject of the receptionist's typing is her confusion about an affair she's having with a weird courier who doesn't seem to like her that much, and her indecision over what to do with her agreeable, if unsexy, boyfriend. There is a modicum of pleasure to be scraped from this, but all in all, the writing is rather ordinary, not particularly witty, and the chronology of the events in the book is somewhat confusing. The whole effort struck me as a weak attempt to follow in the wake of the success of Bridget Jones Diary."},{"Title":"Ringing For You: A Love Story with Interruptions","review":"Wow...this book is SO not what the cover says. It looks (and the blurb on the back concurs) like it should be a light read, much like Bridget Jone's Diary.Nothing could be further from the truth!I enjoyed this book immensely, although when I started, I was a bit annoyed because it seemed so shallow. It wasn't until I was about 70 pages in that I realized that it was NOT a light book; rather, it is a fairly accurate portrait of a realistic woman."},{"Title":"Ringing For You: A Love Story with Interruptions","review":"When I first started reading this book, I thought it was great. It was cute &amp; funny, &amp; I felt like I could relate to the main character. But as the book went on, the story got boring &amp; senseless. All in all not a bad read, but the last 50 pages or so might put you to sleep."},{"Title":"Ringing For You: A Love Story with Interruptions","review":"I bought this book on a whim because to me, it looked like a &quot;poplit&quot; sort of book; something light, airy, and good to read when you don't want to think too deeply.While &quot;Ringing&quot; does have some interesting points, it's been marketed to completely the wrong audience. The prose are mostly cynical and brooding, which, while interesting, is drawn away from by the icons throughout it as well as the general tone of the description and cover. It looks like something lighthearted and simple, while really it is much more heavy -- a slice-of-life look at a life that isn't very happy or inviting. The protagonist is a woman who isn't fond of her job and is looking forward to moving onto something more impressive; doesn't care much for her boyfriend and carries on a side relationship with an unpredictable man who does't want her writing about him in her 'novel'; and generally views everyone around her with a maudlin and cynical eye.Comparing it to &quot;Bridget Jones&quot; is unfair, because the story itself isn't really Jones-esque -- the way it's packaged, however, is. This is not a happy book, this is not a cheerful book, and it will probably just annoy you if you approach it from that perspective. If you're looking for some rich, irony-heavy prose and don't mind it being interrupted by odd little pictures of telephones here and there, this is a pretty decent book."},{"Title":"Ringing For You: A Love Story with Interruptions","review":"except that after reading this novel go on and on about nothing, words are hard to come by. I thought the premise of this book was very promising. However, at about the third chapter, I was tired of it. Having spent money on it, and being caught without a back-up read at the gym, I plowed through. This book was so completely uninteresting that I almost stopped reading it entirely with only fifty pages left. I forced myself to finish it, however, as I had come that far. There was a surprise at the end to somewhat reward me for my perseverance. However, it was a small victory, seeing that I cannot get the hours I wasted on this book back."},{"Title":"Ringing For You: A Love Story with Interruptions","review":"Ok, first off, my rating is really3.5 stars, but after reading some of theotherreviews I figured that this book needed some good mojo. This is an intelligent book about a scatterbrained, but smart young woman in London with a demented love life, a job she doesn't hate but could do without, and way too much time to think on her hands. It is not a book that would appeal to the mass market audience, its too neurotic and artful. It is well written, funny, witty, sharp, and unsettling (as life sometimes is).I think the problems with this book are in the middle. At times, the author seems to lose focus... not of the story, just in general. The writing fluctuates in quality and some scenes are unimportant or could have used some more work. However, the beginning of the book is wonderful, it hooks you and sets up the main character and the MWMM (the love interest) very well. I personally liked the ending, though I could see how some would find it lacking. It was like life, jagged, unsatisfying, and not final. That's why I think I liked this book, it is a lot like life really is, or how it really is in the fictional world.The characters are not always the most likeable, the story doesn't always give you what you want, but in the last few chapters the author figures this out for herself, and by doing so, I think gives the reader something to take with them from this book. Its a book that makes you think, makes you feel, and makes you examine your own life (especially if you're in your late 20's or early 30's).I look forward to her next book and story. If you're a fan of English lit like Emma or of American stuff like Raymond Carver, get this book, you'll like it for the most part. If you think Bridget Jones and romance novels are quality reading I'd avoid this book because its not as neat and tidy of a story as you might want it to be."},{"Title":"Ringing For You: A Love Story with Interruptions","review":"This book could easily go down in history as being one of the most irritating. I am really getting sick of books where women just moan on about whether or not some guy's going to ring them. Who cares? I mean, I know what it's like to go through that kind of agony, but somehow, reading page after page about someone living the same trauma really doesn't do it for me.And who cares about the people that she works with at the Academy of Material bloody Science? They are not inspiring or interesting. She has no life whatsoever, yet she insists on writing a damned novel about it.If I ever see the words/symbol MWMM ever again, I'm going to strangle somebody! This is how she refers to the man she is in love with. Meanwhile, she has a sweet, yet boring man waiting at home for her, and she has to choose between the two. Yeah. Yawn.I don't know why I bothered reading the whole thing, I mean, I didn't pay for it (thank god)- it was from the library. Maybe I just thought something would happen, or maybe that she would make me laugh. Jeez, I don't even know what the main character's name is, and frankly, I don't care.

But, this one isn't one of the lucky ones. The setup of a young secretary telling the story of those she works with, could have worked but, IT didn't. The characters were NOT interesting and I found myself getting annoyed at those little icons the author used to tell what was going on. I felt like I was reading a children's picture book. It was a lame attempt at humor and storytelling. I'm not sure how it got such positive reviews. I certainly didn't see it."},{"Title":"Ringing For You: A Love Story with Interruptions","review":"I'm a big fan of the &quot;British Chick Book&quot; genre (Helen Fielding, Marian Keyes, et al), as my husband calls it, and assumed that the well-reviewed &quot;Ringing for You&quot; would be another in a line of funny, romantic comedy in the Bridget Jones vein. Well, trust me Bridget fans: it's not.Anouchka Grose Forrester tells the story of a not very likable, receptionist. Yes, she's single, lovelorn and living in London, but that's all she has in common with the fabulous Bridget Jones. Fielding and Keyes make their slacker, angst-ridden characters fun and relate-able, Forrester, herself a former receptionist, follows the Fielding diary format but doesn't have any of the magic. You hate the whiney, no good character by page four and are forced to wade through a series of annoying symbols (look, the author discovered the font &quot;Wingdings&quot; on her computer and now we all must suffer) and acronyms. The entire book is practically written in code!All that could be overlooked if you liked, cared or even laughed with any of the characters but the diary writer (I've forgotten her name, if I ever knew it) was thoroughly detestable and no one she wrote about worth knowing. The whole &quot;Man Who Mustn't be Mentioned&quot; mystery (her secret lover) takes up most of the book and, to be honest, I couldn't care less who he was or whether he ended up with what's-her-name."},{"Title":"Salmon Cookbook","review":"I've had this book since shortly after its release in 1987 - long before the low-carb craze, so having that particular recipe isn't something I'd expect.

It's on their low-carb menu (7 net carbs!) and it's fantastic -- just grilled salmon with some lemon, basil and thyme served with broccoli and tasty low-carb smashed! Unfortunately, it was missing this recipe.Don't get me wrong, Atkins folks -- there are plenty of fantastic and easy-to-make recipes here for healthy salmon dishes. But for the perfect Lemon Basil Salmon, looks like I'll have to head back to Pizzeria Uno."},{"Title":"Aurora Floyd (Classic Books on Cassettes Collection)","review":"\\"Aurora Floyd\\" may not be the best novel Mary Elizabeth Braddon wrote -- the honor goes to \\"Lady Audley's Secret\\" -- but, the book is still intriguing because of the contrast it makes with the other book and many other contemporary novels, especially \\"Jane Eyre.\\" And if you don't have these historical interest, the book is pretty interesting thanks to its good storytelling.[The following paragraph about the story includes mild spoilers.]\\"Aurora Floyd\\" follows the history of the heroine of the same name, who has a shady past left in France. Aurora, unrestrained morally in her youth, hides some secret, but still attractive enough to make the two heroes fall in love with her. Without telling the nature of the secret, Aurora, strong-willed and candid, gives a clear warning to one of them, proud Talbot Bulstrode, that he may one day regret his rash action if he dares to marry her. While he vanishes from her to marry other woman, tame and tender-hearted Lucy, the other suitor meek John Mellish succeeds in winning her heart, and he immediately marries her, not knowing her secret. As the time goes on, however, her hidden secret emerges from the past, and finally catches up with Aurora, living now quietly in a countryside. She must face the past, but how? While she is tormented by the sense of guilt, her husband began to suspect something wicked is going on.The story is melodramatic, but it is the merit of sensation novels, the genre in vogue during the 1860s, and Braddon, as she showed in her previous (actually written almost at the same time) \\"Lady Audley's Secret,\\" is very good at handling the subject. It is notable, however, that the author intends to do something different this time, spending more pages on the analysis of the psychology of the characters. The result is a mixed bag; sometimes she shows good descriptions of characters with a witty touch, which reminds us of Thackeray, the story sometimes gets slower because of too much philosophy. Compared with the fast-paced \\"Lady Audley's Secret,\\" her new experiment may look somewhat damaging.But as a whole, the book is agreeable, and after you finish two-thirds of the book, Braddon makes the plot speedier. The last part includes one of the earliest examples of detective story, and a good (but short) portrayal of detective Joseph Grimstone's work is still fascinating. But the greatest merit of the book is its sub-text dealing with incredibly violent passion of Aurora, whose image is clearly mocking the typical angelic image of Victorian women. One of the book's scenes, in which the heroine gives a shower of blows with her whip to her stable-man who bullied her dog, caused sensation and scandalized some critics. The description is still impressive today.In conclusion, \\"Aurora Floyd\\" is a fairly gripping story, even though it is not the best place to start reading her books or Victorian novels. If you think you are familiar with those Victorian novels, or want to read one of the effect following the impact of Bronte's \\"Jane Eyre,\\" try it.Trivia: Braddon lived long (died in 1915), and before her death, she even watched the filmed version of her own \\"Aurora Floyd.\\" Her life story is as intriguing as a story she wrote.[NOTE ON THE TEXT] Oxford University Press's \\"Aurora Flyod\\" uses the later edition of the book while Broadview Press's uses an earlier edition. The former one is considerable changed from the latter, so for the academic use you must be careful."},{"Title":"Aurora Floyd (Classic Books on Cassettes Collection)","review":"Having devoured Trollope, Willkie Collins, I happened onto Aurora Floyd and was truly surprised to find such an outstanding story so beautifully written. A dark secret revealed, a murder and a love story, this is a wonderful book."},{"Title":"Aurora Floyd (Classic Books on Cassettes Collection)","review":"Braddon was a hugely popular Victorian writer of sensation novels. She is most famous for Lady Audley's Secret, a novel that provided Braddon with financial means for life. If you are choosing whether to read Lady Audley's Secret or Aurora Floyd, my recommendation is Aurora Floyd. It was written a few years later when Braddon was a more experienced writer and I found it more original than the more famous first novel.Braddon had a very interesting life. She fell in love with a married man whose wife was in a lunatic asylum. (It feels like every other man had a wife in a madhouse in the Victorian era). Braddon helped him raise his children by the institutionalized wife and had 6 children of her own with him. One of those children was W.B. Maxwell, the author of Vivien, one of my most favorite novels ever. This explains why W.B. Maxwell was so hung up on extramarital sexual relations.Nobody knew that Braddon and her husband were living together without being officially married. When the couple's servants discovered that their employers \\"were living in sin\\", they were so scandalized that they all gave their notice on the same day. Braddon, of course, couldn't care less and continued writing her hugely popular novels.Aurora Floyd perfectly epitomizes the saying, \\"Good girls go to heaven, bad girls go wherever they want.\\" Aurora Floyd does whatever she feels like, leads a very unconventional lifestyle, yet everybody adores and celebrates her. Aurora's cousin Lucy is the embodiment of the Victorian Angel in the House and the opposite of the flamboyant, powerful, and secretive Aurora. Lucy's life is an open book and this is precisely what makes her so insipid. Lucy's own husband is irresistibly drawn to the much more complex Aurora.Braddon, whose lifestyle was quite unconventional, pokes fun at the boring good girls who efface themselves to such a degree that nobody would notice if they live or die. Aurora Floyd, on the other hand, is rewarded for being the opposite of the Angel in the House with being loved by her husband with the kind of love that I find unmatched anywhere else in fiction."},{"Title":"Aurora Floyd (Classic Books on Cassettes Collection)","review":"Beautiful Aurora is spoiled and petted but she carries a dreadful secret. As a young woman she impulsively marries her father's groom, leading him to pay the unsuitable suitor off.. But it will all come back to haunt her later, when she marries again. Among the most compelling \\"neglected\\" works of Victorian fiction."},{"Title":"Aurora Floyd (Classic Books on Cassettes Collection)","review":"\\"Aurora Floyd\\" was an extremely popular Victorian \\"sensation novel\\" when it was first published in book form in 1863 (it had originally appeared as a magazine serial). The novel went through many printings and editorial changes--the Broadview edition attempts to create a definitive text by going back to the first publication, and trying to retain only those revisions that were clearly intended by the author.I would recommend the novel for fans of Victorian fiction. The heroine is unusual in a number of ways (e.g., she's an expert on horses and racing), and her romantic life does not follow the usual pattern. I don't think the book is as well-constructed as Braddon's most well-known work, \\"Lady Audley's Secret\\"--it rambles a bit, and the author's constant rhapsodies about the beauty of her heroine become tiresome--but it is worth reading for its historical interest, engaging plot, and memorable characters. Some of Brandon's ramblings are actually quite entertaining, though some readers may feel that they slow down the story. Fans of detective novels will probably enjoy the serious attention paid to the work of London sleuth Mr. Grimstone in the later part of the book--though most will be surprised that, as a humble employee in the early days of the police force, he sometimes chooses his working methods in order to maximize his personal gain.The 1998 version of the Broadview edition that I read contains a number of illuminating essays on \\"Aurora Floyd\\", Mary Elizabeth Braddon, and Victorian \\"sensation\\" literature in general, some from Braddon's own era. It also contains copious footnotes, many of which were interesting and educational. However, one footnote, in Chapter 23 (p. 351 in my version of the book), contains a MAJOR spoiler that the editors should not have included in that spot, as it reveals the secret upon which much of the suspense of the plot is built."},{"Title":"Peer Gynt: A play in five acts in verse (Ibsen's plays)","review":"A genuinely wonderful comedy, not a bit dated, &amp; a wiser way into Ibsen than any of the later &amp; generally rated greater problem plays.

It was allright, but definitely not among my favorites.Ibsen is a wonderful writer, and has some other great works I would highly recommend, such as A Doll's House or Hedda Gabler. But Peer Gynt was one of his first, and in my opinion, he still needed to work on his plot.Disagree? Email me."},{"Title":"Peer Gynt: A play in five acts in verse (Ibsen's plays)","review":"Often funny. Often bizarre. Always deep. Peer Gynt first appears to me as this self-centered youth who cares only for himself and the satisfaction of his impulses and whims at any cost. He is the quick non-thinker, who leaves a life of relative conventionality to roam as a dissolute wanderer. He is indeed all of these things, but all the while his &quot;self&quot; is not &quot;centered&quot;. At the end of his adventures as a libertine, the grey-bearded Peer Gynt is at a cross-roads, and he asks the character of the Button Moulder this question: &quot;What, after all, is this being one's self?&quot; The Button Moulder replies that being one's self means slaying one's Self, and furthermore &quot;observing the Master's intentions in all things.&quot; Peer Gynt contemplates this... restraint and delayed gratification have never been manageable themes with him. In my opinion, this whole idea of the search for the &quot;self&quot; is what Peer Gynt is all about. At the very final crossroads he is redeemed by the undeserved forgiveness and love of Solvieg, the woman he has once abandoned... this scene being a beautiful picture of the grace and love of God that is available to the Peer Gynt in every reader.Ibsen originally wrote Peer Gynt as a poem, and therefore we lose the Norwegian rhyme and metre in any English translation. To compensate if at all possible, I suggest reading the play while listening to the incidental music of Edvard Grieg, specifically composed to accompany the live performance of Peer Gynt. (Note: My review is based on the translation by Peter Watts)."},{"Title":"Peer Gynt: A play in five acts in verse (Ibsen's plays)","review":"The play is fine.This printing of it, however, is absolutely terrible. Do not waste your money on it. I don't care how much cheaper it is than any of the others. This is completely unreadable. It appears to have been scanned from an 1908 edition of Peer Gynt. They OCR'ed it (Quite poorly I might add), then they print it on demand.There are no stage directions. There is almost no punctuation in sentences (no commas, etc). There are numerous misspellings. It is nearly impossible to tell who is speaking as the names are misspelled, sometimes in all caps, sometimes not, sometimes indented. The Act and Scene divisions are almost nonexistent.I read about 5 pages of it before I gave up and got a photocopied version from my teacher. Complete waste of money."},{"Title":"Peer Gynt: A play in five acts in verse (Ibsen's plays)","review":"This version of Peer Gynt should be avoided at all costs. It is a copy that was made with robotic page turners and character recognition software that was marginal. The book is full of misspellings and punctuation errors. If you've never read Ibsen's Peer Gynt, this text is very difficult to follow,"},{"Title":"Peer Gynt: A play in five acts in verse (Ibsen's plays)","review":"Peer Gynt is a piece of literature that, like Goethe's Faust Part II plays best on the stage of the imagination. It is too lengthy and costly to be performed on stage. Sometimes the first three acts are performed together, sometimes the last two acts are brought together to become a whole for a theatre production.In terms of reading, this is a great fable piece. Peer is the Trickster with the mirror to his conscience. As a youth, he is Troll-like in his lusts, in his carousing. In his middle-age, he is Troll-like in his financial enterprises. At the end of his life, he is a folorn man, having given up possible true love to run around in search of his self. He is a fraud but we feel sympathy for him. He pursues life in search of distractions and power but ends up empty at the end, soon to be the vicim of the Button Moulder, soon to be nothing more than a button.This work has many levels and open to numerous interpretations. Ideally, this is the book you read for a book club. There is nothing conventional about it. The conversations will be endless and the philosophy inspired, well, might be inspiring."},{"Title":"Peer Gynt: A play in five acts in verse (Ibsen's plays)","review":"I ordered this play to read for a class in school.Not only was this \\"robot generated\\" edition extremely difficult to read due to typos and random formatting inconsistencies, but portions of it were completely missing - for example 2 entire scenes in act 4.I actually need to know what happens, and reading this version, I don't.You get some kind of membership with it that means you can view this play, and other books, online, but if I'd wanted to read the play online, I would have done so with one of the free sites that offers complete verions of texts that are in the public domain.Apparently, the \\"robot\\" technology saves on costs, and if it had cost me 2 or 3 dollars, I may have been more forgiving, but it was not, in my opinion, priced low enough to justify the extremely shabby quality.If you need to read this play, or want to own it (it is a classic, and the story itself is worthwhile), FIND ANOTHER VERSION!"},{"Title":"Peer Gynt: A play in five acts in verse (Ibsen's plays)","review":"Peer Gynt is a sort of folk tale character who we see go from being a young man to an old man and who gets in several different adventures. The play doesn't have much of a plot exactly. It starts of in a Norwegian village where Peer is a buffoonish character. He leaves the village, meets up with Trolls, gets in a shipwreck, wanders around the desert, and runs into the button moulder. All of this just happens, disconnectedly. He spends time in America also, but we aren't shown that.There is a lot of talk about being your self, being authentic, etc. If the play has a theme, I am guessing that's it.It's completely different from Ibsen's realistic works like An Enemy of the People or The Wild Duck. I'm more a fan of those works. Peer Gynt didn't really speak to me.On a side note, in the movie Educating Rita, with Michael Caine, Rita takes a test where one of the questions was 'What are some of the difficulties in staging Peer Gynt?' A: It's long. It's not in prose. It has trolls and other fantastical creatures. It has a huge cast many of whom are only on stage very briefly. The main character goes from being a youth to a very old man. The settings vary from a Norwegian village to Egypt and the Sphinx. This is why it's rarely done on stage."},{"Title":"Peer Gynt: A play in five acts in verse (Ibsen's plays)","review":"Based on traditional Nordic legend Ibsen's version would make a better narrative than verse literary effort. Obviously all rhyme is lost in a prose translation, plus the story itself defies the Greek Unities of Time and Place. Scenes are set in Norway, the tropics and the desert--lest audiences be bored with mere snowy locales. Peer's story covers his wild, reckless youth through his cynical middle age, right up to his regretful old age. He interacts with humans, trolls and other-worldly characters as he vainly romps through life. Driven to clear his reputation and earn the respect of his skeptical, critical neighbors, he embarks on a lifelong journey to discover his true identity.Possibly a cautionary tale PEER GYNT touches a human chord: the desire to improve oneself, to repay maternal care and to earn the love of a sweet, faithful maiden. Typical Nordic references include trafficking with trolls and the danger of getting a shard of glass or ice in one's eye, which distorts true vision and humanity. Despite the temptation Peer ultimately rejects trolldom in favor of maintaining his priceless human attributes.This edition, photocopied by robot, proves difficult to read because of:--lack of apostrophes in most contractions--odd punctuation which disrupts the flow of reading--inclusion of literary notes directly into the script, instead of placed as footnotesIn short: a confusing and disappointing version of an honored tale, which inspired composer Edvard Greig's PEER GYNT SUITE."},{"Title":"Peer Gynt: A play in five acts in verse (Ibsen's plays)","review":"I like this version a lot - it's full of energy, and very exciting to see in person, which I was lucky enough to do. But it's NOT the Peer Gynt you might be familiar with, or the one you want to pick up if you're looking for a more standard translation. While this one is true to the story and the characters, there's a lot of updating and a lot of language that might offend people who don't like the kinds of words you can't say on radio and TV. It's more of an interpretation than a translation.If you want a more standard version, I like this one."},{"Title":"Peer Gynt: A play in five acts in verse (Ibsen's plays)","review":"This is the first version of the play.

A must have between Peter Pan and Samuel Beckett."},{"Title":"Peer Gynt: A play in five acts in verse (Ibsen's plays)","review":"Few works of literature have inspired classical music that has broke into the popular press. One of these is Ibsen's Peer Gynt. Written in the late 19th century, Edvard Grieg wrote two Suites of music for the stageplay version of this Scandinavian classic a decade later. This poem / stageplay is actually a short novel, and tells the story of Peer Gynt, the ultimate ingrate of a son. Growing up raised by a single mother, he is the terror of his village, bullying younger ones and annoying older ones. Eventually he leaves his village and encounters a series of creatures and adventures bound to rattle anyone's cage. One memorable moment is when he finds himself in the Hall of the Mountain King, who happens to be a troll. This is the scene whose song of the same name by Grieg is a classic TV commercial tune. Life soon turns the young Peer into an older Peer. Near the end he reflects on his life with some characters he encounters. At this he realizes the waste his life has been. The moral of the story: don't waste your youth or any other moment of your life causing trouble for yourself or anyone else, for in the end you only isolate yourself and make life miserable for both you and those around you."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Perl in 21 Days (Sams Teach Yourself...in 21 Days)","review":"I was able to quickly learn the basics of the language from this book.

My only original complaint was Till's writing, which is at best clumsy and at worst confusing. Still, I plowed through into the fifth day. There, the programming examples given begin to resemble the writing: clumsy, confusing, and -- what is poison for a coding manual -- illogical. One of his examples takes 100 calculations to generate 10 numbers, and fails to meet his own criteria. This broke my faith in the book, but I continued until I found two other programs given as answers that simply don't work.That's unacceptable for a programming tutorial.

If the book says &quot;Teach Yourself Perl in 21 days&quot;, any advanced topics that it covers is gravy. Obviously it's a beginners book.

She's not supposed to teach you algebra too!), &quot;don't buy the book because when you're done learning everything that the book has to offer (which is substantial) it won't turn into a super advanced book&quot; (go buy one of those 2000 page tomes that tries to please everyone and only succeeds in breaking your back). No book can please everyone.

So I realized that I needed a good, quick foundation in perl.I dusted of my perl for dummies book. Now this is a true beginners book. Way too lightweight! This book will not prepare you for perl code that you'd see in the &quot;real world&quot;. The important part is, THIS BOOK WILL! The greatest thing that an author can do for you is give you a spoon so that you can feed yourself. This book does that.By the way, this book has a lot of topics that I haven't seen in &quot;advanced&quot; books. Don't think that it's a lightweight.

Instead, the author's stated goal is to provide a gentle introduction to Perl to get you to an intermediate level and the book definitely does do that.In going through the typos of this book, I realize that most of the code typos are in the Regular Expressions section where errors are very easy to miss.Finally, when I wrote my first review, the website for the book was not fully operational, but I visited the site again and it now appears to be working fine."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Perl in 21 Days (Sams Teach Yourself...in 21 Days)","review":"I knew nothing about Perl and bought this book because other Amazon reviewers said it was good for newbies, and I found that to be true as well. In contrast, Randal Schwartz's &quot;Learning Perl&quot; book, which I flipped through in the bookstore, is just too hard for a complete newbie. However, the book falls a little short when addressing Perl's more advanced functions and features. The &quot;Going Deeper&quot; section found in each chapter is easily the most annoying aspect of the book. In each &quot;Going Deeper&quot; section, the author touches on some interesting and advanced features of Perl without going into any depth or providing code examples. Get this book to learn Perl but get something more advanced so that you can actually use Perl for something useful.Also, there were way too many typos in this book. It's difficult to get rid of typos, but a programming book must be free of typos in its code examples otherwise the reader does not know whether his programs are crashing because of his own mistakes or the book's typos. Some reviewers state that some typos are inevitable in any book with lots of code examples. I disagree. Anyone providing code examples should test and debug it before publishing it. I wouldn't want my name on a book which had buggy code because of typos, so I don't see why any professional author would do the same.I went to the book's website to list some of the typos but aside from the home page, the rest of the website has not been constructed. Hopefully, the author will get around to finishing the website so that readers can post where typos can be found and the author can provide errata pages as well as correcting mistakes for the second edition."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Perl in 21 Days (Sams Teach Yourself...in 21 Days)","review":"TEACH YOURSELF PERL IN 21 DAYS was the first book I bought on the Perl scripting language. While it has no claims above being an introduction to the material, it has got quite a lot of information packed into its 720 pages. I had no background in Perl at all (though I already knew several other CS languages and scripts), but with this book I had no trouble picking it up. I was able to learn a fair amount of knowledge in a short amount of time. The layout of the book is quite helpful and organized; people with no background in Computer Science can start from the beginning with no trouble, while those readers who already know most of the fundamentals can skip ahead to the later chapters.This book will teach you almost everything you will need to know as a beginning Perl programmer. It starts with the basics (the ever-present &quot;Hello World&quot; example, operators, variables) and slowly moves to more in-depth topics (such as hashing, lists, strings, loops and subroutines) until finally getting to the harder stuff (file I/O, CGI scripting and references). TEACH YOURSELF PERL IN 21 DAYS won't give you everything that you will ever need to know, but it will definitely fill in almost all of the blanks that you need to know most of the time.As a book for beginners, this book should have everything you're looking for. It also makes a fairly good reference guide once you've managed to establish yourself as a Perl programmer. I'd advise buying a second, more advanced book, once you're ready to move onto more sophisticated topics. But as an introduction, this book will cover practically everything you will need to know.

For anyone WITH a formal or extensive software background, the book will flow easily. For those WITHOUT a structured software background, don't expect to be a programming whiz after this (or to get a lot of the nuances of the language). The book covers PERL, but not how to write good pgms. The book gets into terms and constructs, even early on, that would baffle a newbee. It also greatly disappointed me that the author DOESNT COMMENT THE CODE AS THEY RECOMMEND! Yes, it is explained in the text, but if the code was commented in the examples themselves, it would be a much better book. Web references are helpful (ie code examples are on-line). I would say it is best used by someone already with a software background looking to cross over to PERL.

During his portraiture, Gray meets Lord Henry Wotton, who preaches self-indulgence and the high social value, yet lamentable ephemerality, of youth. Influenced by Lord Henry, Gray becomes cold-hearted and self-centered. Gray soon discovers that his descent into moral dissolution is being represented by changes in his portrait. Over the years, Gray seems never to age, while his image in the portrait ages in his place and also continues to show the ongoing moral dissolution within Gray's character. In the end, he cannot bear to be what he has become.Comment: This novel struck me as glib.

I didn't notice when I ordered it that it's not the size of a regular book--it's more the size of an academic journal or magazine. Nearly 8 X 10 inches. Further, there's no named editor, no introduction, no apparatus at all. Just the text of the story--and that is printed in two columns on the page. The result is a book that won't fit on the shelf and that is unpleasant to read. Baffling."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray was a hard novel to get into. But once the plot of the story got underway it transfolded into a page turning, mind questioning story. Wilde tells us the story of a beautiful man who wishes that his soul would forever be part of his self portrait, and that he will forever stay youthful. Little to say, his wish comes true. Though there were many parts of the story that seemed to be described in quite a bit of unwanted detail, they almost give the novel a sense of philosophy. This compliments the many complicated philosophical views of Lord Henry, one of the main characters in the work. As the story progressed I found myself being pulled into the plot. When Dorian fell in love with Sibyl Vane I anticipated each turn of events that followed. Since we know about Dorian Gray's wish, each chapter teases us as to what will happen to him. Throughout the rest of his life, Dorian involuntarily causes accidents and grief to others. From Sibyl's death to the suicide of Alan Campbell, things always turn tragic for the ones in his life. It is inevitable that Dorian will meet his own death by the time the novel finishes. The conclusion to the story couldn't have been done better. The way that Wilde closes the life of Dorian Gray is perfectly written, and paints a perfect \\"portrait\\" in our minds as well."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"great book hard to read because print was so small"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Review by Jason LushOne hundred and ninety pages of political masturbation disguised as a supernatural suspense story. Of the three main characters we have; Dorian Gray, who is a brainless puppet the personifies vanity; Basil Hallward, the artist who painted the fabled portrait and represents the sorrowful conscience; and Lord Henry Wolton, who is the quintessential 19th Century fop whose sole purpose in the book is to act as Wilde's voice on politics, religion and homosexuality and as a driving corrupter of everyone else in the book.The pacing is horrendously slow, the chapters devoted to explaining Gray's hobbies and the pictures of his ancestors in his hallway don't help with the lousy pacing.

It was written in a style of gentle prose that was easy to read, and it did put forth at least a few interesting concepts. On the whole though, the ideas in this book were utterly ridiculous and totally lacking in any true depth. They appear to me to be the vain ramblings of a man consumned in his own deepness, thereby proving how shallow he truly was. I would liken this book to a picture in which detailing, shading, and general looks are pleasing, but the perspective is off, ruining the whole picture. So perhaps you would enjoy this book if you are looking for a few ideas and smart sayings put together in a seemingly random, and almost chaotic order."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Every so often one has the good fortune of discovering an author whose work reaffirms all that is appreciable in literature by exemplifying its worst. Oscar Wilde, after reading whose novel and two fairy tales, quickly obviates any further need or desire to be further acquainted. The knowledge found on the cover of my paperback edition, between the obligatory sickly hagiography that usually betrays the expectation it inspires, that The Picture of Dorian Gray was apparently the author's only fruitful attempt at a \`full-length' novel, leaves one snickering ante facto in not entirely facetious gratitude. Wilde was seemingly more at home in the realm of fairy tales, and this 217-page full-length novel not by itself finding ground to fill the space between the covers, finds itself supported by three samples of that genre.One might be forgiven for assuming that the novel portends to explore an emotional or philosophical metaphor of a relationship between the eponymous painting and its subject, but the implied exploration is unfortunately mostly specious. The metaphor, to be sure, is there, but it is a mere seed that never takes root or grows out of its entirely obvious and superficial form, and the story thus fails to fulfil its promise.Furthermore, the filling leaves one with a bad aftertaste. None of the three characters have any endearing features to redeem themselves for the gall they otherwise freely spew. \`Lord Henry' in particular has no characterizing dimension other than denigration of everything else in the form of dull pseudowitticisms, from which comparison we take it the aristocrat was intended to benefit. We learn his contempt of clergy (bishops \\"don't think\\"), stockbrokers (\\"even a stock-broker can gain a reputation for being civilized\\"), dowagers (they are \\"overdressed\\"), academicians (tedious), the middle class (not modern), Americans, marriage, women, and Jews (I don't believe any mention of the religion ever lacks the adjective \\"fat\\"). The misogyny in particular is so pungent and the female characters so weak that the protagonists cannot otherwise but treat them with the contempt that they do. If indeed \\"women are decorative\\" it is merely because the men do not have a vision that sees beyond superficialities. This is no parody of aristocratic vanity (in the style of Thackeray, for instance) so one quickly finds oneself wishing for one of these maligned targets of Lord Henry's dull wit to return the favor with a dull but well-deserved kick in the [rump].When the characters are not railing against the world, they are theorizing about it, but the obvious inconsistencies and utter inanity of the theories make them impossible to consider seriously. To give an example, and not have one character take the brunt of all the book's failings, the artist Basil Hallward states first (speaking of his own work) that \\"every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not the sitter,\\" but six pages later that \\"an artist should create beautiful things, but should put nothing of his own life into them.\\" A story dealing ostentatiously with a profound relationship between ars and artis, in which the artist doesn't remember from one moment to the next whether or not he put feeling in his art, reveals that its author has lost control of his subject. Othertimes the theories are merely silly and quite impossible to take at face value. What to make, for example, of the idea that \\"beauty is a form of genius- is higher, indeed, than genius, as it needs no explanation,\\" or that \\"people say sometimes that beauty is superficial. That may be so, but at least it is not so superficial as thought is.\\" This is just tripe without considerable meaning.Within this theorizing there are faint reverberations reaching toward some oblique philosophy of hedonism, but never quite advancing beyond a mere slogan. Without actually doing the work of fully expounding the philosophy, or having the courage to fully sound its implications, in the way that for example de Sade did, the author cannot reasonably expect us to sympathize or find the actions of his characters anything but wholly unsatisfying and their reactions rather balmy.Wilde quite clearly has no desire (charitably assuming it is not from a lack of potential) to prepare and construct a plot. One of the adjunct characters, Jim, whose sister Sibyl later commits suicide over the protagonist, finds out he is a bastard son, his mother was orphaned, and forgives her (what for, we are left to guess), all within the space of three quarter page. Dorian's swings of attitude toward Sybil from ignorance through love through despisement through sorrow to self-forgiveness are so extreme and irrational that they make a pastiche of emotion. Jim's completely unfounded anger toward Dorian is so unrealistically sudden and out of proportion that it is obvious how Jim's fears will be realized and that there will be a confrontation. There is no mystery, less a sense of a world to discover than of being dragged along by an uninterested parent. The rhetorical questions Dorian asks in his histrionic despair are answered immediately, it is for me simply to get in, sit down, shut up, and hold on.Even more fundamentally, the characters are shallow, undeveloped, and quite stereotypical, the dialog stilted and unrealistic- altogether a surprisingly unsophisticated style, especially in the light of the beautiful writing of his contemporaries. Dialog has a tendency to spin off into unrelated tangents that are unceremoniously and artificially \`snapped back' to the main thread. Henry's inability to speak in any other form than witless aphorism is at first merely unfunny, then quickly boring, later irritating, and finally not bearing further reading. And this is unfortunately barely the only character development in the story at all, the only other characters having little strength of will of their own to resist mimicking this trite ascerbicism.If the book has revealed anything at all, it is not a deeper analysis of art or hedonism, but a much more animal homoeroticism. Dorian Gray is much more than anything else a love story with the trimmings (envy and a murder-suicide), and all the less respectful because it dares not speak its name. Female emotions are contemptible, but the same expressions of liking (Wilde can never bring himself to call it more), admiration of beauty, and extreme flattery by men towards other men, are accepted naturally and not subject to this contempt."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Well, I had to read this book for a school assignment. I'm not really sure what I expected from this book, but I know I didn't get it. This book shows the true demoralization of our society- past and present. The absloute worst part of the book (about 90% of it) was the long, monotonous, verbose speeches that consisted of the characters'ideals that were just &quot;off the mark&quot; by a little. I would not suggest reading this book, partly because of the boring content, but mostly because of the fact that I still haven't found a plot."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"The novel The Picture of Dorian Grey is an unoriginal story line with disturbing morals in which innocent people are corrupted. Written in the late 18th century by Oscar Wilde the novel is an example of homosexual fiction. While the sexual preference of the characters is never addressed it is often hinted at. Many of the morals presented in the novel are very disturbing. Harry presents his views in such a way as to make them seem right. He \\"preaches\\" on living a life for pleasure, and the sensations. He stresses that women are merely brainless playthings there to provide entertainment. His theory on remaining young is to repeat all your youthful sins. This is presenting a lifestyle of self-indulgence, in which material things bring happiness. Harry's corruption of Dorian leads to the corruption of many others. As Dorian begins to live as Harry has suggested he begins to use his influence over people to his advantage. He drives Sibyl Vane to her death, and also her brother who tries to seek revenge. Many close friends become outcasts because of his escalating bad reputation. In this story of twisted corruption, Basil Hallward is a very likely target for destruction. Had is not been for his adoration of Dorian then Harry never would have become interested in him. It becomes obvious that in order to be rid of all the mishaps Dorian must be rid of the originator. Basils death is almost obvious from the start. The main storyline, man sells soul for youth, is one used many times by several authors. It is based on a 15th century German magician Johann Faust. In his time he was considered a fake and a criminal. In the original Faustbook (1587), written by an unknown author, is a biography of Johann Faust in which he sells his soul to the devil Mephistopheles for 24 years in return for power, knowledge, and youth and finally goes to hell in terror. It is ironic that this is also approximately the same amount of time it takes Dorian to become fully corrupted and destroy the painting. All in all the book was a waste of time. With its disturbing morals and unoriginal storyline the book left something to be desired. It was often predictable and uneventful.

He wishes that he--not the painting--will remain forever young and beautiful, while the painting ages and decays. Dorian's wish comes true and it is the painting that not only shows his age, but also all his sins. Oscar Wilde crafted not only a brilliant horror novel, but also a treatise on art and reality. Despite the claims of Lord Henry, art does reveal the truths of life. The painting reveals the true soul of Dorian Gray. When Dorian's beloved actress discovers true love (not the dramatic imitation), she is no longer able to participate in the elevated dramas on the stage. Then she loses Dorian's love. A book is what fully corrupts Dorian and causes him to live a life of sin. This is a story of the inability to bring truth and art together.

I never did, but thought I would give it a try as I really enjoy dry British wit and intelligent prose. Beyond that, I wasn't sure what else I was expecting, but for my tastes, I didn't end up entirely satisfied.The opening 10 or 20 pages insinuated themselves into my imagination and I felt that I would be entertained by the main characters throughout the rest of the novel. The detailed descriptions of the lovely country setting and extravagant flowers gives one an impression of decadence and a high society jadedness that I somehow expected from Oscar Wilde, having read none of his previous work. Unfortunately, the remainder of the novel didn't hold as much pleasure for me.Dorian Grey is a relatively uninteresting central character who is but a blank canvas for Lord Henry to experiment upon; Dorian's own thoughts and musings are not so compelling in and of themselves and yet we are treated to quite a few pages of them throughout. Lord Henry himself is an interesting character whose mean-spiritedness, which approaches evil in some instances, is obscured by his verbose bantering on half-baked, jaundiced observations on Victorian life. These also consume considerable paper stock, and as witty as his musings start out (his thoughts on marriage were particularly humorous to me), they start to run together and become somewhat of a misshapen lump through which I felt I was slogging at times.Anyway, the story is relatively well known to most at this point, regardless of whether you have read the book in question or not. It progresses more or less as one might assume, which is not entirely a bad thing (I would not classify this tale as a mystery or as a horror novel, a genre to which I see it is sometimes curiously attributed). Oscar Wilde is definitely saying something here, and there seem to be many elements of allegory contained within the story. I have read that he saw parts of himself within all three of the main characters, and they do seem to represent different facets of a single personality. Unfortunately these same characters are hamstrung by this very fact, as they each seem only part of a personality, part of a character, and not well rounded or believable in their motivations or actions.This is the first Oscar Wilde I have attempted to read, and I won't say it is my last, but there are classics of English literature which are as well written, more engrossing, and, in the end, more memorable, at least to this reader (\\"Silas Marner\\" comes to mind as a fine book I only just recently read for the first time as well).So, overall, about 3 stars from me. In my opinion it poses some interesting questions, sparkles in a few spots, and held my attention for a few hours, but it's not something I would return to or recommend for pleasurable reading.As a side note, I am somewhat surprised by the criticisms of the homoerotic nature of the relationships portrayed within the novel. Wilde portrayed the passionate nature of what amounts to a love triangle in a very effective (if slightly florid) way, and, as has been noted before, the relationships between the men seem more genuine and believable than those involving the fairer sex. Maybe this type of undertone would be out of place in a Hemingway novel but good grief it's Oscar Wilde!

His only novel, Oscar Wilde's satire of the upper class in late 19th century Britain mocks their vapid lifestyle, while at times glorying in it, though the story arc comes from the tradition of Edgar Allan Poe. The combination is both delicious and shocking. \\"Picture\\" is also a veritable gold mine, or should I say minefield, of ironic aphorisms, most of them emanating from the mind and mouth of Gray's friend and mentor Sir Henry Wooten, who is kind of like Michael Scott of \\"The Office\\", except with a functioning brain.Brilliantly written, entertaining and thought provoking, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" stands highly recommended to readers young and old. It's sad that Wilde lived at a time when homosexuals were persecuted, in his case prosecuted, even moreso than they are now. A giant of 19th century literature could have contributed well into the 20th century, but died penniless, estranged from his birthplace in Ireland, and home in England, at the age of 46 in the year 1900."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray was a quick, easy and enjoyable read. I knew the very basic premise of the story from watching the 2003 movie, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. I also had a lot of wrong preconceived notions because of the the movie.The Picture of Dorian Gray was less supernatural in nature than I expected. Other than not aging and having the picture age for him, Dorian was a regular guy. When given the opportunity to live his life without his behavior marring his beauty, he chose debauchery. I found myself thinking, who wouldn't? He tried to experience everything the world has to offer (a noble pursuit) and finds that life can become pointless without boundaries.Dorian's friend, Harry, is the absolute shining star of this novel. He counsels Dorian in the way of the world, full of his own theories and cynical viewpoints. He's humorous and more often than not, what he says makes a lot of sense.The one thing I disliked about The Picture of Dorian Gray was that it seemed like the most interesting pieces of the story were missing. Oscar Wilde was very vague about exactly why Dorian actually did in the years he spent corrupting his soul. People who were once his friends couldn't stand to be in the same room as him and no explanation was given. Perhaps in 1890, when the book was published, saying that he did vile, cruel, disgusting things was enough. Now, 120 years later, I need more. I need to know and it still bugs me that I don't know what Wilde was alluding to."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Beautiful and lyrical told with biting wit.

I AM ALSO A HUGE BEN BARNES FAN"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Most people never truly contemplate the real meaning of beauty. It has an alluring quality that cannot be fully understood, even in an abstract form. One of English author Oscar Wilde's motivations was to write a work that praises beauty as an art but simultaneously reveals its darker nature. That is what I believe he attempts to accomplish in his sole novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray. The work is set in late 19th century London at a time when the cultural excesses of the Victorian era reached their zenith. Infused with elements of Gothic horror, it is a work of Symbolist prose, the Symbolists being a group of literary luminaries who sought to glorify beauty and aesthetic decadence almost as a kind of spiritualism. Wilde is no doubt part of this new endeavor to perceive beauty in an innovative fashion, and he objectively promotes a rather original world outlook through the dynamic characters he creates.The Picture of Dorian Gray is built upon an interesting premise. A local artist named Basil Hallward is fully enamored by the subject of his latest portrait, the eponymous Dorian Gray. Basil, like almost everyone else, is impressed by Dorian's pulchritude and handsome features. As Dorian indulges Basil by sitting for a portrait, another one of Basil's friends, a dignified aristocrat named Lord Henry Wotton, enters and, he too, takes a tremendous liking for the vigorous youth. Later, Dorian holds a discussion with Henry about senility and Wotton reveals to him his hedonistic worldview: \\"To me, beauty is the wonder of wonder. It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances. The true mystery of the world lies in the visible, not the invisible. [...] A new Hedonism--that is what our century wants. You might be its visible symbol. With your personality there is nothing you could not do.\\" With this in mind, Dorian upholds a new creed by swearing that youth is the only noble quality worth possessing; he would rather have Basil's new portrait of him age in exchange for remaining eternally young. Consequently, Dorian proceeds to engage in every sort of pleasurable vice possible, while the picture of himself hanging in his room slowly decays. The plot proceeding from this point forward holds up well, though the climatic conclusion may seem clich&eacute; in light of the Gothic horror stories that many readers are acquainted with.Wilde does a splendid job of displaying a tone of biting sarcasm. His clever use of wit and double entendre to reveal introspective truths with all the effort he can muster is one of his valiant triumphs. Dorian's lust for sensual pleasure reveals the author's taste as an aesthete and suggests another aspect of the novel's motifs, that of duplicity. Dorian leads a double life by interacting with aristocratic high society during the day and indulging his senses at night. This dualism of Dorian's character underscores the dramatic complexity of his inner struggles.Dorian Gray can be seen as a man willing to exchange his very soul for what he craves. He candidly discards his reputation and eventually risks his life for his lofty desires, which is reminiscent of the Faust legend. Wilde's protagonist is not very remorseful for his debauchery and is constantly being manipulated by his friend and confidant, Henry Wotton. Ultimately, Dorian is a tragic hero participating in an Aristotelian tragedy where he is subtly cognizant of his impending doom and experiences multiple catastrophes. His hamartia proves to be his downfall.While every work of fiction has its shortcomings, Dorian Gray's are minimal. The author exhibits a delightful candor in his narration and characterization, and his nuanced writing style is replete with metaphorical and psychological analyses of flawed individuals.

The writing is accessible, even to those who tend to dislike more old-styled English writing, and the plot is certainly among the greatest ideas in literature. However, the character of Lord Henry, who carries a great deal of the novel, often goes on seemingly unending rants of his views on life and they bring the book down quite a bit. With these discourses, the book loses development in favor of pseudo-philosophy in a clever if rough attempt to both attract and repulse the reader. There is a mid-chapter in the book that describes the middle of Dorian's life that is absolute work to make your way through. The philosophy of the book is important of course, but it's much better when the story lends itself for the purpose. Overall, for the brilliance of the idea of the story; it's required reading."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"This book surprised me with its Gothic horror and surprising plot twists toward the end. This novel, for all its horrible philosophy on life, captures in a poignant way a lost person's search for fulfillment. Despite his indulgent quest for all kinds of pleasure, Dorian is still unfulfilled and in one of the most captivating passages of the book turns to opium to forget life. His descent into the opium den is characterized as a descent into hell, a personal hell which he has brought himself to and in which everyone sees through him and is against him.Though I wasn't a big fan at the beginning, as the book progressed I think it may have become one of the most memorable books I've read. The theme of the book is sin - its putrefying effect both on the sinner and those around him. One of the best moments of the book and one that sticks vividly in my mind is towards the end, when Dorian, sick of seeing his portrait so mangled and distorted by the sins he has already committed, does a \\"good deed\\" in order to try to start to clean it up. He races up the stairs, unlocks the secret room where his portrait is hidden, throws back the cover, and is faced with the same ugliness that had been there before. Then he is faced with a horrible realization of truth: because he had done the \\"good deed\\" out of motivation of making his own portrait/soul look better, he hadn't done a \\"good deed\\" at all and was now so deep in his depravity that even what he calls love has been warped into an all-encompassing egotism.Dorian's egotism gets progressively deeper. throughout the book. As Lord Henry says, It begins as innocent narcissism, but as it grows it begins to shunt blame for the sin of others and even motivates the good he does at the end of the book. Rather than his heavy sins bothering Dorian, \\"it was the living death of his own soul that troubled him\\" (226). His breakup with the young country girl was motivated more out of a desire to cleanse his portrait from its grime than any love for her, \\"for in hypocrisy he had worn the mask of goodness. For curiosity's sake he had tried the denial of self\\" (228). Being able to view his sin on the portrait in a sense made it more difficult to be selfless - \\"nothing makes one so vain as being told that one is a sinner. Conscience makes egotists of us all\\" (106) - and Dorian recognized this difficulty.The idea of pleasure in Dorian Gray is portrayed as a goal to pursue but never reach. \\"A cigarette is the perfect type of a perfect pleasure. It is exquisite, and it leaves one unsatisfied\\" (84). Despite Dorian's pursuit of pleasure (and pleasure of the most exquisite kind) he ends us dissatisfied and empty, jaded to the idea of the fullness of life. He is encouraged on by the influence of Lord Henry, who gives advice such as: \\"The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it,\\" (21) and \\"sin is the only real color-element left in modern life\\" (31). Dorian is quickly influenced by Lord Henry's philosophy, aping to everyone else Lord Henry's views and words and acting out on them by plunging into the pits of hedonism.The portrait itself is a mirror of Dorian's soul. It was a \\"visible emblem of conscience\\" (96). As Lord Henry's pleasure seeking philosophy takes hold in Dorian's mind, he sees that \\"eternal youth, infinite passion, pleasures subtle and secret, wild joys and wilder sins - he was to have all of these things. The portrait was to bear the burden of his shame; that was all\\" (109). However, in with a horrible fascination, Dorian \\"grew more and more enamored of his own beauty, more and more interested in the corruption of his own soul\\" (131) for \\"what the worm was to the corpse, his sins would be to the painted image on the canvas. They would mar its beauty, and eat away its grace. They would defile it, and make it shameful. And yet the thing would still live on. It would be always alive\\" (122). Even though \\"the leprosies of sin were slowly eating the thing away\\" (161) the portrait held on to its life of decay, just as Dorian held on to pleasure, refusing to be cleansed and beautiful again until Dorian's death.Quotes:\\"She was free in her prison of passion\\" (65).\\"She tried to look picturesque, but only succeeded in being untidy\\" (49).\\"There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about\\" (4).\\"Discord is to be forced to be in harmony with others. One's own life - that is the important thing\\" (82).\\"And how horribly real ugliness made things!\\" (128)"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"This book is the most decadent of all the English works in the canon of literature, I think.

As curiosity got the best of me, I finally looked this person up on the Internet. Finding that Dorian Gray was the main character of a most elaborate and interesting tale, enthralled me. Therefore, I set out to read this novel. From the preface alone, I was spellbound and couldn't put the book down.Lord Henry, with his quips and one-liners literally made me think twice. His tranquil ability to convince anyone of anything, sans Basil Hallward, amazed me. Although, I did find a few opinions of Lord Henry to ring true, for the most part I found myself thinking: \\"He's absolutely correct. Oh, wait! That's completely immoral and self-indulgent!\\" Needless to say, Lord Henry was my favorite character in the book.This book truly puts one's own life into perspective. It makes one think, and re-think of the importance of being true to only oneself without influence of others. As Lord Henry said it best: \\"Because to influence a person is to give him one's own soul. He does not think his natural thoughts, or burn with his natural passions. His virtues are not real to him. His sins, if there are such things as sins, are borrowed. He becomes an echo of some one else's music, an actor of a part that has not been written for him. The aim of life is self-development.

It is over one hundred years old, but has aged gracefully and is still easily understood and as relevant to matters of life now as it was when it was first published. Though there have been many imitations of it and many film depictions of it, none of them do justice to the real thing. This timeless classic follows the development of a teenager, Dorian Gray, into manhood as the people that he calls his friends corrupt his soul. This is symbolized in a portrait that Gray hides, which was painted by the man who was perhaps his only good-hearted friend, Basil, who later met his untimely demise. Along with the exceptional plot and surprising twist at the end comes the message that Oscar Wilde cunningly imparts to the reader: One must be master of oneself because outside influences often disfigure one down to the deepest part of their soul. On top of all this, the book is also simply well written and entertaining. It is enjoyable because Wilde uses his mastery of everything from satire to suspense to convey his message and an extraordinarily compelling plot to the reader. You should read this book if you are looking for new knowledge, literature with a deep message, or simply a good time. This edition is especially helpful because it has a glossary for the meanings of some older words and supplementary reading written by Oscar Wilde."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"One of my favorite books. I've read it again and again. Just make sure you don't get an abridged version. Read the whole thing."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Oscar Wilde is a witty and brilliant writer, and his only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray, is a treasure. One of it's best aspects is something another reviewer mislabeled as a flaw, that every viewpoint presented by Wilde is contradicted in another part of the book. This is absolutely brilliant. By building an entire book out of contradictions, the reader can take absolutely any message they want from the book, or no message at all. It meet Wilde's goal (if indeed anything Wilde said can be taken seriously - remember that the paradoxical Henry Wotton is basically a fictional version of Wilde) of \\"art for art's sake,\\" but it can just as easily be a morality tale for anyone that wants one. Henry Wotton can either be the worst kind of villain or a quite harmless and likeable chap who a dumb kid took too seriously.So read this book for it's witty and memorable dialogue, mostly from Henry Wotton. Read it for the shocking (at least at the time) tale of Dorian Gray. Read it for the myriad meanings you can take from it. Just don't skip it because it doesn't have one, consistent message. Anyone can write a message. It takes a genius to write a collection of messages that perfectly balance and disprove one another."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Of all the fears that creep into a man's heart,the most disturbing is the fear of one's own self. A man may evade the whole world but can't deny his conscience and as William Shakespeare remarks somewhere,\\"Conscience doth make coward of us all\\". One may accomlish painting goodliness on one's visage but would never be able to blend his soul in a similar fashion. The whispers of the soul about one's past sins and misdeeds keep lingering in one's heart.And that's precisely the theme of Oscar Wilde's only novel \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\". It is a telling tale about a stunningly handsome,almost beautiful,man's bizzare idiosyncracy of authoring his own tragic doom,about how a youth so splendidly bestowed with beauty,wealth,royalty and women could get sucked in by the myriad forces that he himself gave rise to,about a man's confused,complex frame of mind.Dorian Gray is that ultimate effigy of an ideal youth gifted with all arts and talents. He's the instinctive and eternal source of inspiration,\\"simply a motive in art\\" to his friend,artist Basil Hallward. The backdrop is the gentry and the royalty class of London during the late 19th. century and the Irish writer's genius lies in exploiting this landscape to picture in words and absolutely ethereal imageries man's obscure desires. Dorian becomes obsessed with his portrait traced by Basil and in the general flow of the tyde,conceives an unimaginable notion:to remain forever young whilst the portrait may wither! Indeed such a wish lurks deep inside everyone and so does the realisation o its fruitlessness. But for once,at least in fiction,the fantasy is translated into truth,a dark,troublesome truth.Evey novel,and for that matter every incident,requires a certain spark to unfold a series of actions to conglomerate into a rare item called literature. That urge in \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is impelled by Lord Henry Wotton, a cynical and witty man just ten years older than Dorian,whose eloquent gush of words \\"touched some secret chord\\" in Dorian's heart and sets it \\"vibrating and throbbing to curious impulses\\". The philosophies and crisp remarks by Lord Wotton about life in general and youth in particular push the youth onto his demise.Supernaturally Doian Gray's desire to remain young for good does manufacture itself into a fascinating reality but there's nothing called free lunch under the sun. Commencing from the time when Dorian turns an implicit murderer of his lover Sibyl Vane through the constant denudation of principles and character in the subsequent fourty or so years culminating in him murdering his friend Basil,Dorian stays protected under the shade of evergreen youth whilst his portrait consistently deteriorates and ages---it even turns a mirror of Dorian's own soul with dark contours signifying the crimes committed by him lining its entire figure and in his attempt to relieve himself of the picture,and with it his hideous sins,the eponymous potagonist brings about his own end.The theme of \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is singled out to be about how we get disturbed by our own souls but there're other ideas webbed in as well. That the author Oscar Wilde had an inclination towards gay culture is of course a subtle truth and this is ever so slightly pictured in Basil Hallward's unassuming and suspicious admiration of Dorian. The general occurrences in the gentry society and invokation to women's feelings too are colossaly and humourously penned down superadded by a streak of confusing and often conflicting ideas of life that never falter.There was never really a Faust who sold his soul to the Devil but it was actually Goethe's authorical magic that made it seem so. There was never really a Dorian Gray who exchanged peace for youth but it's actually Oscar Wilde's staunch belief that \\"it is the spectator,and not life,that art really mirrors\\" that materialiases into a concrete portrayal of life in fiction. After reading Emile Bronte's \\"Wuthering Heights\\",we rue that the authoress never composed any other novel and similarly after imbibing the charisma of \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\",which just remains on the margins of a psychological insight into a man's nature,we regret that we can't lay our hands on another classic by this wonderful,wonderful writer."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Almost from the day that this novel was first published in serial form it has caused controversy and debate. It was immediately condemned as an immoral work that did not follow the custom of showing that evil deeds would in the end bring punishment to the evil doer. Just those evil deeds, which were acted out by Dorian Gray, were enough in themselves to scandalize Victorian society. Then, just as his novel was about to be published in book form Oscar Wilde added fuel to the fire by adding a preface that seemed to indicate that there was absolutely no hidden meaning or moral lesson to be found in this book. Apparently, according to the preface, it was simply art for the sake of art. The fires have raged ever since and I'm sure that the author's spirit has enjoyed every second of it.The fact is that the reader can read almost anything he wants to into this work and there have been almost as many interpretations as there have been readers. I found myself intrigued by a passage that is spoken very early in the book by the artist who has painted the now famous picture. This painter, Basil Hallward by name, tells a friend that, \\"every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not the sitter. The sitter is merely the accident, the occasion. It is not he who is revealed by the painter; it is rather the painter who, on the colored canvas, reveals himself.\\" Just what might this book have revealed about Oscar Wilde? Or could this book have been a dark commentary on London's high society of which Wilde does not paint a pretty picture? Maybe this book was indeed as written Wilde wrote in his preface and he had no deep purpose but just wanted to tell a good story. Better minds than mine have pondered this question and have arrived at no conclusive answer to the problem. I have however learned one important thing about this book as I have read it. That being that if one reads this book without worrying about it's implications they will find it a very enjoyable read.Dorian Gray is first introduced to the reader as a young man who was exquisitely handsome and wealthy but he had had a rough childhood. The thing he remembers most about the Grandfather who raised him in such a harsh manner was that he was old. This may well have played into what became of the young man although he would almost certainly not have sank to such depths of depravity had he not met Lord Henry Wotton. For the life of me I can not fathom what Dorian Gray saw in Lord Henry for he comes across as a loathsome, self-centered, tiresome know it all. Gray however becomes enamored of Wotton however and slowly adopts Wotton's theories of pleasing oneself no matter the consequences to others.The real change begins in Gray after an act of particular curliness for which he is already feeling sorry when he arrives home. It is not long until he notices a change in his recently finished portrait, a portrait that was in the beginning as handsome as Gray but suddenly was marred by a cruel mouth. Gray couldn't believe his eyes but suddenly it dawns on him that this picture will bear the scars of his sins and of the passing years. He himself will remain forever young and beautiful no matter how he conducts his life. As I mentioned above, some critics bemoaned the lack of punishment for Gray's acts but I found that there were indeed consequences for his actions. By the end of the book, Gray has become almost mad from the knowledge of his sins and actually seems to long for death. The very picture that has given him eternal youth haunts his every thought for he knows that the picture shows the wretched condition of his soul. That is about all that I believe I can say without giving away the ending and I hate people who do that.Overall I enjoyed this book but Wilde's characters were given to long tedious philosophical pronouncements that only added to my detestation of these pompous blow hards. I can't say that I would rank this book among the all time classics and much of the time the reader will not be able to locate a plot with a team of bloodhounds. Still, if you can get through the dry areas there is often a rich oasis waiting on the other side."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Wilde's only novel contains some of the greatest dialogue of any literature written in the english language. There are few books that could be considered more quotable, and even fewer that could be considered more insightful. The novel is enjoyable even upon a cursory reading, but its splendor is revealed only when it is studied. Wilde reveals so much of himself in his art, and through reading of Wilde's biographies, plays, and the literature that inspired him, the reader becomes intimate with Oscar, and is able to understand him more throughly than most authors would allow from a study of their work. This is a piece I have truly enjoyed, and continues to be one of the premier pieces of English literature."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"This book, which I read quite some time ago but will never cease to love, is a beautiful horror story. The language, the surroundings, even the characters, are gorgeous, but at the same time, everything about them is frightening, and even a little grotesque. Lord Henry is utterly cynical, continually saying things one can never be quite sure he means or is only saying. Dorian is corrupted and horrible, and yet at the same time, one almost thinks he may suddenly stop and try to turn back. Basil is one of the only pure characters in the book, and his devotion to Dorian is sweet, but at the same time, one just /knows/ it will will cause something bad to happen to him--as, ultimately, it does.This book is a very satisfying read, although some people might be disturbed by the content, which is rather mature. Besides that, the homosexual subtext runs rampant waving a Dorian's picture. This may bother some people, although not yours truly. :)Personally, I think it's excellent. If you liked Victor Hugo's style, but would rather not hear historic digressions; if you liked Crime and Punishment's moral conflicts, but were highly irritated by the happy ending; if you enjoyed The Invisible Man's supernatural circumstances but would have been satisfied without the scientific explanations, then go forth ye and read Picture of Dorian Gray. (...)"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Oscar Wilde's 'The Picture of Dorian Gray' is an exceptional novel. Through this novel Mr. Wilde presents many characteristics of the human heart and mind. It hits hard telling the truth of the way in which people really are. Mr. Wilde in his novel asks the question how far would one go to obtain beauty and youth forever to please society? And in doing so presents the desires of most humans to remain young forever and the lengths in which they might go to obtain it. This novel illustrates the obession society has with the outward appearance rather than the inward and is shown in the novel by the Dorian Gray being accepted into the 'circle' despite the 'rumors' that he is a bad man. Through Dorian Gray and Lord Henry Mr. Wilde also illustrates the influence of people over people. Resulting in the destruction of character.I enjoyed the book Dorian Gray because of the fact that it does tell the truth and quite often people don't like to hear the truth, but Oscar Wilde went against what society would view as good and did and wrote what he believed, which makes an wonderful novel."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"I decided to be the FIRST to review this one here. Haha, go me.Picture of Dorian Gray is a great work of fiction. Its interplay of Hellenic thought and Judaeo-Christian ethics was light years ahead of its time, even though it might come across muddled to the casual reader. Perhaps, this novel was too far ahead of its time, as it was eventually used as evidence against Wilde in two court cases for 'gross indecency' in 1895.It is a simple story; really, Basil Hallward paints a lovely portrait of Dorian Gray, a veritable Adonis. As the Painter puts the finishing touches upon this portrait, Gray is involved with a conversation regarding the nature of beauty with Lord Henry (Harry) Wotton. This culminates in Dorian wishing and praying that his beauty may never diminish; that he'd have eternal youth. Ultimately, the painting would bear all of the marks of sin, decadence, and decay that cause our physical bodies to age, while Dorian kept his stunning good looks. Wilde brings about a rather wonderful conclusion, and it is a very enjoyable story.The Picture of Dorian Gray has its dull parts. It doesn't remain current, and I'd suggest getting a copy with notes, so that you may be able to keep up with all of the references. Let's be honest, in 2004 who really cares about what was fashionable in 19th century France? These are questions the notes can clarify, and make some of the references more amiable. Still there are parts where Wilde just lists things, and these you should skip.When reading this novel, I think it becomes clear that the three main personalities are a reflection of society at that time. While Basil Hallward seemed to personify Christian conservatism, and a mundane attachment to the status quo, Lord Henry is the questioning romantic, a character that seems to argue everything yet prove nothing, and believe in even less. This makes him no less interesting, and I believe Wilde may have included him as a farce of some of his contemporaries, yet some of the best insights and quotes actually come from Lord Henry.Dorian is the romantic ideal of perfection. Though a horrible character that fears no consequences for his actions, he still remains perfection. I think that aristocratic England valued physical appearance, social wit, and worldliness more than an ethical life.Dorian Gray also typifies Wilde's affections for Hellenic culture. Dorian is the stereotypical Greek Tragic Hero. He has a flaw; his vanity; this flaw leads to his downfall; a life of sin; he realizes his flaw in the end, and tries to make amends, but it is too little too late. If you enjoy Shakespeare Allusions, you will enjoy this.I really liked The Picture of Dorian Gray, but I will not advise one way or the other whether you should read it or not. If you want something stimulating that will have an enormity of good quotes that will make your dominating intellect seem even more so to the untrained eye, then check it out. If you're looking for pulp go check out Tom Clancey or Danielle Steele."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Wilde gives a new definition to the good. Dorian Gray's problem, despite the fact all his sin is transmited to a painting, art reminds him of the good, and this reminding is enough to be in discord with himself. I don't feel, as some suggest, that Dorian regreted his wish of eternal youth and beauty, but the images of the painting, art itself, drove him crazy - his self doubt. The art showed his inauthentic life, how his feelings and actions were not in harmony. In De Profundis Wilde talks about Jesus' criticism of the Pharasee for studying, but not living what they know - they have no feeling for life, they are souless driviling intellects. Dorian\`s cognizance of his own inauthentic soulless profanatory abject self did him in, he died killing the reminder of his splintered self, and of the frustrations of being an aesthetically induced schizopherenic. Wotton's warning was that conscience makes egoists of us all. Is it the dualistic nature of conscience that drives Dorian to kill himself, not regret? In the end he desires to do good, but is it? Can he? Is he? Wilde, the master of Paradox, leaves some poignant questions, if not eschatological questions, availab.le to be thought upon. Wilde is highlighting the importance of art as truth and art as a mirror, but in the end who is the mirror? Art makes reality, as far as reality is a truth anyway, a perception of truth and reality that is more meaningful than these nonexistant abstracts. But then there is sin to ponder on, is it real? Wilde would say so."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"After reading Dorian Gray, it took numerous books to accept that not all authors can have the genius and prose gifted to Wilde. Dorian's journey of making his life an art, exploring issues such as hedonism, sin, conceit, deceit and youth is an unforgettable one, and this book has lingered on in my mind since I first read it, and I think will continue to do so forever. The best book I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Over 100 years later and still a very popular book, this speaks for itself.

I revisit it every few years.

His reccomendation was so promising that I was eager to get this book. After about a week I was in a bookshop and I saw this book, immediatly I had to buy it, and it was so cheap.I've read it in a week or so, and after I finished it, I opened the first page and began reading again - thats how marvelous this book is. The dialogues are so thrilling and full of witty but thought provoking aphorisms, especially from Lord Henry (one of the characters). For example: \\"I am too fond of reading books to care to write them.\\",\\"Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing.\\" ,\\"Humanity takes itself too seriously. It is the world's original sin. If the cave-man had known how to laugh, History would have been different.\\"Wilde writes so naturally, with no stifness and with so much humour!I won't go into the subject matter because you can get that anywhere on google. But I will tell you that this novel made me a fan of Wilde and also made me read more of his work!Next week I plan on getting his plays (also from Oxford World's Classics, because they put so much to provide you with a good introduction, chronology and resources about the book, and the format is beautiful and easy too read).It's not hard cover, but I like it better as a paperback, it is not thick and you can take it anywhere with you, and its cover and design is unique."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"It deals with a commonly met theme in literature, the wish of men to stay forever young.

Skipped the tedious descriptions of Dorian's collections. Ugh. I just couldn't bring myself to care about the diversion."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"A great book, with many interesting ideas to mull over and written in beautiful English. It is a relatively short read, but it is one of those books that is so packed that it definitely demands multiple read-throughs.

Sometimes, it was a little dry or pretentious, but it was overall pretty good."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"As I am used to reading silly books and graphic novels, this was quite a read indeed. There seems to be an omission of detail, leaving one to imagine what terrors the protagonist commits that leads to the life he takes in."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"The themes contained in this rather short novel are extraordinary. That should be motive for reading through the entire book because one needs to get to the end in order to appreciate and understand the themes. It is a bit dry for a couple chapters in the middle of the book in my opinion, but it is not enough to seriously mar the book itself."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"I was tempted to take off a star for the way the second half of the book tales off and becomes so concerned with Dorian Gray's decadence. However, it's a classic, even if parts of the book are disappointing. Nevertheless, the beauty of the prose and the depth of Wilde's words are such that one can't fault the author for not living up to the standards he set for himself. If you're an astute reader and care to analyze the text, the points made by Wilde can change your life and why this book is a must read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"The book reminds me of other great stories--Faust, Dr. Jeckell and Mr. Hyde, Macbeth--where the main character's corrupt longings become his or her undoing. Dorian Gray searched for immortality through immorality and discovered that it fails to deliver.Wilde presents biblical passages on occasion--usually scornfully--the last of which serves as an apt summary for the whole book. Lord Henry asked Dorian, \\"What does it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul?\\" (Mark 8:36). A rhetorical question that pricked Dorian's conscience.I think if we're honest, none of us can bear to stare at our own portrait. We either try to cover it or knife it--anything but face it! In that sense, the portrait is a mirror. But the picture frame is also a window. It reveals the reality of any life that seeks to gain the world through a compromise of character.Basil's dying words are worth repeating: \\"It is never too late, Dorian. Let us kneel down and see if we cannot remember a prayer.\\""},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"I knew what this story was about long before finally reading it. That's probably common. The famous premise is a fascinating one, though I found myself wondering if the narrative would have been even more impactful if written as a short story or novella length rather than stretched out to a full novel. The Lord Henry character who serves the purpose of putting bad ideas in Dorian's head gives multiple speeches throughout detailing his hedonistic world view. If the number or word count of these lectures was cut in half I don't think the story would suffer much from the absence. Another decision made by Oscar Wilde was not to show readers very much of Dorian's behavior. His first act of cruelty is laid out before us as is his final one, but in between we are only told that his bad reputation precedes him without being shown what he has done to earn it. It's left to our imagination. A few more scenes exhibiting decadent behavior rather than various dinner party conversations in which a pro decadence philsophy is expressed would have made for a juicier read. Would it have made for a better read? That's arguable, as perhaps it also is whether this book is intententially homoerotic or simply written during a time when heterosexual men were much more comfortable going on and on about how good looking a guy was. What's beyond debate is that Oscar Wilde came up with a great idea to build a story around, one that is as timeless as the desire for eternal youth."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY is a very dark tale of vanity, debauchery, drug use, murder and depression. When a nave and stunningly handsome young man unknowingly trades soul for eternal youth and beauty with a wish caught by the devils ear, he inevitably finds that physical perfection, charm and pleasures of the flesh are worth not at the cost of ones soul.Is this classic an enjoyable read?... that's a tough one to answer for such a ominous story , but I will say it's an interesting one that holds some entertaining characters and introduces many thought provoking ideas. Obviously THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY is far from the best piece of literature I've ever experienced, but for me it was worth the short time it took to read, if for nothing else but for the appreciation of Oscar Wilde's famed wit."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"The digital version (free) is quite good.

I only noticed a few typos, barely enough to interrupt the read (and comparable in number and nature to a physical book)."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"I must have read this book several times through out my lifetime and it never gets old. I saw the movie and decided to read it again and it never failed to entertain"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is my first Oscar Wilde book, and I finished the book very happy that I had read it. Dorian Gray is a young man, who has an incredible presence, due to his innocence and uncorrupted state of mind. We are introduced to him through painter Basil Howard, who is inspired by the young man. His acquaintance, Lord Henry Wotton, wants to meet the beautiful young man, and that is how Dorian Gray's demise begins.Everyone probably knows the premise of the book. Where this beautiful young man has a painting that ages, while the Dorian Gray never goes through the aging process that everyone around him inevitably goes through. The portrayal of how one changes over the course of a lifetime is seen through the life of Dorian Gray, as well as the portrait, which becomes more hideous over time.I did not give this book five stars, because I was disappointed in the character development of Dorian Gray. I feel that Lord Henry (Harry) was fully developed through his \\"musings\\" which are common throughout the book, yet the book's namesake sometimes seems to disappears into the background.The Kindle version seems to be complete (at least to someone who has never read the book before). A classic that definitely deserves to be read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Oscar Wilde had a wonderful talent of being able to totally take the reader into whatever story he happened to be telling. In this tale of sin and tragedy, one can feel the fog wrapping around them, the cramped and dark opium dens, and the longing in the heart of Mr. Dorian Gray.If you are in the mood for a work of art that will capture your emotions and drag them along for a ride filled with 'shadows and early doom' (as Bob Dylan might say), this is the book for you. At its end it will leave you sitting staggered, feeling like you have been to the depths of a human soul and back again."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"I first read The Picture of Dorian Gray in my senior year of High School. I was pretty sure I would hate it, because I've been forced to read all manner of \\"classic\\" books that were just ho hum dreary.However, Wilde did an amazing job! I just think its sad that he got such harsh reviews in his time. The book is full of mystery, and asks a question that is still valid in today's society. \\"What are you willing to sell for eternal beauty?\\"So, ask yourself that as you read this book. How far will you go for beauty?(The reviewer was compensated for posting this review. However, the opinion stated in the review is that of the reviewer and the reviewer alone. Further, the reviewer independently selected this product to review and has no affiliation with the product maker/distributor, Amazon or the review requester.)"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"My feelings about this book are nicely summed up by Dorian Gray's description of a hedonistic book he has received from Lord Henry Wotton: \\"I didn't say I liked it...I said it fascinated me. There is a great difference.\\"The basic plot of the story is well known: thanks to mysterious/magical intervention the physical consequences of Dorian's action affect his portrait rather than his physical body. Urged on by Lord Henry Wotton (whose shocking/amusing/wicked epigrams are classic Oscar Wilde), Dorian descends into a life of ever-increasing debauchery, manipulation, hedonism, and the love of beauty above all else.Wilde brings up a number of themes in sometimes dizzying succession: the ability to \\"dominate\\" others, beauty as the supreme virtue, self-actualization as the guide to morality, yielding to temptation as a means of getting beyond temptation, physical consequences vs. consequences in general, the fascination of wickedness, etc. It is often unclear where Wilde stands on these matters since their proponent is Wotton who is \\"wicked\\" and the cause of much suffering, but speaks in the manner of Oscar Wilde. The moral ambiguity of the story lets the reader draw their own conclusions...fascinating."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Basil, who up until now was a mediocre painter after meeting Dorian Gray a young Adonis, was inspired to create a masterpiece of which he puts himself into. Against Basil's wishes, Dorian Gray is influenced by Basil's friend Lord Henry. Dorian looks at his portrait and realizes that while the portrait will stay young forever, he will grow old; so Dorian makes a wish that if only he could stay young forever and the portrait can age.At first Dorian does not realize his wishes been granted. He falls in love with a beautiful young actress who is every woman that Shakespeare ever wrote about. But once again due to Lord Henry's influence, he realizes that she's just a common girl.Starting with absent-minded acts Dorian slowly sinks into debauchery. And with every new act his picture becomes more grotesque while Dorian stays is young and as innocent looking as the day his picture was painted.What will become of Dorian?What will become of Dorian's painting?What would you do if you were Dorian?Oscar Wilde paints a picture himself as he describes Dorian Gray's dilemma. And we as readers travel with Dorian as each decision is made. In some places in the story Oscar Wilde seems to drag on and on with detail; however we find that this detail is necessary to set the next scene.Oscar Wilde himself led a risky life that lead to a jail sentence; is attitudes can be seen in the dialogues in this book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Part humorous fable, part mystery, part gothic suspense, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is another example of the late 1800s fascination with the soul, the senses, and science.Dorian Gray is a mere teen when the story begins, the muse of a local gifted artist, who paints Dorian's portrait in hopes of capturing his youth and beauty. Dorian's charm is also appreciated by Lord Henry, a rascally fellow, able to twist phrases and morals with his sly tongue. His winsome ways captivate Dorian, but Dorian soon finds himself pulled in the direction of a beautiful actress as well. These two loves tear Dorian in different directions, resulting in unexpected turns of events that send him down a road of sin and pleasure, though never with the rewards of true happiness. As his actions lead to even more drastic results, he finds himself fearing every shadow and questioning his own sanity.These events do not occur in a vacuum. With Dorian's sliding moral state, the portrait of his beauty begins reflecting the dark decay in his soul. Even as his own face refuses to age or show corruption, the painting becomes uglier by the day. Dorian is both fascinated and appalled by this. When, at last, he faces the consequences of his own selfish choices, he makes one final decision to try to destroy the evidence.I laughed aloud at many parts, particularly early in the book, then found the tone growing eerie and black. What a thought-provoking book! And one that kept my attention throughout. This is no glossed-over portrait of Mr. Gray, but a grisly depiction of evil--even when it masquerades in a cloak of civility.Oscar Wilde joined other writers of his day--H.G. Wells, Robert Louis Stevenson, and Joseph Conrad--in wrestling with concepts of the soul and the senses in the light of scientific discoveries. What about the conscience? Where did theology and psychology fit in? What about free will? In the last few pages, Wilde paints his own sobering portrait of a man who has tried to live as though the soul and senses have no effect on each other.This now ranks as one of my favorite classic novels. The results of Dorian Gray's experiment serve as a mirror for all those who consider themselves holy, heathen, or hypocrite."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is another one of those classics that I'd heard mentioned in passing or read about but never actually sat down to read. It's short, only 200ish pages long - but don't let the short length of it deceive you, it packs a fairly powerful punch.The premise fascinated me from the moment I read it. Innocent young man who manages to remain that way on the outside, but a portrait of him changes to reflect the corruption of his soul. Fascinating, no?I'm positive that this book has been dissected and analyzed from all sorts of different points of view, so let me tell you what I got out of it.I felt the tragedy, deeply. The corruption of a soul is something that is unpleasant to read, unpleasant to see and seeing the effect it has on others is difficult to deal with at times.It's interesting because I read this novel while I am still continuing to work my way through George Eliot's Middlemarch. Whereas I am having such a difficult time relating to and feeling emotions from Eliot's characters, there was such a wealth of emotion being poured out of Wilde's it was almost overwhelming. I felt the passion of love and the despair when it was lost.By the way dialogue was incredible, it makes the book, honestly. I highly recommend this book to anyone who hasn't read it. And if you haven't read it in a while, go back and read it now. It's going on my \\"yearly re-read\\" shelf for certain."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Like many of the other reviewers, I've always known the basic premise but never actually read The Picture of Dorian Gray. Also like many here, I couldn't resist the free version after reading the reviews. The story is original (though of course well told after over a hundred years of publication) and the writing is eloquent and witty. I agree that the chapter about Dorian's exploits and collections did drag on a little but it acted as a segue from youth to middle age and was kind of necessary to show how the years were passed. Otherwise, the entire work was very engaging. I highly recommend reading this book!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"I have heard a lot about this book and, having read a few of Oscar Wilde's plays and enjoyed them, decided to give it a try. Overall is was a good book, if a bit inconsistent in pacing at times.Dorian Grey is a beautiful young man, who is corrupted by a Lord to worry about how his looks might one day fade. While a portrait of him is being painted he wishes to never grow old. Later he realizes that the portrait is changing to reflect any cruelty in his nature, yet he remains the same.Oscar Wilde is a genius at writing. The cleverness of the language he uses and the sharpness of the commentary on society is deftly done and makes the story a joy to read, most of the time. The footnotes in this version of the book help to explain some of the more subtle jokes that I would have missed without them.The book does have some flaws, especially when compared to modern literature. Wilde takes nearly half to book to set up his characters. You can tell Wilde is a playwright at heart because many of the characters wander off into multiple page long dialogues that get to be a bit too much and sometimes a bit boring. Even in the second half of the book there are times where Dorian is reading from the book he is obsessed with and it just goes on and on and on.The second half of the book is by far the strongest. Wilde stimulates the imagination by talking about Dorian's unspeakable acts but never revealing what the majority of the horrible acts are. I was a little disappointed that there isn't a lot more to the plot than what you read on the back of the book. That being said, the end of the book is remarkable and really made the book a wonder to me.Overall this is a very interesting book and worth the read. Some of the lengthy dialogues can get a bit trying to read through, but most of the book has a quick wit to it that is amusing. The ending of the book holds some wonderful surprises. I would recommend reading this, especially if you are a fan of Wilde's writing style."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Oscar Wilde (1856-1900) is best known today for his witticisms and classic plays such as \\"Lady Windemere's Fan\\" and \\"The Importance of Being Ernest.\\" However, Wilde also wrote short stories, poems and in \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" a short but fascinating novel.The tale is a retelling of the Germanic legend of Doctor Faust. Young Dorian Gray is influenced by the evil Mephisto figure Henry Wotton to make a pact with the forces of evil. Gray will not age despite a career of debauchery, decadence, opium usage and murder. However, the portrait of him by the artist Basil Hallward will age as Gray descends into an inferno of crime.The Marguerite love interest from the Faust legend is young Sybil Vane. Sybil is a \\"vain\\" callow actress who portraits the great Shakesperean female roles such as Rosalind, Juliet and others every night on the stage of a seedy London theatre. Gray marries her but she commits suicide since the girl realizes he fell in love with the stage heroines and not herself. Sybil's brother the sailor Jack Vane will return from sea to seek out vengeance against Dorian Gray. He will be unsuccessful being shot during a hunting accident on a wealthy estate at which Gray is spending a weekend. Basil Hallward is the young artist who will be murdered by Gray who is driven mad by the haunting picture of himself. The novel ends in a way never to be forgotten by the reader.Oscar Wilde published this short novel in 1890. In many ways it resembles the better book \\"Doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" published in 1886 by Robert Louis Stevenson. That earlier work, like Dorian Gray, also looks at a character with a divided self in conflict with the norms and morality of society.Wilde's book is filled with aphorisms most of which are delivered by the cynical Henry Wotton The author is good at painting a scene so we feel as if we ourselves were in the garden and drawing room of wealthy Dorian Gray's London home or seeking an opium den in the foggy slums of fin de siecle London.The Picture of Dorian Gray is one of the best selling classics in the Penguin Classics catalogue. It is a satisfying piece of fiction which will make you think on the nature of evil, the human mind and how role playing and mask wearing are part of everyday life."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"I have read this book many times, and enjoyed it more each time that I did. I have to admit that Lord Henry's wit and wisdom was what kept me coming back to the book, not the important and intellectual issues about art, life, temptations and all the literary matters. I know there are other reviews with the literary facts and theories presented there, better than I can, so I'm not going to try.All I will say is this is a classic, worth more than 5 stars, should be read by everyone at least once in your life, first for the great writing, if its your first time reading Wilde, this is a great book to start with. You should read it slowly, because Wilde is a word smith, no words for words sake, each one polished like the gems that they are. If one could speak like he wrote one would be like a god, or have a late night talk show better than all others.Second, this is a good, clear and complete edition, so now you have no excuses, read on MacDuff, and enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Wilde sees the world more clearly than any writer of fiction in the last century. It is for that reason that his work is so filled with countless paradoxes and contradictions that challenge the mind and titillate the senses. Wilde lived in an infinitely ironic age, when society had grown so influential as to crowd out the individuals that made it up. Today, we have taken for granted this incongruity and so our writers cannot express the kind of irony that Wilde mastered, despite the fact that we all know that something is amiss.\`The Picture of Dorian Gray' is filled with this irony.

It is for that reason that his work is so filled with countless paradoxes and contradictions that challenge the mind and titillate the senses. Wilde lived in an infinitely ironic age, when society had grown so influential as to crowd out the individuals that made it up. Today, we have taken for granted this incongruity and so our writers cannot express the kind of irony that Wilde mastered, despite the fact that we all know that something is amiss.\`The Picture of Dorian Gray' is filled with this irony. The plot shows us the ultimate irony of a man giving up his soul for the beauty of youth--the condition that is exalted in the modern age above all else, intellect, truth, justice, life itself. Interspersed are dialogues and epigrams that persist one hundred years later as some of the finest word handling ever recorded.

Although Oscar Wilde wastes much space with over-explanatory details, the moments in which he tells his story are moments of inspiration and causes of great self-examination. The story, in which a good-looking young man gains eternal beauty, really makes its reader look within themselves and find the person they are and who they want to be. Also, through some very good symbols, Wilde is able to make his reader find new meaning in the world around them and is able to open the reader's eyes to the magnificence--and ugliness--of life itself.Even though the book is mostly filled with simple dialogue and extended (and sometimes, unnecessary) descriptions, the overall effect the story itself can have upon the reader's mind is overpowering. Not only does Wilde's occasional complex dialogue add to the reader's understanding of the world, the ideals with which Wilde writes (and therefore gives his character) make the reader work to understand where they fall within the spectrum of day to day life.The book was slow moving at first, but really started to pick up, due to its author's ability to excite the reader's mind, with the first meeting between the main character and the man who he would eventually blame for all of his problems. I would definitely recommend this book to those who have an open mind (there are some controversial ideas and lifestyles within the story) and are able to follow a character's complex mindset because, although most of the book is simple and in some people's eyes, artless, it still provides the reader with multiple \\"out-of-the-box\\" type ideas.I enjoyed the book, and the message it sent was one that I will probably never forget. It is one that forces the reader to question what they value in life, make them question what a \\"perfect\\" life would be. Because of the story's ability to reach within the readers mind and plant a new outlook on life, the book would be a great read for anyone who is interested in hearing the story of a man who gave up everything in order to keep the only thing he believed to be important within the world, the thing that he himself feared losing the most."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"A classic noir fiction novel were the worship of material values related to physical beauty and immortality drive the ego of a young man belonging to the upper classes of the English society of the XIX century to a tragic fate after circumstances force him to confront his real self. His life takes a swift turn for the worse when he sees the awful expression of his rotten soul expressed on his own face painted in a portrait. Oscar Wilde wrote an essay intended to decry certain paramount values acclaimed by western societies. It features rich pieces of wisdom and underlying messages. Great ending"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"I enjoyed this public domain book very much in that the story line held my interest and was full of interesting observations of human nature which are as relevant now as they must have been when the book was published."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Oscar Wilde is phenomenal at taking your mind and all its components, rearranging them and laying them back out in an entirely different order. There's a lot to be learned from Dorian Gray, I promise he's well worth your time."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"I decided to re-read Dorian Gray for an upcoming book club discussion but I knew that I wanted to read the annotated edition because I cannot resist special editions--books, films, and music-- with all the accompanying special features. I had not realized the extent to which Wilde's original version differed from the final published edition. This edition gives me everything I would ever want to know about Dorian Gray, including not only everything he wrote that was edited out later but extensive footnotes, illustrations, photographs and paintings of innumerable peripheral points of interest.The Picture of Dorian Gray bears similarities in my mind with other notable philosophical metaphysical fantasies of the nineteenth century--Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Robert Louis Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and one less well-known than those others but perhaps an even more direct influence on Wilde--Balzac's Le Peau de Chagrin, or The Magic Skin. In that novel, a man purchases a magic wild ass's skin that is supposed to grant his every wish. He, of course, indulges in every kind of debauchery and decadent, hedonistic activity he can imagine and discovers that the skin magically shrinks and his life span is correspondingly shortened with every wish fulfilled.All of these novels were published before Wilde wrote his philosophical fantasy and they all influenced him, along with other tales of magic portraits by Hawthorne, Poe and Gogol. Wilde used the device in a particularly unique way. The portrait is kept in a locked room in an attic as any reminder or repository of our darkest impulses would be, in a back chamber of the subconscious. In the final published version of the novel, there are connotations of homosexuality and bisexuality among the characters of the impossibly handsome Dorian, the effete artist Basil Hallward and the caustic, witty, married (and bisexual) Lord Henry Wotton. Each of these characters depict aspects of Wilde himself, with Lord Henry being the primary expounder of Wildean bon mots and witty aphorisms--\\"There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about,\\" \\"the only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it,\\" etc.In the original, uncensored version one can easily see from our \`unsuppressed' 21st century perspective that Wilde is writing about characters that are gay or bisexual. Even though Wilde was writing between and through the lines about these matters of sexual identity, it wasn't subtle enough to not be used as evidence against him in his trial for \`gross indecency' a few years later.From the perspective of someone outside Wilde's era, the novel is a strange, nightmarish parable of sexuality, youth, immortality and moral conscience. Without the sexual components, the novel is a strange neutered fable and attempts to heterosexualize it, as in the famous 1945 film version, only produce strangely asexual men with nebulous fetishes.It is Wilde's only novel and it is a brave, noble attempt. Its weaknesses, of which Wilde was aware, stem from his experience writing for the theater. There are pages of dialogue that could have easily been lifted from a page of script in which not a line of descriptive narration appears. On the other hand, there is an entire chapter in which there is no character interaction whatsoever, no dialogue, merely an extensive, descriptive catalog of the cultural stimuli that contribute to Dorian's dissipation.Upon reflection, one wonders if Wilde would have felt the need to write this novel in a less sexually repressed era. In our current day there would be thousands of opportunities for objective purgings of the darker impulses to be manifested not only through painting but numerous other visual media. Wilde would be one of many gay authors. The novel cannot be separate from the time in which it was created, however, and in the England of 1890, The Picture of Dorian Gray was an extremely daring shot in the face of Victorian social and cultural customs."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"This book is full of memorable lines. The conversations exchanged are witty and poignant. Definitely worth a read. A good intro into Wilde.I feel it is relevant to young readers struggling to define themselves in a morally ambiguous world. The ideas are timeless and apply especially in today's time, where I feel the average young adult confronts these issues; whereas in Wilde's time, it was likely only relevant to the wealthy."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Oscar Wilde is one hell of an elegant writer. He focuses a lot on beauty in his writing, and it really shows. The Picture of Dorian Gray is about a narcissistic man, only to fall in love with a a beautiful painting done of himself. He says aloud that he wishes he could stay young and beautiful, like in his portrait, and lo and behold, his wish comes true. He never grows old, but the man in his portrait (himself) does instead. He hides the portrait in the attic (his dirty secret), because he doesn't want anyone to see him growing old in the picture, and the story pretty much goes from there. This book is poetic in its writing, has a lot of witty commentary, and is a must for Wilde fans. All in all, I gave this story 4 out of 5 stars, only because I enjoyed his play much better... The Importance of Being Earnest. Regardless, if not for the plot, read it for the experience in exceptional writing."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"This a well written unusual story with strong characters and definitely worth reading.

Interesting story as well, definitely worth the read. I recommend taking a spin through the book"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Believe it or not, I had not heard of The Picture of Dorian Gray until the movie League of Extraordinaty Gentleman came out. I know, crazy right. No, I havn't lived under a rock my whole life. I don't know how i missed it. Well, after seeing the movie I rented every movie of The Picture of Dorian Gray I could find and fell in love with the story. Then I read the book... and fell in love with the writing.Reading the first chapter is like being swathed in wonderful writing from head too toe. I felt completely surrounded by it. You can almost feel the warmth of the garden, hear the sounds of the birds and dragonflies, and smell the beauty of the flowers as you sit and listen to this conversation between Harry and Basil. The writing is an immersive experince. And Basil's description of his first encounter with Dorian and the feelings that Dorian stirs in him, sound almost... romantic. At the least there's definately a bromance going on. And we also see the first crack of Dorian's facade in this chapter, which Basil's decsription of how Dorian sometiems seems purposefully cruel to him. Isn't it interesting, the first chapter ends with Harry demanding to meet Dorian and dragging Basil into the house and we haven't even met Dorian yet ourselves.As I read the book it occured to me that it could also have been titled the Influence of Lord Henry Wotten, for Harry's (as he's called by his friends) opinions and influence are as central to the story as Dorian Gray himself and more of a factor than the portrait itself. Hardly a scene goes by that Harry, whether present or not, is not quoted as an authority. It was as if he was the potter and Dorian was the clay. Harry was fully aware of his influence, and Dorian... Dorian seemed to be racing from one sensation to another like a spoiled child.This was by far one of the best written, most interesting stories I have read. I will read it over and over and would recommend it to everyone.STATS:Nook Pages: 240Genere: ClassicRe-readability: Very High"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"I was curious about this book from another book I recently read. I first picked up the audiobook narrated by Edward Petherbridge (8 disks, BBC Audio, 1994/2010) from my Library, but I couldn't stand Edward's narration. He was terrible. He spoke really fast, then slow all of a sudden. He was british but it just was NOT working. It's was like Narrator ADD, and I just HAD to put the Audiobook down.Then I took out another AudioBook, narrated by Michael Page (7 disks, Brilliance Audio, 1995), and it was absolutely AMAZING!!! Michael does a wonderful job of keeping the pace and volume easy to follow and the words were British and clear. WOW!! Great job! I highly recommend Michael Page for all audio recordings.The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)Moving on to the story....It was great! It is definitely a Gothic classic. It is a story about a boy, Dorian Gray, who is beautiful beyond belief, but naive as well. He is first discovered by an artist, Basil and becomes the artist's muse. Basil paints the most wonderful, telling portraits, when Dorian sits for him. His work like never before. The artist has a friend, Henry, who is an absolute cynic. Henry thinks he is enlightened, but he is just a miserable existentialist mess! Dorian takes to Henry and they get close, thereby pulling Dorian away from Basil the artist.Henry is full of skepticism, and a deliberate, mean, philosophy on life that he expresses through twisted words and phrases. To Dorian, this is all new and he starts to look up to Henry, emulating him, and following his words. The Good, beautiful, kind, and chaste Dorian becomes a wicked, evil, manipulative, infamous character that everyone is afraid of. His good looks remain, through a portrait made by Basil.Just as Dorian is an inspiration for Basil's blank canvas, so is Henry an inspiration for Dorian's mind as a blank canvas.That is the story.But my summary won't really help you understand the book, you just have to read it.It's very interesting, and well written. I definitely find myself getting angry at some of the things said and done. I am repelled, I feel disgusted, I feel for the minor characters. I sympathize with Basil and I hate Henry. This book got me good.It is am absolutely one-of-a-kind novel I highly recommend you read.

While you are remaining curiously young and ageless to your friends and the world at large, your aging portrait hidden from all eyes is inspected by you alone as the years go by with some trepidation as the case may be, and as time marches on. Not only is your true appearance accurately portrayed in the picture, showing your actual physical age, but revealing in great detail your personality along with your good deeds and misdemeanors etched meticulously across the painting. When friends of mine sent word recently saying \\"Expect us to look younger since you saw us a decade ago!\\", I was quick to respond \\"I fully expect you to look your appropriate age, and far superior than when you were last here\\". Although this was meant as a note of humor on my part, the thought of Wilde's masterpiece came to mind immediately and the air around me was chilly for a moment. As for Dorian Gray when he attempts to alter and amend his portrait (which might be interpreted as his soul), I shall leave new readers to discover the results of such an enterprise for themselves. A powerful and magnificent novel by one of the greatest literary figures of all times."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"My first encounter with Mr. Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray has left me feeling my soul has been put under the microscope and I have been forced to look into those secret dark places that I keep hidden from the outside world.

I love this about Oscar Wilde's writing style. How deliciously dark and disturbing this book is. I am astonished it has taken me so long to read such a brilliant book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Set in the 1800's in the streets of London, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a haunting story of corruption brought unto Dorian Gray by the Lord Henry Wotton. Oscar Wilde explores the pleasures of life, beauty, and temptation through the character of Dorian who, one day realizes that his beauty will fade after Lord Henry's comments on Dorian's youth being captured perfectly: \\"Yes, there is nothing in the whole world I would not give! I would give my soul for that!\\" (Wilde 3). Dorian unknowingly offered his soul to the devil for his physical beauty in return, all his sins would be reflected in the painting.After his friend Basil, paints a masterpiece of Dorian, he tries to protect Dorian from Lord Henry's thinking and goals in life knowing where it would lead him. Although Hayward is only in the novel for a short time, his character inspired me to keep reading until the end where we can finally see how justice is served. Lord Henry Wotton, a friend of Basil Halyward, who grudgingly introduced him to Dorian. Lord Henry is the character you love to hate; he is such a perfect character, you can sense that something is wrong with him.The young and handsome Dorian Gray is the main protagonist who made me rethink my future and how I looked at life. Although very rich and in good social standing, he chooses to hang out in the slums of London in opium dens and around the docks, symbolizing his sins and where his values lie. The way Oscar Wilde characterizes Dorian gives a vivid and accurate picture of a good boy gone bad.The principal theme of this novel is that self-worship leads to self-destruction, this is one of the main themes that pulled me into reading this book. However, another theme that goes hand-in-hand with the previous one is living a double life. Many speculate Oscar Wilde used this as one of his themes because he was inspired by the story; The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde written by Robert Louis Stevenson.Although written over 120 years ago, this book is a must have and should be in every library across the world or on your shelf.

While the plays spark with wit and wisdom, with humour and satirical fun, Dorian Gray is of another class entirely. It is a serious look at the consequences of immorality, of vanity and greed and selfishness. And it does not flinch to paint the 'picture' in all of its gory details. It's contemporary today, as proved by a recent film adaptation (starring the drool-worthy Ben Barnes) which was quite accurately adapted from the book and is, to my mind, required reading.

Along with Dorian, I do wonder if he could have reversed it, if he had cared enough to try.

This book, which takes place in 19th-century England, signifies the high price one young man had to pay for eternal youth.Basil Hallward, a mediocre painter, became infatuated with an extremely hansom but innocent young man, Dorian Gray. It was Dorian's picturesque beauty which inspired Basil to paint his best picture ever. Overcome by the beauty of his youth, Dorian wished that he would ramain young forever and that the portrait would deteriorate with age. However, when Dorian realised that his wish had come true and the picture took on the effects of his sins, his lifestyle signifcantly altered. Dorian went from leading a normal aristocratic life, to living a secretive life full of sin and slander.This book is proof that one can not be happy with youth and beauty alone. The suffering of Dorian Gray shows us that there is more to life than mere beauty. Dorian's life was ruined by a simple wish to be forever young. Although no one can stay young forever, this novel is a key example of why one should not simply focus on base characteristics such as youth and beauty, for these things will always fade."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"This edition is slightly shorter than the others available, but it is the ONLY one whose text reflects Wilde's true intentions. Don't be fooled by the other editions claiming to be the \\"unabridged\\" or \\"complete\\" version. The material Wilde added later was meant to make the novel seem more morally edifying. It makes the novel worse. This one is WAY better -- and also way dirtier. A bunch of the more explicit stuff was cut by Wilde's editor. The editor of this ebook version has restored it all, based on Wilde's actual typescript, which he went and consulted in an archive. If you're a homophobe, get the other, more \\"moral\\" versions. If you want to read one of the great modern novels as the author wanted you to read it, get this one. You won't regret spending a couple of extra bucks."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Oscar Wilde's strange and intriguing mind is apparent in this book, which is full of interesting concepts and bizarre happenings. Dorian Gray, a young man who is obsessed with his own good looks, befriends an English Lord and a struggling painter. After Basil, the painter, finishes Dorian's portrait, they are stunned by its magnificence and how lifelike it appears. Seeing this, Dorian is angered when he realizes that the portrait will live forever and retain its beauty while he himself is left to age. Dorian decides to trade his soul for everlasting youth, and to always retain his beauty, just like the portrait.Since Dorian believes himself to be immortal, he dabbles into various sinful acts. He carelessly pursues a relationship with Sibyl Vane, an actress, constantly letting her down and breaking her heart. Dorian is involved in several mysterious deaths, and he even explores the London underground opium scene. Even though Dorian does all of these things, somehow he remains young, to the surprise of his peers. In the end, however, Dorian receives the punishment he deserves through a series of bizarre events. The &quot;what goes around comes around&quot; theme is strongly emphasized in the conclusion of the novel, which serves as a fitting end for Dorian's struggle with sin.This classic literary work is frequently exciting, but can sometimes delve into the monotony of 19th century British affairs (which may be a little tedious.) All in all, the novel is a wonderful concept which is given life by the genius of Oscar Wilde. It is a perfect research topic as well because it contains many themes which can be applied to anything from English rhetoric to the Original Sin. I myself wrote a term paper on the book and it was very easy to express my ideas because Wilde is so straight forward in his literary agendas.

I am glad that I bought it!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray is a thought-provoking novel that vacillates between ambling, seemingly directionless conversation and a riveting narrative thread that eventually bubbles up to the surface with the intensity of a volcanic eruption. The Picture of Dorian Gray, though not much more than a century old, has already been deemed a \\"classic\\" by literature-lovers, and after reading the book, I can understand its status. Wilde's command of the English language is almost unparalleled in recent literature.Warning - Spoilers FollowHere's the gist of the book. Dorian Gray is a young man whose physical appearance is handsome and innocent. An aspiring artist paints a beautiful portrait of Dorian. Dorian wishes that he always look like his youthful appearance in the portrait. The wish comes true. Dorian remains the same - youthful and charming, but the portrait begins to transform itself into the image of his soul.When Dorian embraces a life of hedonism, he uses his good looks and charm to obtain whatever he desires in life. His insensitivity drives a friend to suicide. The evil desires of his heart eventually cause him to murder a friend in cold blood. Over a period of twenty years, Dorian becomes a monster on the inside (reflected by the portrait of his soul) even as he remains youthful and innocent on the outside.Oscar Wilde's homosexuality is no secret, and the reader can easily discern certain homosexual overtones in the book (especially at the beginning). Perhaps Wilde's subtle innuendoes of homosexuality have made his works so appealing to lovers of literature who tend to sympathize and approve of homosexual behavior.Upon reading Dorian Gray, however, I could not help but notice how the lifestyle of hedonism is so implicitly condemned by the narrative's outcome. If Dorian's hedonism includes sexual relationships with men as well as with women (and Wilde does hint at this), then homosexuality comes under the same umbrella as the rest of Dorian's sinful passions. One can hardly characterize The Picture of Dorian Gray as a pro-homosexual book.Readers of this blog will find the picture of depravity in Dorian Gray to be intriguing. Throughout the story, Dorian, even in his hedonism, acts in a manner that forces the reader to desire justice and redemption. The book's end emphasizes the need for punishment and retribution - pointing at death as the wages of sin.What does the life of unbridled hedonism look like? What does it do to the soul? What happens to the human being who seeks to fulfill his every passion and desire? How does sin affect us physically? Do we age because we sin? These and more are the questions that Oscar Wilde raises in The Picture of Dorian Gray."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Oscar Wilde was one of the foremost representatives of Aestheticism, a movement based on the notion that art exists for no other purpose than its existence itself (\\"l'art pour l'art\\"), not for the purpose of social and moral enlightenment. Born in Dublin and a graduate of Oxford's Magdalen College, he initially worked primarily as a journalist, editor and lecturer, but gradually turned to writing and produced his most acclaimed works in the six-year span from 1890 to 1895, roughly coinciding with the period of his romantic involvement with Lord Alfred \\"Bosie\\" Douglas, sixteen years his junior. Douglas's strained relationship with his father, John Sholto Douglas, Marquees of Queensberry, eventually resulted in a series of confrontations between Wilde and the Marquees, which first led to a libel suit brought by Wilde against his lover's father (who had openly accused Wilde of \\"posing as a sodomite\\" and threatened to disown his son if he didn't give up his acquaintance with the writer) and subsequently to two criminal trials against Wilde for \\"gross indecencies,\\" based on a law generally interpreted to prohibit homosexual relationships. Sentenced to a two-year term of \\"hard labor\\" in Reading Gaol, Wilde emerged from prison in 1897 a spiritually, physically and financially broken man and, unable to continue living in England or Ireland, after three years' wanderings throughout Europe died in 1900 of cerebral meningitis, barely 46 years old.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\\" Wilde's only novel besides seven plays as well as several works of short fiction, poetry, nonfiction and two fairy tale collections originally written for his two sons, is critical to an understanding of Wilde's body of work and his personality primarily for two reasons: First, because it constitutes one of his earliest fully accomplished formulations of Aestheticism, and secondly because of its undeniable undercurrent of homoeroticism; an inclination which, after a six-year marriage widely thought to initially have been a true love match, Wilde had begun to explore more openly around the time of the novel's creation (1890). The story's title character is an exceptionally handsome young man who, both in the eyes of the artist tasked to paint his portrait, Basil Hallward, and in those of their somewhat older friend Lord Henry Wotton, epitomizes perfect beauty and is coveted by both men for that very reason. Seduced by hedonistic Lord Henry into believing that beauty can literally justify anything, including any act of immorality, Dorian sells his soul for maintaining his beautiful appearance, letting his portrait age in his stead. (In that, his character resembles Goethe's and Marlowe's Faust.) He then quickly turns from an innocent youth into a cruel and calculating man whom society, in its shallow adherence to appearances, nonetheless never associates with any of the results of his cruelty, never looking beyond the surface of his handsome exterior and assuming that a man so beautiful must necessarily also be good. Ultimately it is Dorian himself who brings about his own downfall when he is no longer able to face the manifestation of his evilness in Basil Hallward's picture.Upon its initial publication in Lippincott's Monthly Magazine in 1890, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was widely scorned as immoral by a public neither familiar with nor particularly open to the concepts of Aestheticism and its mockery of middle class morality, and repulsed by the thinly veiled homoerotic relationship of the novel's protagonists. Wilde republished the work the following year, adding a preface designed to explain his views on art. Yet, it was that preface which, along with several of his other publications and his written exchanges with Lord Alfred Douglas, ultimately would play a devastating role in his trials, where Queensberry's attorney would come to use an excerpt from that very preface - \\"There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written\\" - to extract from Wilde statements to the effect that any book inspiring a sense of beauty (including, as implied in the attorney's question, an \\"immoral\\" book, if \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" could be qualified as such) was well-written and therefore commendable; that only Philistines, brutes and illiterates - whose views on art he considered invariably stupid and for which he therefore didn't \\"care twopence\\" - could consider this novel \\"perverted,\\" and that the majority of the reading public would probably not be able to draw a proper distinction between a good and a bad book. It was testimony such as this, as well as the impending confrontation with a number of male witnesses ready to testify as to the nature of their relationship with Wilde, that not only caused the author's attorney to convince his client to drop the libel suit against Queensberry but also opened the door for Wilde's own subsequent prosecution.If \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" has a central theme besides the supremacy of beauty and the depiction of a society primarily interested in appearances, it is a call for individuality: Dorian's cruelty is brought out only after he allows himself to be influenced by Lord Henry's equally seductive and cynical hedonism; and similarly, Basil Hallward's blind idolizing of Dorian eventually proves fatal for the painter. - Wilde's only novel is one of the first and most poignant expressions of his own individualism; but unlike his protagonist, who ultimately pays a ghastly prize for selling his soul and giving up his individuality, Wilde paid as high a price for maintaining his. Like Dorian, he knew that \\"[e]ach of us has Heaven and Hell in him,\\" and although this novel's preface ends with the provocative statement that \\"[a]ll art is quite useless,\\" it was the very fact that Wilde put his entire being into his art that ultimately destroyed him. But like beauty, which is finally restored to perfection in Dorian Gray's portrait, Wilde's works have stood the test of time; and not merely for their countless, pricelessly witty epigrams. They're as well worth a read as ever.Also recommended:Complete Works of Oscar Wilde (Collins Classics)Oscar WildeWilde (Special Edition)The Oscar Wilde CollectionThe Picture of Dorian GrayThe Importance of Being Earnest - Criterion CollectionThe Importance of Being EarnestAn Ideal HusbandA Good Woman"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a classic novel about the consequences of eternal youth. Young Dorian Gray promised his soul in exchange for the favor of his body never aging. Instead, a portrait of him grows older in his place. An eerie idea, indeed.While the concept and story itself are extremely interesting it was not the best execution. As another reviewer pointed out, it's not the easiest read for a modern reader. While the passages did not confuse me they did occasionally bore me. I found the book hard to get into - and once I got into it I had a hard time keeping interest.I do not doubt Wilde's credibility as an author in the slightest I feel that, as a modern reader, this is a book that may not stand the test of time as well as others. An extremely interesting idea, but the book feel a bit short."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"This book was given to me as a gift. I didn't really intend on reading it, but after fumbling through the first chapter, I was intrigued and soon thereafter was captivated by it. This book has mixed themes that are gothic horror at one moment, amoral and corrupt the next, followed by social political statement. I have not read a book before that compares with this one and is indeed one of the best that I have read. This book is full of quotes and one liners that are striking, thought provoking, and even horrifying to the reader. The Picture of Dorian Gray is a great book to read and discuss with a friend or a book club."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"I'm a sophomore in high school and usually I don't go for these older, classic books. Usually they bore me so much I can barely finish them. However, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was an exception to this rule. Though the language was a bit more intricate than is commonly found in the books of today (at least the ones I like to read), I found it to be more elegant and eloquent than tiresome and confusing.This book, with all of its discussion of morals, evil, and purity really is a window into late 1800s of England. Despite this, I found the book to actually be interesting. The real appeal this book held for me was its wonderfully potent imagery and mildly creepy, definitely surreal theme. \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is also a very short book, which I thought was pretty cool because I don't have a very long attention span concerning books. In spite of how today's people are probably a great deal more jaded concerning morals, or rather the lack thereof, than the people of Oscar Wilde's time, a lot of this book was fascinating in an almost perverted way. That aspect is offset by the theme of good vs. evil, however. The only faults I found with this book were minor details concerning the definitions of good and evil, issues which I think this book was meant to rise anyway.If you're a parent or someone looking to buy a classic book for a friend or relative in high school, I think this would be a pretty good choice, assuming they like books. The vocabulary seemed fairly advanced to me, but they ought to be able to handle it. The conflict between \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\" in this book is engaging, and the nature of the book is such that the reader has difficulty simply viewing matters in black and white. This makes the book deeper and more interesting to read. The transformations that occur in this book are slightly haunting, and at the end of this twisting tale of corruption and beauty lies a powerful, sudden, and very awesome ending. I really think that everyone should read this book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"This book asks some interesting questions in stunning prose: the descriptions of places and events were vividly etched into my mind.

He asks the reader to ponder the unsymbiotic dichotomy of beauty and goodness. Can one possess both while maintaining a clear conscience?As for the irrepressible and intrepidly narcissistic Dorian Gray, \\"I admit that I think that it is better to be beautiful than to be good.\\" The Picture of Dorian Gray is a short work of literature that I read in one day. However, its brevity is due to Wilde's publisher purposefully omitting material at the time that was deemed vile and unprintable. This causes some holes in the story - references made to the many sins Dorian committed along the way to others were left unanswered upon finishing the book. More than a little frustrating. Having said that, I was pleasantly surprised with the Gothic, sordid, and dark themes that Wilde so aptly transcribes. Wilde amuses us with the copious amounts of witty quotable lines from Lord Henry such as, \\"The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.\\"I found myself writing down clever witticisms constantly as I read the book. A good read if for nothing else than the unsurpassed wit of Oscar Wilde."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"I usually try to go into English classes with a sense of optimism about the reading materials, and they're actually not usually bad. I find myself finishing almost every book ahead of schedule, and liking quite a few of them. So when I found out we'd be reading The Picture of Dorian Gray in junior year of High School, I started it with a positive mind. It was a famous classic after all! However, in this particular case, I was disappointed.The Picture of Dorian Gray is a novel with far too much unused potential. It's about the adventures of Dorian Gray, an upper class young adult living in the 1890's. Dorian acquires a magical portrait that diverts all physical traces of sin from him to his face in the portrait, allowing him to commit as much sin as he wants and remain looking youthful and innocent (i.e., after his insults drive his girlfriend Sybil to suicide, his portrait develops \\"a touch of cruelty in his mouth\\" [pg. 91] but his actual face remains the same). He gets advice from other characters about how he should live life, and after following his friend Lord Henry's way of life (outlined in a little yellow book that encourages Dorian to remain vain and shallow) and living hedonistically and selfishly for years and years, he finally realizes how \`ugly' his soul has become and launches an attempt at redemption. While it seems like there would be lots of action, I was disappointed at the lack of plot in general, and most of the book is actually rich people talking about human nature. Many of the book's lessons are taken from the obscure musings of Lord Henry, who acts as an outlet for Wilde's opinions, and while this is a decent way for Dorian to learn about life, I would much rather have read about him learning through experience as he traveled around doing something interesting. He could have been living a life of incalculable sin, and yet chooses to have sex and hang out in gardens smoking opium all day; not quite the worst decision ever, but not an exciting book.The lack of action isn't the only disappointing thing about the book. I constantly felt that Wilde was too busy sending messages to the audience to really give his characters life. Every dialogue read less like a real conversation and more like a (sometimes cryptic) scripted debate, and Wilde skips past something like twenty years' worth of Dorian Gray's character development (summarizing the slow corruption in one chapter). Other characters serve only to invoke development in Dorian, and no other characters show any significant development themselves, making the story just slightly distant. Wilde wastes space for the plot to talk about his ideas about human nature, crossing the line between novel and essay too much for my pleasure (\\"...you must keep your good looks. We live in an age that reads too much to be wise, and that thinks too much to be beautiful. We cannot spare you.\\" [pg. 220] is a good example of Lord Henry voicing Oscar Wilde's opinion on not just Dorian, but on life, and the Victorian generation). Another book that actually balances preaching with plot well is Animal Farm by George Orwell; it manages to simultaneously deliver a message about communism and entertain the audience. If you want a book where it is mostly messages and the entertainment is scarce, Dorian Gray is the book for you.Well, why is the story so famous? Part of its reputation is due to its shock value concerning homosexuality. There were various less-than-covert hints at homosexuality and adultery, which, unfortunately, are no longer effective in the 21st century. Now that the president is praising gay service in the military on national television, it is hard to be amazed about having gay characters in a book, and so a lot of impact is lost on me. Besides these homosexual exchanges between Dorian and the other male characters, the book is fairly void of plot, and Wilde's reliance on shock value make it boring and harder to take seriously at this point in time, no matter how revolutionary his writing may have been back in his era.The book was short enough to read through without losing focus, and to be fair, Wilde's writing is always very elegant with a signature fancy flair. Many of Lord Henry's musings are interesting, and most of the dialogues are widely quotable. The problem is that the story is just a little bit too boring for me to consider it a book you would normally read for fun, and combined with the superb premise of Dorian's magical portrait, this book's plot was really disappointing."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"I never heard of Dorian Gray until I watched the movie The League of Extraordinary Men. I heard of Dracula [who wasn't in the movie], the Invisible Man, and Jekyl and Hyde, and Captain Nemo. But I have never heard of Quarterman or this guy Dorian Gray, and I wanted to read more about him. The idea of the picture growing old instead of the person, I thought was a brilliant idea. I could not wait to read this book.How disappointing it was for me, but I gave it two stars for two good reasons: the idea and the writer. The idea is quite neat, and I believe Oscar Wilde was ahead of his time when he thought of it. I think he was a genius, and it is apparent in his writings. There are some deep meanings in some of the passages of the book, and it requires a person to sit back and think about what he's saying. I can appreciate that part of it.But I have a huge problem with the characters in the book. I did not like Lord Henry AT ALL. I barely liked Basil, and Dorian was so over the top emotionally. They are all so judgemental and shallow. I knew this book was not going to work for me when Lord Henry kept talking about how beautiful Dorian was. It was just too much. I believe with Oscar Wilde's exceptional talent at writing, he could have made his point in less pages.And then did I miss how Dorian got his wish? Did it just happen out of the blue? Did he go see a witch or someone with supernatural powers? I would love to know how his wish happened. I must have missed it.Anyway, overall, this book is not my cup of tea. No doubt, Oscar Wilde has a lot to say and he's very smart. It is a must in someone's library. Unfortunately, not in mine.Thanks,Joy"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"If the book was entitled \\"The Picture of Dorietta Gray\\" it never would have become a classic. The idea of a man's beauty when the book was written and even today is suspect. There is something feminine about a beautiful person, pretty eyes, long eyelashes, a voluptuous mouth and smooth skin. Masculine men are suppose to be rugged even if handsome, a jutting jaw, thin lips and leathery skin. That Dorian was barely a man when his portrait is completed is important because when he wished for eternal youth, he refused to become a man and to be a pretty boy as he aged was itself, a decadent act.The book begins with lots of talk about Art and how Dorian Gray himself was a work of art who shouldn't bother with the hurley burley of real life. His first corruption comes when he can't accept Sybil Vane is so in love him she loses her ability to inhabit the lives the Shakespearean woman she played so well. But then the book become less about how Dorian fails to live up to the art of his life and more about his shadowy, decadent ways.Men and women fall in love with Dorian Gray. After Ms. Vane, it appears that Dorian falls in love with no one but he lurks around the docks, bars and opium dens with other men. What he actually does that is so disreputable is never clear and but for those of us living post Stonewall have a pretty good idea that it involved casual sex with men.The novel anticipates the celebrity that consumes us. It also proudly promotes male beauty in a new way. But after setting up a grand discussion about art and beauty, I think the book transforms into something more pedestrian, a creepy tale of horror where art and beauty are forgotten."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Title of Book: The Picture of Dorian GrayBy: Oscar WildeReviewed by: M. PoppinsPeriod: 5Basil Hallward painted a picture of his friend, Dorian Gray. Dorian was about eighteen years old, and everyone said that he was very beautiful. Lord Henry Wotton (Harry), Basil's friend from Oxford, became Dorian's best friend after they met. After the picture was finished, Basil gave the picture to Dorian as a present, and Dorian made a wish that he would always be young, and the picture would grow old. His wish came true. Whenever he did something bad, the person in the picture would get older. Dorian's face never changed after the picture was finished. He never let anyone know about the picture. One day, Dorian showed Basil the picture and showed him how much the picture was altered. Dorian then murdered the man by digging a knife behind his ear, stabbing him again and again. The day after Basil was dead, Dorian made Alan Campbell (one of his former friends) get rid of the body, by blackmailing him. Dorian then decided that he was going to do. He was going to destroy the picture, because he thought that he was going to be in peace after the picture was gone. He grabbed the knife that he had used to kill Basil and stabbed the picture with it. A cry and a crash were heard. A while later, his coachman and footman went through the windows, up to where Dorian was. On the wall, there was a picture of Dorian Gray, young and beautiful. On the ground, there was a man who was wrinkled, withered, and loathsome of visage. They had to examine the rings for them to recognize who he really was.I liked this book because it was fun and interesting at the same time. This quote is what made Dorian's wish come true: &quot;...only if it were I who was to be always young, and the picture that would grow old!&quot; He didn't know that his wish was to come true. I love when things like that happen!I also disliked the book, because in some parts, it just went on and on about things that I didn't understand. Also, there was too much philosophy in this book. This was something that Lord Henry said: &quot;I am afraid that women appreciate cruelty, down-right cruelty, more than anything else. They have wonderfully primitive instincts. We have emancipated...&quot; The quote still goes on. I think that Lord Henry is too philosophic.My least favorite part of the book was when Dorian was stabbing Basil, because that was too nasty for me.

It's about Dorian Gray who is about 18 at the time his friend Basil paints a portrait of him.

Another thing that I didn't like was when the author went on and on about jewels and embroidery - it was so hard to follow and it wasn't necessary the story at all.Overall I liked the story, but it was a tough read, and although it's not a very long book (a little over 200 pages) it is not a light read.

I downloaded theFree Kindle versionand read about half of it. I finished the story by listening to the Librivox audiobook recording using thefree smartphone app.I found Lord Henry to be quite unlikeable. His statements were absurd, contradictory, and got old quickly. Here are some loose quotes... \\"The only things that are necessary are those that are truly unnecessary.\\" He had MANY of those and I saw them coming when only three words of a sentence were out of his mouth. \\"I find people infinitely fascinating.\\" Which he quickly followed up with something like, \\"I pay no attention to people at all.\\" I believe Wilde was trying to paint a pompous, egotistical fool and he did a great job. It made me dislike the character greatly.The story was not balanced well. We started out by meeting Dorian and quickly jumped ahead through years and years of his life. There was very little build up of tension. Chapter nine was completely painful to go through. Did we need to read, in long, boring detail, about textiles and gems?My biggest complaint - various evil deeds and adventures are eluded to, but not shown to us. Dorian's actions are key to the concept of this story, but they are told to us at a distance and with very little feeling. Authors hear often that they are to show, not tell the reader what is happening. Chapter after chapter told us, in only vague hints, what kinds of things Dorian was up to. We skip over incidents very quickly. Some are just a word or two in a sentence. I realize that The Picture of Dorian Gray was written in an era when prostitution, drug use, and vile acts couldn't be written about in detail, but it could have been done so much better.This story reminds me ofThe Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. They both have themes of - Be careful what you wish for. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde was also written at a time when sadistic endeavors and deviant sexual practices couldn't be written in detail. Stevenson succeeded where Wilde failed. I felt Mr. Hyde's strength and power. I could see the lust and greed.

I have many reasons to read this book such as my friend is the big fan of Oscar Wilde's stories and she told me that it's a great book, another reason that really made me want to read this book is after I saw the movie called the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, in this movie all charaters are from very well-known book or we can say that they are classic characters. For example Dracula or Vampire, invinsible man(skinner), Dr.Jackle and Mr.Hike, etc.Only one character that I don't know is Dorian Gray(forever young guy), so I find the book to read.When I bought this book, at first I think it would be boring book because it's quite a all style.....but after I read a couple chapters from this book, I change my mind. It's fun, in teresting ideas and use a easy language or I can say that Oscar Wilde use a simple word but feel brilliant and amazing.Another good point for this book is explain the character and place very clear that you can imagine follow the story.I can't say that it's a bad point but it's quite difficult to understand some qoutes but if you read twice or more and think about fact or in a present time you'll understand or may think it's a great qoute.For other thing that I received from this book is social life in the past(around Victorian period), especially for the upper and middle-class people."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"The beginning and end of this book were fairly interesting, we get to see Dorian Gray first as a young man (a child essentially) and how he was poked and prodded into becoming the man we see at the end of the book. The middle is somewhat lacking, and I completely lost interest for almost a month before picking the book back up and finishing the story.The story is essentially that of a man who sells his soul for something petty, namely, beauty and about the downfall of not only the main character but also those whom he encounters in his life. It is an interesting story, but I feel that the story could have been written better and become somewhat of a mystery novel. Instead of revealing Dorian's secret at the moment he discovers it, it would have been fun to leave the reader guessing as to why Dorain was so afraid to let others see the great picture of himself, and perhaps delve into the inner turmoil of Dorian a bit more before the conclusion.I have only read the story once, but in future readings I'm sure this story will become more intriguing."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"It's been a while since I read The Picture Of Dorian Gray, but I'll try to review it as well as I can.The Picture Of Dorian Gray takes place in late nineteenth-century England, among the wealthy middle- or lower upper class. It is about Dorian Gray, a young man who is beautiful, charming and popular. His good friend Basil Hallward is painting his portrait, and during a visit at Basil's house he meets Lord Henry, another friend of Basils. Lord Henry is decadent and provocative, and Dorian is very impressed by him and his ideas.Lord Henry tells him about how precious his youth and beauty is, and how awful everything will become when he grows old (\\"When your youth goes, your beauty will go with it, and then you will suddenly discover that there are no triumphs left for you, or have to content yourself with those mean triumphs that the memory of your past will make more bitter then defeats\\").When Basils painting is finished, Dorian sees his own beauty in it and is struck by the fear of aging. He makes a pact with the devil, and sells his soul so that he can remain young and beautiful forever, while his painting grows old and repulsive. His former kind and lovely self is gradually reformed, and he grows evil and corrupt although he still appears just as fresh and innocent as he has always been.This book is not the best one I've read, but it is pretty good. I think that the characters are sometimes turned into caricatures of themselves; they don't really appear to be real persons. Although I really liked Lord Henry's philosophical monologues, they sometimes grew tiresome and a bit too long. The novel, and in particular the ending, is quite predictable.However, the book is beautifully written (like most of the books I've read from that time (but I don't know if it's because of their superiority to the writers of today, or merely because the good ones are the only ones that are left to future generations))(...) There are strong homosexual tendencies in the friendship between Dorian Gray and both Basil and Lord Henry, and their friendship does not feel like a mere friendship.Apart from being a way for Wilde to, through Lord Henry, give voice to some of his philosophical ideas, I think the novel is about the shallowness and hypocrisy of the Victorian society, which considered outward appearance more important than ethics and moral."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"In the book the Picture of Dorian Gray Dorian, the main character makes a powerful wish that impacts his life and the lives of others.

All throughout you want to rush through the pages to see how the story concludes. What will happen to Dorian? What will become of the hideous painting?The book's three main characters are Basil Hallward, the painter; Dorian Gray, the paintee; and Lord Henry, the intellectual mind behind Dorian Gray. It seems as if all of Dorian Gray's evils are inspired by his sidekick, Lord Henry. So, throughout the story, the reader is left asking: &quot;Is this guy a villain?&quot; As to the answer to that question, it still remains uncertain to me.And the ending - oh! - flawless, impeccable, divine! I dare not give it away, for you must venture into those pages to find out where all the events lead to. The last page of the book is truly the climax. You'll be left shivering with sweat trickling down your forehead just to see what happens.&quot;Of all people in the world the English have the least sense of the beauty of literature,&quot; Lord Henry claims in one part of the story.

This is a fast pased book that doesn't have a single speed bump, you are forced to create them yourself putting down the book every few chapters to marvel at EVERYTHING. The dialog is world class, the theme's truer today than back then, the characters moving and dynamic, all tied up in as few of pages as possible. With the exception of one chapter, you'll know it when you read it.The dialog, I haven't read a book that I am more impressed with. The poet and playwrite in Wilde shows through here. The constant gloomy witt of Lord Henry is awesome. The dinner scenes are great, and you just want to memorize a few sayings to pull out at the next party you go to. Things like, \\"The only way to get rid of temptation is to yeild to it.\\", or \\"I like persons better than principles, and I like persons with no principles better than anything else in the world.\\" Now you might come off thinking this is a book for an angry teenager, but there is a lot more here than that. If you are an angry teenager though.... read this book you will not regret it.This book cannot be avoided for anyone who considers themselves well read. Also a great intoduction into the world of literature. I recomend this book to anyone that has only read Harry Potter or Twilight, it is an extremely easy read and for its age surprisingly undated, and shows how older books are just as entertaining, yet more thought provoking, and what good writing looks like.

This was not a comfortable read for me; in fact, it was quite difficult for me to finish. However, the difficulty did not arise because it was poorly executed; rather, it was so well done that I couldn't bear to watch the destruction of one man's soul.Oscar Wilde writes beautifully and eloquently, and this book overflows with witticisms and epigrams that are eminently quotable. However, many of these bon mots come from the observations of Lord Harry, who is the cynic that leads Dorian Gray down the road of temptation and vice. For that reason, I could not fully enjoy all of these wonderful sallies, knowing from whom they came and whose mind composed them.Dorian Gray is by no means an innocent throughout this book. However, he begins the book as An Ideal - the physical embodiment of all that is good, youthful, innocent and free of sin. In fact, his ideal purity is what inspires his friend, Basil, to paint the titular picture of Dorian Gray. Once Dorian makes the acquaintance of Basil's friend, Lord Harry, however, Dorian is fascinated by Lord Harry's worldly and cosmopolitan views. In a burst of youthful enthusiasm, Dorian wishes for the picture to bear the physical outcomes of his actions so that Dorian can retain his beauty. He soon discovers that his wish has been granted. Adopting Lord Harry's way of life, Dorian descends into a lifestyle of vice and pleasure seeking and perversely (and childishly?) anticipates the devastation he can wreak on the portrait without bearing any evidence on his own physical form.The levels of Harry's influence, Dorian's self-destruction, and Dorian's blindness to the true elements of his fall from \\"goodness\\" combined to make for a powerful read. I couldn't help but get a Faustian vibe throughout this novel, and I found myself calling Harry (in my head) \\"Mephisto!

The book was quite \\"revealing\\" for me, it put into words so many thoughts and ideas in which I agree. What I liked the most about it are the amusing quotes and phrases that it has, it was quite difficult to choose my favorite one, most of them from Lord Henry for me the best character. Lord Henry has a unique style, like the book says \\"I represent to you all the sins you have never had the courage to commit.\\" For me he is like a paradox, and I like him for that because he is like the opposite of me. I think the book makes you want to have a good discussion with him. In general I think Oscar Wilde like the painter Bassil in Dorian Gray's portrait, puts so much of him on the book. His thoughts, ideas, critics and points of view are clearly reflected. I really recommend the Picture of Dorian Gray, for me is a must read book.

The book mainly focuses on a theme of sin and art, and this review will analyze how this novel treats aforementioned two topics and what readers can gain from such perspectives.Is sin inseparable part of one's life? No matter how moral or innocent way of life one seemingly leads, does sin work its way in insidiously to contaminate and destroy our soul? Oscar Wilde would agree. The novel is an intense meditation on morality. Here, As Dorian Gray leads a debauchery life, he is representing the dark side of morality. Once influenced by Lord Henry, who insists that \\"the only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it,\\" Dorian Gray's sole purpose in life is to please his senses despite the costs such lifestyle would incur. His sudden, whimsical wish that his portrait drawn by his admirer, Basil Hallward, would physically age instead of himself, comes true, and for the next 18 years, he keeps his youthful appearance while his portrait grows old. During those 18 years, he indulges himself in many indecencies (although readers could only glimpse at the specificity of those acts since apparently the press banned a number of erotic references when it was first published), yet he remains pure and pristine outwardly. His callous attitude toward and apathetic reception of others slowly taints his soul. One's decisive philosophy on life has huge impact on his moral conscious, as can be seen from Dorian's life. Dorian seldom visits his attic where he has hidden his portrait and takes a look at it. The portrait looks more horrific and sinister with the signs of aging everytime he looks at it. His sin is coming alive and reveals itself in the portrait.Here, Oscar Wilde seems to suggest that we human beings are all sinners since no one is immune to aging of one's physical forms. We age because we sin. Sin is one of inextricable condition of human being's life. As written in the introduction to the novel, \\"it portrays the author's internal battles and arrives at the disturbing possibility that \`Ugliness is the only reality.'\\"Then, can we, readers, say that Dorian Gray's sin's are unnatural and abomination? Can we not conclude that his sin is just different kind of sin from all the sins that human beings commit? Is his sin greater in intensity than the sins commited by others? If ugliness is the only reality, then he is merely candid with himself and is living in a true reality whereas everyone else only swims in the pool of illusions.In theology, it claims that God exists because everyone needs redemption. And we need to attain it through Him. If everyone needs redemption, then it logically follows that everyone sins. Although people may have rebuked Wilde's only novel due to immorality portrayed and done by Dorian Gray, they have done so because they were afraid to look at their own ugliness through the reflection cast by this very novel. Sin is a natural rebellion we all harbor, however unknowably, deep in our heart. Lucifer and Dorian Gray, they were just more honest with what their hearts were telling them.The theme of art, although seems peripheral to the theme of sin, is indeed an important facet that makes up the novel. The artist who paints the portrait of Dorian Gray poured his soul in the this very art. This metaphor becomes reality and the portrait embodies the soul of Dorian Gray. In addition, Dorian Gray is hugely influenced by the book given by Lord Henry Wotten, he who is ultra-liberal-minded and paradox loving friend of Dorian's. The latter fact is autobiographical in context as Wilde confesses in his other essay. Art affects lives exorbitantly. Art changes lives. Art roots unrootable philosophy deep inside one's heart. Art has soul of its own, or the soul of its subject.Then, was Oscar Wilde honest when he claimed in the preface that \`All art is quite useless\\"? Anything that has capacity to change one's philosopy cannot be labeled \`useless'. The very constrast that's shown in the story of the book is that Dorian Gray could not have lived such decadent life if it weren't for his portrait drawn by his friend. Art, here, gave him a new life. Art, when applied, becomes indispensable aspects of one's life. Scholars argue that the saying, \\"All art is quite useless,\\" was written after vituperative remarks Wilde received from his critics. It was his defense; yet his novels immediately rejects such claim through inordinate life story of Dorian Gray.Like many great novels, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a representation of a certain movement at a specific time. The movement was called \`Aesthetic Movement,\\" and the book remains as a symbol of its era, must as Albert Camus's book The Strangers remains the representation of existentialism in the 50s. Interestingly, the book is inundated with paradoxes, most of which were conveyed by Lord Henry Wotten, and its purpose is worthnoting. Dialectic has been a method for a couple millennia to get at the truth, and it seems like Wilde is purportedly using paradoxes to give us a chance to see other side by our commonly dull perspective. He is suggesting that morality is not easily defined, that the difference between virtue and vice is paper-thin. Here are some examples of paradoxes narrated by Lord Henry Wotton followed by my own interpretation:\\"We shall all suffer for what the gods have given us, suffer terribly.\\" -God's gifts are not a blessing but rather a curse-\\"It is only the intellectually lost who ever argue.\\" -People who use their intelligence and rhetoric for the purpose of arguing don't look smart; instead they look lost-\\"Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love: it is the faithless who know love's tragedies.\\" -It seems like the phrase is boasting the wonders and greatness of unfaithfulness, focusing on its dramatic elements-\\"And Beauty is a form of Genius--is higher, indeed, than Genius, as it needs no explanation.\\" -We generally think that concept of beauty as greatness is fleeting, that beauty is inferior virtue from other types of virtues; yet Lord Henry claims that beauty is the apex among all virtues.=== Forgoing my own interpretation for here are more wonderful paradoxes ===\\"The true mystery of the world is the visible, not the invisible.\\"\\"\`Always' is a dreadful word. It makes me shudder when I hear it. Women are so fond of using it. They spoil every romance by trying to make it last forever. It is a meaningless word too. The only difference between a caprice & a life-long passion is that the caprice lasts a little longer.\\"\\"Sin is the only real color-element left in modern life.\\"\\"One should absorb the color of life, but one should never remember its details. Details are always vulgar.\\"\\"Is insincerity such a terrible thing? I think not. It is merely a method by which we can multiply our personalities.\\"To define is to limit.\\"\\"Every effect that one produces gives on an enemy. To be popular, one must be a mediocrity.\\"\\"Their strong passions must either bruise or bend. They either slay the man or themselves die. Shallow sorrows and shallow loves live on.\\"This book is riveting and memorable book, full of paradoxies and deep insights and commentaries on life. I recommend this book to ones bored by mediocry of general mass and also to those who would like to see liberal-mindedness in its extreme. Although the main character leads a decadent life, because of censorship at the times, the passages do not contain explicit sexual scenes or drug usage. Approximately four movie adaptations on this novel have been made so far, the last one of which stars Colin Firth."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"This is an old favorite of my mother's.

Today it would be difficult to get people to read it. As a former English teacher, I was fascinated and intrigued by Wilde's sentence structure and word choice; most readers today would find it stilted and actually difficult to read. In addition, the class structure adds more problems for understanding how the characters behaved. Lastly, the older British custom of describing men and their feelings about their friends would put off many readers. (Same problem with some of Shakespeare's sonnets.) While it is certainly a classic, there are many contemporary authors who deal with the theme as well as Wilde. It is probably a great choice for English literature majors; however. I suspect the general public could invest their time better with another book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"This is a great book... slow read, drawn out... just like i remember. Good ol' classic for free on the Kindle. Who can complain?!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Oscar Wilde's \\"Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is an entertaining, short novel, with a very honest moral to it. A friend of Dorian Gray, Basil Hayward, paints a picture of Dorian which the painting's subject falls in love with. Dorian wishes that he could remain as beautiful as the picture and that the picture may take on the effects of human aging in his stead. In Wilde's creative twist, Dorian's wish comes true, although this only becomes evident to him as his life becomes increasingly chaotic. As the novel progresses, Dorian, in obsessive love with himself, fights to keep his sanity as the burden of his stress, sins, and guilt, are transfered to the picture which increasingly haunts him.Wilde's writing is colorful and his characters' emotions realistic. This novel is a cutting, yet accurate, observation of human nature in general, especially in our modern, self-glorifying societies. Wilde makes the perfect critique of our selfishness and vanity when Dorian Gray says: \\"There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about.\\" For many in our TV and Hollywood crazed world, this statement is not troublesome but rather, a personal mantra."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"I had really high expectations for this novel, which were not fulfilled. The novel consists of mostly &quot;mindless&quot; dialogue and the true story does not really occur until the book is half over. then the story picks up pace until Dorian's descriptions of a book (totally unrelated to the rest of the novel) drag on. Once that portion of the book concludes, the end briskly approaches. Overall, I think I was expecting a more emotional response to this, which never occured."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a fine piece of literature- a tale of excess, of corruption, of decay and of facades.Basil Hallward, an artist, paints a picture of Dorian Gary, a handsome and vain young man, whom the artist is besotted with. Dorian Gray sells his soul for eternal youth, in a Faustian bargain, whereby all the age , decay corruption will show in the picture , while Grey's appearance will stay eternally young and fresh.Encouraged by the hedonistic cynic Lord Henry Wotton, Gray embarks on a life of corruption, decadence and cruelty. Lord Henry is also the vehicle through which Wilde put down his many uniquely Wildesque epigrams into the novel, such as \\" Conscience and cowardice are really the same thing, Basil. Conscience is the trade name of the firm. That is all\\"; \\" Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love. It is the faithless who know love's tragedies\\"; \\"There is only one thing worse than being talked about and that is not being talked about\\" ; \\"The only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it.\\" ; \\" It is better to be beautiful than to be good. But it is better to be good than to be ugly.\\" And \\" As for the virtuous poor , one can pity them of course , but one cannot possibly admire them\\".The bargain made by Gray can only lead to eventual destruction , and the novel is a statement by Wilde on humanity and society , in the cavalier and irreverent way that only Wilde could."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"This story about a man whose wish for eternal youth comes true through a portrait of himself delves into numerous philosophical nether regions. Set in upscale 19th century London, The Picture of Dorian Gray deals with such topics as truth, death, and most especially beauty.Dorian Gray's portrait ages while he remains his youthful self. Gray uses this to his advantage (let's be honest, who wouldn't?). Gray breaks hearts, corrupts others, and avails himself of numerous vices...most notably opium. Gray also takes advantage of his youth by learning new things...music and gemology come to mind. But Gray's self-enhancement does not make up for the copious sins he commits, both large and small...and even though his face does not bely his crimes, the portrait's face does.Wilde's play on eternal youth was almost certainly novel for the time. These days the concept has been played out time again. But I do not begrudge Wilde for this...in his time, he was an innovator.Four major things irked me about this book:First, the prose is overly flowery. I don't read many books written in the 19th century...maybe most of the books were written like this. Second, Wilde seems to use this book as a platform to give us his take on philosophical issues large and small. True, most good works of fiction are a reflection of the society in which the author lives, but Wilde is NOT subtle about giving us numerous opinions on art, love, life, beauty, etc. I think he could have been a bit more subtle doing this. Third most of characters seemed overly naive. Granted, this story is supposed to be set in a time and place where the rich did not concern themselves with trivial matters. Nonetheless...so much was going on under the characters' noses! Even, Henry Wotton -- Gray's longtime friend -- seems to come down with a bout of extreme naivete toward the end of the book. Somehow, this made the characters seem shallower than they otherwise might have been. And my final gripe kind of ties in with the characters' overall naivete. From the time that Dorian Gray is granted eternal youth by whatever powers that be, to the end of the book, nearly two decades elapse. There is only one, very minor, mention of Gray's youthful looks toward the end of the book. Didn't anyone notice that this guy has, supposedly, aged nearly twenty years and yet still appears as youthful as ever? Come on, even these days with plastic surgery and $100+ cosmetic cream, a 40 year old doesn't look half his age. Why did only Gray's closest friend only offhandedly mention this toward the end of the book? Surely someone else must have noticed?Wilde's concept had a lot of potential, and it certainly does make one ponder life's intangible mysteries, but Wilde spent to much time proselytizing his 19th century philosophy for this book to really stand out. This book is only recommended to those who enjoy Wilde's other works."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"I do not know words to describe the way I feel about this book. The first time, with the exception of one chapter, I could not put it down. I have been hooked on Oscar Wilde since. I researched the period and wrote a term paper on this book alone, and after that, when I still was not satisfied, bought his complete works, a book of quotations, and a book about his plays. I only wish by byeing these books I could understand and be swallowed into the beauty of his wisdom. I can sometimes be an obsessive person, and I suppose this is how my review sounds at this point, but don't let your opinion of me detract you from interest in this book.It's worth giving a try...you may become hooked too (by the way for Wilde fans..the movie WILDE is a great window into his life). This book is written with beauty and the words flow like poetry...warning though...people with closed minds towards homosexuality should think of choosing a different book. One of the most descriptive and hiddenly believable parts of this book is the secret feelings Lord Henry has for Dorean. I don't want to misinterpret the book, but i believe Lord Henry's feelings to be more than fatherly...great excelent story!! my favorite book!! what more can be said???-SArah"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"This is just a warning to prospective kindle customers - the kindle version of this book is not \\"lavishly illustrated\\" which is not so surprising in a digital edition. But what was more surprising to me, Nicholas Frankel's extensive notes, which run alongside the text and which exceed the actual length of the novel itself, are not included. In fact, both the paperback and kindle editions are 'reader's editions'. Yes, there are two rich scholarly introductions, replete with notes, and some three pages of notes to the actual text (which are also included in the hardback) , but the \\"annotations\\" which have excited so much comment from reviewers are in fact missing from the kindle edition. There was no warning from Amazon that the kindle edition omits the textual notes that run side by side with the text in the hardback. However, when I pointed this out to Amazon, 'they' very generously offered me a certificate for the amount of the book on my next purchase. So that was very nice.In fact Stonewall Riot Press has a complete, uncensored \\"reader's\\" edition on Amazon for 9.19. The editor himself, JOHN MCARTHUR, praises Nicholas Frankel's annotations:\\"I was already at work on my edition of the text when I received my copy of Nicholas Frankel's P-book edition published in 2011 by Harvard University Press. Though I was somewhat dismayed at having been scooped, I could only admire the quality and thoroughness of Professor Frankel's scholarship. His notes, which run alongside the text, exceed it in length, and he also provides lavish illustrations and other resources.

I am in LOVE with this story. The way Wilde writes is fabulous- I am an increasingly voracious reader of the classics, and Wilde's writing style is exactly what I like. It is written in the eloquent verbage of the time, but not so much so that I find it stifling and hard to get through ( I am currently reading an Emily Bronte, and am having this problem). The story itself is charming and devious, with an ending that you expect and yet are shocked by.

Like a lot of free public domain ebooks, this one isn't exactly user-friendly. The lack of a title page doesn't bother me, but this book is also missing a table of contents. If you're reading this for a class or a reading group, that missing table of contents might be a deal breaker. Additionally, while you can always refer to line numbers, this book lacks pagination. Again: I realize this isn't something that's going to bother everyone, but if you need to refer to page numbers in an essay, you might be in trouble if you use this copy.If you're like me and you're interested in reading this book just for fun, page numbers and a table of contents probably don't matter much to you. However, I think everyone can agree that things like page breaks and proper spacing between chapters vastly improve one's reading experience. That's the real rub: There are none. Paragraphs sit immediately atop one another like a great wall of text. Chapters receive the same treatment and are only demarcated by plain text- no bolding, no new section, nothing. The whole effect is not only visually unappealing, but just plain annoying.So the layout of this Kindle edition isn't great, but this book isn't all bad. For one thing, it's free. You get what you pay for formatting-wise, but it's a fantastic story and it's yours forever at absolutely no cost. Plus- and this is also big- this ebook isn't riddled with spelling errors and typos like a lot of the other public domain books available on the Kindle.

An increasingly macabre tale set in London, England during the 19th century.Most are familiar with the plot behind this book...but some *SPOILERS* ahead for those that don't want to know.A most handsome young man has a most lifelike portrait done of himself by a up and coming young London painter. In his youthful exuberance over the detail and beauty of the work, he casually remarks that he'd give his soul to remain young and beautiful, like in the painting, forever.His curse is that he stays young while his friends age and the face and body in the portrait grows old through the years. But the portrait does more than just grow old, it reflects every bad or evil thing he's done (using his beautiful looks to gain unfair advantage); resulting in a framed visage that becomes more grotesque and ugly with every new sin he commits.*END SPOILERS*Beautifully written, with great descriptive detail (maybe at times, a little too much). Wilde conveys a tense atmosphere filled with forebodling and apprehension as he gets into the second half of his extraordinary novel.Conclusion:A short, brilliant work. A masterpiece! 5 StarsRay NicholsonP.S.The Kindle edition of this book is free via public domain."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"I loved the idea that someone's true nature can be portrayed on a canvas. Although a beatiful young man, Dorian finds that his debauchery and sin are not reflected by the state of his own body, but by the image cast in a painting. As Dorian continues his decline in morals, an interesting question arises. Kind of a \\"which came first, the chicken or the egg\\" type of thing. Was his soul corrupted by his lack of consequences for his mistakes? Or did the freedom merely let him unleash the evil that already poisoned his soul?"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"This sophisticated but crude novel is the story of man's eternal desire for perennial youth, of our vanity and frivolity, of the dangers of messing with the laws of life. Just like &quot;Faust&quot; and &quot;The immortal&quot; by Borges.Dorian Gray is beautiful and irresistible. He is a socialit&eacute; with a high ego and superficial thinking. When his friend Basil Hallward paints his portrait, Gray expresses his wish that he could stay forever as young and charming as the portrait. The wish comes true.Allured by his depraved friend Henry Wotton, perhaps the best character of the book, Gray jumps into a life of utter pervertion and sin. But, every time he sins, the portrait gets older, while Gray stays young and healthy. His life turns into a maelstrom of sex, lies, murder and crime. Some day he will want to cancel the deal and be normal again. But Fate has other plans.Wilde, a man of the world who vaguely resembles Gray, wrote this masterpiece with a great but dark sense of humor, saying every thing he has to say. It is an ironic view of vanity, of superflous desires. Gray is a man destroyed by his very beauty, to whom an unknown magical power gave the chance to contemplate in his own portrait all the vices that his looks and the world put in his hands. Love becomes carnal lust; passion becomes crime. The characters and the scenes are perfect. Wilde's wit and sarcasm come in full splendor to tell us that the world is dangerous for the soul, when its rules are not followed. But, and it's a big but, it is not a moralizing story. Wilde was not the man to do that. It is a fierce and unrepressed exposition of all the ugly side of us humans, when unchecked by nature. To be rich, beautiful and eternally young is a sure way to hell. And the writing makes it a classical novel. Come go with Wotton and Wilde to the theater, and then to an orgy. You'll wish you age peacefully."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"I first was introduced to Dorian Gray through a book club, and I thought 'Oh no, Oscar Wilde, here I go, another hard to read boring society book&quot;. I was wrong. Within the first two chapters of Dorian Gray I was intrigued and fascinated. This book deals with several issues that are as important now as they are today: the way our culture worships beauty and youth, an admiration that boarders on homosexual love, virtues, the differences between men and women, and what art is and what makes it truly art. Dorian Gray is a beautiful young man, who sees a portrait of himself and says &quot;How sad it is! I shall grow old, and horrible, and dreadful. But this picture will remain always young...If only it were the other way! If it were I who was to be always young, and the portrait to grow old...I would give my soul for that!&quot; The book takes off from there, leading you from a small theater to great parties. While younger readers may find some of the wording as tough as an old gym shoe, anyone older than 13 with an interest in mystery, romance, and how society runs, will find this a pleasurable and haunting read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a mesmerizing read dominated by two amazing personalities. Dorian Gray is certainly interesting, but I was much more impressed by his friend and mentor Lord Henry Wotton. Dorian is a perfectly nice, well-meaning young man when we first meet him in the studio of the painter Basil Hallward. Hallward in fact is so drawn to the youth that he draws his greatest inspiration from painting him and just being with him. It is the influence of Hallward's friend Lord Henry which leads to Gray's downfall. There are few characters in literature as decadent, witty, and somehow enchanting as Lord Henry. He is never at a loss for words, fatalistic observations of life and people, sarcastic philosophical musings, and brilliantly devious ideas. Among his world of social decadents and artistic do-nothings, his charm remains redoubtable and highly sought-after. Gray immediately falls under his spell, soon devoting himself to living life to its fullest and enjoying his youth and beauty to the utmost. He solemnly wishes that he could remain young and beautiful forever, that Hallward's exquisite picture of him should bear the marks of age and debauchery rather than himself. To his surprise and ultimate horror, he finds his wish fulfilled. Small lines and creases first appear in the portrait, but after he cruelly breaks the heart of an unfortunate young actress who then takes her own life, the first real signs of horror and blood manifest themselves on his portrait. His love for the ill-fated Sibyl Vane is a sordid, heartbreaking tale, and it marks the culmination of his descent into debauchery. He frequents opium dens and houses of ill repute, justifying all of his worst actions to himself, while the influence of Lord Henry continues to work its black magic on his soul. He hides his increasingly grotesque portrait away in an upstairs room, sometimes going up to stare at it and take pleasure in the fact that it rather than he bears the stains of his iniquities. In time, his obsession with his secret grows, and he is constantly afraid that it will be discovered by someone. For eighteen years he lives in this manner, moving among the members of his society as a revered figure who magically retains his youth, but eventually he begins to see himself as he really is and to curse the portrait, blaming its magic for his miserable life of ill-begotten pleasures and loss of moral character. The final pages are well-written, and the climax is eminently satisfying.Exhibiting the undeniable influence of the French Decadence movement of the late 19th century, this wonderful novel serves as a morality play of sorts. One can understand why its unique nature upset a British society emerging from the social constraints of Victorianism, but this reader is hard pressed to see why this novel proved so damaging to Wilde's eventual imprisonment and punishment. Dorian Gray is no hero, nor does his ultimate internal struggles and yearnings for rebirth inspire one to engage in the sort of life he himself eventually came to regret. The only \\"dangerous\\" character in this novel is Lord Henry; his delight in working his evil influence on others as a type of moral experiment and the silver-tongued charm he exploits to aid him in such misbegotten quests have the potential to do harm to a vulnerable mind such as that of Dorian Gray. Lord Henry's evil genius makes him much more interesting than his disciple Dorian Gray. By today's standards, this book is not shocking, and indeed it is much more dangerous to censor work such as this than it is to read it. This book in eminently quotable, and it still manages to cast a magical spell over readers of this day and age. Quite simply, The Picture of Dorian Gray deserves a place on the shelf of the world's greatest literature."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"What made Oscar Wild(e)?The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press has published a new edition of Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray. While there is no burning need for such a volume in the day of Lady Gaga and marriage equality, it's important to remember that Wilde spent two years in prison for being gay and for having the guts (stupidity?) to flaunt his sexuality. In many ways, it was the flaunting rather than the act themselves that so angered his persecutors.And Dorian Gray, his first and only novel, was certainly a shot fired directly into the heart of Victorian prudery.And in this day of Kindles, e-books and tweets, this is truly a magnificent job of bookmaking. Oversized, lavishly illustrated and gorgeously presented, Oscar would have loved it. The text is examined minutely, with a variety of comparisons from various publications of the novel, as well as Wilde's original manuscript. While there's nothing particularly new to discover in the emendations from the sources, merely a reinforcement of the outrageousness inherent in the piece, the scholarship is both astounding and informative.The annotator and editor, Nicholas Frankel, easily and effortlessly places the modern reader in Wilde's time and place, London's late Victorian Age in London. There is still a tingle to Dorian's story of endless debauchery while he remains looking pure and innocent for decades and the painting ages and grows monstrous, reflecting his sins and crimes.Strangely, the book seems more modern than one would imagine. Rather than merely a potboiler from two centuries back, WIlde's genius imbues the story with a strange and haunting immediacy, and a cautionary tale for us all: Be careful what you wish for.One could hardly wish for a more beautifully accoutered book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Is your soul a good bargaining chip for perpetual youth and beauty? Young Dorian Gray was led to believe so and impulsively struck that bargain. \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is the story of his decline into depravity following that ill-advised trade-off. The story is well-known in popular culture. An artist becomes obsessed with his young model's attractiveness. He and his jaded friend compete for influence over the young man. The friend corrupts young Dorian, encourages him to embrace a life of sensual pleasure and to prize his own beauty. Dorian exclaims that he resents the portrait because IT will keep the freshness of youth -- then the fateful words, that he would give his soul if the picture could decay instead of his own face and body.Be careful what you wish for! Over the next twenty years Dorian sinks into the depths of moral slime and watches the hidden portrait show all the signs of that immorality, while his own face and figure keep the blush of youth.Along with the adulation of youth and beauty, Oscar Wilde delves into the theme of art as morally neutral, a principle of the aesthetic school of thought. Can art be moral or immoral? Should it teach us, improve us? That was the common 19th century view but the school of aestheticism believed that the arts had no role in moral enlightenment. The preface of the book lays out this theme in a series of proclamations.The entire book, like all of Wilde's work, is packed with \\"sound bites.\\" The corrupting friend, Lord Henry Wotton, is particularly prone to Polonius-like declamations, and Dorian tells him, \\"You cut life to pieces with your epigrams!\\" In fact Wilde does that, ripping into polite society and the opium dens of London alike.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is Oscar Wilde's only published novel. It first appeared in a magazine in 1890 as a shorter work, and was later expanded and edited to remove some of the more blatant homosexual references. His writing is exquisite, his themes repugnant but (dare I say it?) edifying. \\"What does it profit a man ...\\"Highly recommended as a true classic of modern literature. I read this book when I was young and thought I understood it. Now that I'm not so young, I'm sure that I don't.NOTE: I listened to this book on CD, not tape, but I chose this product link because it's the same production. The Brilliance Audio Library Edition, read by Michael Page, was incomparably presented and added a great deal to my enjoyment of this absorbing book.Linda Bulger, 2008"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"This book contains the story 'The Picture of Dorian Gray' - in original typescript form. This is the way Oscar Wilde wanted the novel to actually read before the publishers got hold of it. There are two other versions of the novel out there - the version printed for magazine publication & the one printed in novel form. After the publishers got hold of the manuscript a lot of changes were made because of content - the homoerotic element was toned down. The novel version is also longer - Wilde expanded the story. There are pictures, illustrations, & extensive notes included to explain all the changes. It's very interesting to see a version in print that is how Wilde intended it. If you are a fan of Oscar Wilde's works or of Dorian Gray in particular, you will appreciate having this book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Basil Harwood talks to his friend, Lord Henry Wotton, about his latest painting, a portrait of a striking young man named Dorian Gray to whom he has taken quite a fancy. He feels that his art has never been alive as it has since meeting this young man. Intrigued at his friends acute interest, Lord Henry determines to meet the young man himself, and quite by chance, manages to remain in the studio as Dorian arrives and stands for the finishing touches to his portrait.Once it is completed, Lord Henry comments on how youthful the painting is, remarking how unfortunate it is that the portrait will always remain as young as on the day it was painted, whereas Dorian will slowly age, losing his youth and looks to time. Dorian frets over this and says that he would give anything if only his portrait would age instead of him.Weeks later, after an unfortunate scene with his fianc&eacute;e, Dorian notices a subtle change to his portrait, a certain cruel turn of the lips. As the days pass, he notices more changes and begins to realize that he can commit every vice and cruelty imaginable without any harm coming to him. His portrait will bear the brunt of his adventures. But at what price? As the years pass, he begins to wonder about the state of his very soul and if he can change, perhaps bring the portrait back to its original beauty.This is a great novel, dealing for the most part with man's quest for eternal youth. Who wouldn't want to stay young forever? We go through fad diets, gyms, botox, plastic surgery -- all in the name of trying to remain healthy and youthful. Dorian is given a unique opportunity, the consequences of which show him the havoc that all the vices and cruel acts have upon his soul (or his conscience). We also get to see how getting what you wish for doesn't always turn out the way you thought it would.It's a well-written story, full of unique characters. The majority of the male characters seem to have no problem whatsoever having intimate relationships with other men. By his actions, Basil appears to be in love with Dorian. Dorian, in turn, is infatuated with Lord Henry, even thought both of them do have relationships with women (for Dorian, a fianc&eacute;e; for Lord Henry, a wife). There's even a bit of jealousy on the part of Lord Henry's wife when she finally meets the man who's been monopolizing her husband's time.At times, though, it does move slowly due to long passages discussing the place of art in society and philosphizing about the quest for youth and beauty. In these passages the text seems to turn more into a lecture rather than a novel. That, however, does not take away from the enjoyment of the novel."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"While Oscar Wilde's central theme of corruption initially captures the readers attention, the character development does not help to hold the reader's attention for a long period of time. Dorian Gray, the central character, has the potential to be a very romantic and dumbfounding character, but because Wilde does not go into great character development, he seems almost more like the painting that comes to represent him ... dimensionless. The point of the novel is to point out how changed Dorian becomes over the years and how he goes from being the epitome of beauty to someone that is hardly recognized as the person he once was. However, in order to feel this transformation, the reader would need to feel as if he or she knew the original Dorian Gray. Because the beginning of the novel does not describe him enough, the full effect of Dorian's startling transformation is unable to be fully comprehended.In addition, although the theme of outer beauty coupled with inner corruption is a strong one, this book seems more like one that should be read in a class and discussed in groups. It is not a novel that is easy-reading for pleasure. The style of writing makes it hard to breeze through the book, although on the positive the book brings about much self-contemplation and is very thought provoking. The reader cannot put it down because the whole novel leads to the very disturbing, although somewhat predictable, ending.In general, it is a book that should be read and will be enjoyed by many. The reader can relate to the feelings felt by the main characters and the themes in the book are ones that can be witnessed in real life. The general faults of the novel are eventually outweighed by the suspense and the intrigue as the painting of Dorian Gray, once a masterpiece, becomes more defiled with each horrible act committed by Dorian."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Basil, who up until now was a mediocre painter after meeting Dorian Gray a young Adonis, was inspired to create a masterpiece of which he puts himself into.

He falls in love with a beautiful young actor who is every woman that Shakespeare ever wrote about. Once again, due to Lord Henry's influence, he realizes that she's just a common girl.Starting with absent-minded acts Dorian slowly sinks into debauchery.

In addition, we as readers travel with Dorian as each decision is made.

I was skeptical that it could be bad, because I'm very familiar with the wit of Wilde. As far as gothic novels go, this book ranks high in the Victorian era. Looking back from a historical perspective, I can see why the critics of the time disliked it. But from today's perspective, it is nothing short of brilliant.

I surprised myself when I ended up really enjoying the book. It's a great work and definitely a book that everyone should pick up at some point in their lives.Although there were a few characters I didn't enjoy so much, this book was overall incredible. Every book has a couple stumbles and can't really be perfect; but you know you have a true classic when the spectacular parts of the book are so spectacular that you kind of forget about the things you didn't like so much and fall in love with the book anyway.

Also, the price was right: free."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"One of the great joys of fiction is the positive encouragement to discard the intentions of the author and draw out individual meaning from its pages. This positive fruition is exemplified quite extraordinarily by Oscar Wilde in \`The Picture of Dorian Gray', as he weaves a tale of youth, corruption and disregarding hedonism.The protagonist of the story is the youthful and worldly-naive Dorian Gray who, through enticement by his mentor, pledges himself to eternal youth. His wish is sanctioned and the ravishes of age are transferred onto a portrait. Knowing that his appearance will remain forever innocent, he embarks on a pursuit of reckless pleasures, spiralling further into iniquity yet remaining unchanged, whilst his picture grows grotesquely disfigured...The novel was--and to an extent, still is--controversial due to the unsubtle suggestions of homoeroticism. Personally, I don't see the fuss. Partially for obvious reasons, but I also remain unconvinced that it is presented in such a way to have ever been an encouragement for others to embrace such a 'lifestyle'. Rather, it would appear that Dorian's sexual exploits with the same gender is a method to achieving his goal of ecstatic delectation; the goal which, in the end, is his destruction. But, of course, considering Wilde's own sexual practices, one could read it as a defence of those with same-sex attractions.Ultimately, I understood this novel to be a warning against unchecked desire and the pursuit of pleasure without limits; certainly an apt lesson for our own age."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"This book was truly one of the jewels filled with beauty that will never fade with time.

It is inconcievable to think that Wilde was denounced for this book being immoral as it is really quite moral, considering the consequences of Dorian's behaviour.

When Dorian's friend Basil paints a portrait of him, Dorian exclaims that he wished the portrait got old instead of him.This comes true and under further tutelage of Lord Henry, Dorian lives a life of debauchery, hedonism and the like while the portrait bears his age and sin, becoming more malformed with each act.

This is a time where the most important thing is preserving a good appearance. Sin is thought of as merely an adventure and the past is only a forgotten bother. The life of Dorian Gray is a race to see who will win his young mind and form it into his being. A most handsome boy, he never had much opinion and was content just to sit and be painted. Basil Hallward loves him for his features. Basil also was in love with the inspiration he felt whenever he was painting Dorian or whenever Dorian was near. Basil thought of finding beauty and living only through art, but none of this was appealing to the impressionable Dorian Gray.Upon meeting Dorian Gray, Lord Henry Wotton becomes completely intrigued. A man who loves nothing more than observing the behavior of human beings and implanting his ideas into anyone who will listen is quite a companion. Where many do not agree with his words, Dorian couldn't agree more with him. As days and years pass, Dorian is shaped into the perfect being that Lord Henry has only begun to imagine.Where there is beauty, worship, and incorrect influence there is flaw. There is hatred, there is jealousy, and there is corruption. Dorian has the strong belief that everyone will love him and he will forever be preserved the angel of time. To himself he is everything, but to everyone he is bad luck. His ideals, taken from Lord Henry, seep into the minds of others and cause them to fall. Precisely because of these beliefs he would never understand he was wrong.With the horror of the ego and the love of oneself there is no clear path again to the light. This is Dorian's story, his desperation, his trials, his losses, this, good people, is his soul.Lovers of philosophy and gothic idealism will find nothing to hate in The Picture of Dorian Gray. I am still baffled by many of the perspectives created and endorsed by Lord Henry. Though there are undoubtedly sections that could put a hyper person to sleep, this book is filled with so much philosophy and plot twists that it is worth the read despite the at times slow plot.

A beautiful young man named Dorian Gray possesses a portrait of himself, painted by his friend Basil Hallward. Dorian, who is very vain about his looks, expresses the wish that he could remain young and beautiful while the portrait grows old, only to find that he has made an unwitting Faustian bargain, because this is precisely what happens. Influenced by the hedonistic philosophy of another friend, Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian gives himself over to a life of debauchery, remaining forever young while the signs of ageing begin to appear on the painting. The portrait, moreover, does not simply reflect Dorian's chronological age. It also acts as a reflection of the state of his soul. By the end of the story Dorian is no more than middle-aged, but the picture is that of a hideous old man, disfigured by a life of sin and vice.When the novel was first published in 1890 (in magazine form) it was highly controversial, for two reasons. The first reason was its undoubted homoerotic overtones, although Wilde toned these down somewhat when the novel was published in book form the following year. Explicit gay sex scenes would, of course, have been taboo in the 1890s, but coded references to famous homosexual lovers from history and mythology (Hadrian and Antinous, Edward II and Piers Gaveston, Jupiter and Ganymede) can be taken as an indication that Dorian's debauches are not exclusively of the heterosexual variety. There is also an indication that Basil's feelings for Dorian, and possibly Lord Henry's as well, go beyond mere friendship.The other reason why the novel was so controversial was that Wilde was wrongly thought to be espousing Lord Henry's world view and advocating a love of beauty and pleasure as the only good in life. This impression was strengthened by Wilde's Preface, which consists solely of twenty-five epigrams about art, including \\"There is no such thing as a moral or immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written. That is all\\". These statements appear to align Wilde with the literary and cultural movement known as Aestheticism, or sometimes as the Decadent Movement. This movement adopted as its slogan \\"Art for Art's Sake\\", interpreted by many of its followers such as the French poet Theophile Gautier as a denial of the idea that there was any association between art and morality.Wilde's epigrams, however, should not be taken as the Twenty-Five Articles of a prescriptive artistic credo; they were rather intended as provocative aphorisms intended to stimulate discussion. The author himself frequently wrote works with a quite overt moral agenda- children's stories like \\"The Selfish Giant\\", social satires like \\"A Woman of No Importance\\" and \\"An Ideal Husband\\", poems like \\"The Ballad of Reading Gaol\\". Indeed, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" itself can be interpreted as an overtly moral work. In a letter, Wilde said of the three main characters: \\"Basil Hallward is what I think I am: Lord Henry is what the world thinks me: Dorian is what I would like to be--in other ages, perhaps\\"- an interesting remark, given that Basil is both the only character in the novel who is a creative artist and also the representative of a traditional, and often explicitly Christian, morality, which contrasts sharply with Henry's amoralism. Henry is a cynical dandy, much given to witty aphorisms, but like other similar characters in Wilde's works is not to be taken as a self-portrait of the author.If Dorian is a Faust-figure, Henry is his Mephistopheles, but he is a devil less corrupt than the man he tempts. For all Henry's cynicism, he never descends into the depths of depravity in the same way as his prot&eacute;g&eacute; does. He never quite has the courage to practise what he preaches, being guilty of what might be called inverted hypocrisy, making himself out to be worse than he really is. As Basil says to him \\"You never say a moral thing, and you never do a wrong thing.\\" Dorian's sins, however, are not limited to sexual debauchery and drug addiction (he becomes an habitu&eacute; of opium dens). His callous behaviour drives his fianc&eacute;e, the young actress Sibyl Vane, to suicide, and in an attempt to preserve himself from exposure he resorts to blackmail and murder.One thing that does link Wilde to the Aesthetic movement is his undoubted love of physical beauty; the story is written in a very rich, lush style with many striking descriptive passages, such as the opening description of the beautiful summer's day on which Dorian first meets Henry. Yet his attitude to Aestheticism is a critical one, and is perhaps closer to that of earlier writers such as Ruskin and Morris, both of whom promoted an appreciation of beauty not as an end in itself but as part of a wider political and social agenda. Wilde clearly saw the limitations, and the dangers, of a cult of beauty divorced from moral and human concerns. It is perhaps significant that, after committing his murder, Dorian sits down to calm his nerves by reading the poetry of Gautier, the writer most closely associated with the \\"art for art's sake\\" ideology. He breaks off his engagement to Sibyl after seeing her give a bad performance in the theatre; her explanation for the decline in her acting skills is that, having discovered real love, she can no longer be inspired by fictional love. For him, artistic concerns are paramount over human ones; for her, it is the other way round.As one might expect from the only novel of a highly original, idiosyncratic writer, the book occupies a unique place in the history of English literature. It is sometimes classified as Gothic fiction, and the work to which it bears the greatest similarity is perhaps another classic \\"Gothic\\" novel from the late 19th century, Robert Louis Stevenson's \\"The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\", published five years earlier. Like Stevenson, Wilde wanted to explore the duality within the human soul between the virtuous public side and the darker private side which we are compelled to keep hidden. As a homosexual forced to conceal his homosexuality, this theme had an obvious appeal for him.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is a complex, multi-layered work, and there is insufficient space in this review to touch on all its many aspects. It is, however, a work which well deserves its status as a literary classic more than a century after the death of its author."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"This is to my knowledge, the only novel ever written by Oscar Wilde. It is very intelligent and at some points, rather dark, but that all makes it even more fun! The story is that Dorian Gray, is a young man who finds the thought of aging, rather depressing. As it so happens, his best friend is an artist, who has been quite happy to paint a portrait of Dorian. Upon witnessing his youth preserved in art, Mr. Gray wishes it could perhaps, be the other way around...and his wish is granted but, in a nightmarish way. For now the painting reflects his sins. Believe me, he has more than enough. This is a great, if tragic story and I'm so glad it was free, as this was my first time reading it! Also, this book is positively packed with good quotes so, now's the time to create a My Clippings file on your Kindle."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Oscar Wilde, The Picture of Dorian Gray (Tor, 1891)I cannot comment on the scariness of &lt;em>The Picture of Dorian Gray&lt;/em>, the only novel ever written by Oscar Wilde. Why? Because, despite the reams of column inches I've read over the years on how scary the blessed thing is, I couldn't find myself even turning a hair. Simply put, Wilde was a comedian, albeit a bitter, misanthropic comedian. The man didn't have it in him to write horror the way the Jameses (M. R. or Henry, take your pick) or Poe did. (Though one should note that none of those three acknowledged masters of nineteenth-century horror ever produced what we would consider, today, a novel-length work of horror, whereas Wilde did; Poe's only novel was a fantasy, while the longest works of James one and James two are both novelettes.) So if you go into it expecting a horror novel, you may well find yourself disappointed. If you look at it, however, as yet another exposition of the incredible strengths of Oscar Wilde's creativity--the biting satire, the homosexuality so repressed it's half-erotic when someone stands up from a table, the rampant quotability--then like everything else the man ever wrote, &lt;em>The Picture of Dorian Gray&lt;/em> will be right up your alley. It contains some of Wilde's most-recognized one-liners (\\"The only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it.\\", \\"If the cave-man had known how to laugh, history would have been different\\", \\"It is not good for one's morals to see bad acting.\\", and dozens of others), some thoroughly entertaining characters, a plot as old as time itself bent to Wilde's indomitable will, and any number of good, solid laugh-out-loud moments. It also, of course, comes with an excellent backstory that inspired Wilde's most important one-liner of all: \\"There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written.\\" Needless to say, were this not the former, there wouldn't have been such an uproar over it, would there? ***"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"The book \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\", written by Oscar Wilde, deals with the issue of getting old and the question of how you want to live your life. In my opinion the book is a typical book from Oscar Wilde which shows the difficulties and the pressures in the community. Oscar Wilde is a critical author who always writes about his own point of view. Furthermore you can also learn about his personality and the society this time.I think that the Picture of Dorian Gray represents the wish from every person to stay young and beautiful with all the opportunities and chances, waiting for you to grab them. Also the second chance and the possibillity to change is a facility which is usually offered to the youth.Also the end is a perfect rounding which brings all topics and themes together to one point. And as Oscar Wilde shows in his opinion, the point is not how you look, it is more how you lived and what you did. At least the ending says that when you die,you die as the person you were and it does not matter who you pretend you are.The story of Dorian Gray is in my opinion a very gripping book which did not leave me until I finished it. And even then it makes me think about these things. Oscar Wilde's writing is very fast-moving and there are no long or boring scences in the book.Bringing all considerations together I have to say that I enjoyed the book very much, which is why I have read it in only three hours."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is Oscar Wilde's color commentary on the tug of war between Basil Hallward (good) and Lord Henry Wotton (evil--think Wormwood in C.S. Lewis' Screwtape Letters). The rope they pull is the young Dorian Gray. The score in this classic battle is widely known; in the end Wotton pulls Gray completely to his end of the field with Hallward dragged face-down in the mud. For those who have not read it, I will not reveal the absolute ending.Several themes apply to us all: the high price of pleasure and self-indulgence as a way of life; the absurdity of our superficial preoccupation with outward beauty; and how idolizing appearances blinds us to the truth."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"What would a portrait of your soul look like?More than anything else, this question beats at the heart of this thought provoking book.For Oscar Wilde, his alter ego Dorian Gray would not be too pretty.As the book demonstrates, years of sin ultimately rob Gray of his youthful beauty. But, consistent with a wish made by Gray, this theft occurs only a canvas copy of him made by an adoring male artist when Gray was still young.While it would seem that eternal youth is a great prize, especially to the very vain Gray, it ends up becoming a curse. Gray locks the aging picture away in an attic only periodically returning to it to witness the ravages that would have been visited upon him were he not to have made his wish.In this way, while Gray is permitted to retain his external beauty, he's also forced to witness his moral deterioration.As with the more contemporary Angels in America, self reproach over one's homosexuality moves deeply along the subcurrents of this book. Though most don't know it, homosexuality was prohibited by law in Great Britain until 1967 and those convicted of it were forced into harsh punishments and even harsher treatments intended to \\"cure\\" them.It's this deeper sense that most people resonate with in one way or another...substituting their own private sins for those of Gray in their estimation of their moral appearance.Having said all that, it still prompts consideration that Gray himself and his friend Lord Henry -- sinful that they are -- are the most interesting characters in this book. Unintentionaly (perhaps), Wilde is suggesting that it's our sins that make us noteworthy."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"I would love to give this a five star review because I am a great fan of Oscar Wilde from his well known works to De Profundis, but the inconsistancy of this story made it difficult to get into.The first half is a vehicle for Wilde's wit, unfortunately at the expense of story line and character developement, although I should that for me the wit of Oscar Wilde was reason enough to keep me reading. The second half of the book tells the majority of the story and is a much more accessable read.Would I reccomend this book? I think this is one of the few times I would say see the film (1945 starring George Saunders and Angela Lansbury) and then read the book.

Amazon.com, despite its general excellence, fails to take into account the bibliophile for whom the quality of the edition he determines to purchase matters, so, this is not a review for the intellectual content of the volume I have recently bought, but, rather, a review of the quality of this particular volume's production.I had hoped, that Penguin had finally decided to market its considerable store of intellectual wealth to those who desire a book of some distinction, to those who still admire the craftsmanship of a finely wrought tome. Largely, in this edition (and in those others, similar to it) they have succeeded. The cloth covers of these editions are attractively designed; the typesetting modern, attractive, and readable; the cloth marker a thoughtful edition. However--and this is a thing unabidable--the binding is glued and does not have signatures. Sewn signatures are a sign that some care has been taken to ensure the longevity of a book. The crude, merely glued together pages make this volume little better than some cheap paperback in deceiving, meretricious garb. I will not again be purchasing a book from this line, and would advise anyone else to avoid doing the same."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Dorian Gray is a young man of pure beauty. He befriends an artist named Basil, and at first Basil uses Dorian as a model for paintings, putting him into classical scenes. Eventually, however, he decides to paint a portrait of Dorian as he truly is. Around the same time, Dorian befriends one of Basil's acquaintances, Henry, and Henry makes Dorian more cynical and jaded. When Dorian finally sees the portrait Basil has painted, he weeps and wishes that he would remain young, and the portrait would age in his place. When his wish comes true, Dorian will go to murderous lengths to keep the secret.Sometimes, a girl just needs a little bit of the classics in her life. Thank goodness Amazon offers a wide variety of public domain books available for free Kindle download. This was my first foray into Wilde, and I wonder how different of an experience reading his work in his own time would have been. To me, the homoerotic undertones leap from the page, but I wonder how much of that was intentional on his part, and how much of that is me being influenced by what we know of Wilde himself. Regardless, there is something sensually sinister about the interactions of the men in this book. And while most of them do have relations with women, very few seem to value or enjoy female interactions at all.I very much enjoyed this dark, cautionary tale of a wanna be Narcissus. It did take me a while to get into the pacing of the more classical language and writing style, having been reading a lot more modern books lately, but once I was about a third of the way through the book I literally devoured it. I know Wilde did not write as prolifically as some classical writers, but I believe I will be seeking out some of his other works.I could not help but feel some pity for Dorian Gray. He became exactly what everyone groomed him to be, then everyone scorned him for being what they had wanted him to be in the first place. Someone needs to get this book to Lindsay Lohan as soon as possible, she may find it familiar. Which make me wonder, with all the modernizations and mash ups of classic literature out there, why hasn't anyone done anything with this story? It seems to me that it could be redone with a modern twist, or vampires or something really well if the right person did it. Of course, if the wrong person did it, it would be wretched, so maybe it is best left alone."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"This novel is one of the best classics available. It is more entertaining for its controversy value than for anything else.

More importantly, though, Wilde's creation poses the question: Can a book be poisonous? Gray succumbs to the &quot;evil&quot; influence of Huysmans' book A Rebours. As Wilde as written, &quot;there is no such thing as a moral or immoral book.

However, The Picture of Dorian Gray gets bogged down with trifles too often, which is distracting. There is an air of stuffiness and superficiality that becomes a little tiresome.Also, there are few redeeming characters in the novel, as the principal ones are nauseating. Take Lord Henry for instance. His long-winded philosophies and monologues dominate a good deal of the book; rather than adding much to the story, they become heavy-handed, like a point is being shoved in our face too often. And, then there is Dorian. So overdramatic and high-maintenance. Everything revolves around him and his precious little world. I get that he is supposed to be vain and materialistic, but there's little sympathy for him at all, especially when you realize he's more about forgetting his sins than actually repenting them. I realize that Wilde is philosophizing through his characters and the plot, but the means with which he goes about this is tedious.Still, there are redeeming aspects to the novel. Wilde does give us a moral to take away from the reading experience, as the Faustian angle of selling one's soul for beauty becomes apparent in Dorian's life. As Dorian ultimately chooses vanity over spirit and conscience, he sets the wheels of fate in motion. With devil in disguise Lord Henry egging him on, he gradually sees the portrait embody his tarnished soul: vanity, pleasures, sins. Wilde does give the book a very Gothic vibe. Dorian's portrait almost seems alive with grotesqueness, something horrible and monstrous hiding behind that sneer.While I did enjoy the Gothic aspects and the moral to Wilde's novel, I didn't like this novel as much as others."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"I've only just started reading the book but so far I've enjoying what I've read of it to this point."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"I ordered this book some months ago for my love, and it arrived quickly and was in phenomenal shape; exactly as the description stated, and was priced very fairly."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Only read three pages.

Like most of his works this novel is few in characters, but copious in themes. The novel captures the ideals of aestheticism or \\"beauty for beauty's sake\\", a philosophy for which Wilde was a spokes person and prominent proponent. He used this novel as an opportunity to combine the elements of aestheticism with his observations of larger social themes of the era and really define his philosophy as it pertained to society. As part of the observed social themes, the novel incorporates Wilde's refined ideas relating to the supremacy of art and society's view upon decadence, duplicity, and beauty. Yet despite Wilde's attempt to bring focus to his ideas of aestheticism his novel serves as juxtaposition to his ideals if not the exact opposite.Aestheticism was a movement that sought to free art of the restricting responsibility of having a meaning and also of being moral or immoral. Wilde was under the impression that art, of all forms, need serve no purpose but be beautiful. In his novel Wilde uses two prominent symbols of these ideas: the picture which represents beauty and the unnamed yellow book that served as a symbol that literature also needed to moral restrictions. Though his intentions may have been to advance his own ideas, this novel serves to counter that for despite the idea that art have no purpose this novel gives a purpose to both of the aforementioned symbols. The picture is transformed into a mirror of sorts and through this mirror the world can see the corruption and age that Dorian's physical self has been spared. Wilde created the idea that Dorian's portrait became a portal into which he could look and see the nature of his soul and its transformation as his actions corrupted it. The novel itself may have escaped morality but served as a guide to which Dorian became corrupt. Therefore the novel served the purpose of being the catalyst causing Dorian's corruption. This simply proves that although it is possible to subvert and avoid moral restrictions everything can be interpreted to serve a purpose and thus nothing can escape having a purpose.The primary principle of aestheticism is the importance placed upon beauty to which Wilde ties this in with the superficiality of society. Throughout the novel Dorian is influenced by the philosophy of Lord Henry, who believes that beauty and the senses are the most important values, and beauty reigns for most of the novel. Wilde writes of how society places such high a value on beauty and refers to it as the most valuable of commodities for it is soon to be lost. The idea is that beauty is the only thing of importance. For throughout the novel Dorian is treated the same by the company he keeps despite his ethics. This is a clear representation of aestheticism in which beauty need have no relation to ethics. Wilde juxtaposes this idea with that of another character who believes that the price is too high. The way in which Dorian meets his doom confirms this second idea, for he gives his soul. However, at the end of the novel beauty is still held to the upmost of importance which again refers to the both the value of beauty and society's superficial nature. Yet the reader comes away feeling that beauty is something dangerous to value so highly, as is apparent by the demise of the model of beauty, Dorian Gray.Wilde may have intended for his novel to further his own philosophy however, The Picture of Dorian Gray, does the exact opposite. Wilde effectively illustrated both the flaws in a society that valued beauty so highly and the flaws in his own philosophy."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"I got this free for my iPad and I enjoyed reading it.

In my High School English class, grades were given on the basis of how many books one read. If you read 8-10 you received an A. The problem was that after knowing one was going to get an A, all reading stopped. Reading is supposed to be done for the joy of it. I hear the word boring used a great deal when reviewing a book. I know so many kids who end up hating reading because they received a poor grade. The classics are challenging books. I would never use boring as an adjective to describe a book however."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"I feel sad that I couldn't give this book more than two stars.

Maybe I didn't like this book ,because I didn't understand Dorian or the character's. I don't know. But you people describe it so well, that I feel like I've missed something important.

Bad moral."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"After letting his friend Basil Hallward paint a portrait of him, Dorian Gray makes a wish to the heavens above that the the picture would take on all his sins and showings of age and he would remain youthfull and boyish. Throughout the book, Dorian Gray becomes very popular and attracts all sorts of attention just by waltzing into a room. People find him so innocent and pure, he's alluring (which soons turns sour.) But they don't see his other life. His loathing of the once-beautiful portrait which now displays his age, sins and iniquities. This deep hatred drives him to do many strange things in this dark, twisting tale of morale, age and youth. The book follows Dorian through love, loss, murder, disdain, hurt and ofcourse, happiness. Because it covers most every subject, its a wonderful classic, and a must-read.Though because its written in England in the 19th century, some of the vocabulary is bewildering. Its best to read with a dictionary near by or atleast some knowledge of English Literature and diction."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"A comely, vain, innocent young man named Dorian Gray gets his portrait painted and hides it away in an unused room in his house. After a love affair with an actress goes terribly wrong, he notices that his portrait has altered itself in a curious way. He proceeds to live his life by indulging himself in episodes of increasing debauchery and immorality, wrecking other people's lives and committing blackmail and even murder, and all the while his portrait bears the physical signs of his aging while his own body remains young and fresh. The novel offers some weighty questions: Would we choose to be immoral if we knew we were immortal? Is an artist's work the manifestation of his own latent immorality? Are the world's imperfections, sins, and shames represented better through art than through reality?As much as I admire Oscar Wilde's great play &quot;The Importance of Being Ernest,&quot; I must admit that I found some faults with this short novel of his. Despite its florid prose and dialogue containing wickedly caustic wit and punchy aphorisms that evoke a time when conversation was an art, the novel has a strangely artificial, stiff tone. With dialogue that sounds like it would have to be rehearsed before spoken and many scene descriptions that seem like stage directions, it often reads like a play that's been converted into a novel. Interior furnishings are described in the meticulous detail of a Sotheby's catalog; a nice touch, but what's the point? This is an intriguing novel that combines elements of gothic horror and social satire, but it is marred by too many moments of unintentional goofiness."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"In London, the well-known artist Basil Hallward meets up with a wealthy young gentleman, Dorian Gray.

In certain parts of the book he starts to show a nervous side of himself. He does this because he is witnessing that a certain picture of someone is changing before his very eyes. Whose picture you're asking, what do think that I'm going to tell you! Stop asking, and read the book already. Anyway, the setting of this book is taking place around the Victorian Times in England. In England there is an art studio in which Basil Hallward, the artist that paints a certain picture, works and spends most of his time. The problem in the story all started when Dorian spoke a &quot;request.&quot; He &quot;requested&quot; that, &quot;Why can't this picture age instead of myself?&quot; Dorian will be scared of what happens after the next few months.

Not only do I have much of the book highlighted, but it is worn from reading again and again. I would definitly reccomend this brilliant novel to anyone who wants to walk away with a feeling as if they've discovered a treasure they must share with the world."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Basil Hallward is an artist, who paints a portrait of Dorian Gray, a very good looking and nave young man. The portrait is a masterpiece that in reality depicts Basil's feelings for Dorian, as well as, Dorian's youth and beauty.Lord Henry Wotton, a seductive emotional predator and selfish pleasure seeker, is a friend of Basil who meets Dorian at Basil's house and gives him a philosophical speech about the fading nature of youth and beauty. Dorian whose greatest qualities are his youth and beauty pledges his soul to stay young and beautiful. As part of the deal Dorian Gray's portrait becomes the surrogate for the disgrace and aging of the real Dorian Gray.Under the growing influence of Lord Henry over Dorian, the later embraces Hedonism and increasingly sinks into a sinful corrupt life and shows no regard for values or morals. A tragic event caused by Dorian's behaviors starts the projection of Dorian's ugliness and self -centeredness on the portrait. Dorian creates excuses and excuses himself with lame explanations for the tragedy and hides his portrait so he can't see the hideous transformation of himself reflected in his picture. As long as his beauty remains, he can ignore the changes in his portrait. It's interesting how Dorian tries to avoid his inner feeling of ugliness by trying to surround him self by beauty, and other beautiful distractions such as roses and music.Basil's love for Dorian, which is likely a real life reflection of Wilde's love for Lord Alfred Douglas, causes Basil to defend and protect Dorian, even from his self destructive acts, until the last shocking event. I'm tempted to describe the ending event, but I won't deprive the reader from the pleasure of exploration and discovery.Given the period when this novel was written, Wilde is artistically candid and courageous beyond belief. Wilde displays his usual wit, sarcastic playful ways and funny style, while he walks us through serious dilemmas like the supremacy of youth and beauty, homosexual feelings, repentance and murder. Wilde grabs the reader through the use of shocking events that not only criticize Victorian morality, but ironically displays a moral lesson about vanity and narcissism.\\"The picture of Dorian Gray\\" is a wonderful piece of literature in which the portrait asserts itself as Dorian's conscience in a superficial society that places values on looks and wealth while ignoring the real value of humans. Simply, a one of a kind work."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"If you want a new slant on this classic novel, read 'The Ripper Code' by Thomas Toughill.

It is for that reason that his work is so filled with countless paradoxes and contradictions that challenge the mind and titillate the senses. Wilde lived in an infinitely ironic age, when society had grown so influential as to crowd out the individuals that made it up. Today, we have taken for granted this incongruity and so our writers cannot express the kind of irony that Wilde mastered, despite the fact that we all know that something is amiss.\`The Picture of Dorian Gray' is filled with this irony. The plot shows us the ultimate irony of a man giving up his soul for the beauty of youth--the condition that is exalted in the modern age above all else, intellect, truth, justice, life itself. Interspersed are dialogues and epigrams that persist one hundred years later as some of the finest word handling ever recorded. Even a few samples should compel the potential reader:\\"The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about.\\"\\"Every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter.\\"\\"A man cannot be too careful in his choice for his enemies.\\"\\"The only difference between a caprice and a life-long passion is that the caprice lasts a little bit longer.\\"\\"Men marry because they are tired, women marry because they are curious. Both are disappointed.\\"\\"I love acting, it is so much more real than life.\\"- \\"I am on the side of the Trojans, they fought for a woman.\\"- \\"They were defeated.\\"The mastery of wit that Wilde displays must be seen in its context. He was a decadent as much as the characters he portrays are. Ultimately, the disillusion that the decadent faces comes through in the story and the reader is left with a very uneasy feeling upon completing \`Dorian Gray.' Is life as absurd as it seems? Is there a solution? Or are we stuck with a life of paradox? Perhaps our current period of decadence will show us an alternative.

Filled with deliciously witty, catty wordplay and bon mots from a day where banter was highly valued, Wilde was skillfully adept at scrutinizing society and all of its flaws. The Picture of Dorian Gray is tragically ahead of its time, its philosophies on aestheticism and art are still relevant today - and will most likely always be. There were a few downsides (as I said, very few), including some dense chapters expelling the virtues, of well, non-virtue. Wilde would swiftly make up for these with delightful conversations taken straight out of the parlors of the age in which he lived. While some of them felt contrived, Dorian's slow decay into hedonism is wonderfully depicted, and the haunting last paragraph of the novel will stick with every reader. The theses the author conveys are spellbinding and dead-on, and the descriptions colored with imagery and allusions referencing Shakespeare and mythology are vivid. Wilde makes one question their own limits and passions, and engages the reader into being an active participant in life and reading."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"This is a beautiful and witty tale about a depraved man.

Dorian Gray is captured at the height of his physical charms in a painting and soon discovers that the corruption of his body and soul is reflected in the painting while he retains his youthful attractiveness. His life becomes one of increasing debauchery and narcissism.The most quotable of authors, Wilde uses a friend of the young man to deliver an endless collection of axioms and witty observations that add another dimension to the plot.As Gray becomes more convinced of his invincibility he grows more callous toward others and his actions become less human and more monstrous as the story progresses."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Am I no less agreeable?

This was my first Wilde, and I don't think it will be my last. Another reviewer said that this book was about people doing horrible things, and yet the book was impossible to put down.Nearly everyone knows the story. Dorian Gray wishes that his portrait will show the ravages of time and wickedness while he remains young and beautiful - and he gets his wish. I knew that Dorian's life was going to be ruined - and at times I could predict what was going to happen next. Usually that turns me away from a book. But Wilde's storytelling is so delectable, so riveting that (to use a cliche) it was like watching a train wreck. Terrible to see, but I couldn't look away. I was fascinated.I have heard complaints about the 'flowery' language, but I loved it!Being the overthinker that I am, this book also raised some questions for me: Was Dorian really corrupted by Lord Henry, or did Lord Henry merely show the world Dorian's true hidden nature? Was Basil to blame somehow for painting the portrait? This was probably Wilde's goal - to make us think, and to make us question our hidden nature."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Ever since I got my kindle, I've been downloading free classics and The Picture of Dorian Gray was one of them. I remembered it was an option to read for our British Literature final paper so it caught my eye. I started reading the book knowing absolutely nothing about it and within the first few pages I was caught up in its beautiful writing and witty banter between the characters. It's a great story about how a man basically trades his soul for his youth. Wilde writes about the debauchery that Dorian goes through without being so literal about it, which is probably because he was living during victorian times, but it's great because it lets your imagination wander. He doesn't outright say that Dorian seduces women, gets high, or is bisexual, but you assume all of that from his writing. This is not a story that teaches you to choose the \\"good\\" path in life. It's a story that tells us that if we could be a little hedonistic without consequences we would. I'd love to live Dorian Gray's life for a week to know what it feels like...but then have it erased from my life.The negative reviews were basically that the book is boring. I admit there was this one part of the book where it describes everything that Dorian Gray bought, but it's only for a chapter. Another negative reviewer wrote that this book is full of quotables without substance, and well, I don't think the quotes are a bad thing. It's funny! I personally love reading all types of books, both classic and modern, but the ones that keep me fascinated are the classics. The style of writing is just beautiful."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"It felt longer than the actual (approx) 280 paper pages it is.

Although, there are a few typos on the Kindle version."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Though many of us no longer believe in \\"corruptible souls,\\" Oscar Wilde's \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" still holds up as literature and a container of meaning. Though the metaphysics of the novel were likely a mere literary device even in Wilde's day, they nonetheless strike at something deep. Essentially, they ask two perennial questions, \\"what does it mean to be a good person?\\" and \\"How do I know if I'm a good person?\\" Unlike most non-literary mortals, the extremely corruptible (aren't we all?) Dorian Gray has direct empirical evidence of the state of his \\"goodness.\\" He receives, via a Faustian pact sans Faust, a \\"soul mirror\\" from the hapless painter Basil Hallward. As Gray develops from an innocent, almost waifish, youth endowed with irresistible masculine beauty into the Marquis de Sade of the English leisure class, the painting records his increasing dissoluteness. In trade, his physical being retains all the luster of youth and beauty he possessed at 18. This would provide a near irresistible bargain for many twentieth century people, and one wonders at the number of real but metaphorical equivalents of Gray portraits that exist today. But universal belief in a soul, especially as a \\"chalkboard of one's self,\\" has become quaint (even those who believe in a soul probably don't imbue their lives with this belief). Who then, apart from religious adherents, today really worries about \\"damage to the soul\\" in an eschatologically consistent manner that would make Wilde's book blare a meaningful warning signal? Hasn't such thought gone the way of the ether and phlogiston (even though exorcists still dwell among us)? Why read this novel?The simple answer is that \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" remains great literature, though even that concept carries far less weight today than fifty years ago. But if by \\"great literature\\" we mean a story with depth, intrigue, drama and unforgettable characterization then maybe more antennas perk up. Many have also called it a \\"horror story,\\" so perhaps one can subsume it under precursors to Steven King and other morally based modern horror novels? Whatever convenient label one puts on such works, great stories, be they novels, movies, video games, hieroglyphics, songs, dances, buildings, or even a splotch on the sidewalk, teach us something about ourselves. They flip that often neglected \\"introspection switch\\" somewhere in our wiring that supercharges the wonder mechanism. So regardless of the now ancient metaphysics and 19th century ethos of this novel, the telling of such a story as a \\"horror fable\\" still touches that ineffable part of us that strives for \\"goodness,\\" whatever that means. Dorian Gray explores this theme by depicting the abstraction of goodness in visual form that morphs in sympathy with some objective measure of that quality. This in itself summons the creeping question \\"what would my portrait look like?\\" As well as \\"what standards would make my portrait writhing and horrid?\\" The novel suggests, amongst other things, that disregarding the situations of others and focusing selfishly on one's own pleasures makes one corrupt. Sybil Vane's tragic end, arguably the result of Gray's selfish cruelty, produces the portrait's first \\"scrupulous twitch.\\" We still experience these wispy twitches today, with or without a belief in souls. But our increasingly individualistic world throws rationalizations up for any parallel behavior. In a curious twist to the enlightenment-inspired right of \\"pursuit of happiness\\" we suddenly find ourselves morally justifying the destruction of others in the name of principles of \\"individual freedom.\\" This novel seems to eschew such thinking all the way to Gray's macabre and unforgettable death scene. The portrait wasn't so detached from the body after all, it seems. Reducing the book's \\"moral\\" down to a platitude such as \\"selfish hedonism doesn't pay\\" belittles Wilde's achievement. Though really, it says as much but in a beautiful and horrifyingly satisfying way. And it says it in a way that even touches the modern sensibility. Fables can still have impact in an emergent posthumanist era.Another reason to read \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is that, being Wilde's only novel, one can claim to the unknowing that \\"I have read all of Oscar Wilde's novels\\" and come across as quite educated indeed. Of course Wilde was well known for his plays. And the sensibilities of the playwright do appear throughout this short book, with the exception of some long passages of narrative summary in the book's second half. Copious dialogue inhabits large sections, especially when the loquacious Lord Henry Wotton spews his neo-hedonist views. These play a role in Gray's corruption and also suggest a fear of contagious and dangerous ideas. Can ideas corrupt? \\"Dorian Gray\\" seems to say \\"yes.\\" But this novel will not corrupt. It will entertain, being a great story, and it will inspire thinking, because it has substance. And since it spins a great yarn it also has the ability to moralize without the appearance of moralizing. Double bonus. So voluminous reasons exist to pick up and chew at this old tale, either in fiber or electronically. And, finally, if you're going to write only one novel, make it a jaw-dropper. Wilde did."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Beautiful beautiful copy. I was delighted to receive this in the post.

This book offers rich ideas on everything in life guided by the moral decay of Dorian Gray who's fulfilled wish of youth becomes the means to vices and sins. Meanwhile two friends offer opposing advice- and through it all there is no black and white and moral judgement. Simply a tale of human desires and dissapointments. Though it was written long ago it could have been told today and still ring just as true (perhaps with just alternate form of transportation and letters being sent via e-mail)"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"I had to go back and rethink and reread this story, but profoundly moved by how timeless the message seems to be. Modern culture (Hollywood etc...) would benefit from what seems to be the basic MORAL of this story. The more shallow and superficial the pursuits in life, the more corrupt, evil, wicked and proverted one can become. This is a fact, no \\"religious right\\" or anyone else, made it up. Many just turn their backs or ignore the truth. Mr. Wilde himself should have taken a lesson or two from his own story. What a tragedy with his talent to die sick, corrupt, lonely and penniless. At least this classic work came from all the sadness and despair.....too bad.I have often thought that this tale may be one that would be a great stage production/story....Mr. Wilde should have possibly considered it, again............too bad!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"When Oscar Wilde published his only novel back in 1890 he caused much excitement among the literary critics and the society as a whole. And I'm a little bit puzzled because there is no evidence that the book deserves some negative feedback. It seems to me that someone who criticizes the ideas in the novel and summarizes it as an \`immoral' demonstrates high level of hypocrisy. This is art and art is about freedom of imagination and expressing. If we expect from art to represent only moral emotions we experience in our daily life then art wouldn't worth so much.The story of the book is somehow very simple. A young and innocent man named Dorian Gray fascinates an artist so much that the artist finds inspiration even in his only presence. Basil Hallward confides his secret obsession to a friend of his named Lord Henry Wotton and at that very moment Henry decides to meet Dorian. From their meeting on, their relationship is the main point around which the story evolves. Henry is a cynic person who has very provocative and fascinating way of declaring his position for most of the aspects of life. His attitude is uncommon for 19th century London high society and could be characterized as immoral. Dorian gradually adopts the lifestyle Henry proclaims and indulges in taking maximum from the life no matter the cost and no matter who will have to pay for it. On the other hand a rash desire expressed by Doran that the portrait Basil has painted of him ages and Dorian himself stays forever young becomes true. With always innocent look on his beautiful face Dorian is in a very good position to take maximum of his life and he does it. By breaking norms, recognized by high society he ruins lives of most persons attracted and charmed by his beauty and charisma. Lord Henry stays always beside him as a \`spiritual' mentor while Basil goes to the background of Dorian's world. The picture Dorian hides in an abandoned room in his house shows not only marks of aging but also is a mirror of Dorian's soul - everything he does reflects on the picture's face expression which turns to an evil grimace that disgusts Dorian. Finally he comes to a moment that feels sorry for the life he had chosen and decides to make everything possible so that to restore his portrait's humane look as much as possible.The end of the story proved quite an intriguing to me and I feel somehow confident that such an end seems to be the most logical for the story although being drastic and direct in his representation.The writing style of Wilde is of a person who knows very well what he has to say and in the same time you don't get feeling that someone is trying to teach you something. On the contrary - this novel looks like a very good related story. On some moments too much attention is paid to the details, something that represents more successfully the atmosphere of the story but the movement suffers a little bit.I personally am in deep sympathies for Lord Henry's character. His directly stated position on the topic is very often shocking but the interesting part is that you could stay and think a while and take from it what you appreciate. Nothing in this world is completely wrong I think. Just be careful not to fall into blind deviation and become second Dorian Gray."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"With today's slippery morals and exhausting vanity, The Picture of Dorian Gray is an eerie comparison to &quot;then&quot; and now. There are many interesting scenes in the book that make this book very exciting. It is about a man who, upon receiving a portrait of himself, is so upset that it will &quot;mock&quot; him with it's permanent beauty, while he will age and decay. He makes a wish that he will remain young and beautiful and the picture will age and take his sins for him. In the end, though he is beautiful on the outside, he is horrendous on the outside.Definitely a good read for high school students. It's interesting and short, and not as cumbersome as other Romantic novels can be. You can relate it to today's times and it is not a hard read. I did not want to read ANY Romantic novels but I am very happy that I chose this one! And you will be, too!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"This book offers its readers a chance to understand the meaning of true beauty and the reason why time passes the way that it does. If you enjoy really good quotes that make you think, this is a great book for you. It made me think of ideas and concepts that I had never thought about before. Some reviews of novels say they could &quot;never put the book down.&quot; But what happens when the book is over and it goes on the shelf? I would like to hope that, with this book, the wheels in my head will keep turning, and I will continue to think about the concepts it brought up, and apply it to my own life. I think you will do the same if you read this novel by Oscar Wilde"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Oscar Wilde tries to argue in the prologue of this book that literature, as a form of art, is not moralistic and that people therefore should not treat it as such.In all honesty, however, The Picture of Dorian Gray is an extremely moral book; it's just hard to decide what exactly the moral is. The very good and the very bad do not fare that well in this tale of elitist debauchery, while those who go the middle path and avoid both evil and righteousness seem to do quite well. Wilde once said that he wanted to be like Dorian Gray (evil), was perceived by the world as being Lord Henry (moderate), but was actually like Basil Hallward (good). Does this mean that Wilde, by his own moralistic views, was inevitably doomed, regardless of what he tried to be or actually succeeded in being?Anyway, all of this moral stuff is very interesting, but don't fear; the novel isn't terribly philosophical and pretentious. Instead, the book has a by-and-large well-done and consistent plot, and by the end of the novel, when all of these questions of right and wrong are flowing through your head, you can barely recall how on Earth Wilde slipped all that philosophical stuff by you without seeming lofty or ridiculous.I read this book to compete in an essay contest, but I never got around to writing the essay and I'm still glad I read it. A quick and amusing romp through the darkest corners of upper-class 1800s England; recommended."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"I absolutely loved the novel written by Oscar Wilde, The Picture Of Dorian Gray. When I was beginning the novel it was a little slow and even a little dry. But, as the plot thickened and the story went on, I can say it is one of my most favorite books ever read. Dorian Gray, the main character, is obsessed with his good looks and his youth. Gray sells his soul for eternal youth and beauty. But his close friend who is an artist paints a portrait of Gray. As the years pass Gray doesn't age but the picture does. His conscious and eternal youth ends up becoming well ........ You'll have to read to find out.People most likely to read and enjoy this novel would probably be late teens and older. Mainly because it has a lot to do with being young and having all the time in the world to do whatever and learn and experience so much. It also is a little bit harder to read for someone younger. I would really recommend this novel to everyone. The story is great and has a little bit of everything in it."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Rod Stewert once sang that &quot;every picture tells a story&quot;, and in no case is this more true than of one Dorian Gray. By now everyone knows that young Dorian makes a childish wish that a beautiful portrait of his should age in his stead, and that he should remain forever young and vibrant, and somehow this wish is granted. What follows is a tale of increasing debauchery and depravity that poison a man's soul, while leaving no visible clue upon his face.This is not the most entertaining or gripping novel that you will ever read. Far from it, in fact, but the real merits of the novel come not from the action and plot, but from the extremely clever dialogue and the shredding social commentary. (not surprisingly, this novel took a long time to get published, and was later used as evidence against Wilde during his trial for indecency) Wilde takes several shots at the aristocracy, especially their values, as well as art itself, hedonism, and the very concept of morality.Perhaps the finest aspect of the novel are Wilde's quotes, often through his favorite mouthpiece: Lord Henry Wotton. Henry serves as a goad to Dorian through all of his excesses, and he waxes philosophical upon almost any subject that he can get anyone to listen to. He's wonderful and horrible all at once, and best of all, he doesn't even believe half of what he says. This is definitely a 'classic' novel, and well worth the read. Again, if you're expecting high paced action you'd probably best look elsewhere, but if you're in the mood to think a bit, then chances are you'll enjoy &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Picture of Dorian Gray is a very sinful, witty, humorous and beautiful book. This has got to be Wilde's most personal work, one can tell from the writing itself that Wilde really put himself into these pages or maybe what he wanted to become. The tale of Dorian and the tale of Wilde have the same kind of \\"tragic ending\\" to it. Wilde's downfall of being accused of homosexuality and Dorian no longer being able to bear the pain of his acts and conducts bring tragic endings to their lives. I think that every person has or has had for a certain amount of time the wish to stay forever young and beautiful, the burden of time not affecting you at all but something else, in Dorian's case, it was the painting, anyways I'm rambling on and on, do read this book, it's 2:00 am right now and I have a Physics exam tomorrow, today actually, anyway, do read it, it's enjoyable, funny, touching and everything else that a good novel should be."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY has enough going for it to retain its classic status for some time to come. It is loaded with epigrammic sentences by a writer who continues to hold interest. Its concept was highly original and has inspired generations of science fiction, fantasy and horror literature since its debut. Wilde stows a lot of his themes and notes on society and character into its pages, so that it often reads like a stack of dispatches from the late 19th century. The dinner party scenes are priceless. It is certainly worth reading in order to understand why Dorian Gray has entered our language, so often alluded to.While possessing the above traits, the novel does have its flaws that are more pronounced under the glare of contemporary light. Wilde's bigotry shows through. Some of the passages are melodramatic and wooden. Dorian Gray's physical beauty is a work of art, and as Wilde says at the outset, all art is useless. However much he embodies many of Wilde's ideas, he remains rather vapid, even when he is at his most corrupt. Part of that is due to the fact that many of the actions that condemn him are only spoken of or hinted at. Mostly we see the highlights, the suicide of a young girl to whom he was unjustly cruel and some subsequent deaths."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Loved this story in school and it just gets better with rereading.

The desire to find a fountain of youth rings as true today as it did in 1890 when the story was first published. Dorian Gray is a young and dashingly handsome man. When he looks at a portrait that was painted of him it stirs up the regrettable fact that he's at the top of his game now and will never look better. He's irritated that the portrait will continue to look the same and in a sense mock him as he ages in real life. What's a man to do? There was no such thing as plastic surgery back then, and Botox was unheard of. Dorian laments: \\"Oh, if it were only the other way! If the picture could change, and I could be always what I am now!\\" Boom. He gets his wish. That brings us to the old adage, be careful what you wish for. Being young and beautiful is wonderful--at first. Many, many years later, it can get tiresome, at least for Dorian. Dorian doesn't know what to do with all that time. He studies many things and that part of the book got a tad tiresome for me. But stick with it, things get better and a lot more interesting. I thought this was a great book.

But now, I see the struggle between good and evil, self-indulgence versus altruism, hedonism versus retraint and self-respect.

What follows is a tragic tale of decadence and hedonism as Dorian Gray succumbs to a lifestyle of excess and debauchery.

Once, when I thought that that was all that the book was, I still liked it: after all, the story was a good one, the one-liners were mostly good, and if the two didn't fit well together, well, that was a pity, but it didn't prevent the book from being fun to read.I realise now that the book packs a greater moral punch than I'd thought. Wilde makes evil seem genuinely attractive; and this is not to be done merely by telling us that so-and-so finds evil attractive, and then giving a spurious causal explanation. When Dorian performs his first act of genuine cruelty, not only Henry, but the author as well, tell us to forget about it, that it doesn't really matter. They even give us some genuinely good arguments. (Whereas Basil, the force of good, seems to be able to do little but utter stolid platitudes.) So we forget about it as much as Dorian does, and are hit over the head all the more smartly by the end of the book. It's true, Wilde still gets a bit carried away with himself in places; and the effect of seeing so many of his epigrams together in the one place is to make us wonder if we could write a computer program capable of creating a couple of hundred more; but I was wrong in my initial reaction. The flippancy and the deep seriousness are both necessary. They contrast, but they do not clash."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"I read this book as part of a personal quest to read some of the classic authors and was pleasantly surprised.

He wishes that the picture could age instead of him and with that, in effect makes a \\"deal with the devil\\". Who actually turns out to be an acquaintance of the painter. Now I must clarify that the use of the term devil isn't literal or traditional in the sense of a scary creature whom Dorian encounters and actually makes a deal. Over time, it becomes apparent that Dorian doesn't age and that the picture does which causes a emotional distress for Dorian and we see him living his life in seclusion and treachery.People who encounter Dorian seem to have harm follow them or they in fact, harm (kill) themselves. All the while, he maintains his boyish looks and draws the ire of the townspeople and becomes the subject of many comments, rumors, and suggestions.In the end Dorian decides that the only way to be free and have a clean slate is to destroy the very thing that he feels has been holding him back...the picture and what happens next...well...I guess you should just read the book ;-)"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Basil, who up until now was a mediocre painter after meeting Dorian Gray a young Adonis, was inspired to create a masterpiece of which he puts himself into. Against Basil's wishes, Dorian Gray is influenced by Basil's friend Lord Henry. Dorian looks at his portrait and realizes that while the portrait will stay young forever, he will grow old; so Dorian makes a wish that if only he could stay young forever and the portrait can age.At first Dorian does not realize his wishes been granted. He falls in love with a beautiful young actress who is every woman that Shakespeare ever wrote about. But once again due to Lord Henry's influence, he realizes that she's just a common girl.Starting with absent-minded acts Dorian slowly sinks into debauchery. And with every new act his picture becomes more grotesque while Dorian stays is young and as innocent looking as the day his picture was painted.What will become of Dorian?What will become of Dorian's painting?What would you do if you were Dorian?Oscar Wilde paints a picture himself as he describes Dorian Gray's dilemma. And we as readers travel with Dorian as each decision is made. In some places in the story Oscar Wilde seems to drag on and on with detail; however we find that this detail is necessary to set the next scene.Oscar Wilde himself led a risky life that lead to a jail sentence; is attitudes can be seen in the dialogues in this book.The Picture of Dorian Gray Starring: George Sanders, Hurd Hatfield"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Dorian Gray, a young man of high English society, possesses a beauty that any man or women would long for. However, the reader soon realizes that even the purest beauty can not save us from the horrors and intrigue of sin. After seeing his portrait, Dorian curses the fact that soon his beauty will fade and declares \\"if it were I who was to be always young, and the picture to grow old! For that - I would give everything\\". Dorian soon finds that his ill-fated wish has come true, and his portrait now carries the burden of age. As the years pass, Dorian becomes obsessed with sins and evils, for they do not afflict his personal appearance, but rather aid in the deterioration of his portrait, his soul. But, although Dorian continues to sin and think nothing of the consequences of his actions, he is consumed with an overwhelming fear that his portrait and sins will be revealed to the world. Through the actions and sins of Dorian Gray, Oscar Wilde shows human's weakness to the evils of the world. Wilde urges all readers to renounce sinning for it leads to the deterioration of one's moral principles, but more importantly, creates an everlasting fear that can destroy one's soul and eventually destroy one's desire to live. This story should be read by teenagers everywhere for it shows that the true nature of our character is judged by the beauty of one's soul, rather than the beauty of one's face."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Though it's rather slow to get going in the initial chapters, Oscar Wilde's &quot;Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; builds up into a splendidly effective piece, written in highly polished prose. Dorian Gray, who is suggestively described as &quot;charming&quot; and &quot;beautiful&quot; ... is painted by his friend and admirer, Basil Hallward. Dorian, a self-centered social luminary whose character is reminiscent of Narcissus, makes a bizarre sub-Faustian wish which tragically comes true: that his beautiful portrait may age, while he retains his youthful looks. The conclusion is disastrous, the culmination of a narrative containing elements of murder, suicide, blackmail, a confrontation in a grimy alley and an episode in an opium den. The characters are very well sketched out, particularly the triad of Dorian, Basil and the intellectual cynic, Lord Henry, Dorian's mentor and the mouthpiece of some of Wilde's most cutting amoral opinions. The style is, typically, marvellous, characterised by brilliant exchanges and aphoristic gaiety. Wilde lacerates English bourgeois culture, the conceptions of sin and virtue and the attitudes towards art of his time with tremendous aplomb. Some of his quips are patently snide, sometimes mysogynistic, as in: &quot;Woman represents the triumph of matter over mind, while man represents the triumph of mind over morals.&quot; Oh, isn't that just despicable?! I love it!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"If you could retain your youth, what would you give up? What would you be willing to barter? Imagine, you're always young, vibrant, desired and the envy of all those who age around you?The Picture of Dorian Gray doesn't set out to answer the question, just to pose it. Oscar Wilde writes like no other I've read. The prose moves along along like a tempestuous sea. It rolls, it sways, it rocks and occasionally calms before the next surge. Amazing penmanship. Verbose conversations stir between the players as they seek to answer each other's questions and address each other's comments.The main character of the book, for me, was Lord Henry Wotton. A dandy gentleman who, for his own sake, is way too educated. It always seems to be Henry who plants the seeds of thought, or challenges the conventional wisdom which, in turn, sets the other players thinking. Henry meets Dorian as his portrait is finished by Basil Hallward. Henry, struck by Dorian's youth and beauty, remarks that, as Dorian ages, the picture will constantly remind him of who he was. Dorian wishes it the other way around and, his wish is granted but, at what cost? The picture always remains at the age when Dorian was painted yet, the face reflects Dorian's soul. The soul that becomes more dark and damaged.Chapter XI of this book describes, at Sir Henry's urging, Dorian's exploration into life. I don't think I've ever read anything like it before. Oscar Wilde seemed to have gone mad with the pen as he describes riches, wealth, decadence and hedonism. The finest details of objects of desire are described so richly you can almost feel them. This outpouring of prose meanders over many pages. At the end of the chapter I let out a \\"phew\\" as I felt Wilde had probably thrown down his pen and gone for a nap. I was exhausted from reading it. How he felt after writing it is anyone's guess.Gray does some horrible things as he develops and eventually, he sees what he's become. The picture, a mirror of his soul, becomes darker and darker as his soul becomes heartless and self-serving.It's great stuff. The book is relatively short yet overflowing with rich text and thought provoking idioms. Enjoy it, digest it, this one is a classic."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"What a wonderfull book. I Love the classic's. There are plenty of great books written today, but the classic's are from other periods in time that show life in a different light."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"I picked up a an audio cd of 'The Picture of Dorian Gray' at the same time I was reading 'A Stranger's Child' by Alan Hollinghurst. Interestingly the respective narratives move through Edwardian England while peeling back the layers of sexual repression and eroticism associated with the era. The author Diana Galbaldon accomplishes this successfully, too, with attendant similar homo-erotic themes in her Lord John (Grey)series.While both listening and reading similar books simultaneously I was trying to keep the characters aligned with each story. In fact, several characters from each book have the same name. 'Dorian Gray' begins with a prologue by the author that addresses in advance the freedom to publish content that Wilde surely felt would be controversial. This proved to be prescient.The main character for whom the book is named in effect sacrifices his soul for the vanity of youth and life's experiences and excess. Up to a point, one could make a contemporary parallel to a life lived by a celebrity (i.e. Mick Jagger, Lindsay Lohan, etc.) at least from a public perception perspective. The song 'You're so Vain' by Carly Simon could easily have been written as homage to the Dorian Gray character.There exists in the story line a protagonist (the painter of the picture) and antagonist - a friend of the painter's who, arguably is a devil incarnate, guides by suggestion Dorian Gray down a path of self-gratification, vanity and excess.For those of us that recall the Twilight Zone TV series from the 1960's, this book - a classic for it's time - would have made a marvelous episode."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Oscar Wilde's \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" has appeared in nearly a dozen forms, some reflecting publishers' objections, some adding new material by Wilde to compensate for cuts, and some simply bowdlerized in pirate editions. For the first time, Wilde's original manuscript submitted for publication has been printed as he wrote and intended it, before other people's prejudices and pressure caused him to alter the text. This is a beautifully produced large format book, beautiful cover with Caravaggio's \\"Narcissus\\" cropped and darkened, detailed introduction, bibliography and analysis of the complete publishing history of this unusually tortured author and book. All variants are included in the notes and annotations. Of particular interest is the fact that it is this text, which has not previously been published, that Sir Edward Carson, Counsel for the brutal and sociopathic Marquis of Queensbury whom Wilde absurdly sued for libel over an open note in a men's club in which Queensbury, father of Wilde's infamous lover Bosie Douglas, wrote \\"Oscar Wilde posing as a somdomite (sic).\\" But for Wilde's utterly mad legal action against Queensbury, he would not have faced the tremendous wealth of testimony and written evidence placed before the civil court by Carson, and would not have been prosecuted for any crimes, as he was after losing his libel action. Many of the passages which appear only in this new edition of \\"The Picture\\" were used by Carson to paint Wilde into a corner of criminality; and it is interesting to see just which sentences and paragraphs were accumulated to impeach Wilde on cross-examination. All in all, this is a wonderful book, almost too grand for its subject matter. But then Oscar, I am sure, would have expected nothing less."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"I have seen the old movie several times, and it tempted me to order the book. Oscar Wilde was a \\"wild child\\", and he gives a glimpse into the often vain and decadant world of English society through the wanton excesses of Dorian...who appears to remain beautiful, youthful, and untouched by evil. It is Dorian's portrait that decays with every misdeed, including murder. The picture haunts Dorian as he travels among the rich, and also into the opium dens and low life of the waterfront. This edition contains a glossary of lesser known terms and references, for us modern folk. It was a quick and fascinating read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"I knew relatively little going into this book...and what little I did know was from less than 100% accurate retellings such as in League of Extraordinary Gentlemen or references from cheesy shows or horror flicks (I think perhaps there was a reference in Scooby Doo somewhere?). I had the basic gist...there's a guy, Dorian Gray, who has some magical painting that ages while he stays young and wonderful forever. Not much to go on, but I was still excited to read it. I was pleasantly surprised that the book had much more depth to it.&lt;u>Plot&lt;/u>The plot is intriguing and has been used in other stories, though I think this one has more depth than I've seen before. Essentially, Dorian makes a wish that he will be forever as pristine as the painting made of him and that instead the painting will take on it the toils of his life. Whatever supernatural forces allow this to happen are irrelevant...the wish is granted.It's more than a simple \\"young forever\\" contract. Although age plays into the plot in a couple of places, the primary things that distorts the picture are the vices that Dorian engages in. The first transformation of the painting happens after an intense argument with the first woman he loved. It was interesting to me how quickly Dorian recognized the cause of the change for what it was, but had he belabored the motive for too long, the pacing of the book would have stalled and become unacceptable.Dorian uses his \\"power\\" to be ruthlessly reckless in his living. Dorian Gray becomes entirely uninhibited, taking everything to its limit, seeking absolute pleasure. He even sneaks out at night (so as not to tarnish his pristine reputation) to the \\"bad side of town\\" and lives a sort of double life in opium dens with gangs and prostitutes.In many ways (perhaps because I so recently read it), I felt many similarities to the morale commentary presented in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. I felt that Wilde did a better job of delving into the psyche of the hypocritical character, largely because we were able to get into Dorian's head and think and feel with him, while in Jekyll/Hyde, we were kept at a distance by a third person narrative.&lt;u>Characters&lt;/u>There are three pivotal characters in this book.The first, obviously, is Dorian himself. For the first many chapters (perhaps nearly the first half of the book in fact), I wasn't terribly pleased with Dorian as a character...he felt very flat to me. He was basically a mirror to one of the other primary characters (Harry) and didn't ever show his own opinion. He was hailed as pure and beautiful. Perhaps it's all the art references in the book, but I often felt as if Dorian existed more as a classical statue than as a living, breathing character. As his interaction with the 'picture' progresses and once he takes some rather unexpected steps, he became a deeper character and a lot of fun to be with.The second primary character is Lord Harry (or was it Henry...blast those Brits for swapping those names interchangeably so often *grin*). Harry exists as the provocative, cynical, always-with-a-comment-about-anything mentor to Dorian. Harry is absolutely encouragable and a lot of fun to listen to. His speeches often have to do with the pursuit of pleasure at any and all costs and the hazard of a virtuous and peaceful life. His influence over Dorian is profound. As I mentioned above, it often felt as if Dorian existed merely as a mirror for Harry's advice. Harry didn't seem to follow all of his own advice, but Dorian took it readily to heart and strove to live a 'come-what-may' existence. Harry had some of the funniest and most profound comments of the entire narrative. He's a fabulous character.The third character I want to point out actually existed as more of a background character, but I feel the need to call him out merely because of his pivotal involvement in the plot. I actually can't even remember his name now...but it will suffice to call him, \\"the artist.\\" He's the one who paints Dorian's picture. He's the one who introduces Dorian to Harry. He's the one who tries to give Dorian good advice to counter all the reckless advice that Harry poisons him with. The artist was kind of like Dorian's \\"Jiminey Cricket\\"...his conscious that was often (always?) ignored until it was far too late. He showed up in surprisingly few scenes considering the huge importance he had to the plot.&lt;u>Style, Pacing, etc&lt;/u>The language used in this book was truly beautiful. Wilde wrote flowing, vivid descriptions of characters, places and actions. At times it was very poetic. It may be a bit too flowery for readers who don't enjoy that sort of description...it came very close to being 'over the top' to me in a few places. Still, I generally enjoyed the formality of it and the life it gave to the text. The first dozen or two pages were tedious to me...whether because of the language or just the style and thematic pacing, I'm not sure.The pacing was a bit slower than I would have liked. The main difficulty I saw was that Wilde was trying to present so many themes that he often had to result to lengthy passages praising or condemning one thing or another. There were often very long monologues by one of the three primary characters mentioned above. Harry's were generally offset by bits that made me laugh by their extremity while speeches from Dorian and the artist sometimes made me want to slap them and tell them to shut up.&lt;u>Overall&lt;/u>I was a little torn on my overall feeling for the book. It took me a while to get into it and there were long passages that were drudgerous to push through. However, from a high level, this is one of the better books I've read this year...or even for numerous years. It had a plenitude of intriguing themes that left me thinking in between readings. It had a lot of humorous quips and paradigms as presented by Harry that I laughed out loud at. It had surprising twists and tension that left me curious as to the true outcome (as opposed to that from rip-off stories). There are a couple of spots that could be considered \\"climax\\"...the confrontation with the artist is the main turning point in the book. Personally, I would have rather seen more pages after that turning point than before it. I think the last 1/3 of the book was far more engaging. At the same time, the buildup was necessary to promote the intended mood.Overall, this is a book I definitely recommend, with the caveat that you should be aware that it does slow down at points. Just push through those. The overall work is worthy of a couple of slow zones. In fact, perhaps those slow zones serve the purpose of allowing more pondering.****4.5 stars"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"This was a rather difficult book to get through.

It's too deep. A story like no other I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"While this is Oscar Wilde's only foray into novel-writing, I must say it is justifiably called a classic. The use of descriptive language and mood is exquisite.The only downsides that I can mention would be how slowly it moves in some spots. Once in a while, the story takes sort of a vacation, and you are given a lot of details that don't really apply to the overall plot. Some of the things that are discussed are good at shedding light on some of the things that Mr. Gray was doing throughout the years that this book took place, but they can get a little boring. Truth be told, I skipped most of one chapter because it went on, and on, and on about the things that piqued Dorian Gray's interest. It doesn't stop there, but it explains why it did, what he did about it, and some other people that he associated with while he was pursuing a certain subject, like gemology. In this edition, many of the names that are given through these pages are given an endnote in the back, but to the average person these don't hold much interest. Even to some hardcore fans of classic literature and Gothic Horror could find certain chapters (one at least) very tedious.That being said, there is certainly more good in this book than needed to balance out the less interesting parts. In the beginning, we get to see where the corruption of young Mr. Gray comes from. As the book progresses, you can see the corruption finally consume him, culminating in a surprising finale. I read at work, and my jaw dropped more than once, which I only realized after a co-worker brought attention to it. Even though most people have heard of the themes in the book, this is a fine example of taking an existing theme, and making it into a brilliant new idea.The ideas contained in this book can be a little disturbing to some with a weak stomach. Some of the language can be a little stiff and hard to read, but remember it was written in the 1890's.This book is highly recommended for anybody who has an interest in the Classics or Gothic Horror. Not for the faint of heart, but if it's ever crossed your mind to read The Picture of Dorian Gray, pick this book up! If you want to start reading Gothic Horror, I would suggest something a little lighter to start with -- Edgar Allan Poe, The Phantom of the Opera, or something like that. Those are a little easier, and give you a good idea of what the genre is all about.Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"\`So, Henry, how is that young Prot&eacute;g&eacute;e of yours progressing, hem?Lord Henry paused to saviour his glass. Pleased, he set it down, just so, beside his dinner plate, and turned to Lord Fermor.\`Pundits say troubles come in threes, Uncle,' replied Lord Henry. \`What the pundits omit in their gabardine rush to spread their misery to others in a foolish attempt to alleviate their own, is that the best in life never travels solo. Take, for example, the wine and dinner before us. Both French. Together they constitute a meal to entice the gods down from the Mount. When did you ever come across a bad French meal, or a good French man? Yet when wine and food march together, they repay the Creator.'\`No doubt,' replied Lord Fermor, \`but you evade the issue. I asked about the young chap you have taken into your entourage, you know.' Lord Fermor struggled to recall the name, \`that chap who poses for Mr Hallward here.'Basil Hallward felt the heat of recognition first on his brow, then running through his whole body. A retiring man, more at home with his easels and sitters than at high table, he shrank from the public glare.Recognising the signs, though failing to sympathise with them, Lady Agatha piped up.\`Mr Hallword has many sitters, do you not, Sir.'\`Er, yes, indeed I do,' replied Mr Hallward, grateful for the prompt. \`For example, just today I encountered a young man of exquisite appearance, youth in all its pomp. He has promised to sit for me. Lord Henry, I fancy, will try to take him away and teach him of the world, thereby spoiling him as a object d'art.' He laughed to denote humour, simultaneously glancing at his friend to convey the serious meaning behind his joke. Keep away Lord Henry, the glanced announced, shielded behind the laughter. Keep away from this young man lest you send him on the eternal search for fulfilment and in so doing corrupt his soul.Lord Henry roared.\\"Why Basil, you surpass yourself! Hiding a serious message behind a joke so that you may deliver it in public. Would that the Good Book decked itself in such garlands, the better to frighten the masses. You are a greater artist than your canvasses know.'\`I fear my husband is avoiding your question, Lord Fermor,' laughed Lady Victoria. \`When it comes to hiding a serious message behind the veil of farce, he may rival Dante himself.'\`What is the name of your young beauty?' Inquired Lord Henry amidst the general humour. \`I only ask,' he pressed, \`so that I may avoid him. Let us hope I have more success than Eve, who expressed no desire to harvest the only tree in the garden that contained a serpent, until admonished not to. Of course,' Lord Henry continued, \`our Creator did not warn off the firstborn with laughter on his lips. Had he done so, perhaps we would be consuming ambrosia still.

Has he a fine future, seeking the dark mysteries of life of which you profess to be so fond?'\`Should he avoid hubris, I see for him a long, comfortable and satisfactory life.'\`And should he fail to avoid hubris?' teased Lady Agatha.\`Then I see for him immortality in print and prose. Hubris is man's affirmation of his living soul, his insistence that all must be as he ordains, and his rage that it is not. Should Basil paint hubris he would reveal Caliban.\`Modesty, on the other hand, is pleasing to the casual senses but fleeting, like snow on the chimneystack. Modesty and prose combine to produce the barely adequate. Hubris and prose combine to produce immortality, but not personal happiness.'\`And this choice, modesty of hubris, is one you see before Dorian Gray?' queried Mr Hallword.\`Dorian who?'

He reached again for the reassuring certainty in his wine glass. \`I was referring to my Prot&eacute;g&eacute;e, Oscar Wilde.'"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde is definitely a disturbing book. I think there is great worth in reading it, particularly when paired with a book such as Uncle Tom's Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowe or Les Miserables by Victor Hugo. Contrasting Dorian's sordid downfall with with the heroic ascension of Uncle Tom or Jean Valjean is particularly beneficial.The Picture of Dorian Gray begins with Dorian, a young and handsome gentleman who is involved with philanthropy, sitting for a portrait while his new friend, Lord Henry, a sarcastic and hedonistic man of society, watches on. Dorian is described as being \\"unspotted from the world\\" and his beauty inspires the artist to his very best work. Lord Henry exclaims how lovely the portrait has turned out, but laments that it is too bad that the picture will stay young forever, whereas Dorian will eventually age and lose his youth and beauty. A vexed Dorian makes a wish that he will stay timeless and the picture will age instead of him.Taking Lord Henry as a mentor, Dorian sets out to apply Lord Henry's selfish and narcissistic worldview into nearly every facet of his life. In time, Dorian realizes that his wish has magically come true. He remains beautiful, while his painting takes on all the consequences of his wicked actions. As the debased Dorian sins more and more, the picture becomes more hideous and tortures Dorian's soul.Despite being filled with Wilde's signature wit, this is a haunting story showing the consequence of selfish character and the downfall of the soul due to despicable and hideous behaviors. Dorian loses his inner beauty long before he realizes that his soul's ugliness will destroy him.It's interesting to note that he chooses a French novel as his own Core Book, a personal classic which guided him throughout his life. In comparison, Uncle Tom and Jean Valjean both chose the Bible as their Core book. Near the end of the book, Dorian laments, \\"You poisoned me with a book once. I should not forgive that. Harry, promise me that you will never lend that book to any one. It does harm.\\"Wilde clearly shows that books exert an amazing influence over our lives. We must be wise in our choice of what we read. As Thoreau once said, \\"Read the best books first, or you may not have the chance to read them at all.\\" I would only add to that, \\"Read the best books most often, for they will color your soul.\\""},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"A classic and moving novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde discusses man's desire for youth, as well as his involvement in vanity. A tale of two differing personalities, the story is enticing, yet grippingOscar Wilde does an excellent job of revealing the contrasting atmospheres throughout the book. He does a fine job depicting the lighter side of Dorian Gray with images of life and excitement for example when he is getting painted, the light is bright and it takes place near a garden filled with beautiful flowers. Wilde is also able to portray the dark and menacing side in Dorian Gray as he eventually commits murder. Dorian Gray comes off as such a complicated character which makes him so interesting. He wants to fulfill his desires but is unable to do so successfully. People can feel how each person has a part of Dorian Gray in him or her. We all have our flaws we want to fix, but we should not become obsessive over them or it leads to destruction as seen in the book.The story is fascinating in that it is able to capture reader's interest because the mysteries in the plot are so intriguing. Although the book has that characteristic gothic element of a man living without the fear of death or consequence, The picture of Dorian Gray is still an accomplishment because it is written beautifully through the character description.The Picture of Dorian Gray is worth the read, as readers are guaranteed to be captivated by the mysteries the character Dorian Gray holds."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"The Story:Dorian Gray is an adonis who is reminded or rather made attentive to his own beauty by a gentle artist friend (or lover) of his, Basil Hallward, who makes a breathtaking portrait of Gray. The portrait eventually becomes a favorite with Dorian, which also mirrors, in its painted face a sombre reflection of his own misdeeds and immoralities -- each time he commits it -- by growing uglier and uglier. He guards it with extreme care and caution everyday wanting none to see it found marred by his iniquities. Early in the story Dorian happens to meet with a reckless rich man, Lord Henry, a friend of Basil, who cares not a tithe for morality and its dull unattractive ways but believes in living life to the fullest at any cost. He preaches hedonism as sacred and purity a sin. Both Lord Henry and Dorian take an instant liking towards each other the day they meet. This friendship has an obvious deleterious effect on Dorian in that he kills himself repentantly after realising the worthlessness of his having lived a pompous, immoral, wicked and greedy life. Just before the story ends, he kills his well-wisher Basil too.How the story is arranged:Initially, the first few chapters seem to move fast and the story gains momentum. Just as the reader becomes inquisitive, a dull tone appears making the following chapters languorous. Wilde becomes a bit didactic in elaborating on the various interests Dorian picks on in his later adult life. Also, as one naturally imagines Dorian as a young lad, we then suddenly find him a thirties something in the last few chapters without a clear and smooth manifestation of this transition from adolescence to manhood. Most of Dorian's life is sinfully adventurous and in spite of that is portrayed quite uninterestingly. No events are specifically narrated upon and the emphasis on homosexuality can be smoothly sidelined. Overall, the story is good only if viewed as a philosophical inquest into human nature. Anything beyond that may disappoint the reader.Relevance, Reflections and Conclusion:The entire story is a narration of essentially how importantly one's mind makes one's personality, how one's personality makes one's deeds, and how in turn those deeds make one's soul. Of course we do not really fashion our soul, we only help it manifest it through our deeds. Gray's character is a reflection of the kind of narcissist weaklings in humanity who lack the courage to face their dark corners, while constantly finding strength and support in being mentored (actually misled) by feckless perverse people, like Lord Henry here, who lead them increasingly towards moral obscurity. How different the world would be if each one of us could reason out \\"responsibly\\" all that seems perverse and sacred, and yet not give in to anything perverse or sacred until one has found it true himself! I have also found the concept of blame game in this story very interesting. Do we not often dutifully blame others for our own darkness and failures, just as Dorian Gray blames his friend Basil Hallward for turning him into a deplorable narcissist? A responsible man always shares the burden of his own actions, rather than carelessly and callously point fingers at others -- a good lesson to learn! The story also raises deep philosophical arguments at every nook and corner if one plunges deep into the characters of the story attentively. Simple sentences like \\"Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing\\" had me thinking and I found it strongly relevant in today's consumeristic hegemony. There are many more such dialogues which raise questions about the importance of femininity, marriage, purity, aestheticism and so on. Anyhow, to read it for its \\"own sake\\", or to try to finish it in a hurry, will certainly make it very boring and tiresome. But for those who inveterately love to question and investigate the world they live in with its various dogmas, theologies, philosophies and doctrines either propagating or thrashing morality, this book makes an interesting read. Since I do not possess a bent of mind that appreciates a tragic ending, -- I consider human life very precious --, I was sorely disappointed to see the protagonist, Dorian Gray, dead in the end. In fact I find this style of defeatist writing/ending a flaw in itself though it appeals to many. Plainly, if I were the author, I would have given my protagonist a new life, a new philosophy, a new guidance, and a new hope. HOPE...without which the entire humanity cannot exist."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"When THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY was first published in 1890, England was still in the last throes of a Victorian morality that still prided itself on all sorts of morality, especially sexual prudery. Into this realm of things which were not dared to be spoken, along came Oscar Wilde to say them. Wilde's gay background formed a subtext both in the novel and in his personal life that both titillated and repelled much of England.THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY is a reworking of the popular literary motif of the consequences of making a deal with the devil. The average Englishmen well knew of Marlowe's Dr. Faustus who had signed such a pact with Mephistopheles involving the exchange of power and knowledge for Faustus' soul. Every human being has a soul worth bartering; Wilde dared to suggest to a homophobic England that even a gay man's soul was as well.Dorian Gray is a young, handsome man whose portrait is painted by Basil Hallward. Beginning with the very introduction of Gray, Wilde consistently combines two seemingly unrelated themes: the role of the artist in society and the role of the gay man in that same society. In the Preface to his book, Wilde maintains his aesthetic belief that the only purpose of art is to have no purpose: \\"All art is useless.\\" Wilde connects this inutility about the nonpurpose of art with the aging and the dissipation of the painting that grows progressively more unattractive the more that Gray sins. Lord Henry Wotton, who is surprisingly the most interesting character in the book with his witty epigrams and biting cynicisms, is the rou&eacute; who leads--or perhaps seduces--an initially innocent Dorian into a life on nonstop debauchery. Dorian, urged on by Wotton to drop Dorian's newest girlfriend, the actress Sybil Vane, crudely berates what he saw as a second rate theatrical performance, causing her to commit suicide in grief at his cutting remarks. After her death, Wotton leads Dorian into a two decade long life fall into sin. Eventually, Dorian considers it time to clean up his act and this is where many readers have become confused with Dorian's advice about art in the Preface and Wotton's advice about art in the book. When Wilde asserts in the Preface that art is useless, he rejects the current Victorian notion that art ought to be used for the betterment of humanity. He states that the contrary is true. Art must not be used for betterment. He further implies that his belief's corollary must be true too: that art cannot harm human life. In fact, as he finishes his Preface, he notes, \\"All art is useless.\\" Yet, in the novel, Wotton rejects Dorian's claim that his painting has led Dorian's beauty on a straight line road to disaster--for Dorian, for Sybil, and earlier for Basil, whom Dorian has murdered. What is apparent, at least to Wotton if not to Dorian, is that it was not art that was responsible for their deaths, but Dorian, who in his hubris wanted to assume the same mantle of godlike near immortality that damned Faustus centuries earlier. Thus, art had nothing to do with Dorian's descent into evil. It was nothing more prosaic than pride gone berserk.Wilde's not so subtle intent at painting his own portrait of a homoerotic connection between Wotton, Dorian, and debauchery has also been a source of much confusion. Wilde could not afford to state explicitly that Dorian was involved on a gay level with Wotton, Adam Campbell or anyone else, but it is pretty clear that homoeroticism was just one in a long line of events that Wilde knew would point out the ongoing degradation of Dorian. But if Wilde allowed Dorian to escape the consequences of his seduction by Wotton, then he might not have been able to find a publisher. It was hard enough the way it was to do that.Readers today regard THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY as a fascinating if not a dated period piece about trading one's soul for forbidden delights, but no other book warns of the consequences as eloquently as this one."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"I picked up this book to read, partly because I am a big fan of Wilde's plays, and partly because the concept behind this novel has become such a part of our collective conscious that I wanted to know what was behind it.It was filled with all the wit and cynicism that I expect from Wilde, but, I found it to be a bit tiresome to read. I suspect that this is partially due to the fact that it is so solidly grounded in the late 1800's that the concerns of the characters are a bit distant.Still, I must say that I feel that it is a book worth reading. Anything that has seared itself into the western world's consciousness is worth investigating."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"To my mind, this is one of the best works in all of English literature. Oscar Wilde is a artist who uses the page as his canvas and the written word as his paint. His wit cuts at the human condition like a scalpel with depth and precision. Dorian Gray is his finest work.This is a Faustian tale of a man who utters an oath offering his soul for the youth portrayed in a painting of him, if only it would age instead of he. He discovers that the wish has been granted, only he gets more than he requested, as the painting shows not only the marks of age, but also the marks upon his soul as he slips into a hedonistic and odious life.I have read a lot of criticism of this book by modern and especially young readers as being slow and boring. This is much like the criticism of a beer guzzler describing a fine wine. \\"Forget the bouquet and refined taste, just give me my buzz.\\" This story, and the subtle philosophies contained within, need to be sipped deliberately and relished. There is page after page of astute insight into the paradoxes and ironies of society and the mysteries of being human. To be bored with this is to be insensate to life's depth and meaning.Many have also criticized the book as espousing hedonism and attacking Victorian society especially at the time it was written. Such critics wrongly assume that Lord Henry is Wilde's mouthpiece for a fatalistic and cynical philosophy. Actually, the exact opposite is true. The cynic is the one being satirized, not society.Lord Henry uses paradoxical aphorisms to bolster his sardonic view. However, they are specious and self validating arguments that look at the small truths about the world and draw the wrong conclusion. Rather than assume that these eccentricities and foibles are things that we can and should rise above, he draws the conclusion that we should embrace and accept our instinctive weaknesses. He ignores the higher truths and points out instead how the capitulation to our own desires sets us free. Wilde's refutation of this philosophical connivance comes in the person of Dorian Gray.Dorian was Lord Henry's prot&eacute;g&eacute;. He was living the life that Harry espoused (but ironically didn't live himself). And what was the result of Dorian's decadence? He lived a life of torment and self loathing. He agonized over the hideous marks on his soul as catalogued by the portrait with each dastardly deed. Wilde is telling us that this is what such self indulgence and cynicism about life and society brings. His message is that a civilized society, with all its inconsistencies, paradoxes and ironies, is preferable and superior to living like an animal. By smiting Dorian, he is really smiting Lord Henry and everything he advocates. He is making a case for the soul over the body; intellect over instinct.This is an exquisite and thought provoking treasure that is every bit as relevant now as it was almost a century ago when it was written. I have read it a number of times through the years and I never tire of it. As I have gotten older and more experienced, its truths have become more vivid and resonant. If you've never read it, pick it up and savor it. Don't rush through it for the plot. Ponder it as you read. If you have already read it, put it away and try it again in five or ten years. You may discover new meaning, and much that you missed. That's the beauty of a timeless novel. Its wisdom will wait patiently until you've had time to catch up."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray, a story of morals, psychology and poetic justice, has furnished Oscar Wilde with the status of a classical writer. It takes place in 19th-century England, and tells of a man in the bloom of his youth who will remain forever young.Basil Hallward is a merely average painter until he meets Dorian Gray and becomes his friend. But Dorian, who is blessed with an angelic beauty, inspires Hallward to create his ultimate masterpiece. Awed by the perfection of this rendering, he utters the wish to be able to retain the good looks of his youth while the picture were the one to deteriorate with age. But when Dorian discovers the painting cruelly altered and realizes that his wish has been fulfilled, he ponders changing his hedonistic approach.Dorian Gray's sharp social criticism has provoked audible controversy and protest upon the book's 1890 publication, and only years later was it to rise to classical status. Written in the style of a Greek tragedy, it is popularly interpreted as an analogy to Wilde's own tragic life. Despite this, the book is laced with the right amounts of the author's perpetual jaunty wit."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Basil, who up until now was a mediocre painter after meeting Dorian Gray a young Adonis, was inspired to create a masterpiece of which he puts himself into. Against Basil's wishes, Dorian Gray is influenced by Basil's friend Lord Henry. Dorian looks at his portrait and realizes that while the portrait will stay young forever, he will grow old; so Dorian makes a wish that if only he could stay young forever and the portrait can age.At first Dorian does not realize his wishes been granted. He falls in love with a beautiful young actress who is every woman that Shakespeare ever wrote about. But once again due to Lord Henry's influence, he realizes that she's just a common girl.Starting with absent-minded acts Dorian slowly sinks into debauchery. And with every new act his picture becomes more grotesque while Dorian stays is young and as innocent looking as the day his picture was painted.What will become of Dorian?What will become of Dorian's painting?What would you do if you were Dorian?Oscar Wilde paints a picture himself as he describes Dorian Gray's dilemma. And we as readers travel with Dorian as each decision is made. In some places in the story Oscar Wilde seems to drag on and on with detail; however we find that this detail is necessary to set the next scene.Oscar Wilde himself led a risky life that lead to a jail sentence; is attitudes can be seen in the dialogues in this book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"This has to be one of my favorite books of all time. This is breath-takingly honest look at life when the physical is all we look at...and many of us do.From the brilliant quotes to the numerous times when Dorian Gray proves what a scoundrel he is, this book makes any reader think and enjoy their own lives much more to see what that type of thinking causes. Here is a man who looks lke a Greek God and he takes everything for granted because he knows his powers will never allow his looks to be tarnished. Then he loses his sanity and actually commits murder on his artis who painted him and then does himself in!Not only brilliant, but pretty funny, too!Check out this book! It's a once in a lifetime experience!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"This is one of the most interesting books I have ever read. There is a lot of philosophy packed into this short, fictitious account of several (three main characters) rich men who live life in a very nonchalant, yet formal environment. The characters are developed beautifully and invoke strong emotion toward each one. I found myself hating Henry, loving Basil and having strange mixed feelings for Dorian. While there are a lot of different views in regard to the overarching theme of the book, I believe (along with what seems like a majority) that the book is about morality. Man left to his own logic (shown in the character of Henry) is left only with death, and a meaningless existence. Dorian shows (I believe) the struggle of man in choosing a morality outside of human authority and logic. Dorian loses the struggle and of course it ends with his own death, which in reality is the logical conclusion to a life lived for one's own pleasure.It is interesting to note that Oscar Wilde was an accomplished painter himself, and got the idea for this book through an actual experience. I thoroughly enjoyed the story, and the different themes that the book brought out."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"First let me say that this is a very good story. I truly did enjoy reading this book and read it in a matter of days. I very much like the modern library version since it had nice print along with some good notes.Second, this is a deep story. The first 100 pages is about the philosophy of Lord Henry. I am not sure but I equate Lord Henry to the devil. It is either that or the devil is working through Lord Henry. Thoughout the book, it appears that Lord Henry knows what is going on with Dorian even though he was not around when certain events took place. One must read and then read again chapter two of this book. This is the chapter that reveals Lord Henry's philosophy. It is deep so I had to read that chapater twice.After the first 100 pages and it is clear what the picture represents, it becomes much more of a fast paced novel. However, chapter XI (11) is a difficult read. At the end of chapter X (10) Dorian is only 19 years old. At the beginning of chapter XII (12) he is now 38 years old. Chapter 11 basically gives you a history of his life in those 19 years. It seems as if it was added later to give this history. It did add a little to the story but not too much.I very much liked how the book ended but it seemed a little quick for me. However, this book did get me thinking and that is the point of the story.Given that this is a short book (only 254 pages) it is well worth the read. I recommend to anyone that has any type of interest in Gothic stories read this book. Even if you don't have an interest in Gothic stories, this is still a very good, quick read. You will not be disappointed that you read this book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"The greatest marriage of classic literature and modern philosophy, poetry masquerading as prose, and a psychological epic in art-house clothing ever created! The genius of Oscar Wilde knew no bounds, and this book remains disturbingly chilling and alarmingly familiar over a hundred years after its first controversial publication. Though the plot could never exist anywhere outside of fiction, it is at once starkly shocking and believeable, never once wavering from the quietly accusing mood set early on.Dorian Gray is a beautiful youth who becomes painter Basil Hallward's artistic obsession, and the masterpiece painting Basil creates of Dorian seems to mock the young man, who grows jealous of the fact that it will never grow old or ugly, as he knows he will. He silently curses the painting and wishes it would age instead of him, and eerily enough, the painting becomes in itself a picture of Dorian's vain, ugly, hedonistic, and murderous soul.Indelibly true and deliciously quirky, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a treasure trove of genius observations and statements so true and yet so stunning you'll be forced to look over it a second time, just to make sure you didn't miss any of Wilde's poignant words. Well worth your time and energy, this book is reason enough to fake sick from school or work so you'll have the extra time to read it."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Oscar Wilde is a man who is obsessed by appearances. In this particular novel, he follows from the moment Dorian Gray sells his soul to the devil named beauty and youth, pleasure and enjoyment, to his death and he describes how someone who looks perfect, perfectly young, intelligent, brilliant, beautiful, moral and healthy is in fact nothing but a monster decaying in all possible immoral actions, deeds and ways just under the surface. It is a very strong criticism of victorian society that considers appearances as more important than real ethics and morality. He exposes the hypocrisy of such a society where a whole class of people are nothing but perambulating pictures of perfection hiding the mire and mud of crime and evil. We can also feel another dilemma in this book. Oscar Wilde's own dilemma who has to keep up appearances, the appearances of a well behaved, well educated and perfectly integrated man in this aristocratic society of his, and who yet lives a passion and a whole basket of desires and impulses that are absolutely rejected as crimes by victorian society. We know he will not be able to hide this deeper nature forever. But the book shows that no one can evade one's being exposed and rejected, condemned and sentenced to some punishment forever. There always comes a moment when one will be exposed and rejected. This shows how deeply Oscar Wilde must have suffered in his life. The painting is nothing but a mirror of the deeper self of Dorian Gray, but a mirror who will become one day his accuser.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Perpignan."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"I knew what this story was about long before finally reading it. That's probably common. The famous premise is a fascinating one, though I found myself wondering if the narrative would have been even more impactful if written as a short story or novella length rather than stretched out to a full novel. The Lord Henry character who serves the purpose of putting bad ideas in Dorian's head gives multiple speeches throughout detailing his hedonistic world view. If the number or word count of these lectures was cut in half I don't think the story would suffer much from the absence. Another decision made by Oscar Wilde was not to show readers very much of Dorian's behavior. His first act of cruelty is laid out before us as is his final one, but in between we are only told that his bad reputation precedes him without being shown what he has done to earn it. It's left to our imagination. A few more scenes exhibiting decadent behavior rather than various dinner party conversations in which a pro decadence philsophy is expressed would have made for a juicier read. Would it have made for a better read? That's arguable, as perhaps it also is whether this book is intententially homoerotic or simply written during a time when heterosexual men were much more comfortable going on and on about how good looking a guy was. What's beyond debate is that Oscar Wilde came up with a great idea to build a story around, one that is as timeless as the desire for eternal youth."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"I've developed a general rule to avoid free Kindle editions of virtually anything, and it paid off handsomely when I picked this edition. There were two Penguin Kindle editions. This one for $.99 and another for free. As with other free Kindle editions labelled \\"Penguin\\", the edition was not Penguin, it was a \\"Pocket Book\\" edition. This one, for a buck, is true blue Penguin.To further validate my point, this edition has many addins which are often missing from a cheap Kindle edition. First, it has a history of the book's writing and publication, an outline of Wilde's life, an excellent bibliography covering both 19th and 20th century works, two appendices on 19th century reviews of the book and on the provinance of this edition. It also has notes on the chapters which explain things understood by a late 19th century Londoner, but which have been lost to us. An example is the term \\"Japanese effect\\" referring to a style adopted by some late 19th century painters, mimicing some aspects of Japanese art. A leading example was the great portrait artist, James MacNeill Whistler.In a word, it is a complete, genuine Penguin edition, cheap."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"I was reading the graphic novel: Jaka's Story (Cerebus, volume 5) by Dave Sim and Gerhard (which I strongly recommend anyone to read, together with the sequence: Cerebus, volume 6, Melmoth) when I met the fictional character &quot;Oscar&quot;.In that story, &quot;Oscar&quot; discussed with Jaka's husband, Rick, about a poisonous book (&quot;The Picture of Alfred Douglas&quot;), written by a certain Lord Henry Wotton! Any resemblance with the reality? :) &quot;Oscar&quot; told that he asked to Lord Henry how did he explain his success after saying that &quot;to be popular one must be mediocre&quot;? Lord Henry answered him that &quot;in this matter as in many others, he was the exception that proved the rule&quot;.Reading these passages, I was charmed with the Oscar Wilde character and decided to read the true &quot;The Portrait of Dorian Gray&quot; written by the true Oscar Wilde.I think the passages in Cerebus clarified to me what this book was about (modern graphic novels have the power to illuminate one's thoughts). One should not read this book looking for coherence. All the characters are incoherent, and this is one of the genial points in this book. People are not coherent, so fictional character must not be coherent either!In the preface the author, himself, says that art is quite useless, though it is the thing he loves most to do! The artist Basil says initially that a picture, done with heart, belongs to the artist. Later, he gives the picture to Dorian Gray. Henry Wotton throws along all the story a series of poisonous thoughts that he doesn't follow!Other genial point is that Dorian, although being evil (and could be considered a villain in his own story) is not punished for what he does!Sybil Vane commits suicide because of him, but nobody was able to connect her death with him. Later, he kills Basil, but he just disappears with the body, with no consequences. Near the end, when we think that he is going to be killed by Sybil Vane's brother, he escapes easily from him. Only when, by caprice, he makes the foolishness of trying to destroy his portrait, is that he finds death. That is, he dies merely by accident, not because of his vicious or crimes.If, instead, he just tried to cut the picture he would learn that it would have the effect of hurting himself physically. Then he would guard the picture, and proceed living his life of eternal youth and beauty (that is, until some day some insects, or rats, or something, decided to eat his canvas... :) )These are for me the mistakes of many writers, and what turns the end of many stories so boring and so unsatisfactory! The first one is that they want to produce a plot and tie all the characters of the story (as though it was necessary, and as though all characters deseverd to be well developed!!). The second is to try to create characters that evolve learning with their mistakes (as if everybody learned with their mistakes and stopped continuing doing them for all their lives!!!).Borrowing the words of Lisa Simpson (in one of those funny, crazy, genial, Simpsons' stories), the moral of Dorian Grays story is that it has no moral!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"All art is quite useless. Or so believed Oscar Wilde, perhaps the foremost member of the Aestheticism movement of the late nineteenth century. Wilde and his followers believed in art for art's sake: he thought his works needed no meaning beyond beauty. The Picture of Dorian Gray achieves some level of philosophical meaning nevertheless, but whether the book is worthy of the label 'genius' is questionable.This novel tells the story of Dorian Gray, a vain young man with a powerful personality. At the beginning of the novel Dorian has a portrait painted by the artist Basil Hallward, and Basil decides never to publish the painting because he put too much of himself into it. Dorian keeps the painting, wishing that its image would grow old while he himself stayed young. Eventually his wish comes true, and his increasingly Epicurean lifestyle causes the painting to rapidly age and grow uglier while Dorian himself stays young and beautiful.Despite its authors claims about art, the novel provides considerable insight into human behavior and the depths of apathy and vanity a man can reach. It is at times horrifying, but at others the writing itself can seem vain. Wilde often seems more concerned with flattering himself through his writing than with producing anything valuable which, of course, is consistent with his aesthetic philosophy, but that hardly benefits the reader, and I at least disagree with Wilde and believe that a work of art with no real value should not be considered art. Strewn throughout the novel are quotable passages which give the impression of intellectual depth but at closer inspection seem to contain little more than vanity: \\"I like persons better than principles, and I like persons with no principles better than anything else in the world.\\" \\"Is insincerity such a terrible thing? I think not. It is merely a method by which we can multiply our personalities.\\"I did enjoy the novel overall and found it insightful, but I think Wilde's writing is generally too selfish, which is a natural result of his philosophy: the core issue is that I disagree with his philosophy and am therefore bound to find at least some fault with the art it produces."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"This is quite a book. Mr. Wilde has quite a literary ability. His characters are as vibrant as a Van Gogh, his plot is tense, and he has quite a gift for quips and comebacks. All of this combines for a great piece of literature, regardless of the topic or story.This book explores the darker side of humanity, along the lines of Faust, Dr. Jekyll, and Lord of the Flies. We all feel this dread and anxiety deep within our soul; Wilde does not hold a mirror, but a picture for us to look upon and marvel. You get the chills up and own your spine as you watch Lord Henry seduce Dorian Grey.I think the high point of the story was in Chapter XI when Dorian sets a mirror next to the foul picture and goes back and forth looking at his baby-face and then the incubus in the painting. What is crucial is that Dorian is so detached: he sees himself as the smooth-faced god, but in reality, he is the demon in the picture. But his detachment is what is so crucial. He knows what his soul looks like, but he doesn't care!At times this books seems like a play, which has Wilde's native element. But the prose has such a smooth flow that you do not notice. I found myself constantly underlining Wilde's aphorism. He has a gift for one-liners, and his book is quite a charming read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"The book is very interesting, although it starts out slow.

It may be fiction, but truth lies within the pages of this book. Oscar Wilde has painted a truly perfect representation of the human species with his character Dorian Gray. A character so full of life that you can't help but be drawn into the book. I was unable to put it down after reading the first page!When you open this book, you are not just reading a story, you are looking into a mirror. You see yourself in Dorian Gray's position as he goes through his trials and tribulations. Regardless of who you are, everyone feels and, at some point, thinks along the line's of Dorian Gray. For some, they may have even traveled down a similar path. It is for this reason that Oscar Wilde was able to create such a realistic character. He created something that people can relate to because each of us has a Dorian Gray within us, at least, to some degree.I don't know if Wilde meant to be so philosophical or psychological with this story, but it is a work of genius. I believe that this book should be part of the required reading material in some age appropriate schools. I doubt that it will, but I feel the character of Dorian Gray and his 'life' would be an eye opener for many.I highly recommend this book to anyone even vaguely curious about it.

Lord Henry's efforts to corrupt Dorian work quickly. Convinced that youth and beauty are the only things worth having in life, Dorian looks upon his finished portrait with cruel jealousy. His image will never grow old, but he will.One wish sends the plot of the novel into action: Dorian wishes the portrait would age, while he stays youthful.Enter a lover whose heart Dorian breaks. Her despair coerces her to suicide. With her death on his conscience, he notices an evil glint in the eye of his portrait. Over the years, Basil's painting begins to age. Dorian sabotages reputations and even commits murder, all the while looking as young and beautiful as he did on the day his portrait was painted. However, the portrait-a grotesque reminder of his double life-documents every immoral act.Focusing on duplicity and aestheticism, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a captivating and cinematic tale. Oscar Wilde's knack for dialogue is what made him a famous playwright and parts of Dorian Gray are rich with clever play-like exchanges.Lord Henry's wit is exceptionally tantalizing. But he doesn't seem to take himself too seriously, whereas Dorian adopts everything Lord Henry preaches with the conviction of a Southern Baptist. He's basically just a dumb pretty person that everyone coddles despite the fact that he's a terrible human being.**Side note**The Picture of Dorian Gray is Oscar Wilde's only novel. The book was scandalous when it was released in 1891 because of clear homoerotic undertones. Dorian's lovers are both men and women.

Woven through its themes of beauty, decadence, age, and the nature of art is a thread of shimmering doom that becomes more poignant the longer one spends with DORIAN GRAY and the more one considers its relationship with its author.It is a peacock's fan of luminous wit and glimmering color, dripping with venom and smelling of strange perfumes. We are all familiar with the general flavor of things: an innocent and exceptionally beautiful youth has his portrait painted one fateful afternoon; upon viewing the piece, he is paralyzed by the sudden revelation that one day he will be old and hideous while the painting will retain its beauty and life. In a devil's bargain, he wishes that it would be the other way around. And then, under the influence of a particularly deleterious gentleman, Dorian Gray begins to change: his innocence gives way to corruption and his beauty seems apt to languish under the spell of opium, cruelty, and languor. One day Dorian notices that the painting has begun to transform, while he himself retains all the beauty of an innocent despite the ever-swelling ocean of his sins...Few works of literature are as effervescent as DORIAN GRAY and just as few are as utterly pessimistic; that it is capable of fusing remarkably disparate parts into a whole that is absolutely cohesive is a fascinating example of its author's gifts. Like Wilde's SALOME, DORIAN GRAY is as colorful as it is bleak, and even its weaknesses, in context, seem like strengths.Seldom is an artist's most famous work also his most erudite and brilliant: this is one of those works. I have approached it perhaps six or seven times in the last five years, and each reading has left me more enraptured than the last--which is high praise for a novel that relies a great deal on suspense and aesthetic splendour. I consider it one of the finest things I have ever read--daring, sultry, venomous, eloquent, and radiant in its own decay.(From my Gothic fiction blog:[...]"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"My impetus for reading this book, since I read few novels, was a book entitled \\"The Ripper Code\\" by Thomas Toughill. That book's author posed the theory that in writing \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\\" Oscar Wilde was attempting to point the finger of guilt at one of his erstwhile friends, and possible homosexual lovers, as London's \\"Jack the Ripper.\\" This intrigued me, particularly since Wilde's book was published only a year or so after the last of the Ripper murders, and, as Toughill noted, Wilde and his suspect lived only about six miles from the Whitechapel district, where the murders took place, and Wilde clearly chose the date of the last Ripper murder, November 9, 1889, as the date which brought his story to its climax. So, in reading this book, I couldn't help but bear that in mind.After reading this book, it is clear that Wilde based some, if not all, of the main characters in his novel on persons whom he knew and, in all likelihood, on actual conversations he had had with those and other prominent people in London society. And there are certainly clear similarities between at least two of the most prominent characters in his novel and Wilde's friends: namely Dorian Gray, himself, and Wilde's presumed suspect, George Francis \\"Frank\\" Miles, an artist who contracted syphilis and died in 1891 shortly after the final Ripper murder; and Dorian's first love and suicide victim, the young actress Sybyl Vane, and the actress, Lilly Langtree, who Miles and Wilde both knew in her early days and whose career they clearly advanced. Other than that, however, there is little to suggest that Wilde was attempting to point the finger of guilt at Miles or at anyone else.As for the novel itself, I found it to be extremely interesting and hard to put down. I was particularly impressed by the author's apparent insight into human nature, as reflected in some of the ideas expounded on many occasions by Dorian Gray's friend and mentor, Lord Henry Wotton. Some of those passages were rather long, and perhaps a little tedious, but still interesting if one persisted. I consider this to be a classic which most readers would enjoy, but, in my view, Wilde simply drew on his experiences and chose certain events and characters to help sell his book. Frank Miles can rest in peace --- at least for now."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"This book was so well written and covers so many important, seemingly timeless dilemmas that I felt guilty while I was reading it. Even though there is no explicit language, there was a subtle sexual undertone throughout the work that was frightening. It is one of those books that people love to hate and hate to love because it hits so close to home for people in so many walks of life. I think the reason it can touch so many people is because it makes people wonder about how well their friends would think they are doing rather than how well they themselves think they are doing. \\"What would I look like if the mirror were to show my 'inner' self rather than my 'outer' self?\\" is the pervasive question here."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"I enjoyed reading this book I chose it because of the Author.

It provides an interesting look on the society of the time through this multi-layeredstory, and Dorian Gray is a perfect representation of the human species. The novel depicts anundeniable influence of the French Decadence movement of the late 19th century, and allows thereader to understand better why it upset the British society that was emerging from the socialconstraints of Victorianism. I appreciated the beauty of his writing style, always elegant, witha flow that looks like poetry all along the book. The conversations exchanged are also witty andpoignant.Maybe some people could find the flow of the story quite slow, or with too many descriptions,which may not give enough room for imagination. Also the text was a little small, but remainedvery readable.Anyway, I highly recommend this book.

You're supposed to read it because it's a classic (no need for quotes around classic). On the other hand, it's pretty much about giving in to one's lesser wants and needs. We've all probably seen Dorian at one time or another. If we're lucky, we see him before the fall. There is something about a beautiful youth who has yet to fell the fingers of corruption. Many have seen him during the process of corruption (gosh...we may have even participated in said corruption). We've probably even seen him near the end of the process. Oscar Wilde's novel is brilliant. It covers the process of corruption very well. The ending is cliche, but it wasn't (probably) at the time.And, since I'm writing this for the e-book (uncensored), the model on the cover of the book is, ummmmm..., worth considering being corrupted by or corrupting."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"This free classic version for my Kindle was very good!

The book builds up beautifully towards the climax. Wilde's generates idle irreverent amoral and bitingly sarcastic dialogue as if out of thin air."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a masterpiece of English literature from the 1800's. It's easy to see why the book aroused so much controversy when it was released, and why it had an integral role in Wilde's subsequent imprisonment: the moral dilemna the book presents is disturbing even today. Wilde was truly a great writer; it's obvious from reading this book. Not only was his wit top-notch as is often ackwnoledged, but his prose is very smooth and polished, very refined. Wilde's attitudes towards art are well-known - indeed, he says in the book's introduction that \\"all art is quite useless\\" - but it seems obvious now that he was a natural talent. I hesitate to say things like He was meant to be a writer, but it certainly seems true of Wilde. This is one of the books that shakes our moral foundations. Wilde's high-class lifestyle is well-documented - it seems his surname was utterly appropriate - and one can definitely see where the plot and perhaps some of the details of this book came from his own experience. Undoubtedly, the main premise of the novel - a man selling his soul for eternal youth - most likely sprung from a desire that Wilde himself expressed. Perhaps he was having doubts about his hedonistic lifestyle even when this book was written, several years before his imprisonment. One can conjecture all one wants, but the fact remains that this book is a marvelous piece of work. The wonderful, polished prose is a joy to read - with aphorisms abound - and I, for one, see it as a deep regret that this was the only novel Wilde ever wrote. We missed out on a lot of great literature, especially with the general disdain the plays are now looked upon with in our society. Alas, read this masterpiece, and you will miss out less."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"I read this book in 6th grade and have loved it ever since. It's rich and compelling words are fantastically written and portyayed in the mind frightfully real and visual. Oscar Wilde is one of my all-time favourite writers and I congratulate his excellence of writing and choice of description. After his two year sentence on Abnormal Sexual Vice his career literaly ended but even though he is gone, his writing is still fresh, enjoyable, and always a favourite."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"&quot;Every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist...&quot; says Oscar Wilde's Basil Hallward - and every book is the author's autobiography. Wilde provides an irresistible coupling of his fascinating wisdom and seductive voice in THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY, a self-portrait.In a story of forbidden love, Wilde languishes in an idyllic setting eager with curous onlookers whom he delights in stimulating. He insists upon being provocative and alluring, taking 'strange pleausre in saying things that he is not sorry about having said.' THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY is an image drawn by a lover whose passion for realism is transcended only by the hands of a writer who leaves everything to your imagination. As Dorian Gray protests, &quot;Let me think. Or, rather, let me try not to.&quot;But this IS a book about thinking - and deeply. A book that fathoms the deep erotic recesses of the human heart and speaks its language perfectly."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Dorian Gray was definately an excellent book, although the wording was somewhat outdated. It is an excellent piece of work, but I just had one question about it. Do you really think it was all Dorian's fault that everything happened? I believe Dorian's horrid fate would never have existed if Lord Henry had not been introduced to him. Lord Henry put outrageous ideas into an innocent litte head, and should be noticed as the fault of all of Gray's actions. It just killed me that no one realized what was really happening! But besides that question of fault, it was a grade A book, that I would read again, but not without a dictionary by my side. I recommend it to anyone who likes intelectual reading, and who is willing to sit through outdated talk. Just go for it, it's worth your time, and better yet... it's a short novel!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"A tale of beuty, love, innocence and cruelty. Wilde did a wonderful job of telling the story of young Dorian Gray, a timeless beuty that never shows his age and whose face never displays his sins. He betrays close friends, is fuel for many a suicide, is down right cruel and unfeeling to any of his numerous loves, is selfish and self immersed; yet his young, beutiful face never shows a trace of ill being. Being in a room with him, drowns anyone with pleasure, peacefulness and charm- it is impossible to look at his face and believe that someone so sweet and innocent in looks would commit any of the evil he is rumored to have done. Instead of himself being affected, a portait of him as a young man endures the strain of his uncouth behavior.This timeless tale, set in England at the turn of the century, would be an excellent story line for any modern novel and would make a wonderful movie. Wilde's writting style is proliferic, poignant and delightful. It captures the language of the time period, yet was easy to read and easy to relate to. Wilde conveys the evil of the aestetic world and how it can drive one to stop at nothing for fear of losing it. And though he hints at such controversial topics such as drugs and homosexuality; it is neither detailed nor graphic; and is only slightly touched on. Throughout the novel, Wilde creates an image and lets the reader fully develop it for himself. I absolutley adored this book and highly reccomend it to anyone. Not for a moment did I think it dull, or too wordy. It is a very easy read (which is difficult to say of such a classic), and incredibly enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"This book fits Wilde's description of a cigarette as a perfect pleasure - portable and brief, yet leaving you unsatisfied. Like Dorian Gray himself, this book is superficially charming, with its numerous and clever epigrams, but with some very ugly undercurrents, e.g. virulent anti-semitism, misogyny, and homosexuality. We never connect emotionally with Dorian Gray, who never matures into a complex or interesting character, but remains as some gay ideal with psychosis. Read Henry James' &quot;Portrait of a Lady&quot; or Edith Wharton's &quot;Age of Innocence&quot; for a far better written, devastating attack on Victorian morals and hypocrisy."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Indudablemente Oscar Wilde es uno de los m&aacute;s grandes escritores de la Literatura Universal; pero m&aacute;s que eso fue uno de los pocos que se atrevi&oacute; a enfrentar a una sociedad adoctrinada y primitiva, siempre dispuesta a estigmatizar aquellos que no se alineaban con los patrones impuestos por ellos mismos.

He doesn't grow old but the picture of him does, in the most awful and frightening ways.Dorian shows his friend who painted the picture how it has changed - his friend reaches for a knife and charges at the picture. Dorian restrains his companion and kills him with the knife. Dorian grows more and more evil as the picture grows from awful to hideous.

Most of the book is what used to pass as witty dialogue between stifled, elite Englishmen and women. Most of this dialogue displays the thinking of a totally amoral Lord Henry who verbally paints everyone he meets as a slivered character reflecting his own amorality. To Lord Henry, one's belief in anything is proof of one's deranged thinking. Both he and Dorian experienced continued hedonism but with no gratification.The reader is forced to accept the premise that an artist painted the portrait of Dorian and in so doing captured the young man's soul on the canvas. While Dorian lived the portrait kept aging while Dorian retained his outer, youthful appearance. Thus no other living character in the story had any evidence of the aging ugliness of the portrait. At Dorian's death the living portrait, the soul of Dorian, returned to its pristine, youthful glow.Throughout the story the reader is joined with the character Dorian in accepting the portrait's brutal transformation. But with the array of deaths that followed Dorian's heartless cruelty the reader kept being confronted with the pointlessness of the tale. The reader would like to have witnessed Lord Henry's response to the apparent suicide of Dorian Gray who he worshipped throughout the tale.

The first few pages are incredibly interesting. They are written extremely well and are filled with facinating ideas. That doesn't last long, though. After the forthy-somthing page the reader begins to understand that Oscar Wilde uses a lot of words to say nothing. And he does say something, you won't notice it because it's strangled to death with a lot of useless information.However, I do think the book does make a good read. You can't really blame Wilde for writing the way he does, since he, himself, says on the second page of this book: &quot;The only excuse for making a useless thing is that one adimers it intensely&quot;, and Wilde does admires his work intensely and for that we &quot;owe' it to him to read &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"I enjoyed reading the book, and thought that it was a great allegory.

Certainly, it is dated insofar as many other Edwardian novels out of Nineteenth Century England seem trite and shallow (faring badly with what was coming out of Russia at the time: Gripping, universal, human stories from titanic authors like Dostoevsky or Tolstoy). But, cultural handicaps aside, let's give Wilde his due: The book is a treasure trove of wit--from his brilliant epigrams to its very fascinating plot, which anticipates Magical Realism by at least 50 years. That is to say, when one thinks of &quot;Twilight Zone-esque&quot; writing one is put in mind of Kafka, Borges or Grabriel Garcia-Marquez. The best in World Literature.

Although the moral of the story has been copied over by many other authors (with slight variations), the dilemma remains the same - is one willing to sacrifice his internal peace for the price of the eternal beauty?

Under the influence of Lord Henry, whose philosophy rest entirely upon self gratification that looks upon those good in life as those who are too weak and timid to live life, Dorian Gray trades his youthful innocence for a life of self pleasure at what ever cost. As he falls deeper into sin, taking all those around him along, his portrait receives all the marks of sin while he remains looking as young as he was the day his portrait was finished. Even though he has been able to live his life the way he thinks is the best, doing whatever he wants and not paying any price for it, he winds up feeling loathsome as he is haunted at night by the deeds of his sins and Lord Henry's theory of \`relieving the soul through the senses' no longer works for Dorian. His portrait also haunts him as it tells of all sins. He tries to reverse the process of contamination by behaving in a way he thinks is good, but being good for selfish means is almost as bad as a sin, and though we may repent of our sins we still bear some scars from our past sins, so seeing no instant change he tries to destroy the painting, but the painting is a link to his soul.~And the moral of the story is don't live for self"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"A book for all time.

This story is about a young man who grows to be a sinful and terribly vain man driven by love, beauty and art.The Main character, Dorian Gray, at the beginning of the book is a beautiful and youthful man. Dorian was a man everyone wanted to be around just because he had innocence and he was different. \\"He has a simple and beautiful nature.\\" Says Basil Hallward. This innocence and beauty changes as he becomes friends with Lord Henry and his values of life change him. Because Dorian was so nave, Lord Henry lured Dorian into a whole new life and new philosophies about love, beauty and selfishness. This is not the only deep friendship that is developed in this book. Dorian also becomes friends with Basil Hallward and Basil paints a portrait of Dorian and Basil puts his whole heart into this painting for it to ultimately destroy himself and Dorian. Anyway, Dorian wishes that he could stay young all his life and always be beautiful. As he grows older Dorian does many terrible and shocking things but he still remains beautiful and untouched while his painting of himself shows the real nasty, terrible, and corrupted Dorian.One part of the book that really captivated me is when Dorian murder's one of his good friends. I think this is one of the turning points in the book because I believe Dorian realizes that life shouldn't be based on the appearance of things but more about quality and spirit. Dorian understands that his lifestyle of upscale parties with London's elite, and his friendship with Lord Henry is not all that it seems to be. You can see that after Dorian murders someone he questions himself and the painting because he realizes what the painting has done to him. During the last pages of the book we can see how Dorian self-destructs and finds away to restore the painting of exquisite and youth.This book was very different from anything I read and I loved it. I like how Oscar Wilde wrapped me into this book with many compelling and interesting thoughts. The main lessons I learned from this book is question your role models and to value your life. Another lesson I learned is to not worry about beauty because if we only pick things that are beautiful we miss the wonderful and mysterious things that don't look pretty but deep inside they are."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Oscar Wilde's only novel is one of the best books I have ever read. The story is fascinating, and one that most people have heard of--that Dorian Gray, a young, beautiful man, makes a fervent wish that he would never grow old, and that the portrait just painted by his artist friend would age instead. This occurs, leading Dorian down a path of debauchery and cruelty, most of which must have been too horrific for Oscar Wilde to go into detail without violating obscenity laws.The book is a masterpiece in examining manipulation. The artist introduces Dorian to a friend, Lord Henry, who calls Dorian's attention to his beauty, and Dorian, formerly innocent and sweet, becomes vain. It is amazing to see just how potent the power of suggestion is, and this novel demonstrates it perfectly.The writing is less than perfect. One chapter goes on and on about artifacts that Dorian has collected around the world, leaving the reader saying, &quot;Okay, and who cares?&quot; Wilde's prose is far from flawless, but the story is so engaging that the reader will be willing to overlook the imperfections and will be intrigued in spite of this."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"This fascinating story of extreme narcissism and moral dilemna provides food for thought on the author's strange and sometimes twisted views on society as played out by the characters.

I have a region free DVD player and sadly there was never a US release of this film). I haven't seen this film version yet and I know it strays from the original novel but that's not the worst thing in the world. I've seen a version where Basil was a woman and it was set in the nineteen sixties with really bad acting. Now that was terrible. And there's also the 1944 version of The Canterville Ghost that turned it into World War 2 propaganda. So I don't mind what they've done with the Ben Barnes version of Dorian Gray.But since I am waiting for this adaptation I would like to write a review now for the novel The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde. I LOVE the work of Oscar Wilde. Allow me to stress that. I absolutely love the work of Oscar Wilde. My two favourite works of his are The Canterville Ghost and The Picture of Dorian Gray.The Picture of Dorian Gray tells the story of a young man who sells his soul for eternal youth and beauty. While he remains flawless, a portrait of himself grows uglier every time he sins. He cannot die unless you destroy the painting.Thanks to temptation and vice Dorian falls into hedonism and debauchery. As he externally remains pure and untainted his soul bears the burdens of his actions as reflected in the painting. Dorian learns the hard way that it's not physical beauty that matters but the inner beauty of one's own soul in qualities of kindness, mercy and compassion, things that he had lost along the way for selfishness, hedonism and greed.Dorian's fall from grace is a road lined with wit and humour. The story is riddled with clever epigrams (witty, short sayings) mostly said by the morally questionable character, Lord Henry.Lord Henry is a surprisingly naive character who plants bad ideas and temptations into Dorian's head while he, himself, doesn't seem to actually commit any sin he talks about. He even has the naive notion that people of their status don't do things like murder, as if such crimes are vices only of the lower classes.The picture of Dorian Gray is a very good and interesting read that talks about social conformity, morality, hedonism, and good and evil.

I haven't seen this film version yet and I know it strays from the original novel but that's not the worst thing in the world. I've seen a version where Basil was a woman and it was set in the nineteen sixties with really bad acting. Now that was terrible. And there's also the 1944 version of The Canterville Ghost that turned it into World War 2 propaganda. So I don't mind what they've done with the Ben Barnes version of Dorian Gray.But since I am waiting for this adaptation I would like to write a review now for the novel The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde. I LOVE the work of Oscar Wilde. Allow me to stress that. I absolutely love the work of Oscar Wilde. My two favourite works of his are The Canterville Ghost and The Picture of Dorian Gray.The Picture of Dorian Gray tells the story of a young man who sells his soul for eternal youth and beauty. While he remains flawless, a portrait of himself grows uglier every time he sins. He cannot die unless you destroy the painting.Thanks to temptation and vice Dorian falls into hedonism and debauchery. As he externally remains pure and untainted his soul bears the burdens of his actions as reflected in the painting. Dorian learns the hard way that it's not physical beauty that matters but the inner beauty of one's own soul in qualities of kindness, mercy and compassion, things that he had lost along the way for selfishness, hedonism and greed.Dorian's fall from grace is a road lined with wit and humour. The story is riddled with clever epigrams (witty, short sayings) mostly said by the morally questionable character, Lord Henry.Lord Henry is a surprisingly naive character who plants bad ideas and temptations into Dorian's head while he, himself, doesn't seem to actually commit any sin he talks about. He even has the naive notion that people of their status don't do things like murder, as if such crimes are vices only of the lower classes.The picture of Dorian Gray is a very good and interesting read that talks about social conformity, morality, hedonism, and good and evil.

It is a true classic."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Oscar Wilde was born in Dublin in 1854. He was a poet, playwright and author, though is perhaps a little more widely known for his wit. He studied at both Trinity College Dublin and at Oxford's Magdalen College - where he became a part of the Aesthetic Movement. At Trinity, he won the Berkeley Gold Medal while at Magdalene, he won the Newdigate Prize in 1878. He subsequently graduated from Magdalene with a double first - however, he failed to be elected to the Oxford Union, which is something I'd imagine they're very embarrassed about now. After a very colourful - though, at times, difficult - life, he died in 1900 and is buried in Pere Lachaise in Paris. \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is Wilde's only novel, and was first published in 1891.Basil Hallward is a highly-regarded and well-known artist. As the book opens, he has just completed his latest portrait - one of his latest muse, a young gentleman called Dorian Gray. Hallward's friend, Lord Henry Wotton, thinks it's the finest work completed by Hallward and suggests it should be exhibited in the Grosvenor - Hallward, however, disagrees. He feels he has put too much of himself into the portrait, insisting it would reveal more of the painter than the subject. Basil has become obsessed with Gray : he sees him daily, and describes his presence as \\"absolutely necessary\\". Wotton naturally becomes intrigued, and is keen to meet Gray. Basil, on the other hand, wants to keep them apart - knowing Henry would be the worst possible influence. Unfortunately, Gray calls round unexpectedly and he has to introduce them...Basil's fears were well founded. By the end of their first conversation, Dorian is completely in Henry's thrall and is convinced that his youth and beauty will only gradually fail - leaving him with nothing of value. He offers his soul, if his looks remain as they are, while his portrait ages in his place. Under Henry's guidance, Dorian dedicates to the \\"new Hedonism\\" - and, in time, he notices the portarit not only ages but becomes more hideous with each sin.I found it difficult to see exactly how Basil and Henry came to be friends. Apart from a little pretentiousness and plenty of flouncing - especially in the book's early pages - they appeared to have nothing in common. I did find it a little difficult to take Henry seriously, though - luckily, for the book - Dorian proves to be as impressionable as he is vain. He is dominated by Henry's malign influence and - despite occasionally considering returning to the straight and narrow via Basil - generally remains happy to follow the path Henry set out for him. A book that gets better as it goes along, as it starts to deal with Dorian's internal struggles - and is certainly much better than some other classics I've read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"I have never read this book before getting it for my Kindle. I love it, the book makes you tink about how you conduct your life and how it shows on you.This book also gives the reader a window into the life of a the rich of England at the time.

A morality tale wrapped up in a story dripping with homoeroticism and hedonism. I can't imagine how much pleasure Wilde had when he wrote this story and how much went on his head that never actually made it onto the page as a result of the laws of the time. This luscious, lusty Faustian tale is so dark and delicious; discreet when it has to be, suggestive when it wants to be. And the picture I have of Dorian Gray in my mind is that of the most beautiful man on earth--yes, we're all suckers for a bad boy, aren't we!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"I'm really not sure why a lot of people have not read this. It truly is a work that can only be appreciated when read and reread. This is my second time reading through the pages that Wilde weaves with this epigrams and curious cascading delight for words. Each sentence is as interesting and beautiful as the last as he speaks of sin conveyed in the most interesting of manners.Truly, Dorian is a fall from grace. A Lucifer that could have looked upon what he would become if he had the choice. Perhaps the concept of the Devil hanging over Dorian's shoulder is what makes this story so interesting. Sin never weathers Dorian's face, he remains as beautiful as he was when he was in the prime of the human age. Only the tell-tale signs of age and sin and hate and cruelty are etched upon the portrait that Basil so intricately painted. It is an ugly thing that portrays every crime Dorian ever committed. Even, towards the end of the novel, when he wished to become 'good' the old sin cannot be washed away. Even so, Dorian cannot conform to the 'good life' and instead forces himself to an unknowing demise because he cannot cope with the prospect of living a wholesome life. He would have to give up the sweet taste of sin, that which he had known without reprimand for years."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Dorian Gray is an exceptionally handsome young man, but when he sees his portrait and realizes his own beauty he wishes that the painting would grow old while he could remain young. At first he is mortified when he finds changes in his painted image, but influenced by a friend Dorian begins to seek the pleasures in life. No matter what depths he sinks to his handsome face remains unchanged, while the portrait grows uglier and more hideous, burdened not only by age but by his debauched lifestyle.I don't know if this work of literature is as widely read as it maybe once was but I was quite taken in by the story. It's interesting that Dorian, instead of using the portrait as a type of conscience to correct his actions, instead takes strange delight in observing the change. He revels in his freedom from outward consequences and digs deeper, delving into every pleasure. In some ways the separate manifestations of the individual reminded me ofDr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, while his recognition of his outward appeal and how it would fade seemed to have shades of Bradbury'sDandelion Wine. And the character of Lord Henry is interesting, always in the background congratulating him and encouraging Dorian's sensual hedonism. But it's also a critique of society, both Victorian and today: we spend our time and money trying to reverse the effects of age (the gym, cosmetics and cosmetic surgery, etc.); companies spend billions idealizing (or idolizing) \\"youth\\"; and some even even seek to excuse away weakness and place blame elsewhere. In all, it may not be a perfect story but it's very interesting and thought-provoking."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Wow.

It is beautifully done like a silk tapestry or a work of art. His ideas about life and what place art has in life are equally as interesting. It is obvious to the reader from the moment he or she picks up the book that it is mostly about art, as the title itself shows---The Picture of Dorian Gray. It becomes clear to the reader Art was the true basis for this book. Dorian himself is a physically beautiful man who collects art, and he enjoys all the splendor of a fashionable existence. Oscar Wilde was a man who also shared interest in these things so it clear that the base for his most successful book is his ideas about art ( as show in the preface) the relation ship between artist observer and art. The characters in this book are playing the parts of his opinions of art wonderfully and in doing so reveal to the reader their inner most thoughts and feelings.Dorian and his painting that he holds so dear each have a different place in Oscar Wilde's ideals as the art and the artist .One of Oscar Wilde's statements about art is \\"The artist is the creator of beautiful things. To reveal art and conceal the artist is the artist's aim\\". (3). Dorian's outside appearance that he \\"reveals\\" becomes an illusion, a sort of mask, which hides or \\"conceals\\" his inner unhappiness and inability to live. Dorian's outer persona becomes his \\"art\\", the elegant illusion that he offers to the world, while his inner feelings are the \\"artist\\". Dorian's \\"artist\\" is his soul, but in fact while he is revealing this beautiful surface to the world and enchanting everyone he is concealing his true self. He separates himself from the aging and corrupted painting. Putting on this act is to \\"conceal the artist\\" which is the artist's aim. For Dorian Gray, hiding away all signs of aging and keeping up a surface youth, beauty, and innocence is creating himself as a work of art. This point is further illustrated in the text when after basil's visit to him he nearly goes mad about protecting his painting or his soul \\"when his servant entered, he looked at him steadfastly, and wondered if he had thought of peering behind the screen.... yet he thought it best to be on his guard...his eye fell on a large purple satin coverlet heavily embroidered with gold, a splendid piece of late seventeenth-century Venetian work ...Yes, that would serve to wrap the dreadful thing...Now, it was to hide something that had a corruption of it's own, worse than the corruption of death itself-something that would breed horrors and yet would never die.\\"(103-4). The most obvious point that this paragraph shows is Dorian's need to \\"conceal\\" his soul or himself. The Venetian coverlet symbolizes Dorian's \\"art\\" or need for splendor and beautiful things to conceal his true identy. Dorian's need to conceal himself is shown with literal symbolization he is taking his art or Venetian coverlet and putting it over his \\"painting\\" to hide his soul. As the paragraph goes on he describes the painting or his \\"soul\\" in a way that shows you his true feelings about his soul he thinks of himself as being corrupt, horrible, and worse than death and naturally wants to separate his art or outter self from his painting or inner self. Oscar Wilde's theory's about art and artist's relationship connects perfectly with Dorian grays feelings about himself.Dorian has no conscience about other people's feelings because he does not expect his own which relates to Oscar Wilde's opinion that an artist has no ethical sympathies. Oscar Wilde says, \\"No artist has ethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable mannerism of style\\" (p. 3). Dorian seems to be without human emotions. He remembers his parents only through their outward appearance--- the lips or shape of the face that he has inherited. He does not remember their feelings for him or his attachment to them. It may have been that he was raised without emotional ties. The only time that his family is mentioned, Dorian calls his memories of them hateful (p. 103). In Victorian High society, feelings and emotions were considered less worthy than opinions or ideas. This has caused Dorian to grow up and not understand moral conscience he believes that the only thing that is important is new innovation and ideas, because he was taught to be that way. That is demonstrated when he decides to show Basil his soul:\\"You can tell the whole world about it afterwards, if you choose. Nobody would believe you, if they did believe; they would like me all the better for it. I know the age better than you do\\" (p, 133). He says that his age---the end of the nineteenth century---was more pre-occupied with style than substance, so his youthful glamour---and the fact that the had a secret for escaping ageing---would inspire envy and imitation, not horror. But it is show in the story with basil's reaction to the painting or his \\"soul\\" that people will in fact be horrified by someone who destroys their soul by keeping themselves enterally young and beautiful or renovating their \\"art\\". And by saying \\" I know the age better than you do \\" he is actually proving the opposite and that he doesn't have any ethical sympathies because he so obviously doesn't the nineteenth- century does care about a persons soul. It also relates to the modern day struggle over plastic surgery whether it is a way to keep yourself beautiful or a way to become obsessed with your appearance and destroy your morality you could say that a modern day Dorian Gray is a Michael Jackson someone who is once loved and admired by his public but then after turning to plastic surgery and shopping to better his appearance he becomes a joke and loses his admiration much like Dorian Gray. They both do not relate to the public and have lost their moral conscience do to constantly trying to better their appearance or better their \\"art\\". Dorian Gray doesn't understand other people's ideals because he is not willing to except the fact that he thinks of his internal self as an ugly disgusting thing. Dorian plays into Oscar Wilde's opinions about artists not having ethical sympathies because he does not understand moral conscience of his society. He also shows the reader his inner feelings that he thinks of himself as something awful.Basil and Dorian are like art and observer basil's ideals about Dorian are mirrored on to him. Basil Howard's influence is reflected in this quote from the preface; \\"All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the surface do so at their own peril. It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors\\" (p. 3). The spectator in this story is Basil Howard. Basil Howard sees Dorian through his own eyes as a beautiful young man who is full of life and innocence. Basil's soul of truth, love, kindness and caring for others is put into his painting. Dorian's external appearance is appreciated by a spectator (Basil) so it begins to mirror what the spectator sees, and other people also come to see Dorian as a prince of art. Like when an observer looks at art they interpretative it in their own way. This is shown when basil comes to talk to Dorian about the way he is perceived to society \\"I want you to lead such a life as will make the world respect you. I want you to get rid of the hateful people you associate with...you have wonderful influence, let it be for good and not evil\\" (p, 132). This shows basils admiration for Dorian and the way that he thinks of Dorian that it mirrored in the way that he will see him. He is in fact saying that he wants to lead a life where the world respects him and that he has wonderful influence because all he knows about Dorian Gray is what he knows about himself. In the page before basil talks about Dorian's face and the way that he looks means that must not be a bad person but that is only a surface opinion, like that you have of art, once you learn something about the artist, you interpret in another way. Basil doesn't know Dorian's \\"artist\\" or soul he doesn't see him he only sees himself, so basils beautiful heart and soul are projected onto Dorian's appearance. Again Oscar Wilde's ideals of the relationship between the artist and the spectator are interpreted on to his characters Dorian is just a mirror of basil, Just as art is just a mirror of the spectator. It also shows that basil wants to respected by the world, and have wonderful influence.A person could spend days and pages and pages explaining why Oscar Wilde's ideas of art reflect on the characters of The Picture of Dorian Gray and what it reveals about the characters true feelings. Here are the most important Dorian Gray and his painting reflect on the his ideas of the artist and the art, Dorian Gray and his ideas of artists not having ethical sympathies, and that Dorian and Basils relationship is the same as the art and the artists relationship. And a person could also go into the fact that according to Oscar Wilde's ideals about art the critic is he who can translate into another manner and I hope that was done in this essay.please anyone don't steal thi sessay as your own, because believe it or not if your teacher is smart and will type in the first sentance of this essay in google and this will come right up and you will be expelled.thank you for reading"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Who knows? But right-wing orthodox Catholic monarchist readers will be required to steel themselves through the first two chapters which consist of a drawn-out slap fight between Elton John, Graham Norton and Ian McKellan. Now I like a cat-fight as much as the next guy, but a tussle among effete Brit cats with man parts is just icky. So the narcissistic homo-erotic banter opening the book was significantly under-appreciated by this reader. But after you get through those chapters the book gets much, much better.It is difficult to maintain that the book represents a defense of amoral Aestheticism, since the embodiment of the aesthetic ideal, Dorian Gray, is shown to be a damned man. That is not to say that Wilde embraces Catholicism in the novel, as the narrator often posits confusing opinions on issues of conscience and sin. At times Wilde seems to suggest that only immoderate (quantitatively speaking) behavior is immoral; and yet, at other times, it appears some actions themselves ought to be avoided. Is Wilde acknowledging that there are exceptionless moral norms? And what is the reader to make of rotten Wotton, whose epigrammatic phrases seem so akin to Wilde's? Hallward points out that Wotton's cynicism is a pose. He never says a moral thing, but he never does a wrong thing. So are we to take his Wilde-isms seriously? Are we to take Wilde seriously? Wilde says art is neither moral nor immoral, yet Gray is poisoned by A Rebors, a book by another decadent author who, oddly enough, also converted to Catholicism. And then there's the picture itself, the fruit of Hallward's homosexual obsession, which is clearly cursed, in spite of its initial apparent beauty.Wilde's protests notwithstanding, it is a book with a moral informing the reader that he cannot escape his conscience, that he cannot reject nature and nature's God, and that the wages of sin are death. But therein lies hope, for if God is to be believed regarding the wages of sin, then why should we doubt Him regarding our Redemption? Unfortunately, this message is made ambiguous by an author who, rather than unintentionally creating a distorted image of an idea that cannot be fully represented, intentionally peppers the novel with paradox for the sake of cuteness. But the Truth is not cute. He's terrifying, and Wilde knows better. Therefore the book is best left to the orthodox or the decadent. The lukewarm will simply be confused."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"For me, The Picture of Dorian Gray was a tedious read. I did not particularly enjoy it that much, although I acknowledge that it is a good piece of literature. It is very well written and full of details and vivid descriptions. The story is told artfully and exquisitely but I found it long-winded and difficult to get through at times. Many people would enjoy a book like this, but it was not for me. I couldn't relate to the British aristocracy system and was utterly appalled at how unbelievably shallow the characters were, although Wilde was probably going for that effect. I was also disappointed with the ending. I thought the point of the novel would be to eliminate the stereotype that bad people are ugly, but it just perpetuated it. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a book that makes them think. It is also recommended to people who like books from this era (late 1800's) and have a lot of time on their hands."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Will someone please tell me why this \\"uplifting classics\\" edition uses an image of Thomas Jefferson on the \\"cover\\"?

He should not have to lower himself and preach to the reader."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"I was really looking forward to this book, since I heard glowing reviews about it.

I don't mind it when authors digress a bit from the story to reflect on a theme or two, but Wilde did it so often it seemed like I was reading a 100+ page philosophy essay on art.

In the end all I can say to truly show how I feel about this novel is that this book BORED me. 177 pages of art that is 'quite useless'.

I feel that Oscar Wilde used this as a semi-autobiographical vehicle to transport his radical, eccentric ideas and ideals. He speaks through his characters of Lord Henry and Dorian Gray. They seek to justify debauchery and murder and they kill off anyone who is good, kind, moral or differs in opinion with them. A good read, perhaps, for the likes of the 42nd president of the USA.

Wilde has taken an old story and transformed it into a tale of Victorian excess and corruption. He has created a main character (Dorian) with whom a little part of all of us can identify with--he lives his life to the fullest extent, but doesn't age, while his portrait bears the burden of his fast living. I highly reccemmend this book to anyone who enjoys good literature at it's best.

Throughout his life he becomes more and more heinous morally, while retaining his innocent look until his death, which is the suprise ending...Also included in this book are the short stories 'Lord Aurthur Savile's Crime,' 'The Canterville Ghost,' 'The Sphinx Without a Secret,' and 'The Model Millionare.'"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"After hearing about Oscar Wilde and how his novel The Picture of Dorian Grey was renounced because it contained hints of homosexuality I was very eager to read the novel. However, I was utterly disappointed. The disappointment had nothing to do with the novel's themes but rather its characters and delivery.As a literature major, I am one who enjoys long novels full of detail and old romantic language such as that of Jane Austen. While The Picture of Dorian Grey was written with glorious detail and all the flowery language that I love I found myself very bored. There were many places where I found that the story dragged and though I am sure they were meant to be brilliant social commentary I could not stand the countless scenes where Lord Henry or Dorian sat about with their friends and chatted.I may have still been able to give this book at least a three star rating if the boring scenes scattered throughout the book were the only fault but unfortunately what truly put me off was the characters. I cannot enjoy a book whose characters I do not come to love or at least care for in some small way. By the end of the novel I did not care one bit what happened to Dorian Grey; he was a spineless boy and a cruel man. Lord Henry was always a wicked man and a tiresome preacher of what he considered to be cleverness. Basil Hallward was the only character that I enjoyed and somewhat identified with but he was not enough apart of the story to redeem it and nothing could make up for Dorian himself.I was extremely disappointed in this book and I cannot say that I would recommend it to anyone other than a literature fanatic looking too read as many classics as possible."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Ugh, what to say about this book. I wanted so badly to love it, but I didn't. I didn't even like it a little bit. That's terrible when you don't really enjoy the very first classic you read. This isn't setting a good stage for the future and planning on reading one classic a month. Good thing Alice in Wonderland is next month. That will definitely make up for the suck of this one. Don't you hate it when you hear such good things about a book and you go in expecting to love it only to be completely disappointed? Yeah, that's what happened here.The book follows Dorian Gray (the original Mr. Gray, if you will) who is apparently a very beautiful man who is envied by many only he doesn't quite understand why. I liked Dorian but I didn't feel like his character had much depth. I liked that he wasn't all look how sexy I am you know you want this, but at the same time he was kind of a sissy. He follows this Lord Henry guy around like he's a lost little puppy dog and puts up with him bashing him on numerous occasions. I don't know who this guy thinks he is but I had to force myself not to skip over his parts. The only rational person in this book (minus his psycho obsession over Dorian) is Basil but he isn't in enough of the book to really care too much about.I think I know why I couldn't get into this book as much as the rest of the people who told me about it. Have you seen the movie The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen? Okay, I see Dorian Gray in that movie when I think about him. I see Stuart Townsend in all his \\"I'm the bomb get over it\\" glory. I cannot and will not picture him as the pushover that he was in this book. That movie ruined the book for me. I remember watching the actual Dorian Gray movie but it was boring too. I may have to watch it again just to see how terrible it was in comparison to the book, but I vaguely remember falling asleep at some point.The only reason I didn't give it one butterfly is because I was able to finish it. It was hard and it seemed like forever, but I did it. And the only reason I did it was to get to the end. I read on and off for like five days just to read about the scene I could have watched in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen after only an hour and a half. Stuart Townsend will always be my Dorian Gray. This book just didn't do it for me. However... Dorian is a VERY cool name. Props to Mr. Wilde for that."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"I feel perplexed about The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde. On one hand, the story is well written about a young man being moulded and shaped. On the other hand, this book was incredibly flowery and doesn't really start for 100 pages. Dorian doesn't really know about life and meets an artist and an aristocrat that help him though his journey into manhood. The artist paints his portrait, subsequently making him keep his youth. The aristocrat had the biggest influence on Dorian Gray, though Lord Harry Wotton is very annoying. He talks and talks the whole way through this book, thinking he's so witty.Dorian Gray starts off in this novel as a blank slate, an easily influenced young man. Thoughout the rest of the story he gets moulded and pushed into shape. After Basil paints his portrait Dorian starts to unravel, afraid to show the picture, he locks it way in a room and never lets anyone see it, protecting it at all costs. The whole thing symbolising the way we hide our real selves from the rest of the world, scared of what they may think.The Picture of Dorian Gray would have been controversial in its day, with strong homosexual themes. Though the book itself is more about the life and morality, Oscar Wilde did a brilliant of capturing this element of the book. For me the biggest downfall of this book was that Lord Wotton was too loud and dominates throughout the entire book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"This is an incredibly well written, wonderfully illustrated, and very interesting book to read. I have read and already own The Picture of Dorian Gray, but this book adds so much to my understanding of the story, the characters, and the time in which Wilde wrote the book. Plus it has fascinating references to Oscar Wilde's friends, enemies, his views on woman, art, life, and his other stories. I am reading every annotation, every footnote, and the story all at the same time. This book is a must have if you enjoy Oscar Wilde, and wish to understand him better. Buy It!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"First off, for the audience looking to read this book after viewing the character from the movie LXG, know that the characteristics of Dorian are no as they were in the movie. Dorian does not die when he looks at his portrait; in fact his observation of the changes in his picture is one of the main elements of the story. Basil, an artist that is obsessed with the beauty of one man, Dorian, paints a portrait so beautiful that the subject is pained by the fact that the portrait's beauty will outlast that of his mortal body, and he wishes that this formula could be reversed, with the portrait aging in his place. He gets his wish, but at what price? Dorian, now free from the bounds of mortality, is no longer afraid to sin, since there he thinks that nothing can happen to him. But his behavior was not all due to his immortality; it was also due to the fact that the negative influence from Lord Henry corrupted his pure soul. The fact that he was able to keep his beauty but not able to keep his soul shows that judgment based on appearance is not only wrong, but inaccurate. This book is recommended, but not to the highest extent. The story picks up quickly, as it must with such a limited amount of pages. One of the only flaws in this book is chapter 11, the long, unwanted pause. A classic nonetheless, one that should no be overlooked."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Wilde creates a Faustian plot where Dorian Gray wishes to never grow old, and gives up his soul to do so.

Dorian Gray does represent the reality of the British Aristocracy of old and how useless their lives really were for many."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"I saw many variances of movies but never read the book. It was a true page turner. It left me wondering about Oscar Wilde's state of mind...LOL!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"With his life spanning the later half of the 19th Century, Oscar Wilde wrote in a wide variety of mediums, ranging from poetry to plays and from essays to fairy tales, and one novel. His fairy tales are arguably the most accessible of his writings, and as is the case with fairy tales revolve around some moral theme being conveyed. For instance in \`The Selfish Giant' a giant places a wall around his garden to keep the children out, and thus spring never comes on his garden, causing him to realize the result of his selfishness. Similarly in \`The Star-Child' a beautiful boy is forced to come to terms with his prideful cruelty.The Picture of Dorian Gray can be seen as a continuing of this fairy tale manner of writing, except in novel form (though even then the novel is fairly short).The story begins in the art-studio of Basil, a painter who is putting the final touches on what is said to be his most greatest painting. With him is Lord Henry, a shallow obscurantist of high society who upon hearing of the figure in the portrait desires to meet with him - the figure being that of a young and impressionable Dorian Gray. The two become friends and eventually the philosophy of Lord Henry begins to have its affect on him.In the words of Lord Henry, this amounts to \\"if one man were to live out his life fully and completely, were to give form to every feeling, expression to every thought, reality to every dream-I believe that the world would gain such a fresh impulse of joy that we would forget all the maladies of mediaevalism, and return to the Hellenic ideal-to something finer, richer than the Hellenic ideal, it may be... The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.\\"Throughout the course of the novel Dorian comes to embrace this ideal, giving into his own inner nature: \\"Eternal youth, infinite passion, pleasures subtle and secret, wild joys and wilder sins-he was to have all these things. The portrait was to bear the burden of his shame: that was all... For there would be a real pleasure in watching it. He would be able to follow his mind into its secret places. This portrait would be to him the most magical of mirrors. As it had revealed to him his own body, so it would reveal to him his own soul. \\"Thus Dorian Gray enters into a sort of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde type of scenario with himself where he resolves to do away with his conscience - where Mr. Hyde reveals the truth of Dr Jekyll, the portrait comes to reveal the truth of Dorian Gray, and before the end he must come to face that truth.The book is enjoyable, and at around 180pgs can be read in an evening. Like his fairy tales it comes away with a moral, though modern renditions of the character seem to miss this point.Memorable Quotes:-\\"You know how I love secrecy. It is the only thing that can makemodern life wonderful or mysterious to us. The commonest thing isdelightful if one only hides it.\\"-\\"Modern morality consists in accepting the standard of one's age. I consider that for any man of culture to accept the standard of his age is a form of the grossest immorality.\\"-\\"Ah! in what a monstrous moment of pride and passion he had prayed thatthe portrait should bear the burden of his days, and he keep theunsullied splendour of eternal youth! All his failure had been due tothat. Better for him that each sin of his life had brought its sureswift penalty along with it. There was purification in punishment.Not \\"Forgive us our sins\\" but \\"Smite us for our iniquities\\" should bethe prayer of man to a most just God.\\"Specific CriticismsI don't believe I have any real criticisms or complaints about this book. I do have to say that I greatly disliked the character of Lord Henry, and the book can be read much more quickly if you skip all his dialogue after his first few rants. If you've read one of his conversations you've read them all; the basic model is that he says something absurd or outlandish and then the other characters alternately gasp and fawn over his words.Every now and then this is interrupted by him saying something exceptionally bland, such as remarking that \\"They are both simply forms of imitation\\" when Basil makes the statement that \\"Love is a more wonderful thing than art.\\" Or by making some contradiction in terms, such as \\"I never approve, or disapprove, of anything now. It is an absurd attitude to take towards life.\\"Little nuances of character stand out, such as Henry and Dorian constantly remarking about the shallowness of other characters while demonstrating a pointed shallowness throughout the book. Of course this isn't a criticisms of the book or the writing, it is likely in fact a praise of the writing, that he can create such a distasteful character.More reviews at ellipsisomnibus.wordpress.com"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Especially considering the time of writing, this book sets out a rare insight into the workings of the human mind.

The two main characters, Dorian Gray himself and his mentor Lord Henry Wotton, lead lives of extreme self-indulgence.Lord Henry constantly spews forth his theories and philosophies regarding everything about human nature. Although they are numerous, Henry's ideas can be condensed into one main point. Early in the narrative when he is first exercising his right to influence under the title of mentor, Henry exclaims to Dorian that the only thing worth having is youth. Youth, which is, according to Henry, the only stage where beauty can be found, comes with an ever-present hedonistic lifestyle. This is the template for which the impressionable Dorian bases his life upon.Dorian becomes the ultimate purveyor of self-indulgence and corrupts everything he associates himself with, all the while accompanied on his journeys by a curse of grave implications. To the disappoint of many, I will not give away more of the story; as I'm sure most of you are already salivating over the details I have put forth.The story unfolds at first in a matter of weeks and then jumps several years, yet the focus of the novel does not waiver. This Romantic Period novel is filled with the standard mystery, and a central dealing with human nature. It is well written and comes with excellent detail, as required by this writing period. It also comes with the characteristic whit of Oscar Wilde. The dialogue between characters is excellent and Lord Henry's theories are exquisite often bordering on comical, but always cynical.Wilde seems to warn against the excess of hedonism and uses the story of Dorian Gray as a deterrent. More importantly I believe this is a social critique of high society, which breeds excess and cultivates decadence, while often regarding everything with a selfish eye. The book is filled intellectual quips about human nature and society, yet it is a short book and relatively easy read. This book is required reading for many, so possibly you've already read it, but if not, during commercial breaks of course, give this a try."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a terrific melodramatic Romantic-era novel. It is a pleasant story of an artist-Basil-and his relationship with a young man named Dorian Gray. Basil often paints portraits of Gray, and one day a man named Lord Henry Wotton comes and changes Gray's life. Though I don't want to spoil the rich plot, Gray is faced with the reality that he will soon age and the sketches will not, and he is horrified.The book is a quick read, despite mostly long chapters (fifteen pages or so). I was able to sit down and read the book, often finding myself enjoying a book assigned in English class. Though it is quick moving and a reasonably short book, it is a book meant for high schoolers and older.For a story out of the Romantic era, I really enjoyed reading this book. It wasn't one of the books that I had to turn to Cliff's Notes to understand-it was an easy read. The book kind of reminded me of a soap opera, though not nearly as lame, it had some parts that would appear in the script of a soap. I found myself hating Lord Henry for ruining Gray, and enjoying the choices that Gray made.Overall this book is definitely worth a quick read. It's not your typical Romantic book, because it isn't a cheesy novel, it has some real depth. I recommend it to anybody looking for a quick and easy read or if it's on the reading list for somebody's summer required reading for English.

When Dorian realizes he too must face mortality and it's grip on his beauty he makes a wish to never lose his youth and beauty, to instead let his painting age for him. This the painting does... from the curve of his lips to the look in his eyes.

As Dorian succumbs to the tempting dark underworld of London, and he lives by night in wicked ways, the beautiful portrait painted of him becomes like a journal of his soul, becoming ever more twisted and deformed. It begins to haunt Dorian continuously, day and night, consuming his every thought.

Any lover of a well written book would also fall for this."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray, by Oscar Wilde is a novel that explores the themes of human corruption, moral decadence and the value of youth in society. The novel follows the life of a narcissistic youth, Dorian Gray, who makes a Faustian pact with the devil to keep his youth. Dorian grows to love immorality and the darker joys of life. However, the evils of his life do not manifest within him but in his portrait.Published in 1890, The Picture of Dorian Gray is still a popular choice of literature for society today, being praised as one of Wilde's greatest works. The appeals of The Picture of Dorian Gray to a modern day society are the plot, characters and Wilde's firm command of language. The novel deals with themes that are common in society, drugs, violence, immorality, social decadence and human corruption.At times, Wilde's writing appears shallow and wooden, lacking any action. However, what is lost in action is gained in dialogue, which is exquisite and strongly reflects Wilde's own nature. The novel is riddled with finely wrought epigrams and witticisms that display the true skill and genius of Wilde as both an author and an orator."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"What is more important, physical beauty or a beautiful heart?

That said, the higher threshold of today's readers for topics that would have made a Victorian-era bookworm blush doesn't take away at all from the bona-fide quality of writing, and depth of thought, manifested within the complex discourses of Oscar Wilde's characters time and again throughout \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray.\\"The storyline itself is interesting -- a young man, driven to trade his soul for lifelong youth and beauty, is left with a brutally accurate reminder that the burdens of the soul are inescapable. Nevertheless, the clever plot is the lesser of the art forms Wilde exhibits in this book.The most impressive feature of Wilde's writing in this novel is the manner in which his characters express and justify devious thoughts. Corrupt and evil notions are so explicitly well-rationalized, with such a seemingly undeniable logic, that the reader is almost forced to pause, mid-paragraph at times, to debate in his own mind whether he agrees with what he just read. As the story unfolds, and the maladies brought about through the gradual corruption of Dorian Gray grow more and more apparent and profound, one almost needs to turn the pages back to the stanzas previously used to justify an ill-fated thought simply to reconsider why such statements at first seemed to be such decent insights about humanity. Perhaps we are all just as corruptible as Dorian Gray? If so, that is the genius of Oscar Wilde in this work.This novel is not simply one to be read; rather it is a novel to be read deeply into. There is a little bit of Dorian Gray in us all."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"reading this for the first time, i remember the movie that was made in the 1980's (vaguely) i'm a fan of oscar wilde and these pocket editions as well!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"I love this story.

I highly recommend this classic book.Check out my newest thriller - Bound by Birth - by Randall R WheelerBound By Birth"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"What a delightful book! Many of us our familiar with the basic Dorian Gray fable - a man yearns for immortality and gets it. In Wilde's take, Dorian Gray, a young handsome teenager wishes the deprecating effects of age to strike his portrait and not his flesh. He gets his wish and at the goading of Lord Henry becomes an absolute hedonist. Always within though there seems to be a remorseful conscience, a longing for purity. But the ease of depravity squashes moral sentiments before they take root. In the end though, the ageless man finally confronts his portrait...After learning of the author, Oscar Wilde, I was surprised that the book came from his pen (thinly veiled homoeroticism nonwithstanding). I interpreted the book as a cautionary tale against heedlessness and indulgence - basically against the materialist character of Lord Henry. It is a moral tale that explores themes of beauty and its subsidary: age. One cannot help but see one's own portrait in the depiction of young Dorian Gray.I found the writing of the book to be fantastic. Great dialogue and monologues with the British witticisms that you would expect."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"So you want to remain eternally young? This book will tell you an engrossing moralistic tale that paints the picture of where the deadly sin of vanity can take you. It will take you into a descent into a hell full of shadows where the light will never touch you.This is a classic dark tale of intrigue. It is filled with the depths to which the human condition can sink. It is a page turner, but it may leave you feeling empty at the end. That is what it did for me. Nevertheless, it is a haunting book that is well worth reading. Oscar Wilde will speak from his grave throughout the centuries through this book.As the author of a spiritually-themed book entitled \\"The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude,\\" I appreciated this book for the most unusual reasons. I am a former addict who knows what it is like to experience hell within life. The hopeful note within this book is that it will wake the reader up to taking responsibility for his or her own life. That is what I have had to do with my own. Thank God for books that can wake us up to that reality so that we do not have to sink into the abyss of nothingness.Davis Aujourd'hui, author of \\"The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude\\""},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Famed for his biting wit and a master of epigrams, Oliver Wilde fails to disappoint in the only novel he has ever published. The Picture of Dorian Gray is both shocking and profound, delving into the daunting choices one man makes after obtaining, through a careless wish, perpetual youth.Dorian Gray begins the book as an innocent, wholly untainted Adonis. He is introduced to the decadent Lord Henry Wotton through his friend Basil Hallward, a renowned painter. After the influence of Lord Henry, Dorian, upon seeing his alluring, youthful self captured in Basil's portrait of him, rashly wishes that he might remain young and beautiful like the portrait while it grew old and ugly. The discovery that his wish was made a reality leads Dorian down a sordid path. He coldly scorns his love, Sibyl Vane, when she loses her acting ability for love of him, resulting in her suicide. After this mar of blood on his conscience, Dorian chooses to lead a life of hedonism, ignoring the pleadings of his old friend Basil. Blaming Basil for his tainted conscience and corrupt way of life, Dorian murders Basil and eventually, stabs his portrait in rage, killing himself. He reverts to his true self, utterly grotesque and unrecognizable.Although the plot alone is enticing, Wilde's incredible skill with language is really the highlight of the book. Many astonishing events occur in the story of Dorian's descent into decadence, but Wilde's consistent, calm narration does not mask the scenes' madness but rather enhances it, making Dorian's evil actions all the more eerie. Tempting in its morbidity, the book drags along its readers as a horror movie would its audience. Through his mastery of syntax, Wilde is often able to convey exactly Dorian's emotion and state of mind. Varying between short, choppy sentences and long, languid descriptions, Wilde skillfully manipulates syntax to reflect upon the state of the characters. Imagery runs rampant throughout the novel. Whole passages devoted to the description of the gardens and the like drug the reader with sensual images, pulling them into the scene itself.The characters are also developed to an amazing extent, especially Lord Henry, the most intriguing in the book. Despite being a bad influence on Dorian, Lord Henry is actually a main contributor to the profundity of this novel. Although he is seen as a decadent, and often times, the intellectual lightweight of the story, Henry is also very philosophical. The man seems to have a philosophy of everything, smothering in his constant philosophical didactics. However, sayings like \\"Ordinary people waited till life disclosed to them its secrets, but to the few, to the elect, the mysteries of life were revealed before the veil was torn away\\" are very thought-provoking. It seems that Henry is Wilde's spokesperson through whom the author questions society's way of life and any alternatives. Lord Henry's thoughts, thus, not only influences Dorian but also has a tremendous effect on Wilde's readers.However, this amazing novel is not without flaws. Basil is intended to be the most moralistic of the trio, an opposition to Lord Henry's negative influence on Dorian. Although Basil's weakness can be interpreted as Wilde's criticism of Victorian society and its own weakening morals, his reluctance to fully acknowledge Dorian's stray from the noble path and thus, his inability to save his friend is infuriating and almost annoying.Overall, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a great read. Its morals are fairly simplistic while its messages are wholly complicated. The masterful use of language in the novel establishes once more the reason for Oscar Wilde's popularity. Provoking and profound, The Picture of Dorian Gray definitely merits a second read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"It has been said that this book is one of Oscar Wilde's classics and I do say it is. The story revolves around one man and his desire to be young. Although it was originally published in the 1800's, the themes and ideas within the book you can adapt to today's time. I have underlined many quotations that I found very interesting and if thought about make sense.Now, for those who know or don't, it has been made a movie before and it has been revived this time around as a movie set to release this year with the lead character played by Ben Barnes (The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian). Ben Barnes was known for Prince Caspian and this is his next movie to release. Also starring, Colin Firth.I would certainly read this book first before seeing the movie and for a price like this, you cannot take advantage of reading a great literary classic."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"The experience of reading Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray is tantamount to engaging in a philosophical debate with a person suffering from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder--and they're winning. The exquisite attention to detail paired with a sharp analytical wit delivers an indomitable argument. One cannot help but succumb to temptations along with the charismatic Dorian and echo his cries of despair when the effects of sin become prominently displayed, marring the handsome features.Wilde creates a subtle trap, luring the reader with Dorian's innocence and naivet&eacute;. The snare gently tightens as the pure boy slides deeper into depravity and becomes corrupted by pleasure. So slowly is the reader introduced to the poison, by the time realization hits there is no hope of escape. They are as thoroughly embroiled in the life of hedonism and aestheticism as the protagonist. Dorian becomes subsequently more callous with every act of debauchery he commits and the impact of his actions is reduced by the sheer number of skeletons in his closet. Rather than becoming appalled as his wickedness grows, the reader is simple hardened for what is to come. When Dorian finally carries out the act of treachery that tilts the scale, no one is surprised.The pictures painted by Wilde's careful words are elaborate to the point of being mind-numbing. Explicit descriptions of Dorian's hobbies fill pages while serving no apparent purpose. Closer examination determines the usefulness of aforementioned descriptions in drawing the reader closer to the child-like curiosity of Dorian, perhaps justifying his eventual corruption. Unfortunately this knowledge is not enough to banish the tedium and some passages must simply be suffered through.Oscar Wilde has created a thought provoking masterpiece. An excellent read for those who have ever question the morality of society of have peered out across seas of corruption and vowed to stay away. Not for the faint of hear or easily distracted, hose who choose to take the plunge will find themselves pleasantly rewarded."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"a classic literary staple of the modern world! a must read for any intellectual. every sentence is brimming with stimulating ideas and paradoxes."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"The characters were at times insufferable which is the point.

It was hardly surprising that following the publication of this book, the authorities sought to have him arrested for homosexuality. If aestheticism is embodied by Lord Henry, Henry is a despicable character, whose philosophies sound not only juvenile and sophistic, but ignorant due to his lack of practicing what he preached. He didn't act out his hedonistic, immoral theories, only Dorian behaved that way, and when doing so brought torment, shame, and guilt upon himself. And to preface the book with &quot;All art is quite useless&quot;? That makes no sense, since the picture was the most useful, significant, meaningful thing in life. Was Wilde's goal to declare his own dear philosophies completely worthless? If so, he succeeded, but I am much more impressed by someone who sets out to justify his philosophies rather than someone who sets out to debunk them."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"I love the classics and somehow this one escaped my attention until now. I wish only that it hadescaped my attention forever. This rambling book of boring, sexually unstable rich people with nothing better to dowith their lives than look at pretty Dorian (because, Dorian is very pretty), and insult the commoners who have no rank or class,is tedious, boring and a complete waste of time.Dorian has his portrait painted while the painter and another man oogle him and tell him how pretty he is.The painter said his life was not complete until pretty Dorian came to sit for him.Dorian is very pretty..Dorian wishes he could stay young and pretty and that the painting would age instead of him.,,.. because he's young and prettyand men and women alike tell him how pretty he is.Dorian gets his wish and then the book ignores all his issues and goes off into the prose land of mushrooms.We next see Dorian decades later, the painting is hideous but Dorian is pretty. All his sins have left him pretty and the painting ugly.What happened in that time span is not told.Dorian is pretty.There is zero character developement and by the end I was just hoping everyone character in the book would die.Even Dorian, who is very pretty. We do not not know him, or the painter and have only a glimpse of the life of thethird main character in the book. He thinks Dorian is pretty too.*****************Spoiler Alert*****************I guessed the end about 1/3rd of the way through, I only missed that I figured Dorian (he, who is pretty) would torch the painting insteadof stabbing it.*****************End Spoiler Alert*****************I'm sure all the world is aflutter because of the daring topics discussed, or not discussed as it wasn't in this book. For its time period, I guessit would be shocking. Dorian, however, is still very pretty and that remains regardless of when this book was written.So, I hear this is only an edited version and somewhere out there is the REAL version, and it is oh so much better, but, nothing could savethis travesty of words. I wasted enough time with these pathetic characters (and author) although I think Dorian is still very pretty according to everyone.I'm only glad I read it on my Kindle so a tree didn't die in printing this boring book.

Wilde seems far more interested in catologing lists of inane objects and people than he is of entertaining or interesting the reader. Wilde only glosses over Gray's sinful actions letting us know sparse details about his supposed debauchery but never exposing the reader to them...So a woman kills herself over being jilted, so he uses opium, so he goes to prostitutes, so he is bisexual...Who cares?? Such a shallow character (and this book is filled with shallow, undeveloped characters) is impossible to care one way or another about...So when the end of the book comes to its obvious conclusion as a reader I simply shut the book, pondered what all the fuss and bother has been about and put the book on Ebay as its not worth taking up space on my bookshelf..."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"sdfj dsljf asdfjksl sadf lsdjf al asdl sjdsl flasdf fl. fsdjls,..f lf fdjfdsl. dsdfjs.. eoweoiwiew wwed vfrd vmri riejkfn fkjei fjf"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Okay when I bought this book I was leery because I thought it would be too scary.

I found myself constantly amazed that someone from Wilde's time could have had such clarity of thought on certain topics. I've never seen the movie made from this but I saw some movie posters. So it was hard taking the horror look and putting that in this book. It is more of a twisted coming of age story and not even one that gets too deep. Lord Henry has deeper moments of speech then Dorian. And as shocking as they said this book would be...I read nothing shocking. I thought maybe the unedited version would actually have a sex scene in it lol but they don't even mention a naughty body part lol. Nothing ever gets remotely sexual. I mean several characters are definitely gay but not in a shocking way. More like Jack McFarlan on Will and Grace.

When I watched that movie I had no idea who the character of Dorian Gray was. The movie wasn't that good, but I was still interested in that character. When I saw The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde, I decided I wanted to learn more about that character.This book was not easy to read at all. It wasn't because of the language that it was written in, which did add to its difficulty. The part that bothered me the most about this book, other than its length, was the horrible lack of flow. I got the main idea of the book, I understood most of why certain parts of the book were there, but there were so many parts that did not add to the plot that for many pages at a time you would read about things like a jewel collection, book collection or whatever else fancied Dorian Gray at the time. It was so hard to finish this book because there were so many times that I couldn't grasp why I was reading what I was reading. There were so many times that Dorian or his friend Harry would go into these monologues for absolutely no reason at all.There were a few redeeming qualities to this book, but unfortunately they did nothing to help me enjoy it at all. The one thing I did like was the basic premise of the book. Dorian Gray could not age and he was beautiful so he could do whatever he wanted to. His lack of need to preserve his soul led him down the path of evil. His friend guided him down that path as well. The whole time I was reading this book I was thinking about Harry as the devil. He would plant thoughts into the brain of Dorian that led him further and further down his path of destruction.The book was a let down and I hope that the next classic fiction book I choose is a good one.If you like my review and want to read more of them I have a blog chronicaling my first year with my Kindle.

Check out my profile for the website."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"While trying to start some kind of an aesthetic as well as a moral revolution, The Picture of Dorian Gray instead became a disappointment in the world of literature. I began reading this book upon the premise that it would contain fascinating worldviews, as well as a gripping plot. Rather, the book fell flat on its face. Wilde reflected his views of the importance of art, the pitfalls of beauty, and the horror of aging in this novel, and though it wasn't the views that were a problem, it was how they all contradicted one another. The author claimed, \\"all art is useless\\" in the preface of the novel, yet eventually it is art itself that becomes the bane of Dorian Gray's existence.The novel follows a young, beautiful young man, Dorian Gray, along with two of his friends, Basil, who paints a stunning picture of Dorian, and Harry, who leads Dorian into a world of lies, sin and betrayal. Though it starts off interestingly enough, the novel drags after the 50th page, and it only gets worse and worse until the very end. It is meant to shock its readers, with tales of murder and drugs, yet the writing isn't sophisticated enough to support these statements. The downward spiral of Dorian Gray's life is deserved, and the novel fails to leave the reader with a strong residual message. To its credit, however, the original premise was interesting, and the decay of Dorian Gray's existence and how he views himself makes for a decent plot.I will not bother to go into the details of the novel, for example the sexism and the portrayal of women in the book, and how it is questionable whether the characters are more in love with women, the idea of women, each other (yes, they are all male), or themselves. The homosexuality in the novel did not bother me, though the inaccurate portrayal of women did.If you are interested in reading about art, corruption or murder in the late 19th century in England, please, spare yourself the torture of reading Dorian Gray, though it is only a little over 200 pages."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"The picture of Dorian wasn't that great of a novel. The subjects in this moral fable are very dramatic but go exceedingly too far. Tragedy stalks every crack and turn of it. It ends in a tragedy. In the beginning, it is rather happy, but right after the actress and lover commits suicide it goes completely. I do not doubt Wilde's famed wit but, he could have written something more happy than this depressing novel. The descriptions are very well done(especially in the beginning.) Thus, he should used his wit and humor for a more enjoyable and felicatous novel."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"this book was really really twisted, our sophmore class had to read it for school, and almost everyone hated it"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"The quickest way to sum up this book in one word is \\"wow.\\" I will admit that for awhile I didn't find the book 5-star worthy, but I soon found myself thoroughly engrossed. Wilde has written this story like a symphony in four movements with an overture, ballad, climax, and finale. The prose is absolutely lyrical.Beauty is a dominant theme. Wilde excessively alludes to Greek Gods and the perfection of Adonis. The concept of beauty is also represented in the idea of man vs. himself, or better yet as beauty vs. immortality. Dorian wrestles constantly with his inner self and with the immortality his beauty presents to him. But with his beauty comes sins and pleasure that have no effect on him because their consequences marr his self portrait. Dorian uses his beauty to sin which ultimately leads to violence; his emotions often confuse his sins with pleasure.A secondary theme is the absence of reality. In the Importance of Being Earnest, Wilde echoes a similar line as that from Dorian. He writes that the two most attractive types of people are those who know nothing at all or absolutely everything. Three key characters represent varying degrees of reality, as well as Wilde's description of attractive people. Dorian knows nothing and Lord Henry knows absolutely everything, but Basil is the medium ground between the two that represents reality. Basil is the only one who sees/acknowledges things for what they truly are, but he is shunned by others who don't want to see reality. Characters like Dorian and Lord Henry have the idea that to see reality is to be scared of life. It is bad to be a spectator to one's own life. Dorian even admits that \\"He felt that the secret of the whole thing was not to realise the situation.\\" If he didn't acknowledge it, it simply did not exist.Lastly is the theme of homosexuality. Wilde does not mention any specifics of homosexual relationships, but what one has to read between the lines jumps off the page with equal magnitude of the written text.All in all, this book is excellent. Read this book, you will be glad you did!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"The novel \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" by Oscar Wilde is yet another triumph for this talented author. The dark tale of a young man who unknowingly sells his soul in order to stay forever young is wittily brought across through three main characters, each resembling a different part of Wilde himself.Dorian, the main character, represents what Wilde himself said he would like to be, yet Dorian also clearly resembles part of Wilde: the part that was once young and innocent before becoming corrupted by the world he lived in.Henry Wooton, the man responsible for the corruption of Dorian Gray, is the side of Oscar Wilde that the world thought was the true Wilde: carefree and conceited, caring nothing for other people, yet extremely witty. This is also Wilde, as far as the witty and carefree parts go. Only when Henry displays his rare moments of care for other people does this character seem like Wilde.Basil, the man who paints the infamous picture of Dorian, is the character who Wilde found himself to be the most like. Quiet and withdrawn, Basil is a caring man with a good consience who completely adores Dorian. Out of the entire novel, Basil is one of the few truly good people.This novel does, however, have it's shortcomings. Lord Henry Wooton's wife is introduced in a scene and given an extremely interesting description. She is a nervous woman who laughs often and also displays the wit that Wilde was so famous for. This description, however, makes one think that she will be extremely important later, when in truth, she never shows up again (though she is mentioned once by Henry). There is also a chapter that delves a little too deeply into the obsessions that Dorian went through, going into long run-on sentances and too-long descriptions.Overall, this is an extremely well-written novel that portrays what is wrong with society today through the views of the characters and the actions they take. Though it may not be the easiest read for today's society (many of whom are as corrupt as the characters in the book), it is one well worth reading, if only for a new outlook on life."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"\\"It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors\\" - Oscar Wilde\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is an excellent novel about the degradation of the human soul. The novel focuses around the handsome Dorian Gray and his interactions with the artist Basil Hallward, who paints his portrait and Lord Henry, who becomes the corrupting influence on Dorian's soul and Dorian's iinteractions with the British aristocracy. Dorian is compared to Narcissus, who was so obsessed with his own beauty, that it swallowed him whole. Dorian seals his fate with one wish; upon viewing his portrait, he wonders if it would be possible for his portrait to show the signs of aging, in exchange for his mortal beauty. Throughout the novel, we see Dorian's decent into total self - absorbtion and evil all of which culminates in an ending that is predictable but still entertaining none the less.Just a quick side note, there is some great social commentary running throughout \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\\" specifically Wilde's commentary on the stiff, British aristocracy of the late 19th century, absurd views regarding women, who are painted by Gray as blubbering idiots (a sign of the times) and last but not least, the underlying homosexual undertones present between Dorian, Basil and Lord Henry are fascinating to deconstruct.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was my first introduction to Oscar Wilde and after reading the novel, I was hooked. I would like to return to the quote above, about art mirroring the soul of the spectator, after reading this novel, you will have a sense of how trully frightening that notion is."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"C.S. Lewis wrote that pride is the greatest sin. It is the doorway to all other kinds of evil. Though this was certainly not what Oscar Wilde was writing about, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a perfect illustration of this. The protagonist's pride causes him to go to horrible lengths. In the end it causes everyone around him (and eventually himself) great pain. I have read Wilde's works only a couple of times since being introduced to them in high school. Each time I do, I remember how much I like him as an author. This time, I was once again reminded how masterful Wilde was as a writer. His keen wit and incisive humor is refreshing. His prose is clean and unlabored. I don't know why I haven't read his stuff more often. I certainly will now."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"This story is positively a masterpiece. Dorian Gray is a young boy at first, whose beauty is so entirely dazzling that Mr. Basil Hallward, an artist, becomes utterly obsessed with the portrait he is painting of Dorian. Feeling certain he has not only achieved his best artistic work yet, he confesses shamefully that he has put so much of himself into the portrait that were it ever displayed publicly, the world would glimpse his soul. In short, Basil is in love with the image of Dorian Gray. Lord Henry Wotten befriends Dorian, much to the chagrin of Basil, who feels a near homosexual jealousy. When Basil presents the finished portrait to Dorian, Dorian makes a whimsical wish \\" If it were only the other way! If it were I who was to be always young, and the picture that was to grow old! For that - for that - I would give everything!\\"From that moment on, Dorian's life changes. Lord Henry becomes his mentor of sorts, and a finer fictional character I have yet to meet. Indeed, Lord Henry has a profound influence on young Dorian, and his philosophies will hypnotize you, as they often do Dorian Gray. The portrait takes on sinister and looming proportions, and eventually Dorian must face the consequences of that one whimsical wish, and fight the ultimate battle - for his own soul. An amazingly fabulous book you absolutely MUST read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"When Wilde landed in America in 1882 for a lecture tour, he was asked if he had anything to declare. He responded, &quot;Only my genius.&quot; Okay now, an attitude like that didn't exactly make me want to read any of his works for a long time. Finally, I decided to try The Picture of Dorian Grey, and I found that it really was a work of genius.The novel is the story of Dorian Grey who at the beginning of the novel has his portrait painted by Basil Hallward. The picture turns out to be remarkable, and Grey becomes jealous because the picture will remain young and beautiful while he will age. He expresses a wish that the picture would age instead of himself. To his delight, his wish becomes true, and believing himself to be immortal, he embarks on a path of of hedonism. He always searches for pleasure above happiness, and above all things he loves beauty. Along the way, the portrait chronicles the total moral decay of Dorian Grey.The are a lot of interpretations to this novel. My favorite is to read it as a moral tale warning of the consequences of leading a life of hedonism. It could almost be read as &quot;The Picture of Oscar Wilde&quot; as he seems to be criticizing his own lifestyle. This is probably also the most ironic reading of it since Wilde continued after the novel to preach aestheticism. But anyway, taken within itself, the novel is marvelous. The prose is well-polished. The pacing is elegant and the plot is always interesting. The points is makes are important. The Picture of Dorian Grey deserves its classic status, and Oscar Wilde actually was a bit of a genius."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"I'd heard a lot about Wilde when I started this book, but this was the first of his works that I'd ever read. I was half-way expecting long, incomprehensible philosophical discussions, impossible to decipher passages...my stereotype of 19th century literature. But when I was through the first chapter, I had a wake-up call. &quot;Wow,&quot; I thought, &quot;this is really GOOD!&quot; I became addicted, and sped through the rest of the book.

The story not only has a good plot, it has a strong philosophical foundation which is characterized through numerous epigrams. Among the characters, Dorian Gray and Lord Henry present various explanations throughout life.

Oscar Wilde's \\"Dorian Gray\\" is about youth, corruption, and esthetics. Reflective of Wilde's own life and revolt against Victorian era sentimentality, young Dorian Gray slowly changes after his philosophical discussions with the cynical Lord Henry Wotton, whose cold criticisms and harsh wit are often humorous in an addictively jaded kind of way, and tempting to arm oneself with; however, read on and observe Wilde's destruction of Lord Henry's young protoget. The immediate power of Basil Hallward's portrait of Dorian retains a demonic hold on its confused subject, taunting and torturing his vanity with its strangely metamorphizing characteristics. Who's changing, and what exactly is changing? Wilde creates an unforgettable \\"portrait\\" here of one man's (or is it the whole of Victorian society?) demise. Many critics of Wilde have seen him and \\"The Portrait of Dorian Gray\\" as pure evil and criticized the undertones of homosexuality, and linked it with a lifestyle of debauchery and degradation. Wilde was thrown in jail for his \\"unlawful activities\\". To them I must concur with Wilde, that \\"Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming. This is a fault.\\""},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Wilde's Dorian Gray is such a powerful book because it explores the path of one man's sins and their effect on his life and the lives of those around him. Wilde uses Dorian as an example to demonstrate the struggles of humanity coping with its flaws. Wilde's plot is simple enough. Dorian was a man who had everything going for him. He was young, beautiful, wealthy, and unspoiled. Then he met Lord Henry, whose bizzare philosophies that he himself didn't even take seriously had a great impact on the impressionable Dorian. Lord Henry had convinced Dorian that once his youth had passed, he would have nothing enjoyable left in life, which caused Dorian pray aloud that a portrait he had of himself would take on his own physical burdens. As Dorian becomes more and more corrupted by Lord Henry and commits more sins, he notices that the painting (which represents his conscience) is becoming more and more wretched. He occasionally feels remorse and tries to change, but his plans always fail when Lord Henry draws him back under the shadow of his influence. The discouraged Dorian finally resolves to start his life anew by destroying the painting, the only record he has of his sins. When he stabs the picture, however, he kills himself.This is a powerful story that portrays the important lesson that sins are inescapable and everybody's actions catch up to them. This isn't a hard concept, but Wilde's writing is very challenging. He uses very poignant expressions constantly throughout the book that can get the reader off track because they tend to cause him to attempt to frequently stop and process what has just been said. I think that this was a great book, but it wouldn't be good to require it at Mercy High because it takes so long to get through."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"More than a story, The Picture of Dorian Gray contains many of Oscar Wilde's most famous commentary on life. Unlike any other work of fiction that I have read before I actually read this book with a pen in hand, underlining Wilde's eloquent thoughts about art, tragedy and life.No need to recap the story here other than to say that it continues to be applicable to every human being born into this world. Each of us has our own picture that reflects our deepest and truest feelings, thoughts and actions. Facades abound but there is no getting around our frequent trips inside to have a look at the portrait that only we can see.A masterful book that goes far beyond the well-known story."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"\\"What does it profit a man if he gains the world, but loses his soul?\\" This is the core question raised by \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\", Oscar Wilde's reworking (if that isn't too unkind) of Goethe's Faust for the Victorian era and his attack on the values of the middle classes caused a scandal when it was first published in 1890 and over 100 years later, while not particularly shocking to the modern reader is still a deeply unsettling tale. The novel revolves around our hero Dorian, the tensions within his own character and the forces that conspire in his eventual destruction.The book begins with Dorian seeing for the first time a portrait of himself painted by his friend Basil Hallward and Dorian's wish that the portrait would age while he remained forever the same as he was on that day. The \\"prayer of his pride\\" is answered and not only does the picture carry the assault of time for Dorian, but also the full weight of the casual cruelties and crimes he commits, evolving from a reproduction of his physical form into a mirror image of his soul. Realising this, Dorian is driven to even greater excesses safe in the knowledge that he can get away with it until finally his own guilt catches up with him.In his only novel, one can't help but feel that Oscar is giving us an insight into his own soul and the guilt he suffered over his sexual orientation. But on a deeper level, Wilde shows us the damnation of one soul and in that gives us a metaphor for our world and ourselves. Despite the Victorian idea that a person&#65533;s nature is written on their face, which is frankly ludicrous with the hindsight of the last century, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is a truly wonderful and thought-provoking story heavily laced with the famous wit and wisdom of the great man himself."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"\\"It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors\\" - Oscar Wilde\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is an excellent novel about the degradation of the human soul. The novel focuses around the handsome Dorian Gray and his interactions with the artist Basil Hallward, who paints his portrait and Lord Henry, who becomes the corrupting influence on Dorian's soul and Dorian's iinteractions with the British aristocracy. Dorian is compared to Narcissus, who was so obsessed with his own beauty, that it swallowed him whole. Dorian seals his fate with one wish; upon viewing his portrait, he wonders if it would be possible for his portrait to show the signs of aging, in exchange for his mortal beauty. Throughout the novel, we see Dorian's decent into total self - absorbtion and evil all of which culminates in an ending that is predictable but still entertaining none the less.Just a quick side note, there is some great social commentary running throughout \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\\" specifically Wilde's commentary on the stiff, British aristocracy of the late 19th century, absurd views regarding women, who are painted by Gray as blubbering idiots (a sign of the times) and last but not least, the underlying homosexual undertones present between Dorian, Basil and Lord Henry are fascinating to deconstruct.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was my first introduction to Oscar Wilde and after reading the novel, I was hooked. I would like to return to the quote above, about art mirroring the soul of the spectator, after reading this novel, you will have a sense of how trully frightening that notion is."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"To be honest, I had two reasons for choosing this book. One was for a class assignment. Having a list to choose from lead to the second reason I picked this- a friend told me she had greatly enjoyed it. Therefore, I began reading with the expectation of having a &quot;nice&quot; read. Other than that, I didn't expect much from the novel. This is one of the times I am glad to say that I was wrong. &lt;i&gt;The Picture of Dorian Gray&lt;/i&gt; providea, first and foremost a good storyline. A young man, worried that once his youth and beauty departs he will lose everything, wishes that a portrait painted of him bear all reprecussions of time. After a period of time, this young man, Dorian Gray, discovers he has gotten his wish. However, an old maxim proves true once more in this novel: be careful what you wish for, as Gray learns he will, in fact, get what he deserves as a result of a life of debauchery. Yet an interesting (and certainly unsettling, at least at the time it was written) story line is not all the book has going for it. Wilde provides the reader with three main characters who are well-developed enough to make them convincing. We are given a tempramental artist (another good reason to read this book: anyone with any sort of artistic temprament will greatly appreciate some of the commentary made within the dialogue of the story), who is given to jealousy, a jaded, rather intellectual man who always has an opinon and never hastens to inform those in the vicinity of it, and, finally, a young man who begins the story as a very naive person and changes throughout the book in a seemingly natural manner. A wide variety of smaller characters also help to enhance the plot. In short, this book was one of the most interesting I have ever read. At times, I found myself getting the attention of someone nearby, to point out a line found in one of the passages that I felt they might enjoy or somehow relate to. In one way or another, it is my opinion one would be hard-pressed to find someone who did not relate to something the book.

He lives life with full adbandonment pays the price.I believe the moral of the story is this. In the end we all pay for our actions.Wilde does a great job building characters and leading the reader into the world of the Englis upper-crust."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"This book is sooo good, I think no jaded reader can deserve that title without having read this book. Dorian Gray, an astonishingly beautiful young aristocrat, receives the gift of eternal youth in the form of a painting one of his friends has made of him. Later, prompted by another friend, the divine dissolute Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian gradually falls into a dissipate lifestyle and the eerie painting shows both the ravages of age and the advance of Dorian's moral decay, while he retains his breathtaking looks. As Dorian becomes more and more obsessed with the painting's worsening appearance, the changes in his once sweet and naive personality are explained in the story, and Dorian lives in fear of the painting being exposed to the world, therefore showing him beyond any doubt as the sleazy creep he is, until it comes to a point when the gift he prized so much ends up turning against him. Dorian Gray is one of the least likable characters I have seen on print, but I really liked his wicked friend Lord Wotton, who in the story is the one in charge of leading Dorian astray and dishing criticism after witty criticism of nineteenth century English society. I later learned this particular character was a sort of mockery of Oscar Wilde himself. A mellower version of this character can be found in another of Wilde's works, Lord Arthur Savile's Crime, my second favorite story by this author."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Contrary to some opinions I've come across, this book does NOT romanticize or promote a loss of morals. It is the exact opposite. Yes, Dorian becomes corrupted, but does the ending suggest that Wilde was making Dorian a hero for it? By no means. Dorian did not live happily ever after. It is a very moral book in that it clearly reinforces the principle of inevitable consequences of one's actions. Yes, at times it was a little slow (that is when the characters went into long life-philosophies)but all around it was very interesting and provided an insight into the late Victorian world in which Oscar Wilde lived. It addresses some key concepts such as appearance and its relation to virtue and the double-sidedness of one's character. Overall this book was not bad at all. A good read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"I am a fan of many writers, but Oscar Wilde holds a special place in my non-existant but nonetheless real Hallway of Marble Busts of Famous Dead Guys. Obviously, Wilde was aware of his already-forming legend status at the height of his popularity, and his arrogance is permeated throughout every one of his works. This does not, however, disqualify him from being rightly honored by his huge and admiring readership. It also doesn't change the fact that he was victim of his own irony, dying young and humiliated in jail. No one illustrates tragicomedy better than Oscar Wilde.

I read the reviews and saw how people praises the book a lot. I liked the concept so figured I'll read it first before I'll watch the movie. I really thought I'd walk into a grotesque environment but it ended up so intriguing. Its exhilarating and atmospheric. I admire Oscar Wilde's brilliance in creating the characters, specifically Lord Henry. He is Dorian Gray's (the evil one) creator and honestly, Henry is the keystone of the story. His lines are perfectly constructed making them alluring even if he wasn't brave enough to do them himself. If I were like Dorian who grew up seeing only 4 walls and suddenly got freed, then get to talk to a man as eloquent as Henry is, I really believe his influence will be so great too. The characters of the book also show deep interest in art of different forms including Painting of course, literature and fashion which reflects the artist within Oscar himself. The author described Dorian Gray as \\"art\\" himself, I figured it will be challenging to find a person to play the part in the movie so beautiful to be called \\"art\\". Amazingly, Ben Barnes lived up to the role. Being chosen to play that role brings pressure and flattery of course, but the challenge is, if he can bring to life the Dorian Gray Oscar Wilde created. Its a good read! Oscar Wilde is a talented writer as we all know. This book can change your point of view of some aspects in life if you let it!! As what Ben said, \\"there's a great difference between pleasure and real happiness\\". You can try the movie too, its wonderfully made; great acting and the story line is nice. they made a few modifications and additions from the book at it made it more interesting.

Some of their friends sent their children there long before I was born. Pastor Jones might have had Dorian Gray in mind when he said: \\"Dissipations of youth must be paid for with a draft on old age.\\"Wilde's Dorian Gray is devoted to the fanciful premise that a soul might scar itself with the most horrible of depraved debauchery, which in Victorian London included opium dens, prostitution, and in the case of Mr. Gray, murder, both by proxy and in personal excess of temper. So, if you exercise patience, a murder mystery unfolds. (Lots and lots of patience!)What dark meditations crossed my mind, and how like ice was my countenance while feasting in Wilde's psychological eulogizing of scarlet sins and opulence from dozens of characters famous in classical Western history. As my mother was a history major with emphasis in fine arts, I've seen many of the anecdotal persons from art and mythology named in this book, experienced their art and literature and stories in our own collections and the local library. I've read their sad, sordid sense of moral turpitude, the decay of dynasties possessed of great art, luxury and wealth.Dorian's zeal to experience every pleasure on which he might lay his hands is reminiscent of the Ecclesiastes, though more lengthy and of less lucid outcomes. Accused sometimes of misanthropy, Oscar Wilde is nonetheless a master of florid verbosity. As once observed by author Ursula K. LeGuin, each sentence must dedicate it's reason for being, to an introduction of the next sentence.I might not have read all of this novel, except that I'm awed in admiration of the incredibly artful architecture of Wilde's sentences. One simple sentence might introduce what literature teachers will scold their students about being a \\"run-on-sentence.\\"But Wilde philosophizes elaborate arguments in the heads of his characters. There is nothing wrong analytically, or logically with attaching the cohesive phrases and clauses of two or more sides of an argument all together into a unified thought, even wielding a dozen commas to conjoin these articulated opposites.The style evokes memories of reading St. Paul in the King James English Bible, or the sublime constructions found in the tragedyRamona (Signet Classics), by Helen Hunt Jackson. I would never subject juvenile readers to the philosophy of Dorian Grey.

It is for that reason that his work is so filled with countless paradoxes and contradictions that challenge the mind and titillate the senses. Wilde lived in an infinitely ironic age, when society had grown so influential as to crowd out the individuals that made it up. Today, we have taken for granted this incongruity and so our writers cannot express the kind of irony that Wilde mastered, despite the fact that we all know that something is amiss.\`The Picture of Dorian Gray' is filled with this irony. The plot shows us the ultimate irony of a man giving up his soul for the beauty of youth--the condition that is exalted in the modern age above all else, intellect, truth, justice, life itself. Interspersed are dialogues and epigrams that persist one hundred years later as some of the finest word handling ever recorded. Even a few samples should compel the potential reader:\\"The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about.\\"\\"Every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter.\\"\\"A man cannot be too careful in his choice for his enemies.\\"\\"The only difference between a caprice and a life-long passion is that the caprice lasts a little bit longer.\\"\\"Men marry because they are tired, women marry because they are curious. Both are disappointed.\\"\\"I love acting, it is so much more real than life.\\"- \\"I am on the side of the Trojans, they fought for a woman.\\"- \\"They were defeated.\\"The mastery of wit that Wilde displays must be seen in its context. He was a decadent as much as the characters he portrays are. Ultimately, the disillusion that the decadent faces comes through in the story and the reader is left with a very uneasy feeling upon completing \`Dorian Gray.' Is life as absurd as it seems? Is there a solution? Or are we stuck with a life of paradox? Perhaps our current period of decadence will show us an alternative. Until it does, we can enjoy the astounding word play offered here."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Oscar Wilde was one of the foremost representatives of Aestheticism, a movement based on the notion that art exists for no other purpose than its existence itself (\\"l'art pour l'art\\"), not for the purpose of social and moral enlightenment. Born in Dublin and a graduate of Oxford's Magdalen College, he initially worked primarily as a journalist, editor and lecturer, but gradually turned to writing and produced his most acclaimed works in the six-year span from 1890 to 1895, roughly coinciding with the period of his romantic involvement with Lord Alfred \\"Bosie\\" Douglas, sixteen years his junior. Douglas's strained relationship with his father, John Sholto Douglas, Marquees of Queensberry, eventually resulted in a series of confrontations between Wilde and the Marquees, which first led to a libel suit brought by Wilde against his lover's father (who had openly accused Wilde of \\"posing as a sodomite\\" and threatened to disown his son if he didn't give up his acquaintance with the writer) and subsequently to two criminal trials against Wilde for \\"gross indecencies,\\" based on a law generally interpreted to prohibit homosexual relationships. Sentenced to a two-year term of \\"hard labor\\" in Reading Gaol, Wilde emerged from prison in 1897 a spiritually, physically and financially broken man and, unable to continue living in England or Ireland, after three years' wanderings throughout Europe died in 1900 of cerebral meningitis, barely 46 years old.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\\" Wilde's only novel besides seven plays as well as several works of short fiction, poetry, nonfiction and two fairy tale collections originally written for his two sons, is critical to an understanding of Wilde's body of work and his personality primarily for two reasons: First, because it constitutes one of his earliest fully accomplished formulations of Aestheticism, and secondly because of its undeniable undercurrent of homoeroticism; an inclination which, after a six-year marriage widely thought to initially have been a true love match, Wilde had begun to explore more openly around the time of the novel's creation (1890). The story's title character is an exceptionally handsome young man who, both in the eyes of the artist tasked to paint his portrait, Basil Hallward, and in those of their somewhat older friend Lord Henry Wotton, epitomizes perfect beauty and is coveted by both men for that very reason. Seduced by hedonistic Lord Henry into believing that beauty can literally justify anything, including any act of immorality, Dorian sells his soul for maintaining his beautiful appearance, letting his portrait age in his stead. (In that, his character resembles Goethe's and Marlowe's Faust.) He then quickly turns from an innocent youth into a cruel and calculating man whom society, in its shallow adherence to appearances, nonetheless never associates with any of the results of his cruelty, never looking beyond the surface of his handsome exterior and assuming that a man so beautiful must necessarily also be good. Ultimately it is Dorian himself who brings about his own downfall when he is no longer able to face the manifestation of his evilness in Basil Hallward's picture.Upon its initial publication in Lippincott's Monthly Magazine in 1890, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was widely scorned as immoral by a public neither familiar with nor particularly open to the concepts of Aestheticism and its mockery of middle class morality, and repulsed by the thinly veiled homoerotic relationship of the novel's protagonists. Wilde republished the work the following year, adding a preface designed to explain his views on art. Yet, it was that preface which, along with several of his other publications and his written exchanges with Lord Alfred Douglas, ultimately would play a devastating role in his trials, where Queensberry's attorney would come to use an excerpt from that very preface - \\"There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written\\" - to extract from Wilde statements to the effect that any book inspiring a sense of beauty (including, as implied in the attorney's question, an \\"immoral\\" book, if \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" could be qualified as such) was well-written and therefore commendable; that only Philistines, brutes and illiterates - whose views on art he considered invariably stupid and for which he therefore didn't \\"care twopence\\" - could consider this novel \\"perverted,\\" and that the majority of the reading public would probably not be able to draw a proper distinction between a good and a bad book. It was testimony such as this, as well as the impending confrontation with a number of male witnesses ready to testify as to the nature of their relationship with Wilde, that not only caused the author's attorney to convince his client to drop the libel suit against Queensberry but also opened the door for Wilde's own subsequent prosecution.If \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" has a central theme besides the supremacy of beauty and the depiction of a society primarily interested in appearances, it is a call for individuality: Dorian's cruelty is brought out only after he allows himself to be influenced by Lord Henry's equally seductive and cynical hedonism; and similarly, Basil Hallward's blind idolizing of Dorian eventually proves fatal for the painter. - Wilde's only novel is one of the first and most poignant expressions of his own individualism; but unlike his protagonist, who ultimately pays a ghastly prize for selling his soul and giving up his individuality, Wilde paid as high a price for maintaining his. Like Dorian, he knew that \\"[e]ach of us has Heaven and Hell in him,\\" and although this novel's preface ends with the provocative statement that \\"[a]ll art is quite useless,\\" it was the very fact that Wilde put his entire being into his art that ultimately destroyed him. But like beauty, which is finally restored to perfection in Dorian Gray's portrait, Wilde's works have stood the test of time; and not merely for their countless, pricelessly witty epigrams. They're as well worth a read as ever.Also recommended:Complete Works of Oscar Wilde (Collins Classics)Oscar WildeWilde (Special Edition)The Oscar Wilde CollectionThe Picture of Dorian GrayThe Importance of Being Earnest - Criterion CollectionThe Importance of Being EarnestAn Ideal HusbandA Good Woman"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"I found the first half or so of this novel the stronger, more interesting part, mostly for the unbelievable abundance of mercilessly satirical paradoxes of the cleverest quality.The building of the story around three characters, really quite different, is satisfying; though, as the story goes on, it's really only about Dorian and his mysterious portrait.The most prominent character for the first part is Lord Harry, the mouthpiece for all of the novel's notoriously subversive paradoxes. People may find him irritating because of his supercilious, scornful intellectual brilliance - they may even be jealous of him because of this, like I was to begin with; and then others will most likely be offended becuase of his espousal of an immoral aestheticism which disregards corrupting social consequences. Yet, I find Lord Harry as remote and inflexible in his decadent aestheticism as any unsympathetic moralist I've ever met in fiction - it's just Lord Harry chooses to be moralistic in a paradoxical, unconventional way. His attitudes are exclusive and unbending, and he lives out his beliefs uncompromisingly. He is impatient of any other view - yes, he is highly moralistic - a brilliant character. I don't think he's meant to be taken too seriously, in the sense that one tries to warm to him or learn from him, like one does with central, powerful characters in other stories - he does not serve that purpose. He's not there to be engaged with; if you attempt it, he'll laugh at you and push you away. He has a weary dislike of you before you even begin reading. So, if you try to make yourself like him, it won't work, and you'll dislike him all the more, and may dislike the novel because of it. Don't upset yourself: read it in the right way. It fully deserves it, because there are pages and pages of gifted prose to be in awe of.Dorian can be likeable because of his sincerity. If I've mistaken him and he isn't really sincere, then I like him because at least he's never at ease with himself for his bad actions - though even that might not be totally true! Well, he is not the same as Lord Harry; he doesn't repulse your advances towards him as a reader like Lord Harry. He's not untouchable.I don't think the story is making any great moral point. Such is the beauty of the writing style and the ideas and the way the people are, rather than who they are, that I think the characters are secondary, in some strange way. The tragedy that befalls two of the main characters near the end of the book isn't heart wrenching. But that isn't a fault of the author's in not making them likeable enough or not developing them well enough; because, like I say, they are slightly removed from us. What is presented for our delectation is the beauty of how they are, more than the morality of how they ought to behave."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"In books, magazines, television, etc. in the English-speaking world, we often come across references made to Oscar Wilde, as many people quote his witty sayings and lines. Having come across so many of these references and quotations myself, I was hesitant to pick up any of his works, assuming that to understand and appreciate Wilde I would have to be some kind of a literary scholar. Let me set the record straight: this is definitely not the case at all, as Oscar Wilde is very down to earth and easy to understand.He is a gifted writer and I understand now why people quote him so much. He's a master at putting thoughts to pen and paper so ingeniously. After I found out for myself what he was all about, I regret that I never read his books earlier. I picked up this book that included various works and I was truly amazed at his genius. He interlaces humor with the heavy so cleverly.In all of his works you can easily identify a so-called \\"dandy\\", a male character whose one role is to make flippant but ironically true remarks to the dismay of stuffy characters. The quotes we so often see or hear are usually remarks uttered by one of Wilde's dandies. Offering tongue-in-cheek humor with wholehearted honesty, Wilde called a spade, a spade but could so with such brilliant wit. Oh if only I could be even half as gifted with the pen!I am not going to write about any plots of the stories and plays, as other readers have done that already. I simply wanted to say that if you have never read anything by Wilde, I highly recommend you do. I am confidant you will enjoy. You could end up like me, frantically longing to get your hands on as much of his writing as you can."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Picture of Dorian Gray is a great work of fiction. Its interplay of Hellenic thought and Judaeo-Christian ethics was light years ahead of its time, even though it might come across muddled to the casual reader. Perhaps, this novel was too far ahead of its time, as it was eventually used as evidence against Wilde in two court cases for 'gross indecency' in 1895.It is a simple story; really, Basil Hallward paints a lovely portrait of Dorian Gray, a veritable Adonis. As the Painter puts the finishing touches upon this portrait, Gray is involved with a conversation regarding the nature of beauty with Lord Henry (Harry) Wotton. This culminates in Dorian wishing and praying that his beauty may never diminish; that he'd have eternal youth. Ultimately, the painting would bear all of the marks of sin, decadence, and decay that cause our physical bodies to age, while Dorian kept his stunning good looks. Wilde brings about a rather wonderful conclusion, and it is a very enjoyable story.The Picture of Dorian Gray has its dull parts. It doesn't remain current, and I'd suggest getting a copy with notes, so that you may be able to keep up with all of the references. Let's be honest, in 2004 who really cares about what was fashionable in 19th century France? These are questions the notes can clarify, and make some of the references more amiable. Still there are parts where Wilde just lists things, and these you should skip.When reading this novel, I think it becomes clear that the three main personalities are a reflection of society at that time. While Basil Hallward seemed to personify Christian conservatism, and a mundane attachment to the status quo, Lord Henry is the questioning romantic, a character that seems to argue everything yet prove nothing, and believe in even less. This makes him no less interesting, and I believe Wilde may have included him as a farce of some of his contemporaries, yet some of the best insights and quotes actually come from Lord Henry.Dorian is the romantic ideal of perfection. Though a horrible character that fears no consequences for his actions, he still remains perfection. I think that aristocratic England valued physical appearance, social wit, and worldliness more than an ethical life.Dorian Gray also typifies Wilde's affections for Hellenic culture. Dorian is the stereotypical Greek Tragic Hero. He has a flaw; his vanity; this flaw leads to his downfall; a life of sin; he realizes his flaw in the end, and tries to make amends, but it is too little too late. If you enjoy Shakespeare Allusions, you will enjoy this.I really liked The Picture of Dorian Gray, but I will not advise one way or the other whether you should read it or not. If you want something stimulating that will have an enormity of good quotes that will make your dominating intellect seem even more so to the untrained eye, then check it out. If you're looking for pulp go check out Tom Clancey or Danielle Steele."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Innocent and young Dorian Gray is seduced by some bad influences, and taught to worship youth, beauty, and sensation. Due to a passionate prayer, the physical effects of a life dedicated to self-gratification and pleasure-seeking are borne by a painting of him instead of by his own body. The story focuses not on the actual events of Dorian's life, but the discussions on the philosophies supporting such a life. To this reviewer, the message is that a life of selfishness and self-gratification corrupts, and in the end we can have no separation from this corruption. Dorian Gray is a tad slow at times, as the conversations can get long, but it is still educational, and certainly worth reading."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"I never would have thought this interesting combination of Marlowe, Shakespeare, and Dickens possible. For those of you who follow my writing, you know that I really liked Mr. Wilde's \\"Importance of Being Earnest.\\" And his \\"Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is enough to put him right up there with Mr. Marlowe, Mr. Shakespeare, and Mr. Dickens. Like any good tale of terror, the story starts normal and plausible. We only get to know Sybil for a short while, but she delivers a very touching passage on her love for Dorian which prepares her very sympathetic character. Her brother is prepared early and resurfaces with good timing. Basil is well drawn as the artist who has an interesting fascination with Dorian. We only see Alan Campbell briefly, but we are permitted to feel some sympathy for him when he is forced into a criminal act and finds himself overcome with anxiety. Harry is a well drawn character who not only provides comical touches, but jokes (unknowingly) about many dark thoughts that are undoubtedly revolving in Dorian's mind. And Dorian? What a wonderful creation! First we get to see him as a normal person. Soon afterwards, we see his dark desires. We see him fall in love, and then we see his love turn to abuse. But even as we see his character descend into evil, Wilde never quite permits us to forget that he is human. This is especially prevalent when he longs for his childhood innocence. Wilde masterfully builds tension when Dorian's unchanged face starts to raise questions. And as if this were not enough, Wilde allows Dorian's reputation to degenerate with his character. What's left? Only beautiful and excellent wording, magnificent suspense, terrifying moments, dramatic irony, some well placed comical touches, etc, etc, etc. This is a phenomenal book that offers an interesting combination of Marlowe's techniques (showing pacts with evil), Shakespeare's techniques (articulate wording and passages), and Dickens' techniques. (Fierce humor side by side with pure terror.) DO NOT let this phenomenal masterpiece get away!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Unfortunately I made it through both high school and college without ever having been assigned this book. Over the years I have read plenty of Wilde's works, but for some reason or another, missed this one over and over. I recently sat down, and decided that it was time to give this a read. To be honest, I knew very little about this actual book prior to reading it, other than it involved a picture that aged rather than he in the painting.I expected to have difficulty reading this book, since it had been such a long time since I had read anything from the Victorian era, however the language was surprisingly simple, and Wilde's wit is as sharp as ever. Almost sharp enough to harm the reader should they not be forewarned or guided through the readings. Should someone of a weaker mind read this book, it would be easy to fall into the trap of Dorian, who himself was poisoned by a book and the words of his friend.Summary without giving too much away: Dorian Gray is an Adonis-like beauty, young and full of life and innocence at the beginning of our story. His beauty has attracted the obsession of a painter who paints picture after picture of him. Basil (the painter) tries to keep young Dorian pure and in love with life. Henry, a friend of Basil's comes to the studio as Basil paints his master work - a portrait of Doran. Henry fascinates young Dorian in his vile manner of speaking and sarcastic wit. His talk instills in Dorian both a fear of losing his beauty and a lust for all that is selfish and vile in life. Dorian's notable debauchery follows in exquisite detail with Henry always along for the ride to prod young Dorian down the wrong road. Several suicides and a murder or two later, complete madness begins to make its appearance.Wilde was brilliant in his writing of this book, he captures the time perfectly... the lust of it, the sexuality of it, the debauchery of it... all in the name of truth. In their words they say things that their hearts dare not to believe and their smiles are masks hiding the truth. And what if someone believed in these lies? What if they lived their life according to what they had been told? Then they would be Dorian Gray... and we will see what happens to him. This is a brilliant read, and for those of you who will have to write papers on it... the story is not long, but it is thick with meaning. There are very few stories that I would give 5 stars to, this is one of them."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Published in 1890, this novel by Oscar Wilde is a startling, fantastic portrayal of fin de siecle indulgence and hedonism.The novel is dark in its tone as it describes Dorian's fall from purity, and it involves itself heavily with suicide, death and supernatural occurences. The novel is also somewhat satirical, as Wilde makes reference to the absurd state of social affairs in Victorian London. Ironic and suspenseful, the novel keeps the reader interested in each plot development, and keeps the reader engaged and moved by the beautiful, carefully crafted prose.The story begins with Lord Harry Wotton, utterly captivated by a painting by a friend, the artist Basil Hallward. The painting is of the handsome and unspotted young Dorian Gray. Dorian is stunned at the worldly knowledge of the older gentleman, and soon finds himself under Lord Wotton's care and attention. Harry, the eternal pessimist, schools Dorian in his existential, hedonistic view. Dorian wishes in his vanity that the beautiful painting might age instead of he. When Dorian falls in love with and coldly rebukes a young actress, he returns home to find that the painting bears a faint expression of cruelty and callous; a certain sneer about the mouth. His wish had come true; \\"the canvas [bore] the burden of his passions and his sins.\\"As the story goes on, Dorian falls further and further into his own mind, indulging his every whim, strangling the lives of most everyone he touches by the ropes of scandal that Dorian is entangled in.Resonating throughout the story are the themes of power and love, overriden by vanity and swept beneath by slight homosexual undertones (easily overlooked by anyone who wants to overlook it).I thoroughly enjoyed this novel; the characters were well-developed, and I could identify with Dorian's desire to find a balance between his selfish motivation to indulge himself and his moral need to free himself from his sins. It is the endless plight of human existence: The moral drive to overcome the sins of our nature. The way the novel was written gives the reader a deep appreciation for Oscar Wilde, and the way in which he writes. The novel was a little difficult here and there, not because it was verbose or stylistically challenging, but merely because it was very in-depth. The book itself is a beautiful work; but moreso than the book itself are the ideas behind it. This is a book that makes one think about consequences of actions, the importance of emotions, of repentance and redemption.I would highly recommend this book.\\"Something has changed you completely. You look exactly the same wonderful boy who, day after day, used to come down to my studio to sit for his picture. But you were simple, natural and affectionate then. You were the most unspoiled creature in the whole world. Now, I don't know what has come over you. You talk as if you had no heart, no pity in you.\\" - Basil Hallward to Dorian Gray, Chapter 9."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"I have always heard of Dorian Gray, but never got around to reading it until now.

Compelled by my teacher to read it, I didn't think this book could give me so many hints. Thanks to Oscar Wilde I had my first approach to the Aesthetic ideolgy, absolutely one of the most involving and interesting: let's do &quot;Art just for Art's Sake&quot;! Dorian Gray embodies the new intellectual who thinks life should be lived as a work of art, so that it is possible to stop the destructive power of time. He also stated the only reality is that of impressions and sensations, and everything in life should be done in order to experience every kind of sensations, no matter how to do and what society could think. Well, I'm just a teenager and maybe for this reason I share some of Wilde-Dorian's instances: like me, the protagonist tries to reconcile wills of rebellion, linked to his soul's corruption, with desires of worldiness. In conclusion I think this is one of the best book I've ever read - and I have read al lot. I would suggest it to everybody who's willing to descover the most intimate and deepest aspects of his own soul!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"This is a beautiful book in layout and design. Oscar Wilde was many things, but for me he is an Artist first and foremost, and with this book The Belknap Press pays homage to a brilliant writer. The novel's reception is an intriguing story. I have recently purchased OSCAR WILDE: THE CRITICAL HERITAGE, and it beautifully relates the history of the book's reception. One unsigned review, In PUNCH, begins, \\"The Baron has read Oscar Wilde's Wildest and Oscarest work, called DORIAN GRAY, a weird sensational romance...\\" Another review, in DAILY CHRONICLE, begins, \\"Dullness and dirt are the chief features of Lippincott's this month. The element in it that is unclean, though undiniably amusing, is furnished by Mr Oscar Wilde's story of THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY.

It is now a classic of supernatural fiction, and I think it has been in-print ever since its first book appearance, or shortly afterward when Robert Ross worked so diligently to bring Wilde's works back into print. This is a beautiful and definitive edition."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Oscar Wilde's only novel, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" provides a cautionary tale about the dogmatic pursuit of youth and beauty at the cost of one's own soul. Wilde provides an insight into the hedonistic lifestyle that he lived and championed. Indeed, one of the basic tenets of Wilde's philosophy - aestheticism - is presented in contradictory terms. While aestheticism attempts to redefine art as a means of beauty with no moral purpose, the novel's artwork - the portrait of Dorian Gray - shows the moral consequences of Dorian's hedonistic and narcissistic lifestyle.In a way, Dorian is the work of art, for he never changes his appearance. It is his portrait that is burdened with the sins and iniquities of Dorian's wickedness, for his portrait becomes haggard and disheveled as Dorian's soul sinks further into a dark abyss of nefarious behavior. On the outside, Dorian shows the luminous beauty of youth and a pure mind, yet the true soul of Dorian is diseased and dying. Any attempts at changing his inner essence only reveal him to be a hypocrite and egotist.Another cautionary tale is that in one of idolizing others and falling for their influence. Dorian begins his descent into immorality when he becomes enamored with Henry Wooten's philosophies that \\"the only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it\\" and \\"beauty is the wonder of wonders.\\" The cynical and satirical Henry Wooten espouses his hedonistic lifestyle, yet does not become entrapped in it like Dorian. Then, it is Dorian's influence who corrupts and ruins the lives of nearly all those with whom he is intimate.It is easy to see why this novel was criticized and decried as immoral in Victorian England. From the first chapter, there is a definite homosexual undertone. Henry and Basil admire Dorian's beauty and Basil declares that he cannot live without seeing Dorian everyday. Indeed, Basil's fondness of Dorian could just as easily describe romantic feelings toward a woman. Although there are heterosexual relationships, they are shallow and fleeting. Dorian's own deplorable actions are never revealed, save for opium, yet his corruption of young men implies that he engaged in acts of \\"gross indecency\\", the very same acts for which Oscar Wilde would be tried and convicted years later. Perhaps Wilde is attempting to justify his own lifestyle and criticize moral judgments, for \\"it is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances.\\"Although this is essentially a dark, Gothic novel, it does contain scenes of wit and humor. Henry's dialogue and witticisms convey the same tone as many of Wilde's highly acclaimed plays. Through satire, Wilde reveals the superficial nature of the aristocracy. Despite rumors of Dorian's sins, he is still highly desirable in London society, as his beauty and youth trump all.This is a superb novel by Wilde. I only wish that he would have honored us with a few more novels."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Dorian Gray was quite the read.Dorian Gray is a young man who has exquisite, wonderful features. He is good-looking. He is a model for Basil, a painter. Basil paints a portrait of Dorian Gray. Lord Henry, one of Basil's friends, meets Dorian and remarks how sad it is that Dorian will not always retain his youth and beauty. Dorian grows sad about this - and thinks, if only this picture would grow old and I can always stay young! He envies his own picture, because he thinks that the picture will forever retain its youth - while he will bear the wrinkles of life.Then things start becoming strange. After an unpleasant experience with his fianc&eacute;e, an actress, he looks at his picture and notices a cruel twist of the mouth. This is only the beginning. As Dorian makes his descent into debauchery and sinfulness, the picture bears the weight of his actions. Everytime he commits a transgression, the picture grows uglier and uglier. The picture becomes his sort of \\"conscience.\\"This book is one worth reading. I had heard of Dorian Gray and was curious. Wilde's writing was descriptive, yet easy to read. It is one of the easier classics, in my opinion.The only flaw to this novel was, at one point, there is a stage where Dorian collects a lot of things - like embroidery, etc. It describes the things he collects and makes lots of references and allusions to seemingly random people (perhaps famous people in history?). This seemed to me like a non sequitur, and just lots of rambling. Furthermore, it was confusing because I didn't know who the people being mentioned were. It was tedious, although I endured it. I'm glad I did, because the story progressed wonderfully.The ending is... quite morbid, but didn't come across as a complete surprise.The Picture of Dorian Gray is worth your while.

Initially innocent he is corrupted by Henry Wotton his supposed friend, a devoutly immoral character who leads Dorian Gray into a truly sinful existance.By chance Gray discovers his wish came true and the portrait not his own face is aged by his lifestyle, but when he sees the extent to which the image has been ravaged he wishes to recinde the wish. Wilde illustrates the ugly side of our natures and shows there is always a price to pay for it despite the public face presented to the world. Despite the dark message, the biting wit and sarcasm keep the reader amused as well as disturbed, leaving me with a somewhat guilty feeling if I should laugh while reading it (which I often did). The interesting thing is the author does not take a moral stance, maybe because of the life he led himself. Although Wild's only novel and not overly long, it is a truly great work.

Lord Henry is also the vehicle through which Wilde put down his many uniquely Wildesque epigrams into the novel, such as \\" Conscience and cowardice are really the same thing, Basil.

I guess the fact that I was also reading Milton's Paradise Lost at the same time as Dorian Gray doesn't help cut down the long internal debates Dorian Gray forced into my skull.

Given a magical portrait that protects the subject from the consequences of immorality, Rod Sterling would have ended it the same way.Still reading through a contemporary lens, Dorian Gray provides rich imagery of life in the 19th century. Wilde disadvantages this strength of the novel by exhaustively listing image after image while Dorian immerses himself in sensory experience. These passages read like mildly interesting dictionary entries.Overall, the pithy dialogue, imagery and wonderfully gothic story wins out and Grey entertains."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"Initially heavy on witty dialogue and light on plot, but it gets there in the second half and is a clever story.

As a young, beautiful and conceited man, Dorian finds comfort in the company of Lord Henry, a morally corrupt aristocrat in Victorian England. Already teetering on the verge of chronic narcissism, Dorian is pushed off the edge into the abyss of eternal damnation by Henry's seductive, imaginative, and in the end, destructive speech.This classic, cautionary tale of the woes of youth has vanity at its core. Dorian, like all of us, is afraid of becoming irrelevant and unloved as a consequence of old age. Only in his case, he let his paranoia coupled with bad influence (Lord Henry) devour him. The story isn't unique in the sense that it happens everyday in the form of inconsequential lives consumed by gyms, beauty salons and drugs, chasing reluctant love and evasive youth.If you haven't read this classic in school, I highly recommend you do now. Lord Henry's lines, though evil, are very entertaining and almost too poetic. No man I know has a wit and sharp tongue like Lord Henry, but again, he is not a man. He is the devil's incarnate."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"That famous quote from Shakespeare's Hamlet certainly applies to Dorian Gray. And Lord Henry Wotton couldn't help using this quote, much like he couldn't help baiting Dorian Gray. Lord Henry admires the man in Basil Hallward's new portrait so much that he has got to meet him. Is he as beautiful in real life as he is in the painting? Is he ever! He is an Adonis, a young man as pure on the inside as he is on the outside. No wonder Hallward is obsessed with him! So begins Lord Henry's attempts to corrupt the young man. In no uncertain terms, he tells Dorian Gray that \\"beauty is the wonder of wonders. It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances.\\" He also goes on to tell him that his wonderful youth and good looks are his best qualities, too bad someday they will fade. Dorian Gray is upset. His portrait will remain young and beautiful forever, whereas he will age and lose with his physical beauty. If only it were the other way around...That is all I'll share in terms of plot. You have got to read this magnificent novel to know the rest. The Picture of Dorian Gray, first published in 1890, is one of the most disturbing works of fiction I have ever read. No wonder it is so popular! It is thought provoking from beginning to end. Dorian is a cross between Narcissus and Faust -- his vanity is obvious from the very start, and Lord Henry is depicted as a devil, whereas Hallward is the angel who tries to maintain Dorian's innocence. Yes, as it has often been observed, the novel does have some not-so-concealed references to homosexuality. The aforementioned theme, mainly noticeable in Hallward, is, in the words of Marianne Dashwood in Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility, \\"implied but never declared.\\" There was no need for Wilde to say it in so many words, but he dropped hints here and there, like the rumors that Hallward moved to San Francisco. I doubt he would have been able to be more inconspicuous in his time. This novel could cover long hours of discussion. There are so many themes and symbolism and magic realism and foreshadowing here, and Lord Henry's crude but honest musings and observations are fascinating. He is definitely the most interesting character in the book. This is my first time reading this book. I'd wanted to read it since I read Amanda Filipacchi's Nude Men ten years ago. Why it took me so long to give it a whirl I will never know. Better late than never, I guess. And if you haven't read it, well, need I suggest that you do? You won't regret it.

It was an interesting book, and while I cannot say that I liked it as such, it is good to have read it - my curiosity is satisfied.It was very sad that Dorian went so completely \\"off the rails\\", so to speak, under the influence of Henry, and I found the worldview difficult to cope with. At times the irony in the situations was very poignant - such as when Dorian tells Sybil Vane that she is selfish, while he, in fact, is the selfish one. I suppose that justice was met at the end of the book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"First published in 1890, Oscar Wilde's now classic novel is a meditation on decadence, art and morality. At the center is a young man of strikingly good looks who's portrait is painted by a dear friend - a portrait that then absorbs and reflects the young man's soul as he makes decisions that affect others as he slides into a life of debauchery.Highly stylized, the prose contains classic lines such as \\"the only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.\\" Wilde's only novel, the book was viewed as scandalous and immoral when published despite the fact that the immoral - or, more accurately, amoral perpetrator of ill deeds suffers as he chases empty pleasures and eventually comes to reflect upon the impact that his actions have had upon others and himself.The book is not the easiest of reads given the heavy style, the setting, and pervasive use of cultural references from high society in the late 19th century. However, for those who want to fully understand the commonly referenced trope of \\"Dorian Gray's portrait,\\" nothing serves bettern than the source."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"I read this book because it was a bookclub read.

I am happy that I read the book and I did find it to be a good story and plot overall. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read the classics."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"I really have no idea why \\"Illustrated\\" is included in the title of this work. The only part of this book that is illustrated (besides the cover) is the short biography found at the end of the book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"It must have been around 1870 when very capable artist Basil Hallward brilliantly painted soon to be very rich 20-year old Dorian Gray. Hallward's wordy, witty friend Lord Henry Wotton on their first meeting in the painter's studio persuaded Dorian Gray that youth was any good looking human's greatest attribute. And youth, since it did not long endure, must be lived to the utmost while it did last. This meant Dorian's \\"expressing,\\" externalizing every insight, impulse and passion that most people learn to keep bottled up inside them. An early version of \\"let it all hang out.\\"Oh, how hitherto naive and innocent Dorian wished that he would never have to say farewell to his youth and beauty! If only he might stay young while the young man in his portrait did all the aging? That wish was granted. And THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY (1890, 1891) unrolls the next 18 or 19 years of Gray's while everyone around him grew older but he did not.It can be argued,that Dorian's wish for eternal youth was morally indifferent, neither good nor bad. It might have remained harmless, like Ponce de Leon's search for the Fountain of Youth. It was conceivably a well-meaning God who granted Dorian Gray's wish. What would matter in the end was what Gray did with his youth.He was given good albeit secular advice by painter Basil Hallward and very bad, cynical, character-ruining advice by Lord Henry. Unfortunately for Hallward (whom Gray would later murder) and for Dorian himself, the young man consistently heeded Lord Henry. In consequence, Dorian Gray learned to separate art from reality, learned to value clever words and eptithets more than unselfish deeds and denied himself nothing that his fertile brain could imagine. This self-indulgence included frequent visits to London opium dens, brawls with foreign sailors on the docks and viciously spurning Sybil Vane, the teenage Shakespearean actress, whom he loved for her acting skills but who renounced them because they seemed unreal compared with Dorian's love for her. Hours after a scathing denunciation by a disappointed Dorian, young Sybil swallows prussic acid and dies.All this dissent into hell is faithfully reproduced in the increasingly cruel, vicious lines of face and body in the portrait of Dorian Gray. The picture becomes the conscience of the novel's hero who often sits spell-bound before it. It sometimes persuades him, very briefly, to make half-hearted efforts at reform. But the portrait allows Dorian to understand that every single one of his half-hearted good deeds is hypocritical, is bad acting. For 18 years, until he destroys himelf with a knife intended to destroy his portrait, Dorian Gray remains a handsome 20-year old while all others move steadily toward the grave.Telling the bare story of Gray's decline takes up perhaps a third of THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY. The rest is ballast, starting with excursuses into Gray's sometimes year long fads of the moment: tapestries, music, religion (especially Roman Catholicism), mysticism and decadent French literature. Then there are teas, dinners and parties among the swells and aristocrats of London. These are all contrived social stages for Oscar Wilde to let his decadent characters like Lord Henry Wotton and handsome young Dorian Gray skewer institutions like marriage and preen themselves before admiring audiences as they drop several hundred seemingly spontaneous epithets into sparkling conversations. The London ambience of useless Duchesses, members of Parliament and wealthy society widows is lovingly limned by Oscar Wilde.Let one party and its smart talk suffice for many. As brilliant for its repartee as any other social occasion in the novel is Chapter 15's small, hastily puled together dinner at Lady Narborough's. Dorian Gray appears, having mere hours before having stabbed to death his friend painter Basil Hallward and having then blackmailed another onetime friend to dispose of the body. At Lady Narborough's Dorian was wildly excited but outwardly calm and his manner \\"as easy and graceful as ever.\\" The company was rather dull. His hostess's married daughter had \\"one of those characteristic British faces that, once seen, are never remembered.\\" Things became livelier when Lord Henry Wotton arrived, very, very late. The table discusses the amours of Madame de Ferrol. Lord Henry summed her up: \\"Her capacity for family affection is extraordinary. When her third husband died, her hair turned quite gold from grief.\\" Henry preens himself when accused of wickedness: \\"It is perfectly monstrous ... the way people go about nowadays saying things against one behind one's back that are absolutely and entirely true.\\"The question arises at Lady Narborough's: are we such a sorry lot because it is \\"the end of the century\\" (fin de siecle)? or the end of the world (fin de globe)? Certainly none of the players is morally outstanding or even self-content. They are useless and they know it.-OOO-"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"This was a English summer project for my daughter in school. She really enjoyed it.

These people like authors to create beautiful scenes for them that they can forever conjure up in their heads. For this kind of reader, The Picture of Dorian Gray is probably a pleasure. Unfortunately, I am not this kind of reader.It is perhaps fitting that a book about beauty is defined by the images it creates rather than by the story or the dialogue. However, Oscar Wilde's mastery of dialogue is what makes his plays such a pleasure. For me, The Picture of Dorian Gray will never live up to Wilde's plays. This is not to say that the book is completely irredeemable; whenever Lord Henry is around, the book becomes better (but only insofar as it becomes more like a play, more focused on dialogue).You will love this book if you like descriptions, if you, unlike me, were able to read the chapters of The Grapes of Wrath that rambled about the land and that did not contribute to the plot. If you are like me, on the other hand, this book will be readable but not particularly enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"The storyline is very good and the theme is thought provoking. However, the great weakness for me are the characters in this piece. Character driven novels have characters that bring out some form of emotion from the reader.

Had Wilde developed the characters better this could have been a masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"If you have never read an Oscar Wilde book, read this one. It is easy to read, entertaining and throughly enjoyable. The language doesn't trip you up. I have enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"I have watched the old movie of this story and the newer one but had never read the book. This was excellent!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"The most disappointing part of this book is that it read more like a non-fiction philosophy book than a story or novel. I would say 70% of the pages were portrayed as thoughts of a character or a speech of a character contemplating life, women, how we are suppose to live, etc.The actual story was hidden throughout the book, but you have to drone on through many pages to find it. The story itself is highly predictable and yet still has many missing parts to it. Many years of Dorian Gray's life is missing where it is hinted to that he commit's the most awful sins. I think reading of those sinful actions was to be more entertaining than the rabbit trails that Wilde goes on.Despite these facts, I am glad that I read the book once. It held my attention enough and was brilliant enough that I did learn something from the book, which is a great accomplishment in itself, to teach a reader a few principals that may slightly help or change on any small level, the readers actions. So I do recommend this book if you have no more pressing serious books on your reading list.On a side note, I do disagree with all the reviews I have seen on this book where the reader says that they can not relate to Dorian Gray's sins and that his sins are outdated. His chief sins in the book are (SMALL SPOILER ALERT) murder, drug use, pride, treating others harshly and without respect, using women in many ways, etc. are all sins practiced today even if they are not practiced exactly the way they are in the book. If you can relate to none of those sins in any way, then you are a better person than I, or suffer from foolish pride which is the chief sin in the book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"I'm being made to read this book for the third time (once in high school, twice in college), but I've always rather detested it. I've been told I need to \\"appreciate\\" it, and to that effect I've been reading a number of reviews (both positive and negative) of this book, trying to get a grip on *why* it's so highly regarded. The basic story is this: Dorian (a pretty twentysomething without much personality) makes a tacit (implied, not stated) bargain with a painter: his portrait will grow old and sick while he remains young and beautiful, no matter what he does to himself. And he does *plenty* to himself. 230 pages later, he grows a conscience and tries to destroy the painting, bringing age/sickness on himself and thus dying, unpunished for his \\"sins.\\" The Faust parallels are evident; unfortunately Dorian Gray is no Faust, and lord Henry (his \\"corrupter\\") is no Mephistopheles. The book is told as a series of banal witticisms and jests which sound good the first time you read them but get chewed up and spat out the second they're exposed to intelligent analysis. (Example from the preface: \\"All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the surface do so at their peril. Those who read the symbol do so at their peril. It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors. Diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new, complex and vital. When critics disagree the artist is in accord with himself. We can forgive a man for making a useful thing as long as he does not admire it. The only excuse for making a useless thing is that one admires it intensely. All art is quite useless.\\")Synthesizing all the reviews, I get the sense that people who *really* like it--the \\"witty\\" verbiage, the Faust-lite storyline, and the moral heavy-handedness--like it because it shields them from the knowledge of their own inner emptiness. That sounds harsh; let me explain further. Since everything is stylized, pre-determined, and \\"fake,\\" there's no danger of self-discovery--no danger of discovering anything true. Oscar Wilde was deeply alienated against his own self (most homosexuals living at that time and in that society were), and so is not capable of feeling honestly, or expressing himself with any sincerity. Human nature (in the wider, not baser, sense) is \\"reduced\\"--that's the only word I can think of to describe it. Words are everything; appearances; everything. But words are empty sounds without the meanings attached to them (anyone who knows more than one language knows *that*), and appearances are superficial and deceiving, to trot out that old cliche. Human beings do not exist merely to think up verbal ripostes to personal attacks, and yet, here, this is all they do. Well, that and \\"sin.\\" But what a \\"sin\\" is is never really defined, and Dorian Gray doesn't really \\"sin\\" much (he seduces a girl, dumps her, and there's some implied homosexuality---*yawn*).\\"Dorian\\" is a morality tale, like the story of Jesus. It is something to tell children with no imagination, to warn them of the dangers of societal rejection--the dangers of being \\"different.\\" In a subtle way, it encourages conformity--and it *definitely* encourages repression. It is false to me in so many ways that I can hardly stomach it."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"nicely bound, beautifully embossed, priced especially well considering the binding and compared to other retailers such as Anthropologie; contains a sewn in ribbon bookmark which I love.

When reading about such characters such as Lord Henry for instance, you can only admit that you are being worked by the words and charms of a great novelist. It is sad that this is the only full novel Oscar Wilde ever did.(he did do a fair amount of plays, short stories, and essays however). After reading it, you will find yourself quoting it for a good while. And the plot device used is one of the better one's in all of fiction. I must say I plan on re-reading this one, the language, the wit, and the overall story that Wilde creates is very alluring and worthy of all the praise you might hear about it.Pick it up, read it, love it, and then recommend it to all of your friends."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"After a few months of cajoling, my parents finally convinced me to read \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" by Oscar Wilde. Actually, part of what motivated me was not my parents' persistant pestering (and occasionally threatening), but the fact that Oscar Wilde is the favorite author of the lead singer from my favorite out-of-date band, The Smiths (Morrissey, yes).But anyway, to the book. When I started to read, I was in some kind of rapturous awe of Wilde's writing. It was so utterly beautiful, shaped and molded as finely as the face of the man Wilde so eloquently describes, Mr. Dorian Gray himself. It has the operatic and tragic occurence of an opera, or at least a play, but had The Picture of Dorain Gray been written as a play, it would have shirked the story of the wonderous use of the English language that so holds this novel up.Admittedly, it was a bit thick to wade through at times, but other than that, it's a ripping good ride, and I recommend it to anyone who wants to know more about the evils and attraction of physical beauty."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)","review":"The description of the condition of the book was spot on, I would even go as far as to say that it might have been overstated. the book was in great shape, basically new except for some highlighting, but seeing as im in college notes are very helpfull.

It centers on a young dandy who is rather shallow and self-absorbed.

This wish is granted and the story follows the events that unfold up to Dorian's realization that he has received everything he \\"wanted\\" and is now miserable. Two main acquaintances Basil and Lord Henry abound. Basil in some ways is a God figure in that he represents the good path and encourages Dorian to better himself and be an upright person. Lord Henry on the other hand is more of a Beelzebub. He encourages Dorian to debase himself, follow his whims and not concern himself with the wreckage he leaves in his wake.

I strongly recommend it as a well written account by a man's man who led very adventurous life.

If the thought of fishing the Nile, hunting lion in the Sudan and tigers and pigsticking (hunting wild boar on horse-back) in India makes your heart beat faster, this is the book for you. Likewise, if this turns you off, it is obviously not. Hook is not one to lay his private life on the line, so we learn little of such matters as his marriage and subsequent divorce, but he is a most perceptive observer and an accomplished raconteur and we learn a good deal about the people and animals of the countries he serves in. Hook tells us of his experiences in the hunt and on the field of battle in a simple, direct manner, not without a touch of humour. Refreshingly, as one would expect from an officer and gentleman of his time, there is no gratuitious sex, violence or obscene language, though I have no doubt he was exposed to a great deal of the above.

The goal of this exploration was to redefine caring, to create new ways to teach preventive health care and nurturance, and to sensitively encourage caregivers to own their responsibility to intellectualize and write from their unique vantage point as observers of pain. Numerous and various clinical scenarios were available through the creative writing in BETWEEN THE HEARTBEATS and provided an opportunity to look at clinical situations with a refreshing perspective. My co-editor, Cortney Davis, and I have conducted many workshops but this was my first opportunity to use the book as a text for a three credit course.

Many nurses, after reading this collection, have contacted me to say how these poems and stories reflect what they think and feel as they themselves are working with patients: the joys and moments of transcendance as well as the fears and frustrations. Nurses from all walks of healhcare--among them ICU nurses, homecare nurses, Hospice Nurses, OB/GYN nurses, Nursing Home nurses, office nurses--find words here that mirror what they feel during those amazing moments, the ones between the heartbeats, when they are standing by a patient's side. Death and dying are part of a nurse's day, just as surely as birth, healing, and grace are. These works speak of all aspects of caregiving, from the nurse's unique vantage point. Now in it's fourth printing, Between the Heartbeats is being translated into Japanese and a second, all-new volume is currently being assembled, a companion piece to the original volume offered here. As Frances Biley said in her review of Heartbeats in Nursing Times (3/20/96) &quot;This book is essential. I dare you to read 'NICU' by Dana Schuster and not be moved. Beg, steal or borrow this book; if that fails, buy it.&quot;"},{"Title":"Between the Heartbeats: Poetry and Prose by Nurses","review":"A meta-review -- 3 positive reviews by the work's editors and one negative review by a reader?

Some of the poetry is morbid. And we wonder why there are nursing shortages?"},{"Title":"Hulk/Wolverine: 6 Hours (Hulk Legends, Vol. 1)","review":"Traditionally, the issues Marvel collects under it's Marvel: Legends banner are stiring, beautiful examples of the series they represent. The only thing Hulk/Wolverine is an example of is mediocrity and what NOT to do with a mini-series.Reprinting Hulk/Wolverine Six Hours #1-4, this graphic's script is as weak and anemic as Banner at his Ultimates' worst. With yet another boring somehow-this-hero-runs-into-another and supervillians follow plot, it was almost painful to read. Add to that the villain is named \`Shredder' and though we've never seen him before or since, we're supposed to buy him as a credible threat to Wolverine. Yawn, but one look at the guy and you know Wolverine will tear him apart in seconds. Also, ignore the fact that there's more plot holes in this than all the multiple universe X-Men continuity combined. Without mentioning who, someone in here receives a blood transfusion from Bruce Banner. The last time this happened, the She-Hulk was created, yet there's no mention of that or any ill effects mentioned. Continuity headache anyone?The art is interesting in its own right and style for the most part, but again, it isn't breathtaking, or worth the price of admission.The covers by Simon Bisley are reprinted in this volume and are quite marvelous as is most of Bisley's work, marking one bright point in the volume.Also, Hulk #181 is reprinted, but it's included in other, more interesting volumes.Overall, skip this and read Frank Miller and Chris Claremont's Wolverine graphic, ISBN 087135277X, if you're looking for a good Wolverine story, or Hulk: Gray by Loeb and Sale, ISBN 0785113460 for a well done Hulk story."},{"Title":"Hulk/Wolverine: 6 Hours (Hulk Legends, Vol. 1)","review":"You bring two characters with such a colorful history and pit them together, you get a good, solid work of comic book art and story. The first time Wolverine appeared was in a Hulk comic some 35 years ago. Though the characters have met one another from time to time recently, nothing can make things click if you don't have a good writer and artist.Bruce Jones is the regular author on the monthly Hulk comic. He has transformed old Jade Jaws from a superhero into a dark, gritty and very human character. Hulk doesn't fight many costumed villains. He fights the rage in himself and the monster that can break loose at any given minute. Having a literary background in fiction prose, Jones feels right at home in creating horrific real, dilemma for his characters. You feel the Bruce Banner is really the same character played by Bill Bixby in the old HULK TV series. The lone man trying to hide from his pursuers. The main difference is that Jones doesn't want Banner to find a cure for his HULK transformation. He makes relish it and like it in sordid way. Very much like the upcoming summer blockbuster.Adding Wolverine in the mix, is just like adding fireworks. Logan is a loose cannon. He's highly combustible and ready to blow up on anyone. One thing works for him, he really really makes it happen with the HULK.The story brings the characters together in a realistic way and pits them against each other, then together and then against each other and then together again. You know how it is when you have two powerful characters, the adrenaline just starts rushing. Both Banner and Logan try to help a little kid that is on the verge of dying from a snake poison. Throw in the mix, a couple of drig dealers, a whacko called the Shredder, a sexy plane pilot and you have a jolly good time.No one really cuts loose in this comic. The major treat, however, is seeing a reprint of the first appearance of Wolverine in HULK 181. That's what the makes the whole comic worth reading. Reference to 6 hours is also a smart way of coonecting the present graphic novel to the old reprint. In the end, HULK will always SMASH puny, hairy human with claws."},{"Title":"Hulk/Wolverine: 6 Hours (Hulk Legends, Vol. 1)","review":"The idea behind &quot;Hulk/Wolverine: 6 Hours&quot; is to take advantage of the summer movie schedule in 2003 which say the first Hulk and the second X-Men features hit the big screen. The main problem with this trade paperback, which collects the first four issues of &quot;Hulk/Wolverine&quot; written by Bruce Jones and illustrated by Scott Kilins, along with the first appearance of Wolverine reprinted from issue #181 of &quot;The Incredible Hulk,&quot; is pretty much signified by the cover. First, the cover, indeed the very title of the book suggests that you are going to see too of the baddest dudes in the Marvel Universe go after each other. It takes pretty much the entire story to get to the point where Bruce Banner turns green and Logan springs his claws and the two start tearing into each other. But the fight ends up being a minor aspect of the story, which has Banner and Logan lost in the Canadian wilderness with only six hours to rescue a woman and a sick boy from two desperate drug dealers after a plane crash. The idea is that these two old foes, with the two worst tempers in the Marvel pantheon, control themselves long enough to save the two innocents.The second problem indicated by the cover, which was done by Simon Bisley, is that it is a lot more interesting than what you will find inside. In fact, each of the original covers for the four issues are more interesting visually than what Kilins provides, which is okay and works fine for most of the narrative until the big fight, at which point it leaves a lot to be desired. But then you have the reprint of the first Wolverine story, which revives the age-old question, who was your least favorite Marvel artist: Don Heck or Herb Trimpe? For me the answer was always dependent on who was inking Trimpe, whose art always looked better inked by a Severin as opposed to Jack Abel as it was here.Consequently, the big irony here is that this is really a Bruce Banner/Logan story, not only because those two are who we are watching for most of &quot;Six Hours&quot; but also because the interchanges between the two are the most interesting part of the story. The strength of the story Jones is telling is in the characters rather than the action, and the plot is just an excuse for these two to do their own macho routines for as long as possible to put off the inevitable fisticuffs. This is a decent enough story until the big fight scene, at which point Kilins fails to go deep."},{"Title":"Hulk/Wolverine: 6 Hours (Hulk Legends, Vol. 1)","review":"Hulk/Wolverine: Six Hours, a four issue mini-series, finds the green goliath and the 'ol Canuck-le head becoming reluctant partners as they trek through the Canadian wilderness to rescue a sick, young boy from a pair of drug dealers. Those who expect a knock down drag out fight between the Hulk and Wolverine will be disappointed here. Written by monthly Hulk scribe Bruce Jones, Six Hours focuses more on Bruce Banner and Logan than their counterparts. In Jones' current run, he's made Banner the focal point instead of the Hulk, allowing a more human story to be told. He does the same thing here, offering plenty of great interaction before the two eventually do drop the gloves and tear into each other. The art by Scott Kilins is the book's only downside, Jones' regular Hulk partners Mike Deodato or Dougie Brathwaite would have been a much better selection. As a bonus, this TPB also includes the classic Incredible Hulk #181 which includes the first appearance of Wolverine and the first square off between the two Marvel icons."},{"Title":"Hulk/Wolverine: 6 Hours (Hulk Legends, Vol. 1)","review":"I love it when they team up The Hulk and Wolverine--they are two of my favorite characters. And they usually manage to keep it an interesting story, which they do here. They've got six hours to rescue a sick boy from drug dealers. I will say the artwork is real uneven. And as an added bonus, they've tacked on the issue of The Hulk where Wolverine makes his first appearance. Don't that just take you back."},{"Title":"Hulk/Wolverine: 6 Hours (Hulk Legends, Vol. 1)","review":"As I liked the run that Bruce Jones had done on the Hulk line previously, I had very high hopes that this would be a quality miniseries.My hopes were not even CLOSE to realized.The story starts out with dialogue that skips back and forth amongst the groups of people that the story revolves around - the technique of picking up whatever sentence/phrase used in the last scene for the new scene got old very quickly.And then it was all downhill from there.The events that occur to get all the characters together are implausible even for comic books, the interaction between Banner and Logan is flat, the secondary characters are pretty much just cardboard cutouts and the BBG... Man, I don't know who to lay my scorn more heavily upon, the writer (for the concept) or the artist (for the visualization). Just terrible.I can't believe I had to go to the trouble of getting this reserved through the library system, and I feel like I deserve the 50 cents I had to pay for that privelege back."},{"Title":"Hulk/Wolverine: 6 Hours (Hulk Legends, Vol. 1)","review":"Bruce Banner is on the run, and Wolverine is doing a bit of getting back to nature. Banner scams his way on a plane, and sits next to a boy. The boy is sick, because of a mixup involving his glasses, and two pet snakes, the poisonous one bit him because he couldn't tell which one it was.To further complicate things, two drug dealers are on the plane, looking to get rich. They make Banner mad, which makes him green.The mafia throw another factor in when they hire a superhuman clawed hitter in to look for the drug dealers, and Wolvie has tangled with him before.In the back is a reprint of the first appearance of Wolverine, fighting the Hulk, with a Wendigo around for fun. A nice bonus, that one."},{"Title":"The Ehrman Needlepoint Book","review":"would recommend this book for any needlepoint lover.

The Signet Classic edition contains a preface by Studs Terkel and a very informative introduction by Fred L. Gardaphe. Terkel notes that the book was first published in 1939, and compares it to John Steinbeck's \\"Grapes of Wrath.\\"\\"Christ\\" tells the story of an urban, working-class Italian-American family in the early part of the 20th century. Much of the book is focused on Paul, a young man who finds work as a bricklayer.di Donato writes with a vivid style; he attains a muscular poetry of blood and concrete as he describes the workers' \\"symphony of struggle.\\" He brings to life both the specifics of Italian-American life as well as the larger multicultural world in which Paul's family lives. The book deals with Italian-American folk beliefs, tenement living, bilingualism, and a young man's sexual awakening. di Donato also writes on the theme of the common person's struggle against uncaring officialdom. He also explores the question of faith in the face of suffering.There are many vivid scenes and characters in this novel. One account of an Italian-American feast is particularly memorable. There are also some really graphic, horrifying descriptions of workplace death and injury. I believe that this powerful novel belongs on the shelf with all those great books that sympathetically look at the oppressed and the overworked in the United States. And for another author who has written eloquently on the Italian-American experience, I recommend the fiction of John Fante."},{"Title":"Christ in Concrete","review":"You have seen those photos from the thirties- construction workers sitting on a girder hundreds of feet above Manhatten, lunch pail next to them, seemingly unaware that their legs are dangling over an abyss. Christ in Concrete is about those workers and that abyss.This is one of the strangest, most original books I have ever read, a lost classic of American modernism. I cannot think of an author to compare Di Donato to- the mundane and fobidding ironies of Celine come to mind, but so do the mythic qualities of Brecht. It is sort of a reverse image of The Fountainhead- here are brilliant and passionate people literally being crushed by architechture.Di Donato's style is loud, blunt and operatic. He rushes through cinematic images and superdramatic tragedies, almost as though he fears he is going to bore you. The events are fairly autobiographical. It's rather like meeting a charming but slightly frightening stranger who tells you thier life story: you are entranced and sympatheic, but fully unnerved."},{"Title":"Christ in Concrete","review":"This tale of the Italian-American experience told through the voice of a young man whose father is killed in a bizarre construction accident is overwhelming.It is perhaps the most overlooked American classic."},{"Title":"Christ in Concrete","review":"This is the finest book I have ever read about Immigrants. As an Italian American it is especially rewarding. If made into a real film (not like the cheesy 1949 version)it could be a masterpiece -- it could be to Scorsese what Schindler's list is to Spielberg.One note -- wait to read Fred Gardaphe's introduction until after you read the novel as he gives away a lot of the story."},{"Title":"Christ in Concrete","review":"Discovering that America's streets were not paved with gold is a hard reality found in nearly every immigrant story. That America was a cheat designed to exploit and destroy is a more unique construct, one which forms the thesis of this 1939 novel.\\"Christ In Concrete\\" begins with its most memorable section, one which casts a pall over all that follows. In it, we see a man named Geremio work on a New York construction site, circa 1924. It's an unstable structure, but the cruel, drunken bossman keeps Geremio and the other Italian immigrants working under threat of dismissal. Inevitably, the structure falls, and Geremio dies horribly in a descriptive passage where author Pietro di Donato gives you all the awful details. After that, the rest of the novel follows Geremio's young son Paul, who is forced to pick up his father's trowel to feed his large and poor family.The dissatisfaction with capitalism is presented early, in the form of the nasty bossman Mr. Murdin and some words here and there (\\"The full gut sees not the hungry face,\\" one woman observes sadly). The message of savage capitalist exploitation is not ever-present, but it does undergird the narrative.\\"Christ In Concrete\\" is even bolder as a critique on the emptiness di Donato perceived in religious faith, akin to Marx's \\"opium of the people.\\" We see it early on, in the pain-wracked unheard cries to God from the dying Geremio, and even more definitively at the end, where di Donato pushes the point with savage force. In the middle, except for a scene with a spiritual medium which actually provides some welcome laughs in an otherwise dead-serious book, the atheism at the heart of \\"Christ In Concrete\\" is very much a background element, too. In fact, di Donato seems to find value in Catholicism's ability to hearten, though not materially help, otherwise hopeless people.For me, \\"Christ In Concrete\\" was less interesting as a social or philosophical document. Its true strength, albeit a relative one, is in the presentation of the everyday lives of Paul and his family after Geremio's death. Di Donato powerfully describes such things as a tenement where residents breathe in each other's stink and find pleasure in wine and gossip. A wedding feast is described so palpably you feel yourself counting calories as you read, and a birth scene is almost as gory as Geremio's death. Di Donato was not a polished writer, but he was an enthusiastic one, with a reverence for the tiniest detail that somehow doesn't bog down the energetic narrative.\\"It seemed so daring to lay brick at the edge of a wall that ran down hundreds and hundreds of feet to a toy world below, a wall that leaned and seemed about to fall away,\\" di Donato writes about one of Paul's worksites. At times, di Donato's descriptions take a Beat-like quality, of grammatically untethered wordflows: \\"High severe chambers through tall heavy doors stout walls warmth quiet thick everlasting wood trim smooth crackless plaster lacquered floors...\\" begins the description of a rectory Paul visits for aid, in vain.While vividly rendered, the story of \\"Christ In Concrete\\" feels much like what it was, a focused short story followed by a long, episodic narrative tacked on later, with a finale that pushes the book's tragic message to an uncomfortably high pitch. The characters are not that interesting, and tend to bewail their fate at greater-than-necessary length: \\"Unfair! Unfair!-Our lives-Unfair!\\"On the positive side, \\"Christ In Concrete\\" captures both the brutality and beauty of the immigrant experience as fed through a Marxist prism. It's not a fun read, but you will remember it."},{"Title":"Christ in Concrete","review":"Ah, how to adequately describe this vividly written, tragic, humorous, sometimes-horribly-graphic, deeply poetic novel that depicts a true-life story! Perhaps my adjectives may seem to have done that already, but they hardly scratch the surface! I have never experienced anything exactly like it, and except for a little later, when I read its sequel, Three Circles of Light, I don't believe I ever will again! Although written as a made-up story, it is actually a form of memoir written about the author's father, a bricklayer in the early 19th century who, because of the dangerous and corrupt working conditions he and his co-workers are forced to endure, dies a terrible death, entombed in concrete on, of all days, Good Friday. Although the death-scenes of he and others are truly uncomfortable and unforgettable reading, this book is far from unremittingly depressing! It colorfully, humorous, sometimes ribaldly, evokes the lives of Italian immigrants in the New York City area; their loves, loyalties, laughter, traditions...the characters, so real, so hilariously, heartbreakingly human, become like your own family members as you read. It also shows how little things really do change as far as the plight of laborers is concerned. The closest thing I can think of to this book is Upton Sinclair's The Jungle, but this novel, I think, has more life, more heart to it. An absorbing read, highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Christ in Concrete","review":"While from a literary perspective, this is no masterpiece, it nonetheless captures a unique portrait of early twentieth-century Italian immigrant life. My great-grandfather, Nicolo, worked with tile in Philadelphia around the same time of the setting in this book. Many of the stories I've heard growing up make more sense now having read di Donato's novel.The writing is stilted at times (di Donato's attempt to make the English sound Italian), and he allows his characters to go on angst-ridden rants for far too long. But there are numerous gems in this piece. I wholeheartedly recommend it -- to Italian-Americans to learn a little more about their heritage and to all others to catch a glimpse of early Italian immigrant life in America."},{"Title":"Christ in Concrete","review":"\\"Christ in Concrete\\" is both paean and prayer to the old immigrant Italian industrial worker.Like the laborers it depicts, \\"Concrete\\" lurches towards moments of joy without ever breaking through the unrelenting misery that is very much author Pietro di Donato's message.This is working class literature of the 1930s where the great unwashed are brought into finer relief, their desperate situations the fodder for heart-wrenching plot.In vogue during its Depression heyday, this kind of literature, even done as well as it is here, faced structural barriers to mass acceptance later. The disadvantaged are always the disadvantaged and their most uplifting stories still register as grim.In \\"Concrete,\\" the tenement dwellers of New York's lower East Side are not necessarily unhappy. Di Donato portrays them as stout of heart, quick to aid their fellows, and adept at grabbing a rare laugh when presented with the chance.But they are maimed or ground to dust and the novel's pessimistic conclusion is that the game is rigged against them poor WOPS. And it is. They are \\"Christ in Concrete,\\" dependent on work that literally kills them.There is not a lot of workerist rhetoric to this book. It is less Marx, more Biblical justice and Christian plea. Merely an adept portrayal of the construction worker's life in the great Gotham of skyscrapers and cold bitter bluster.Stories of work itself.Di Donato, a bricklayer by trade, mined prosaic music from the mundane task:\\"He reached the trowel down into the mortar. Slice down toward him, edgewise twist in quick short circle and scoop up away from him. The trowel came up half-covered with mortar - but how heavy! He dropped it back into the tub and worked the trowel back and forth in the mortar just as he had seen the bricklayers do. The feel of flexible steel trowel in pliant warm plush soon-to-be-stone. The wet rub of mortar on tender skin, the fleshy sense of Job.\\"He explained its soul-deadening effects:\\"These men were the hardness that bruise Paul many times. They were the bodies to whom he would joined in bondage to Job. Job would be a brick labyrinth that would suck him in deeper and deeper, and there would be no going back. Life would never be a dear music, a festival, a gift of Nature. Life would be the torque of Wall's battle that distorted straight limbs beneath weight in heat and rain and cold.\\"This is turn-of-the-20th century immigrant milieu. It is life in the tenement, its Italians, Swedes, Jews, and blacks heaped upon one another with their only commonality a severe lack of resources.\\"Christ in Concrete\\" provides a global view that concentrates as much on the women and children at home as it does the men at the construction site.In \\"Living the Revolution,\\" an academic study on radical Italian women of the very same New York \\"Concrete\\" mixes, Jennifer Guglielmo notes that southern Italian women responded to patriarchal dominance in society by \\"crafting their own cultural expression,\\" including magic, sorcery, divination, or dancing the \\"tarantella.\\"These pre-feminist strategies are dramatized in storytelling by di Donato through the tarantella-dancing Annunziata, or when she and Paul visit \\"The Cripple,\\" a tenement-bound medium to the netherworld.Di Donato wrote the heck out of this story. The translation is a kind of direct transposing of the words as ordered in Italian which successfully marks the book with a distinctive prose style.Di Donato committed one falsity in wrapping up his heartfelt condemnation of capital exploitation:\\"No poet would be there to intone meter of soul's sentence to stone, no artist upon scaffold to paint the vinegary sweat of Christian in correspondence with red brick and gray mortar, no composer attuned to the screaming movement of Job and voiceless cry in overalls.\\"Not true, for with each additional word he wrote, Di Donato did a little more to erase the verity of that sentence."},{"Title":"Christ in Concrete","review":"In terms of shipping and the product itself I received it in an extremely timely manner and it was in perfect condition.

I found the Signet edition in a used bookstore, and being Catholic, the title caught my eye immediately. I love that it was actually written during the Depression, in 1939 and is compared to Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath. Their stories are very similar. Paul's character is so vividly drawn. Knowing what happened to Di Donato's father, it seems obvious that Paul is auto-biographical. Side note: if you want to watch a movie that appears to be heavily influenced by Christ in Concrete, I highly recommend MAC by John Turturro, from I think 1990 or 1991. His father was in the construction business and after reading the book, I recalled a couple of images that I remember seeing in the movie. If Mr. Turturro was asked today, I'm sure he would credit Christ in Concrete as being a big influence on that film (which he directed). Anyway, Christ in Concrete is a wonderful book which I think any first or second generation American should read."},{"Title":"Christ in Concrete","review":"VERY GOOD BOOK, JUST DIDNT LIKE THE ACTUAL WORDING OF THE BOOK ITSELF WAS A LITTLE WEIRD FOR ITS TYPE OF PLOT, ANY WAYS VERY GOOD BOOK ABOUT THE TIMES."},{"Title":"Guns and Roses: The Untold Story of Dean O'Banion, Chicago's Big Shot before Al Capone","review":"Guns And Roses is the riveting true story of ruthless, colorful, and reigning gangster Dean O'Banion, known as \\"Chicago's Arch Killer\\" and the \\"Boss of the 42nd and 43rd Wards\\" before Al Capone seized the dubious title of underworld kingpin.

Many crime writers and researchers will reap the benefit of her investigations into the Irishman who played an integral role in the development of Pre-Capone/Torrio Chicago. The simple fact that our protagonist's name was never &quot;Dion,&quot; as he'd been called for decades, is proof-positive that the pre-existing information on O'Banion needed scrutiny and clarification. Rose Keefe has provided both, writing within an eloquent narrative that keeps the reader turning the pages.I highly recommend this book for it's tighly-woven history. Did you know that O'Banion was an Irish Tenor, and once worked as a singing waitor? As a gangland figure, O'Banion was a walking contradiction. The reproductions of the gangster's childhood letters to his dying mother present a surprising contrast to the persona he developed in Chicago, when he ruled with brutality and murder.The inequities of O'Banion's personality continue to baffle historians. Rose Keefe has set the record straight on many of the facts that have, until now, remained ambiguous."},{"Title":"Guns and Roses: The Untold Story of Dean O'Banion, Chicago's Big Shot before Al Capone","review":"This is about the people who nearly beat the Capone Mob for control of the Chicago boot-legging business.

The wild Northside Gang is today best remembered for being the victims in the St Valentine's Massacre but in the twenties they were household names.

The book focuses on the rivalry between the Northside Chicago mob and the Southside Torrio-Capone mob.Obanion and his cohorts are literally devoured by the inter-city \\"big time\\" mobs with connections to New York city.From reading this book I don't believe Obanion knew what he was up against,he was a small town boy who moved to the city of Chicago, yet he tried to run his crime empire like a small business. Cavorting around a flower shop by day,shaking hands,(without an enemy in the world?),with little to no protection,meanwhile engaging in criminal activity that would include murder.That's just asking for it,and Torrio's mob,later inherited by Capone,was only too happy to oblige. It seems Torrio's mob when they arrived in Chicago was already an experienced hard core criminal transplant from NYC and cites thereof.How could Obanion honestly think that when the control of rackets,gambling,bottlegging,and the millions of dollars at stake, there was a \\"moral\\" line that shouldn't be crossed?Especially when dealing with the mob and seeing as the mob eliminated its own so what could a rival gang expect.Capone listed his profession as furniture dealer but I doubt you would see him lifting furniture into trucks.His furniture business was a fort.The short baby faced Obanion never had a chance in dealing with the NYC mob. this book really brought this out as I read it.An excellent work on crime history but it sort of makes Obanion look like a \\"farmer\\"."},{"Title":"Guns and Roses: The Untold Story of Dean O'Banion, Chicago's Big Shot before Al Capone","review":"i,ve read numerous books regarding gangsters,along with the luciano testament, this is the best,from a young age to irish mob boss of chicago,s north side very detailed and superbly written,worth a read"},{"Title":"Guns and Roses: The Untold Story of Dean O'Banion, Chicago's Big Shot before Al Capone","review":"As in her biography of \\"Bugs\\" Moran, Rose Keefe keeps her account of Dean O'Banion moving with colorful details, but she doesn't question her sources when using snatches of dialogue. Keefe heavily researched the gangsters but, not being a Chicagoan, doesn't put the events in any context. O'Banion never comes alive, and his period as a \\"safeblower\\" is glossed over in favor of the traditional concentration on bootlegging. Still, this is an entertaining and useful book."},{"Title":"Guns and Roses: The Untold Story of Dean O'Banion, Chicago's Big Shot before Al Capone","review":"Al Capone and Johnny Torrio hated and feared Dean O'Banion so much they chose to kill him, knowing the consequences would be dire. His friends loved him so much that they pursued a fierce war against his killers, even to their own deaths. What kind of man could inspire such intense and opposite emotions in the people who knew him?American History would not be the same without Dean O'Banion.It was O'Banion's death that led to Johnny Torrio's retirement and Al Capone's rise in power. It was the vendetta carried on by O'Banion's friends that made Capone's reign so bloody. It was the escalating violence of that vendetta that led to the Valentine's Day Massacre which so disgusted the American public that prohibition was repealed.The author explores all the complexity of character that makes Dean O'Banion one of the most unique characters in American History.

She captures the essence of a man that visually could have walked off the page and her knack of storytelling is top-notch. I was captivated in his devotion, not the brutality. Rose shares these images with the reader that really setup the framework of early Chicago. This isn't your run of the mill gangster book and the attention to accurate detail is deliberate. The book is well thought out and presented in a way that kept me wanting to read more, even furthering my education on prohibition and early Chicago in the process. This is a must read for true gangster enthusiasts and historians alike!"},{"Title":"Guns and Roses: The Untold Story of Dean O'Banion, Chicago's Big Shot before Al Capone","review":"This is a must have book for anyone interested in Chicago's beer wars.

As with all of Rose Keefe's books this one is a five and a half out of five stars book."},{"Title":"Guns and Roses: The Untold Story of Dean O'Banion, Chicago's Big Shot before Al Capone","review":"I have one problem with this book, and I'm willing to concede it may not even be a valid one. The author did an admirable job researching her subject, and anything one could possibly want to know about Dean O'Banion is contained in these pages. However, since O'Banion was assassinated at such an early stage in the battle for control of Chicago's beer trade (1924) and the war didn't effectively end until the remnants of the North Side Gang were decimated in one swoop during the bloody St. Valentine's Day Massacre of 1929, I felt that much of this book's contents were a rehash of the rivalry between the Capone forces and O'Banion's successors. Again, not to take anything away from Ms. Keefe's great writing or the biographical information itself. It is simply my opinion."},{"Title":"Guns and Roses: The Untold Story of Dean O'Banion, Chicago's Big Shot before Al Capone","review":"Chances are if you're reading the reviews for this book then you've read at least one Capone biography and walked away, like me, thinking, \\"Great story, wish I knew more about the Northsiders.\\" Well Rose Keefe has heard our collective wail and has provided us with one of the best books on both Chicago gangland and one of its most interesting characters. There is much more to the O'Banion/Northside story than just being fodder for Capone's gunmen. If you're into Chicago's gangland past then this volume is a must."},{"Title":"Guns and Roses: The Untold Story of Dean O'Banion, Chicago's Big Shot before Al Capone","review":"Even though I have read numerous other books on Chicago's infamous past during the prohibition years I found Rose Keefe's effort entitled Guns and Roses to be another fascinating read which is primarily devoted to Al Capone's North Side rivals. O'Banion's loss of his mother at an early age and subsequent move to a seedy section of Chicago contributed to Dean's alliance with the city's criminal element. The warring parties were driven by greed in invading each other's assigned territory during the beer wars. After the assassination of O'Banion in his florist shop in 1924 a number of his friends (Weiss, Drucci, and Moran) all had short terms heading the North Side mob. Weiss and Drucci being shot and Moran having his gang virtually wiped out at the St. Valentine's Day Massacre on February 14, 1929. If you have read other books on this subject you can prepare yourself to enjoy yet another offering on the subject with this book. In addition, this book has photographs I have not seen in other books. I'm sure you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Guns and Roses: The Untold Story of Dean O'Banion, Chicago's Big Shot before Al Capone","review":"At long last! Finally! Bravo! This is what all biographies of underworld figures should be, and almost never are. Indeed, it's what all biographies should be. It will be the benchmark against which all subsequent books about organized crime figures are to be judged. Reading this book, I was in awe of Ms. Keefe's ability to journey back through the mists of time, and hack her way through the hoary legends, and urban myths, the lies and distortions and half-truths that infest far too many books like this, and succeed in transforming O'Banion from the merry, bloodthirsty stereotype he's been for so long into an actual flesh-and-blood human being. Thanks to the journalistic alchemy of Ms. Keefe, O'Banion comes alive in these pages in a way that he never has in any of the other books I've read on this topic. I'm astonished at the amount of new, illuminating information she's been able to unearth in her research. Am I gushing? I guess it's just that I've read so many flawed, poorly-researched underworld fantasies that masquerade as history or biography that coming across Ms. Keefe's work reminds me of why I started reading books like this in the first place. Her writing is as vibrant and exciting as the era she writes about. I'm currently reading her biography of Bugs Moran and can't wait for the next one. I hope she continues researching and writing for a long, long time to come...To sum it up, Ms. Keefe's books are an historical goldmine, and a thrilling read to boot. Buy 'em."},{"Title":"Guns and Roses: The Untold Story of Dean O'Banion, Chicago's Big Shot before Al Capone","review":"For too long the North Siders have been relegated to the shadow of Al Capone and Rose Keefe has now come forth to rectify this situation with a wonderful biography of Chicago's first celebrity gangster, Dean (not Dion) Charles O'Banion, whose death touched off five years of bloodshed known as the Chicago \\"Beer Wars.\\" Her impeccable research, bolstered through interviews with elderly witnesses who actually knew O'Banion, uncovers both a complex and interesting man and one of the most colorful antiheroes of the '20's. The writing style is marvelous and this is both an impressive debut volume and a must for any crime library and this reviewer also looks anxiously forward to her followup work on George \\"Bugs\\" Moran."},{"Title":"Guns and Roses: The Untold Story of Dean O'Banion, Chicago's Big Shot before Al Capone","review":"This is the most comprehensive and thoroughly researched biography of Dean O'Banion and it has been justly recognized as definitive. Rose Keefe's greatest accomplishment is that her meticulous research has refuted dozens of journalistic half truths, embellishments and canards that have become commonly accepted as the truth simply because of constant repetition over eight decades. The actual Dean O'Banion is a far more complex and interesting character than his newspaper stereotype.Many sources have characterized the Prohibition battles between the Northside Gang and the Capone/Torrio mob as simply a territorial battle between the Irish and those damned Dagoes. Keefe correctly points out that the Northsiders were, in fact, an exceedingly diverse group comprised of Irish, Italian, German, Jewish and Polish hoodlums. The reality was more complicated than the widely accepted conventional wisdom.Although O'Banion could act in an utterly ruthless manner if circumstances warranted, more often than not he relied upon his quick wits. He possessed superior intelligence and had an engaging personality that inspired great loyalty from his comrades even long after his death.Despite his humble origins, O'Banion had the ability to put people from various walks of life at perfect ease and to form lasting friendships that allowed him to move easily in political and social circles despite his criminal background. O'Banion was a contradiction: he was a devoted son and husband. One could envision the industrious O'Banion succeeding in almost any field of endeavor that he tried. The loss of his beloved mother to tuberculosis and a childhood accident that left O'Banion partially crippled with a permanent limp were traumatic episodes, but rather than contenting himself to be sidelined by his handicap or to endure a life of economic hardship and privation, O'Banion chose not to be pushed around as he hit back hard with both fists in order to survive in the rough and tumble, dog eat dog environment that was Chicago in the early years of the past century.If you are living from hand to mouth, it always pays to be ambidextrous and O'Banion was, figuratively and literally: his custom tailored suits contained multiple pistol pockets which allowed O'Banion to draw concealed revolvers using either his right or left hand or both hands simultaneously. The same hands that O'Banion could and did use to fire pistols, crack safes, stuff ballot boxes or slug out rival newspaper hawkers would also cut flowers into lovely arrangements for weddings and funerals. As a bootlegger, O'Banion prided himself on selling quality products as opposed to the rot gut handled by his rivals.Keefe relates the many occasions on which O'Banion performed acts of charity. Some of these kindly acts were calculated, however, since O'Banion was also interested in reaping votes come election time. By performing good deeds, he could call in favors when ballots were being cast by his neighbors. Unlike Al Capone who coupled brutality and with openly lewd and lecherous behavior (Scarface allegedly gained his trademark after making crude remarks about a woman's shapely posterior in the presence of her protective and knife wielding older brother), O'Banion was noted for behaving in a courteous and oftentimes chivalrous manner.Keefe's writing is factual and entertaining. The O'Banion who she describes in such great depth proves to be such a charming and larger than life personality that it is entirely possible to imagine his immortal soul awaiting forgiveness and redemption in Purgatory. I was reminded of the Warner Brothers crime melodrama \\"Angels with Dirty Faces\\" in which a priest played by Pat O'Brien called upon a group of juvenile delinquents to \\"pray for a boy that who couldn't run as fast as I could\\" after his childhood friend who failed to escape the corrupting influence of the mean streets died at an early age as a result of embarking upon a criminal career. If this sounds like a mere Hollywood screenwriting cliche, consider the fact that a Roman Catholic priest was disciplined and transferred for leading graveside prayers for Dean O'Banion despite orders from the Cardinal to deny Christian burial rites to known gangsters.The only serious fault that I found with \\"Guns and Roses\\" is that the book lacks proper footnotes. There is a bibliography, but Keefe ought to have provided footnote attributions to the excerpted materials that were previously published elsewhere. There are also some minor geographical, historical and typographical errors that Chicagoans may catch in the text, usually on minor details, but the book is otherwise solid. Despite these shortcomings, this book is nevertheless a significant addition to the true crime history of Chicago during the Prohibition Era."},{"Title":"Guns and Roses: The Untold Story of Dean O'Banion, Chicago's Big Shot before Al Capone","review":"Because of his paradoxical character and personal flamboyance, Dean O'Banion has long presented an easy target for Prohibition-era commentators in search of a standing foil for Al Capone. And most of those commentators have been content to repeat, and embellish, the superficial tabloid legends that have framed his image over the years. Never the subject of a searching and serious biography (until now), O'Banion has typically been portrayed as the kind of stereotypical gangster psychopath so beloved by Hollywood screenwriters. But no one who inspired the loyalty, respect and affection of so many of his contemporaries could have been as psychologically impaired as the man portrayed in the existing literature. Now, at long last, without excusing or minimizing the violence and thievery at which O'Banion excelled, Rose Keefe has written -- in a beautiful and crisp journalistic style -- a carefully researched biography that catalogs his life in its full context. And along the way she provides a host of insights into other gangster notables who, along with O'Banion, formed the legendary North Side Mob. \\"Guns and Roses\\" is an important and long overdue contribution to the body of literature that deals with that fascinating time. Serious students of the period and gangster buffs, alike, should give it a careful read - both for the information it provides and the sheer enjoyment of the read.MORourke"},{"Title":"Guns and Roses: The Untold Story of Dean O'Banion, Chicago's Big Shot before Al Capone","review":"I have so many gangster books, being a crime buff, that I didn't think I'd see anything new hit the light of day. I am so happy to have been proven wrong.Call me weird (others have), but every Al Capone bio that I read found me more interested in the North Siders, especially O'Banion. There wasn't much to be learned about any of them that had not already been in print for years. Rose Keefe's O'Banion bio contains interviews with people who actually knew him, and reading the book suddenly brought not only Dean but the other North Siders to colorful life. I learned for the first time about the fate of O'Banion's older brother, Hymie Weiss' serious illness, and Vincent Drucci's crazy sense of humor. I didn't just appreciate the book for all its new insights and tidbits of information: the lively writing style make it much more readable than books written in a scholarly vein (you know, the types that can create one-sentence paragraphs).This book has been long overdue."},{"Title":"Guns and Roses: The Untold Story of Dean O'Banion, Chicago's Big Shot before Al Capone","review":"I'm so glad to see some really well-researched books coming out these days about the legendary figures of organized crime. Dean (not Dion) O'Banion was one guy I never expected to see a full-blown biography on, yet here it is. Rose O'Keefe must have done a lot of digging to come up with all of this material, and virtually none of it can be found in any other book; certainly none that I've ever heard of. She scores well as a writer, too, telling O'Banion's story in a way that will keep you turning those pages, eager to see what's coming next. There's a lot of context here about the various gangs of 1910s-1920s Chicago, and O'Banion's place in that jungle, which is helpful. If I had to name one small criticism, I'd have to say that the author's tone betrays a tiny lack of objectivity about her subject. He just seems like a vicious thug to me, though a fascinating one, but the book empathizes more with O'Banion than with his victims.

The devices have become much more important than other areas of photosensitivity in fiber, for example second harmonic generation, and promise considerably more to technology. This rapid take up of devices is well described in the text.Raman Kashyap has put together a highly commendable text-book on the subject. It begins with a brief history and basics of fiber, then deals with the photosensitive mechanisms of the host materials. The various techniques of grating production are described in considerable detail and with more than adequate back referencing to the original papers. This is then followed by a comprehensive coverage of the theory related to Bragg gratings. Clearly the book is aimed at the graduate research student, industrial researcher and applications engineer, with sufficient material in one text to allow even the more inexperienced to understand the basics of operation. With an understanding of this the reader can design his own applications.Refinement of the gratings is covered in a chapter on apodization and applications are dealt with selectively in chapters on band pass filters, chirped devices and grating lasers and amplifiers. This very readable book is then rounded off in a final chapter dealing with the characterisation of Bragg gratings.I highly recommend this book. It is written by one of the pioneers of the field. It has a text- book feel but is easily read and can be lifted and opened at any chapter. Clearly the expert need not read through it sequentially. There is considerable back referencing to the many original papers and numerous diverse applications of all sorts of grating variations. I am sure any research group with even marginal interest in the subject will have this in their group library if not personal copies. Applications engineers will find it indispensable."},{"Title":"Fiber Bragg Gratings (Optics and Photonics)","review":"A review of this book can really only be given in comparison to the only other book on the subject at this time, \\"Fiber Bragg Gratings: Fundamentals and Applications in Telecommunications and Sensing,\\" by Othonos and Kalli.This book is rather thick on theory at the expense of the applications of Fiber Bragg Gratings (FBGs). Having said that, if you are after detailed theory, specifically for the \\"Apodization of Fiber Gratings\\" (chapter 5), \\"Fiber Grating Band-pass Filters\\" (chapter 6), or \\"Chirped Fiber Bragg Gratings\\" (chapter 7), this book will be of interest to you. As someone who was interested in a concise theory section, and details of applications to date, I should have just stuck with Othonos and Kalli's book. The only other application section in the book is chapter 8 \\"Fiber Grating Lasers and Amplifiers.\\" The FBG as a sensor is not mentioned any where in this book (chapter 3 has a very small section dedicated to the \\"tuning of the Bragg wavelength.\\" Hence, if you are working with FBG sensors, this book is not for you, again, Othonos and Kalli would be much better. Obviously chapter 6 includes some of the communications applications of FBGs but this is quite narrow in scope.Overall, the first four chapters (not including the introduction) do a good job at covering the theory of FBGs in a way that means you would not need to look up the references. However, the final four chapters leave me wanting more on applications (or wishing I had bought the book second hand for less, but that is a personal opinion of someone working on FBG sensors).So, I would have preferred to have just bought Othonos and Kalli. But this may be of use to some in the area.My final though is that Kashyap does appear to have written a book which feels more like a text book, were as Othonos and Kalli has the feel of an edited collection of some 700+ references. But as a reference book I personally prefer the second.Regards,"},{"Title":"Fiber Bragg Gratings (Optics and Photonics)","review":"Having read this book I feel that the author has over emphasised certain aspects, e.g. the theory at the expense of applications.

I had always been a relatively healthy eater and very active. I rode my bike almost every day and averaged about 250 miles a week. When I started putting weight on, I couldn't understand why. My reaction was to diet and I have been on every diet since then. Nutri-System, Jenny Craig, Weight Watchers, Bistro MD (this was by far the most disgusting food I have ever eaten), Atkins,.... Well, you get the idea. I also tried diet pills but never lasted very long on those. Also, the more weight I gained the less I felt like exercising. I figured what was the point. I gave up many activities that I actually really enjoyed because I felt fat. In all I gained about 20 pounds.After reading this book I now realized I did exactly opposite of what I should have done. I should have continued my healthy eating habits and kept up my fitness routine. I would have gained weight because that is what women's bodies do but I probably would have gained a lot less weight.I read this book in a day and I felt like a weight (no pun intended) had been lifted off of my shoulders. I have started working out again and eating normal foods in moderation. It is liberating! It is to early to know whether I will lose weight but my guess is I will. What I do know is I feel happier and more in control.Read this book - the earlier the better. Don't wait until you are 50 and have gained 20 pounds.

I'd never been really overweight as a teen and young woman but I was regularly going on and off diet and exercise plans trying to get down to an ideal weight. Nothing had really worked for me; either I was hungry and thinner or hungry and not thinner but I was sick of being hungry and sick of feeling as if I had to constantly police what I was able to eat. OFF got me off diets and on a reasonable eating/exercise plan; and I went from 5'4\\" and 126lbs. to 120lbs. without suffering for it. (Yes, I know that is not a dramatic difference but when you're a single girl in your 20s, it seems dramatic. And the big deal was that I was eating what I liked and feeling good about it.) It took several months of being on the OFF plan but it worked.Years went by and I got married and got busy and got less concerned with how much I weighed. But recently, I decided that 140+ lbs. was not a weight I was comfortable with and I went to my bookshelf and started rereading OFF. I'd been on the OFF plan again for about 2 months, and working out at least 4x a week, and after I dropped a few easy pounds the scale stopped budging. I'm 42 now and remembered that I'd seen Waterhouse's new book on Amazon; I ordered Outsmarting the Midlife Fat Cell about a week ago. In the past week, I began drinking soy milk and increasing my protein intake as Waterhouse advises, and I've already dropped a pound of fat, down to a total body weight of 135 lbs. (I have a scale that shows the percentage of muscle, water, and fat weight.) I don't know or care if I'll ever get back to 120lbs. but I'm confident that if I keep following the midlife OFF, especially the weight training component coupled with conscious eating of high protein/high nutrient foods, that I can get back to a body size/composition that feels more like me."},{"Title":"Outsmarting the Midlife Fat Cell: Winning Weight Control Strategies for Women Over 35 to Stay Fit Through Menopause","review":"Really good book.

The author is strongly against dieting (....even talks about how dieting backfires on you...), but instead tells you about what you can do to help keep your body healthy and more fit and, hopefully, minimize weight gain during this time of life. She is realistic, however, in explaining that success will be different for everyone.....she doesn't suggest a \\"miracle cure,\\" but the information she gives is very helpful. After reading, I realize that I need to do things very differently now to keep my body healthy and in shape as I go through menopause. Following the guidance of the book, I have adjusted my eating habits (...eating more small \\"meals\\" during the course of the day, instead of eating a few larger meals...) and made significant changes to my exercise program to help keep my metabolism going (...not just walking, but doing some other types of aerobic exercise...). Also, I am doing strength training for the first time ever, which I am enjoying very much (....also check out a book the author recommends on that subject called, \\"Strong Women Stay Young\\" by Miriam Nelson). Even after a short time, I am seeing positive results from all my efforts. The author's writing style is very \\"user-friendly\\" and easy to read. I also really enjoyed her positive attitude and the encouragement that I felt while reading the book. It has made me look at myself very differently as I move forward into this new phase of my life. I would highly recommend this book (....and have given it to many friends already...) to any woman who is struggling through the life-changing experience of menopause. It's fantastic!!"},{"Title":"Outsmarting the Midlife Fat Cell: Winning Weight Control Strategies for Women Over 35 to Stay Fit Through Menopause","review":"It gave me more understanding of what is going on with my fat cells.I highly recommend it for women 35 years old (as I am right now) or even younder. It would be too late to read this book when I am 50-55."},{"Title":"Outsmarting the Midlife Fat Cell: Winning Weight Control Strategies for Women Over 35 to Stay Fit Through Menopause","review":"Far too much of EVERY chapter devoted to repeating essentially \\"I know what you're going through\\", \\"You feel this, you've tried that\\" on and on and on. A single well-written glossy magazine article would cover more useful information than you get in this whole book. Find good medical and health sites online instead and save your money."},{"Title":"Outsmarting the Midlife Fat Cell: Winning Weight Control Strategies for Women Over 35 to Stay Fit Through Menopause","review":"I am a doctoral level medical professional, and I have to warn women - if you are serious about losing the extra weight at midlife, do not do what this book says. It's okay if you need some help with your self-acceptance at this moment, and it's good for understanding what has happened at midlife, and how your body changes. However, if you want something to motivate you and teach you a successful strategy to decrease the weight and keep it off, this is NOT the book ! Very disappointing on that measure. You don't learn to outsmart or win this way."},{"Title":"Outsmarting the Midlife Fat Cell: Winning Weight Control Strategies for Women Over 35 to Stay Fit Through Menopause","review":"That is the bottom line for this author. She spends way too much time telling us to \\"embrace\\" our new, thick waistlines, and too little time on any real information or help. Don't bother exercising. just give up and eat smaller amounts of whatever it is that made you fat in the first place, get 9 hours of sleep every night (good luck with that!) and eliminate all stress from your life. According to Waterhouse that's all you have to do, and then you'll ONLY gain 10 pounds during menopause instead of 20 or 30. Save your money and keep looking. The truth is out there."},{"Title":"Outsmarting the Midlife Fat Cell: Winning Weight Control Strategies for Women Over 35 to Stay Fit Through Menopause","review":"I read a lot. A whole lot, and it's not just limited to health and fitness books, either. However, the book that I recommend the most is this one, Outsmarting the Midlife Fat Cell by Debra Waterhouse. I have it on my wish list, but I've already taken it out of the library and read it four times, front to back. Why? Well, Dr. Waterhouse has written a clear, concise, sometimes humorous self help book that is actually HELPFUL! She explains what the changes are that a woman from around 35-55 might go through, why it is so easy to gain weight and so difficult to get it off, why we start gaining in our tummies, why all of the things we did in our twenties to lose suddenly don't work anymore, and why we need to make peace with these changes and respect what our bodies are trying to do for us. Her writing style is practical, upbeat, and motivating. Her recommendations for how to halt spare tire encroachment make sense and genuinely work. Her advice also provides the added benefit of halting osteoporosis, and maybe even reversing it. No gimmicks here. No magic bullets. But you also won't have to live on bean sprouts and tofu(unless you want to). The author gives you permission to weigh a few pounds above the recommended insurance charts, and the means to see that it looks good on you. I've read and recommended some other health and fitness books that are quite good, but none surpass this one. It needs to be on every woman's shelf. Period."},{"Title":"Outsmarting the Midlife Fat Cell: Winning Weight Control Strategies for Women Over 35 to Stay Fit Through Menopause","review":"I'm 45 and exercise regularly and was dieting yet continued to gain weight.

The book has a very positive approach to the menopause experience."},{"Title":"Outsmarting the Midlife Fat Cell: Winning Weight Control Strategies for Women Over 35 to Stay Fit Through Menopause","review":"I'm a fat acceptance advocate who hates diet books on principle. Someone suggested I read this book anyway, and I'm glad I did. It confirmed the conclusions I've come to on my own after many unhappy years of struggling with an illusory &quot;weight problem&quot;: diets make you fatter, skipping meals is bad for you, there are no &quot;bad foods,&quot; you should listen to your body and eat when you're hungry, and the only way to stay in shape is to exercise. Her theoretical explanations made a lot of sense, and her attitude was reassuring: this is the way a woman's body WORKS, and if you gain some weight or change shape in midlife it's not because you're &quot;doing something wrong.&quot; I don't agree with her completely: I think she's unnecessarily judgmental about &quot;emotional eating&quot; (if you're under stress and can't do anything else to alleviate it, is it better to overeat for a few weeks or to take up smoking?). Also, she seems to feel that the only way to build strength is to work out with free weights, but many other exercise programs can have the same effect -- even yoga, if you select the right asanas to practice. Still, in general, hers is the ONLY sensible approach to managing one's weight that I've ever read (any diet book that lists the National Association for Fat Acceptance as a &quot;support group&quot; is all right with me!), and I'd like to recommend that every woman (fat or thin) read it as she enters midlife."},{"Title":"Outsmarting the Midlife Fat Cell: Winning Weight Control Strategies for Women Over 35 to Stay Fit Through Menopause","review":"I went to bed one night relatively trim and able to fit in my clothes. I woke up the next day and I had a &quot;stomach!&quot; That's how it seemed at least and I didn't know why. I was aware that I had seen the same thing happen to many of my friends at about the same age and didn't know why. My eating habits hadn't changed; I never was an exercise buff...but why suddenly this mid-life bulge?I ran across this book quite by chance and the cover caught my eye. I wanted to know how to &quot;outsmart the mid-life fat cell&quot; and I was certain it existed. This book was better than the best novel. I couldn't put it down. It was so easy to ready and understand and supplied graphics to further explain the reasoning and science behind each explanation.I am well on my way to outsmarting the fat cell and it is easy. The book is really very sensible and not a fad diet. The authors credentials give the book the crediability it needs to be taken seriously and has dependable, seemingly accurate explanations.

It's filled with facts, based on reality, and is easy to read. The author uses analogies, stories and humor to educate the reader. I highly recommend this book to all women over 35 AND their mates. You'll be glad to know you AREN'T imagining things, it's NOT in your head, and you aren't alone! When you finish, you'll know what's happening to you, why, and how to live with it postively. I laughed, I cried, and I've already loaned my copy out."},{"Title":"Outsmarting the Midlife Fat Cell: Winning Weight Control Strategies for Women Over 35 to Stay Fit Through Menopause","review":"I had high hopes that this book would help me reverse the steady increase in my weight that has been occurring over the past several years in spite of my healthy diet and exercise program. Unfortunately the author didn't provide me with any new information. The message I got was accept the fact that you're going to put on weight with menopause.What did help me lose weight, as well as improve my sleep and alertness, was Barry Sears' Zone diet. Waterhouse laments that menopausal women can put on weight eating rice cakes. Sears explains why this happens. (Bottom line: don't eat rice cakes!) Waterhouse tells us that some women actually like their more rounded, apple-shaped figures. Sears explains why it is a look we should avoid.I enjoyed the humor, but if you're serious about losing weight, trying reading some of Barry Sears' books. I've been losing half a pound a week consistently, feel more mentally alert, and sleep better."},{"Title":"Outsmarting the Midlife Fat Cell: Winning Weight Control Strategies for Women Over 35 to Stay Fit Through Menopause","review":"In my own subconsciously arrogant way I used to believe that as long as I didn't overeat and exercised I would never gain excess weight. Well, this last year has been a very humbling experience. I am about to turn 40. ALMOST OVERNIGHT it seemed like everything was fitting more snugly than it used to, especially around my midsection (this was the one body part that never used to give me grief). I figured, cut back on my food a bit, and bump up the exercise. Still nothing... if anything I seemed to be getting bigger! I finally got on the dreaded scale and I had gained 10-15 lbs. in the last year. I'm now wearing 10s and 12s. Yikes!So I see this book in the bookstore and know that I have to buy it. This has been one of the best purchases I have made this year. It thoroughly explains WHY I am gaining this weight and why it is going to my midsecion rather than its former favorite areas, my rear end and thighs.It explains why dieting is the worst possible thing I could be doing. Why lunch should be my largest meal, and why 5-6 smaller meals make more sense than two or three, with starving sessions in-between.It explains why exercise is the most beneficial thing I can do right now, and how combining daily exercise (an hour of aerobic activity a day) with small meals is the most efficient way to fight our midlife fat cells. We should also do strength training 3X/week to keep our metabolism raised.But like anything else, we can't go overboard on exercising any more than we can go overboard on the dieting. During this time in our lives, our body is programmed to go into survival mode any time we deprive our body of food or we exercise too much. According to Debra, the more we have dieted in the past, the harder time we are going to have with weight gain during perimenopause/menopause. Apparently, women are going through the changes at a much earlier age than our older parents/grandparents because of this excess dieting. Their generation didn't diet as compulsively as ours does.The book mentions the paradox of pregnancy during perimenopause. Because more women are delaying their pregnancies until their 30s and beyond, many are dealing with weight gain from this, along with perimenopause, therefore dealing with doubly resistant fat cells.What I have the hardest time digesting, but I have to accept in order to keep my sanity during these next 10-15 years, is that my body is SUPPOSED to have this extra padding of fat in my midsection during perimenopause/menopause in order to protect my organs and promote longevity. Not an EXCESS of baggage in the middle, but more than we had when we were younger. Where we used to gain it more in the rear/thighs during our teens/20s for healthier childbearing, now this weight is going to our middle for a healthier menopause; thus, a longer life. No, I don't like it, but knowing that our body will be able to drop weight again more easily AFTER menopause provides a small comfort.I thought I was doing something wrong or something was wrong with me... but now I understand!STILL...What about these women in their 40s and 50s who are still thin as rails? How have they managed to avoid the bigger midsection? (these women are definitely in the minority) Have they all had a tummy tuck? Or are they better at hiding it? As helpful as this book is, I still have to wonder if there is still a secret that hasn't been discovered by most of us?"},{"Title":"Outsmarting the Midlife Fat Cell: Winning Weight Control Strategies for Women Over 35 to Stay Fit Through Menopause","review":"When I started reading this book I felt like the author was in my home. I had been working out and watching my weight more than ever before and at 41 wasn't losing a pound. I had the thyriod test done and talked to my doctor which didn't help. Three weeks after reading her book, I lost 3 pounds and it's slowly coming off. The information was helpful and empowering."},{"Title":"Outsmarting the Midlife Fat Cell: Winning Weight Control Strategies for Women Over 35 to Stay Fit Through Menopause","review":"I recommend this book so highly that I am taking the time to sit down and write a review--something I usually do not do! I have just recently had a doctor agree with me that I am going into the perimenopausal years (in my late thirties). Debra Waterhouse explains that it really is true that more and more women are entering this time of their life already in their thirties--something that I've had a difficult time getting people I know to believe!I feel that all women in the perimenopausal and menopausal years really need to read this book. (Women of all ages should read the author's other book &quot;Out-smarting the Female Fat Cell). Dieting has a terrible hold on women who doen't realize or believe the negative effects of it.It has been a tremendous relief to me to read that my recent, rapid weight gain is not necessarily all my fault and that dieting will only make it worse. To read and understand what's happening with the hormones in my body and the effect that has on me physically and emotionally gave me a feeling of confidence. Confidence that I can become healthier--without dieting and depriving myself--and stronger by working more physical activity into my day.I plan to put Debra Waterhouse's advice into practice and be healthier and stronger after menopause than I am now!Thank you for this great book and the way you have written it so that the average person can understand this very complex time in their lives."},{"Title":"Outsmarting the Midlife Fat Cell: Winning Weight Control Strategies for Women Over 35 to Stay Fit Through Menopause","review":"After having read only half way through the book so far, I felt that I needed to write a review because what Debra Waterhouse says makes so much sense! She has answered the question to my problems. I have experienced the hysterectomy, the dieting, the weight gain, stress, hair thinning, hot flashes, etc. I have seen doctors who can't seem to tell me tell me much. One doctor even insinuated that it was all in my head! I couldn't figure out why I gained so much weight when I hardly eat. The way I run around at work with the combination of the high stress, you would think that I would be as thin as a stick. It didn't make sense until now. I am so thankful for Debra's book, because I was really feeling like my body was falling apart. Every woman should read this book. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Outsmarting the Midlife Fat Cell: Winning Weight Control Strategies for Women Over 35 to Stay Fit Through Menopause","review":"A decent book, with some interesting information about fat cells, but in general, nothing new.

This book comes across as whiney at times with a \\"woe-is-me\\" approach to midlife, despite her efforts to appear positive. She condones eating things like French fries, potato chips, full-fat products, daily chocolate and has a minimum-necessary approach to fitness. She clearly isn't a fitness fanatic. She even mentions that larger women can have a commanding presence and lists Aretha Franklin as an example! Hello, that woman epitomizes over-indulgence. Also, if you are very active, you will have to get more food into you than she says. I tried to only eat the smallest meals only when I was hungry, and probably because I am fit and exercise regularly, I needed quite a few more calories than she suggested. I suggest women look to a life full of activity as an antidote to depression and aging, and I would not suggest, as the author does, that the fat we need in our diet come from junk foods like potato chips. There are so many more ways to get fat into your diet that don't involve saturated fats. Avoiding bad foods does not qualify as a \\"diet.\\" It's good sense."},{"Title":"Outsmarting the Midlife Fat Cell: Winning Weight Control Strategies for Women Over 35 to Stay Fit Through Menopause","review":"I found this book to be very informative. It helped me understand what happens to the female body as we age from preteen to elderly and how to deal with it. I recommend reading this book!

It could have been condensed into a brochure!!"},{"Title":"Outsmarting the Midlife Fat Cell: Winning Weight Control Strategies for Women Over 35 to Stay Fit Through Menopause","review":"This book doesn't contain concrete, proven methods for weight loss in midlife. Instead, it says ANY attempts to diet will cause greater weight gain. The takeaway: give up and accept you'll never get your 20 year old waistline back and good luck growing old. Redundant in every chapter. Not a worthwhile read. There are some great books out there that have actual suggestions to outsmart menopause fat cells that actually work. I've lost 5 pounds on Bob Harper's The Skinny Rules and have been reading Dr. Oz website for additional strategies. His demographic is middle aged women like me. Ladies, we do NOT have to accept getting fat."},{"Title":"Outsmarting the Midlife Fat Cell: Winning Weight Control Strategies for Women Over 35 to Stay Fit Through Menopause","review":"I found this book to be extremely beneficial to me and very glad I read it. I'm 57, going through menopause and have gained nearly 20 lbs in the last year and a half. I tried every eating style out there to lose the weight, high protein, low carb, low fat, low calorie, and not one of them removed one pound. I also have a job that allows moderate daily activity but I still haven't lost a pound of weight. Dr Waterhouse's approach to removing the fat cells is something I didn't have a clue about and makes perfect sense so I'm following her advice. Although I'm quite disappointed in the review from \\"Dr. Mom\\" who's a Doctor herself who advises not to buy the book or believe what it has to say. She couldn't be more wrong. Most, if not all, women have no clue as to what's going on with their weight gain and become worried and anxious over their appearance and health. We suffering gals are not Doctors like Dr Mom, so to get sound advice from someone like Dr Debra Waterhouse, who is willing to tell us exactly what's going on and what to do about it,is a godsend. Dr Mom didn't offer any advice of her own so why should we believe her knock on this book? I say \\"BUY THIS BOOK!\\" You will be very happy you did and you'll love Dr Debra Waterhouse for her treasure trove of information that you'd have to spend $$$ getting at a Doctors office or from a GYNO :-)"},{"Title":"Outsmarting the Midlife Fat Cell: Winning Weight Control Strategies for Women Over 35 to Stay Fit Through Menopause","review":"If you are well beyond menopause age, as I am at 61, you have to be careful trying out this book. I think it is very good and makes a lot of sense. However, an older body is going to put up a lot more of a fight converting to these methods than a younger one will. Also, changing habits at this age is difficult but not impossible. I am discovering that a better way of using this book is gradually adopting on a one by one basis the ideas she has in this book. By trying them all at once, your body can overload as mine did. The food is mainly a matter of habit and is long term doable. I think her maxim of you should be eating no more than you can comfortably hold in your fist is a good one. However, the exercise area is where you need to be cautious. I got into trouble with the hour long swims and the using of weights. Specifically, I strained my shoulder and my neck. I think I was overenthusiastic and that did not help. I frankly do not know if I ever will be able to resume using the weights. I hope to recover by Fall and hopefully substitute her cross training idea of walking, cycling and swimming being used 3 hours a week over 3 different sessions. In sum, I think this is a very good book with very good ideas for the post menopausal woman, but baby steps not giant steps are needed in adapting it to a more senior body."},{"Title":"Outsmarting the Midlife Fat Cell: Winning Weight Control Strategies for Women Over 35 to Stay Fit Through Menopause","review":"When I came across this book I was in the middle of another &quot;Lose 15 lbs. in 2 weeks!&quot; type diet. I was tired of starving, feeling guilty, and ready to give up. While reading this book it was like a light bulb came on. What she writes makes perfect sense. Eat when you're hungry; eat smaller more frequent meals; stop when you're filled, but not full; exercise moderately. These were foreign concepts to someone who has lived either on or off a diet for half of her life. So, I immediately stopped starving myself, and began listening to my hunger signals. It has been a life-changing experience for me. Now I'll never live in semi-starvation or binge-mode again! Goodbye counting calories, carbs, fat grams, eating on schedules, etc. Hello life!

Thank you Debra Waterhouse!!!"},{"Title":"Outsmarting the Midlife Fat Cell: Winning Weight Control Strategies for Women Over 35 to Stay Fit Through Menopause","review":"I'm still working my way through this book, but so far it's given me a great deal of reassurance that I'm not alone in suddenly developing a \\"spare tire\\" at the age of 40, and it has also done much to help me understand that the same old exercise and eating routine I've followed for ages isn't cutting it anymore.The few problems I have with the book include the author's irritating tendency to periodically stress that women \\"need\\" chocolate. It's almost as if she's projecting her own cravings onto all women - going so far as to write a book on this very topic; thus further perpetuating this ancient stereotype (the book sounds too absurd to even look into).As she's taken pains to publish a work explaining women's biological midlife changes, drawing on (and greatly simplifying) scientific research to support her claims, this baseless, repetitive nonsense about chocolate has no place here. It's as scientific as stating \\"all women love shoes\\". I've found in my own experience that giving up all types of processed, packaged baked goods and sweets years ago has resulting in losing my taste for it. And, like many women, chocolate causes me to suffer from terrible migraines and flareups of rosacea. I neither love it or need it and haven't thought about in two decades. She would have done better to simply say that we tend to crave sugar more at this time, which is probably closer to the truth.Moving on..I also noticed while flipping through the book another glaring factual error - one concerning vegetarian protein sources. The author states that it is necessary \\"to combine your beans and rice\\" to get a complete protein source. For years before this book was printed (1998) modern science acknowledged that this isn't true. As long as we get all of the amino acids we need in a day, food combining is totally unecessary. It's unfortunate that she didn't double check her facts before printing this misinformation. Frances Lappe Moore made this assumption initially in 1970, and her subsequent book some years later corrected the error.Finally, since the book is directed at 35-55 year olds, and many of the women who buy it may fall into the lower end of that age range, the continual reference to being \\"menopausal\\" (I didn't enjoy thinking of myself that way, mainly because I'm nowhere near menopause) can be quite grating. Even though she does explain the difference between perimenopausal and menopausal phases of life, the \\"perimenopausal\\" references tend to drop by the wayside as the book progresses.All things considered, I would still recommend it for anyone struggling with an otherwise inexplicable weight gain and other signs of midlife change."},{"Title":"Outsmarting the Midlife Fat Cell: Winning Weight Control Strategies for Women Over 35 to Stay Fit Through Menopause","review":"I could not understand why all the things I had been doing with success (exercize, proper eating) were failing me suddenly at the age of 40....now I know!

For those who do not understand the difference between essentialism and constructionism, this will make you understand.Professor Griff, Winnie Mandela, Robert Mugabe and so many others make false claims that Africa had no homosexuality until Europeans intervened. Dr. Wekker disproves that by showing how Surinamese mati are influenced greatly by West African religion and principles. You could almost say this is an Afrocentric support of Blacks in same-sex romantic relationships. This is a book that Black gay male and lesbian activists all over the Diaspora need to own and read. Some may want to read this book along side \\"African Homosexualities.\\"When quoting informants, Dr. Wekker uses their actual Surinamese language and then translates it into English. For polyglots and those familiar with the Dutch-speaking world, this may be informative. However, there is a way that it just takes up space. This book would have been 50 pages shorter without it. Perhaps, Dr. Wekker wants readers to inhabit multilingual terrains, as Gloria Anzaldua did. Still, I think readers like me who don't understand any form or Dutch will skip through a lot. I did love some of the colorful idioms and phrases here. One Surinamese woman says, \\"Only god knows why he didn't give the horse horns.\\" I'm still trying to find a way to use that phrase in 21st-century America! (By the way, the author writes in American English, rather than British English.)Dr. Wekker tries to \\"keep it real.\\" She stands against bourgeois posing intended to impress elite audiences. Still, there is a way that this book makes us Black people look bad. The book is filled with violence, sexual promiscuity, womanizing from either gender, disparagement of marriage, and other things that some may find objectionable. I do worry about what would happen if this book gets into the wrong people's hands.You can see and hear the author in a documentary called \\"Middle Sexes\\" narrated by Gore Vidal. As women's studies departments become gender studies departments, readers may want to peruse this alongside Bana-Shute's book on Surinamese men."},{"Title":"The Twelve Seasons","review":"In my review of Krutch'sThe Desert YearI noted that I had \\"grown up\\" with him, at least in the sense that I religious read his column in the New York Times in the 1960's. In terms of columnists, he was a world apart: a naturalist and an ecologist, before those terms and professions came into vogue. Though, of course, he did have his predecessors, most famously Henry David Thoreau. Thus, it is no surprise that Thoreau is quoted on several occasions in these essays. Krutch first issued this collection of 12 essays, one, obviously for each month, in 1949. I purchased my copy in 1967.Krutch says that he had never been south of the Tropic of Cancer. His natural world which is depicted in these essays is the one of New England. And he finds much solace there, or, as he says: \\"Anxiety and distress, interrupted occasionally by pleasure, is the normal course of man's existence. Joylessness, the \`quiet desperation' which Thoreau defined, may ultimately come to seem the distinctly human characteristic; and in the country I not only escape to some degree but also participate somewhat in the joy which is not ordinarily ours.\\"Krutch starts his \\"twelve seasons\\" with April, when New England again awakens from its winter dormancy. His essay for June could have inspired a Nanci Griffith song, \\"Trouble in the fields\\": \\"...our children live in the cities, and rest upon our shoulders, they never want the rain to fall, or the weather to get colder.\\" Or as Krutch first said: \\"One trouble with the city is that there is so much bad weather there. Nearly everybody admits that snow is merely an expensive nuisance, and even the early summer rains serve no real purpose where there is nothing to be watered, and where sewers have to be built to drain the insipid liquid away.\\" A fine statement bemoaning our alienation from the natural world.Krutch is well-read, so his essays are filled with literary illusions. Schopenhauer, T.S. Eliot, Homer are just a few of the reference points. He died in 1970. Then, it must have seemed that the battles over evolution were resolved. He seems to have prematurely declared victory when he wrote: \\"Historical accounts make it clear enough that when Darwin and Huxley won their battle overOn the Origin of SpeciesandThe Descent Of Man, the most they achieved was a reluctant, shamefaced confession that man is a part of Nature and must admit his blood relationship with other living things...\\" Alas, that is still a \\"debating point\\" in the American Senate.Krutch also had a problem with the \\"sport\\" of hunting. Thus, no surprise that he relates the following anecdote about Tolstoi: \\"They say that when one of Tolstoi's acquaintances who happened to be a bigoted meat-eater, came to dinner, he found a chicken and a knife tied to the table leg; if he wanted meat, Tolstoi told him, he would have to prepare it himself. If this were the universal custom, I imagine that a great many animal lives would be saved. That division of labor which is responsible for the profession of butcher is one of the most important single factors against which the vegetarian has to contend. There is more than one kind of dirty work which we habitually hire others to do for us.\\"Joseph Wood Krutch was a guiding light, still valid after all these years. 5-stars."},{"Title":"The Twelve Seasons","review":"I first read this book whe I was a freshman in college and wouldread a chapter a month as the year went by.

He struggles on occasion because he alternately refutes &amp; repeats stereotypes about Latinos, players &amp; nonplayers alike. Some reference material (e.g. a reading list, maps, etc.) would make the book more useful, but overall it is both amusing &amp; insightful, notably on the politics of baseball in US-Nicaraguan relations.

I recommend it in addition to the comprehensive \\"Scuba Diving\\" by Dennis K.

I'd definitely have it in my &quot;sport diving&quot; home library, if you do any kind of diving at all.Divers who have long been out of certification classes or who are planning refresher training will especially benefit.The variety of topics include these: The Truth About Decompression Sickness; Tides, Waves, and Currents and how to read them; 18 Keys to Scuba Diving Excellence; What to Look For in Diving Equipment; Fitness and Training--How You Can Do It; Underwater Photography; Spearfishing; TREASURE DIVING; Safety...Includes lots of photos and is one of my all-time favorite sport/hobby books."},{"Title":"The Rescue Of Ranor","review":"Minna is a regular white witch except she doesn't like to help people (which is part of the job) So when Sven, a non (person who is immuned to magic) comes asking for help she isn't very excited. Sven's brother Ranor (a important, obnoxious, trouble making magician) is kidnapped and held for ransom by a black sorcerer (the most powerful kind) The deal is that Sven (to set Ranor free) has to fight the Black Sorcerer with the help of a White Witch. So once a White Witch lets a person come in to their house they have to help them with their problems. Minna is stuck. Sven and Minna set out on a journey (With Minna's Familar, a half demon half goblin) where it seems nothing but trouble ever seems to happen. This is a complicated but funny story of a place where half the land is scientifical and the other half magicial. This is a story worth your time if you like adventure and magic."},{"Title":"The Rescue Of Ranor","review":"FYI: I'm over 45, and never read this book before now, so I'm coming at it from the point of view of an adult who likes, and has read a lot of, 8-to-12, 12-and-up & YP books. (They have far better plots than most of the adult stuff.) Also, at this time, I'm only mid-way thru it, so I don't know the outcome. As plotline is covered above, I'll stick to more abstract aspects such as quality of writing._ _ _ This book is fun - very good light reading. I'd recommend it to anyone of any age, even the 10-year-olds (with high reading levels). The characters are very well-drawn. I can imagine the action incredibly well. The author doesn't really state the age of the young witch, but she seems to be in her teens. This means anyone from 10 on up can imagine themselves in her place, reluctantly having adventures she's been avoiding for so long._ _ _ And I think the plot is deceptive - it's not as simple as it appears. True, it's mainly (so far) a journey punctuated by exciting but short-lived events. But I'm getting inklings that the whole point of this Challenge her young client is faced with may only be an excuse for the sorcerer to get to our Witch. It's the WAY the Challenge was constructed - necessitating a Non-Magic relative coming from the Scientific world, and having to bring the first White Witch he finds... who HAPPENS to live just next to the border, in her quest to avoid people in general... It's too coincidental that this inexperienced (but apparently, more powerful than she knows) witch is sucked into this (my long experience with Whodunits is coming out, I'm always suspecting hidden motives). (I could be wrong...)_ _ _ Anyway, it's a lot of fun for anyone who enjoys a good read. (Really, the kids' novels are a really neglected area for us older people. And since they're for kids, the authors don't have the freedom to in-fill the plot with pointless sex scenes, which I really don't want in my reading.)_ _ _By all means, this is a keeper."},{"Title":"The Rescue Of Ranor","review":"This book is one that I remember fondly from childhood/early adolescence. I must have read it ten times. Not only is it well and convincingly imagined, and well-told, it uses the fantasy world as a way of exploring themes that resonate with anyone who has experienced difficulties or hardships. This book works well on two levels - it's a fun adventure romp in a magical world, and a story of self-realization that can be appreciated for its parallels to the world we really live in."},{"Title":"Blood and Money","review":"I read this book for a different reason than most, I am an avid lover of Saddlebred horses and have been my whole life. I knew of Joan Robinson from her success in horses and have always wanted to know what happened to her. Tompson does an excellent job of portraying the events that lead up to Joan's death. If you liked this subject matter you should also read Ann Kurth's, Prescription: Murder. It isn't nearly as good as Blood and Money, but it gives a more in depth story of how John Hill killed Joan. Written by his second wife, Kurth tells how John told her, in detail, exactly how he killed Joan. Both books are wonderful. All Saddlebred lovers should read them both."},{"Title":"Blood and Money","review":"I read this book about a year ago, it still haunts me.

She had sickened just a day before but her husband, who was also her doctor, seemed strangely reluctant to give her any care or to seek help. She was diagnosed as being afflicted with a number of deadly organisms which appeared suddenly in her system. Ash Robinson is certain that his daughter was murdered by her husband but after his arrest and a trial, a mistrial was called and another due to commence in a few months. Then followed a series of amazing events, including a quick marriage and divorce by the doctor, followed by his murder by a supposed robber in front of his third wife. This whole book which is a true story, is something that even a novelist wouldn't hope to get away with but every event is factual and another example of how the rich ARE different. The book is very well written and an attention holder right to the end."},{"Title":"Blood and Money","review":"I picked this book at random from my daughter's bookcase not realizing it was based on true facts.

Being from Texas as I am, I read about a wealthy family from my home state that was embroiled in a scandalous murder investigation. How John Hill killed his wife (I'm not giving anything away saying this..it was in the news)was nothing short of horrific.In the book, there were parts that seemed to drag on, although all parts of the investigation must be considered to understand how the murder was committed.

Absolutely one of the best true crime books ever written. You can watch the movie, Murder in Texas on Youtube, starring Farrah Fawcett, Sam Elliot, and Andy Griffith (he did play the character of Ash Robinson to a 'T\\") saw the movie back in 70's and it was very good but it was base on the 2nd wife's version of the truth and she definitely had an agenda. Ordered my second copy of this book, gave my sister the first. Mr. Thompson did such a wonderful job that no other book about this subject could even come close, you will not regret buying this. One thing I have noticed when looking for pictures on the internet of Joan Robinson Hill is that she bears a very close likeness to Cybil Sheppard back when she was younger, I thought that was interesting. There are so many fascinating things connected with this entire story that you can't help but find out more. Like one reader suggested it would be great if the next edition had an update because it was written over 30 yrs. ago."},{"Title":"Blood and Money","review":"I would have to say that this is the book that started my interest in family crime. Thomas Thompsom wrote this compelling and hard-to-put-down book about a wealthy Houston family, the Robinsons. Joan Robinson, an avid horsewoman, married John Hill and thus the problems began. Along the way, John becomes a plastic surgeon, they have a son, the marriage falls apart, Joan dies, Joan's father, Ash Robinson, blames John, John remarries - well, it gets complicated. I don't want to give away too much, but suffice it to say that it was first published in 1976 before the Internet, so Mr. Thompson really did his homework, I've read the book 4 times already, and I hope to read it again. Excellent well-written book - it makes me want to go back and revise my previous reviews and change most of the 5 star ratings to 4 star ratings."},{"Title":"Blood and Money","review":"I am going to stick my head out and say this is perhaps the best true crime book I have ever read. In comparing this work to many of those by Ann Rule, I sometimes find Rule's revelations contain a repetitious tendency which bog me down from time to time. In contrast, for me anyway, \\"Blood and Money\\" flowed superbly.Thompson weaves an incredible tale of love, greed, hate and murder, delving deep into characters from the top echelon of Texas society to those lives lived on its edges, pounding the gutters of America's cities. I particularly liked the way he widely lays bare every life that is heavily involved in this crime, giving each one a relevance and significance, revealing the path they took towards this destiny.It's well worth chasing the book, it is a sizzling read."},{"Title":"Blood and Money","review":"\\"Hi\\" said Joan, summoning a show ring smile for Dr. John Hill, who rose like an obedient hound dog and pumped her hand enthusiastically. He was almost six feet tall, a well built man with broad shoulders, and thick black hair and a wide and guileless face. Joan decided that he was worth knowing. She made a discreet signal which Margaret Foster caught. The two friends went to the powder room.\\"When Joan Robinson, the daughter of a Texan millionaire saw John Hill, the plastic surgeon, she made up her mind from the start that she wanted him and saw him at the time as one who would be only to happy to marry into her well-heeled family. He was indeed happy to do so and did marry her.It was not long before his colours started showing up and he became unbearably greedy, and controlling.This was not a match made in heaven and when she fell ill and died, to all and sundry it appeared like a set up. However, Joan father Ash Robinson would stop at nothing, because he was more than sure that Joan had just not becone ill and died, but he was convinced that John Hill played a pivotal role in her death, and that she was murdered. He set to work hiring the best lawyers and sending them crazy with particular instructions, not necessary legal, for poor Ash was haunted day in and out by his daughter's death .These 474 pages will keep you entertained, going to court, lots of appeals, and the exhumation of Joan's body.

Modern thought is that his wife Joan died from Toxic Shock Syndrome, an illness not known or described at the time of her death. The time course, refractory nature, symptoms and fulminant course all fit quite well. Having treated septic shock in the ICU, I can also say with authority that with the available treatments at the time it is unlikely she would have survived in any case. Dr. Hill took her to the hospital where he was known since he would reasonalby expect his wife to receive the best treatment since he was personally known there. And it is absurd to think he planned to kill his wife with an illness that was not known or understood at the time.making Dr. Hill the villian makes for a more commercial story, but I ask you to consider that if he did not murder his wife how cruel his death was, to be murdered in the view of his mother and son."},{"Title":"Blood and Money","review":"Perhaps on a handful of occasions, you come across a story that can paradoxically alter and reinforce your understanding of the human condition. A story so rich in complex and interesting characters, their lives narrated with such vivid detail and telling dialogue, they have to be real people and not the imagined composites of a novelist. A story set so perfectly in a place and time in history that you come away believing for a while that you lived there, traveled the streets, overheard conversations or had supper with the denizens.Of the hundreds of books I have enjoyed reading, like an endless buffet of delicious meals, there are few and far between the luscious delicacies found in Thomas Thompson's book, Blood and Money. This sumptuous feast requires slow, deliberate relish in order to luxuriate in every chapter like exquisitely prepared courses served in the finest restaurant. Before I had finished the first chapter of the book, I began to pace myself to allow the rare beauty and satisfying depth of this engrossing experience to linger.Thompson's masterpiece made him famous, along with introducing the Robinson family to a worldwide audience. He tragically died at age 49 from an illness he acquired while researching another superb work, Serpentine, a riveting and bizarre true story about a serial killer who preyed on tourists in multiple continents. Were not Thompson's career cut short, I would be happily standing in line for his next offering. As it is, I have read and enjoyed every one of his books. His thorough understanding of human nature, exhaustive research and attention to detail, and his virtuoso ear for vernacular, anecdote and irony vaults his work far above the usual pulp suspense or crime genre into the category of great literature, along the lines of William Faulkner, James Joyce, or Dostoevsky. None of the reviews, dust cover blurbs, or quotes from publishers do justice to this book; there are no superlatives that can overstate its brilliance.Blood and Money is set in Houston, Texas, from its beginnings as an uninhabitable swamp to its colorful and extraordinary ascension as a major power metropolis in America. Every influential player in the story is traced from childhood to his or her participation in the intricate drama, which at its core is a familiar tale of love, betrayal, murder, money, and revenge. Ash Robinson, a rags to riches hero, indulges his talented and popular daughter, Joan, to virtually anything her heart desires, including private education, champion horses, and three deadbeat husbands, the last of whom, plastic surgeon Dr. John Hill, probably murders her with a mysterious concoction of bacteria. I don't want to spoil the story, but suffice it to say I believe John Hill facilitated Joan's demise, if not precipitated it out of greed and expedience. Hill is a portrait of narcissism: self-serving ambition, reckless indulgence, cold and calculating cruelty, and with an overly protective, self-righteous mother who defends him to the bitter end. Some of you, like me, may despise Hill so intensely by the first half of the book, you begin rooting for the \\"bad guys\\" to escape punishment.As in the Shakespearian tragedy, Macbeth, there are quite a few dead bodies before the end of the saga, and by now most of the survivors have passed on to the big oil rig in the sky. Unlike in most crime books, however, the reader is privy to an energetic biographical history of the lawyers, judges, prostitutes, pimps, gamblers, ruffians, cops, oil men, socialites, and even some famous Texan politicians, which could only be accomplished through massive research, countless interviews, and dissecting court transcripts and newspaper reports in an investigative fervor unmatched by many writers. Thompson was a journalist with obvious connections and charisma, in whom nearly everyone confided like a priest at the last rites.Joan Robinson Hill is the most ambivalent character in the book, followed in a close second by her father, Ash, whose relationship with her was akin to worship. Unlucky in love, Joan is nevertheless adored by her family and friends, if not most of Houston, and represents the quintessential independent woman: talented, passionate, strong-willed, temperamental, philanthropic, and a devoted mother to her only child, a son she shared with the wretched Hill. Joan is no saint, but her failings and flaws are so endearing, she is someone with whom you can imagine being good friends or at least a doting admirer. Her death is only the beginning of a complex series of relationships, crime and murder.If I tell you anything else, it will ruin the suspense. Buy a copy of Blood and Money. You will want to own this book, and savor every piquant page."},{"Title":"Blood and Money","review":"From this opus, it is clear that the late Mr. Thomas Thompson was an \\"Old Southern Gentleman\\" in the worst sense of that phrase. At times, his archaic attitudes towards race and gender relations were enough to make this usually gentle reader of True Crime want to heave his hefty history of Houston's Hill murders across the Reading Room. For example: \\"The major cities of Texas traditionally rank in the upper echelons of the national crime statistics, partly due to the large populations of blacks and Mexican-Americans among whom such deeds are unhappily a way of life.\\" Practitioners of the World's Oldest Profession fare little better. Thompson repeatedly refers to those principals who are either currently plying their trade or alumni thereof as \\"the whore\\" and \\"the prostitute\\" instead of by her name. OK. Enough already! The reader \\"gets\\" their occupation - now get on with the story!!This tome (450 pages Original Hardcover, 474 paperback 2001 re-print) of a Texas-size tale is written in a decades-earlier-than-its-1976-publication stilted American English. It needs an index so that the reader can refresh memory when a character shows up again after an absence of hundreds of pages. It sorely suffers from the lack of photos in either version.

If you value your time, read something else."},{"Title":"Blood and Money","review":"&quot;Blood and Money&quot; first published in 1976 is a true page turner and a major piece of non-fiction journalism. Set thiry years ago in the moneyed mansions of Houstons River Oaks it is a spellbinding tale of an oil millionares(Ash Robinson) obsessive love for his daughter(Joan Robinson) and her ill fated third marraige to a rising star plastic surgeon(John Hill). Events take tragic and unexpected turns carrying along the readers emotions. Then the author brings us through a series of court trials deepeening the characters and shading their motives. Abruptly the story leaves behind the privileged rich lives and burrows into the sleazy underbelly of Texan prostitution and petty crime culminating in a final pursuit and spectacular murder trial. No fiction is a match for the awful truth here and the writer Thomas Thompson meticulously unravels this bizarre saga of greed, power, lust, love and murder. All the characters are deeply shaded and by force of sheer detail their lives are brought into vivid focus. It is a sprawling narrative similar to Norman Mailers &quot;The Executioners Song&quot; although largely confined to the somewhat strange state of Texas. Thompson must have utilized every possible material(court transcrits, autopsy reports, police files, photographs) and person avialable to him. Conversations are carefully reconstructed, events are colorfully described and the author seamlessly insinuates himself into the mind of each of the characters. Readers enjoy a fly- on-the-wall perspective of the characters doings and actions. Ultimately &quot;Blood and Money&quot; can fairly take its place alongside other New Journalism classics like &quot;In Cold Blood&quot;. It would have been nice however if the author had included a preface, (some notes about his research techniques) photographs and character epilogues. The hard cover Doubleday publication does not contain any supplementry information perhaps other versions do. This calibre of jornalism is damned impressive and it's a pity we don't have its originator Thomas Thompson with us any longer."},{"Title":"Blood and Money","review":"I don't write many \\"me too\\" reviews in this space, but I can't resist recommending \\"Blood and Money,\\" not only for afficianados of \\"true crime\\" literature, but for anyone interested in the workings of the American legal system. I know little of the city of Houston or of Texas, but I gather that Thomas Thompson's tome is also an excellent snapshot of this booming energy/medical/cultural complex, c.1970.The details of the story are covered by other reviewers here. It's interesting that many have come to hard conclusions about the legal culpability of certain principals in this long, involved story (perhaps being influenced by other sources), while Thompson himself passes no definite judgments (though it's not difficult to tell what he's implying). Although there are no source notes or acknowledgments, one has the impression that Thompson included little in this account that could not be corroborated by \\"reliable sources,\\" although he does include some speculation on specific points.But the real value of the book, as I said, is not so much in portraying guilt or innocence but in dealing with a larger issue: the impact of wealth, social prestige, and publicity on the legal process and on justice. Depending on how one views the evidence presented by Thompson, it's not unreasonable to say that none of the principals involved in this entire episode received justice from the Texas court system. Some relatively minor players went to jail, and one died, in part, because of their involvement. But for the big fish in this case, the legal system in the end had no answers and no closure. I'll leave the deeper reflections on class and justice to Karl Marx.Another thought: This book should be required reading in medical schools. A physician who insists on treating his own family and friends is asking for it!The publishers of this thirty-year-old book would do well to commission an \\"Afterword\\" for a new edition, to cover what happened since the 1976 publication. A few developments (based on some internet searching): John Hill's third wife, Connie, sued Ash Robinson for wrongful death in the slaying of her husband, but no damages were awarded. Thompson was himself sued for defamation by Ash Robinson, as well as by Ann Kurth (John Hill's second wife), and by a Texas police officer who figured in the story. Robinson's case eventually was dismissed, and Thompson won the other suits. Thompson died in 1982, Ash Robinson in 1985. The story was dramatized as a TV film, \\"Murder in Texas,\\" in 1981, based on the book \\"Prescription: Murder\\" by Ann Kurth, who maintained that John Hill tried to kill her and may have faked his own death. Kurth's book, and the film version, no doubt have left many with a much more definite idea as to who was responsible for the death of Joan Robinson Hill.Not exactly the most vital book I've read lately, but if you are seeking an intriguing, novelistic and somewhat illuminating book for bedtime or the airport, you could do far worse. And if you ARE a \\"true crime\\" fan, this book is a must."},{"Title":"Blood and Money","review":"I saw the mini-series starring Farrah Fawcett before I read the book. I was intrigued by the movie. I had never heard of Joan Olive Robinson Hill before and after seeing the movie I wondered about her and her life and if it were possible that her husband did in fact kill her. There were a lot of questions that needed answering. I read the book and was amazed at the attention Thomas Thompson gave to even the smallest detail and how he was able to draw you into the story, you almost felt like you were there when these events happened. The book did not absolutely say that John Hill had killed Joan Hill, but it certainly provided ample motive and opportunity. And the scenario that describes the way he might have done it seems plausible. Who knows? This does not take away at all from the drama of this story and as John Hill himself is dead as well, there are some things we will never know. Thomas Thompson makes you feel empathy for Joan and her situation. He also makes you feel sympathy, compassion and scorn; why didn't she just leave the bum and find someone who really wanted her. I loved this story."},{"Title":"Blood and Money","review":"The depiction in this interesting book is accurate, according to events reported in the Houston newspapers that covered these events. I was fortunate to actually see Ash Robinson one morning in 1978, in the driveway of his River Oaks home, wearing pajamas and putting something in the trunk of his car. It was awesome."},{"Title":"Blood and Money","review":"When i was a little boy, I snagged this book off my mother's bed stand and could not but it down, obviously it was not exactly what my mother would want me to read at ten, but it was just a fantastic read, and it happened in Houston, which for me made it totally fascinating. The story is so amazing you really cannot believe this really happened, but shockingly it did, the Hill mansion in River Oaks still sits on its corner, astride to Kirby Drive. This is a well written barn burner on a story that pleaded for this kind of treatment. Really, one of the best true crime books every written, highly recommended."},{"Title":"Blood and Money","review":"Thomas Thompson does a fantastic job of re-telling the events surrounding the mysterious death of a Houston socialite, the investigation into the death, the trial of her prominent surgeon husband, and the circumstances surrounding his murder a few years after hers. This is without a doubt the most gripping story I have ever read. Thompson's research on this project was extensive, and I would imagine exhaustive. It is written as if he were a witness to all the events which took place in this story. It is a story so bizarre, it would have to be fiction, but sadly was a very true story of adultery, greed, and vengeance. If you can find the book I highly recommend you buy it. You will have a hard time putting it down."},{"Title":"Blood and Money","review":"This book was given to me when I was a 13 year old living outside of Houston TX. It was the book that launched my fascination with true crime books of high quality (i.e. Darcy O'Brien,Vincent Bugliosi). I am still fascinated by the case and have heard many rumors in the last 20 years about the actual cause of death. Amazing - that this story still haunts me all these years later. It is out of print and I own a copy I have never lent out for fear of never seeing it again! Also interesting was Ann Kurth's Prescription:Murder which is her side of the case. Not even close to the same caliber as Blood &amp; Money but still interesting. I cannot recommend this book highly enough - find it at the library or a used book store immediately!"},{"Title":"Blood and Money","review":"'Blood and Money' is just about the best book I have ever read regarding true crime. I am an avid Ann Rule fan but Tommy Thompson's tale of murder(s)in Texas was spellbinding. I have read this book probably 20 times and will read it again and again. This book was the best purchase I have ever made at a used book store."},{"Title":"Blood and Money","review":"This is a very well written account of a true-crime that occurred in Houston, TX in the late 1960's. This rings like a movie because of the cricumstances, and sadly the victim, Joan Robinson was murdered in one of the worst possible ways. However, the boring, selfish, nerdy Doctor received what he deserved in the end. If I say anything else I'll ruin the book. I found it at a used bookstore, so don't be daunted if you don't find it right away. It's a suspenseful book that pits characters against one another. (That &quot;Racehorse&quot; Raynes is quite a character.)"},{"Title":"Blood and Money","review":"I think this book started me on the true crime addiction. It was wonderful."},{"Title":"Blood and Money","review":"Having recently seen a wonderful film entitled \\"Murder in Texas,\\" I was intrigued by the knowledge that the miniseries was based on a true story. Thomas Thompson's \\"Blood and Money\\" is a wonderful examination of the intertwining lives of many diverse people. Delving deeper in the case and answering many of my questions, I found this examination of the lives of Doctor John Hill, Ash and Joan Robinson, and many other individuals to be compelling reading. This fascinating true account explores such relevant themes as obsessive love, revenge, greed, and the abuse of power.The premise of this large book concerns the mysterious death of society woman Joan Robinson Hill. In 1969, she died suddenly after an abrupt and debilitating illness. Joan's father, Ash, launched a vehement and determined crusade to try and convict her husband, John Hill, (a famous plastic surgeon), for the crime. In 1973, John is murdered as he returns home from San Francisco with his third wife. The mysterious death has all the marking of a contract killing. Could Ash Robinson be behind the crime?Every character in this case study is fascinating. Although we will never know what really happened in this complicated web of deceit, revenge, and violence, it is easy to see that every individual is fallible. The story was troubling as it points out flaws in America's justice system and shows that the possession of money may accomplish tasks but not buy peace of mind. Both John Hill and Ash Robinson were individuals who deeply disturbed me. John disturbed me because of his self-absorption and seemingly calculating attitude. If John did not actually murder his wife physically, then his neglect of her definitely contributed to her death. Ash disturbed me because of the almost voracious fixation he had for his daughter. What is most shocking is that this narrative is true. The most pitiable characters in this true account were Joan Robinson, Marcia McKitrick, (the prostitute who might have been involved in the conspiracy to murder John), and Bobby Van Diver, (Marcia's accomplice).Mr. Thompson does not give definite opinions on who he feels to be responsible for the crimes, but there are times when implications are obvious. I loved his easy-to-understand and light narrative style. His explanation of certain laws were very helpful. The book is riveting from start to finish. I'm glad that, unlike the miniseries, each person is depicted fairly. Therefore, John is presented realistically and Ash is as well. I was surprised at how Thompson wrote about Ann Kurth, (John's second wife). She seems to be the one individual of whom he is overly critical. Since \\"Murder in Texas\\" is based on Kurth's own book about John, and is therefore one-sided, Thompson's examination of the case is more realistic. Please read this book to meet some truly fascinating individuals and to become acquainted with an unforgettable true crime in human history. God bless you all."},{"Title":"Blood and Money","review":"Thomas Thompson wrote the best true crime book of all time. Each page is a page of literature. He paints such a superb picture that you feel like you are in the room with these people. I truly miss his talent."},{"Title":"Blood and Money","review":"this is one of the very best books i've ever read,hands down.i remember reading this book back in the early 80s.ordered in the middle of febuary,received it quickly as usual. it only took me about 3 days to read, very hard to put this book down.the movie however is VERY different.it is hard to find,saw it on \\"[...]it starts at a party in the middle of joan&johns marriage,which is already in trouble.dad ash was a very hands on dad in the book.he is very loving in the movie as well but not as much as in the book.it was very dissapointing,trully copied off t.v. somewhere!!!and in the end of the movie he runs off to mexico after fixing an ex~cons face to look like him and using him at his house at the robbery,and having the ex~cons face disfigured so he couldn't be reconized.the ex~cox i'm sure didn't agree with this escapade.(he was killed).but this book will remain in my library forever. i will definately reread it down the road.... enjoy!"},{"Title":"Blood and Money","review":"This book was in good condition when I received it, fully in tact, although it is an old book with a little wear."},{"Title":"Blood and Money","review":"I started to read this book years ago, but had to return it to a friend.

Especially if you like a great mystery!"},{"Title":"Blood and Money","review":"I first read this book about 25 years ago, and have read it several times since. It is just as intriguing today as then. I never go by the Robinson-Hill home or Ash's, that I dont think about this long ago saga. I thought Thompson did a masterful job telling the events of this case. It was the talk of Houston for years. Recently I even saw pictures of the inside of the home on a website about this case. Joan Robinson Hills grave in partially hidden by a tree. You have to really look to see it."},{"Title":"Blood and Money","review":"Thompson's book is a brilliant recreation of the crime and its aftermath. It was especially interesting to me because my mother knew Joan Robinson Hill through the world of American Saddlebred horses. While it is glaringly evident from numerous errors that Thompson knew nothing whatsoever about show horses (and didn't take the trouble to find out), the remainder of the book could not have been better done. A real page turner."},{"Title":"Blood and Money","review":"i love true crime and this one happens to be my ALL TIME FAVORITE!!! trust me, you will love it. it's the bible of true crime."},{"Title":"Blood and Money","review":"If you read this review, it will reveal the end of the story as portrayed in the book. However, you will have a more accurate picture of the events with which the book deals. The book concludes with the conviction of Lilla Paulus as a participant in the murder of John Hill. The impression is also strongly conveyed that Ash Robinson paid to have Hill killed. However, the book fails to reveal the conviction of Paulus was reversed on appeal for insufficient evidence, and a judgment of acquittal was entered. Also, Ash Robinson, Paulus and others were unsuccessfully sued in a civil action for the wrongful death of Hill. The book spends a good bit of time discussing the legal requirement of evidence independently corroborative of accomplice testimony in a murder case; it was the lack of such corroboration that led to the acquittal of Paulus on appeal. However, there is no such requirement in a civil action. But in the civil action the jury found no conspiracy by Robinson, Paulus and others in the death of Hill; this judgment was affirmed on appeal. These decisions may be found in the opinions of the Texas appellate courts, which go into some detail of the records of the trials. While these decisions were handed down after the book was published, and therefore would not have been available to the author, nevertheless from the written opinion in the Paulus criminal appeal one can glean certain omissions in Thompson's account. For instance, Lilla Paulus' daughter gave damning testimony against her. Thompson fails to mention at all that Paulus' son contradicted his sister on certain key testimony. While the book is an engrossing read, one must question the overall accuracy and completeness of the story as portrayed therein in light of these omissions."},{"Title":"Blood and Money","review":"I was a juror in the State of Texas v. Lila Paulus trial and Tommy Thompson was in court each day. We spoke with him after the trial. I still dream about some of it. The book is what nightmares are made of - and it's all true."},{"Title":"High Score! The Illustrated History of Electronic Games","review":"Past accounts of gaming history are marred by mistakes, omissions, or a focus on one aspect of electronic entertainment. High Score provides balanced coverage of consoles, computers, and the arcade. As someone else noted, it *is* very much from an American perspective. The history of European gaming still needs to be written. And, yes, the book--like today's gaming magazines--relies too much on pictures and not enough on words. Those are valid points. They are secondary, though, to the impressiveness of the book. If you fondly remember past golden days of gaming or if you want to learn more about them, this is so the book for you."},{"Title":"High Score! The Illustrated History of Electronic Games","review":"If you grew up in the computer generation this book will bring joy to your heart. Techno-nostalgia litters every page of this quality paperback. Glossy screenshots and pictures of game packaging act as a magnet, pulling the memories of games gone by from the deepest parts of the reader's brain. This book brings back memories of Donkey Kong!, Lode Runner, M.U.L.E., Rocket Ranger, Space Quest, and many of the great dynasties of the game world. Wilson and DeMaria have pulled together a virtual encyclopedia of special memories. The only way that this gaming tome could have been improved would have been to provide the games with it. Even without the games, readers will exult in this quality portrayal of their hobby and those who helped propel it forward into the 21st century. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"},{"Title":"High Score!

It shows how Donkey Kong looked on Atari(a dark fuzzy ugly thing) to the way he looks on Game Cube's Super Smash Bros.(much more detailed and graphically lovable). It doesnt say things like oh Atari is horrible because its old or SNES is dumb because its more than 10 years old. It simply shows how things got more sophisticated and better looking in time. The whole book is a must see. I hope that in the next life I get to play every single game listed in this book. It shows the story of Mario and Link as well as Sonic The Hedgehog."},{"Title":"High Score! The Illustrated History of Electronic Games","review":"This is the best book on computer games that I have seen so far. An amazing lot of work and love has gone into it and it is a real masterpiece - pure joy to read and look at.300 pages, densely packed with thousands of illustrations, photos, screenshots, cover &amp; concept art -- and the layout is just amazing. For most popular games series, e.g. Ultima, you get screenshots and covers for every single title! But the book is not mere eyecandy. There's tons of exquisite information too, like interviews with major game designers. Even if you already have a lot of insider knowledge of computer games, I guarantee you'll find lots of new and interesting stuff here.The book is well structured and very detailled, yet at the same time great fun to read. It starts of with the pre-Pong era, going back as early as the 19th century with the foundation of companies that later became Nintendo and Philips. Further on, it focusses majorly on arcade games, consoles and the PC.The only shortcoming is that the book is rather USA-centric. The european games scene, which moved more around homecomputers like the Commodore 64, Amiga and Atari ST isn't covered. Same goes for most european productions, like the games from Bullfrog (Populous), Bitmap Brothers (Speedball), Graftgold (Uridium), Factor-5 (Turrican, Rogue Squadron) and the likes.However this is not a real drawback as the book is an unmatched treasure chest nonetheless. You will certainly not regret buying it. Did I mention the entire book is in full color and the print quality is excellent? Get it *now*!"},{"Title":"High Score! The Illustrated History of Electronic Games","review":"The Bottom Line: This is a nice coffee table book to spark some discussion, but true gaming fans and players will be dissapointed with this version of gaming history.My own, personal dissatisfaction with this book comes from the lack of coverage of the 2D fighter genre, which was kicked off in the early 1990's with Street Fighter 2. This one game single-handedly revitalized and recreated the arcade market, which had been strugling since around 1983. It forever shifted some primary design philosophies, most importantly, from competing against a computer AI to competing against human opponents (which is the main draw to just about every online game in existence today).In a sense, it was a retro-evolution back to games like Pong and what made those games so much fun.To put it another way, games were designed with the idea that humans would be competing against each other as a primary design element. Therefore, issues such as balance, cheating, and competition took on new meanings. These factors had to be developed within the framework of highly complex games, not simple games like Pong.The impact of this game cannot be overstated, but the authors devote a whopping 1-page to this landmark game and say little about the genre (and the hundreds of games) that came after and are still being made today. That's simply inexcusable. Street Fighter, alone, has about 30 sequels in various incarnations.The vast majority of 1990's section is devoted to PC gaming and profiles of PC Gaming companies (because the PC finally began to become a powerful enough machine that it could deliver graphics and sound that had broad market appeal).Very little is ever said about the shifting gaming cultural landscape that occured between cosoles, home computers, and Arcades but that sort of thing, to a true gamer, is as important as the demise of Saturday morning cartoons when cable got big.In short, with the exception of the early history section, this book reads more like a catalog of games organized by release date and accompanied with a screen or box shot. It fails to actually comment intelligently on the subject itself."},{"Title":"High Score! The Illustrated History of Electronic Games","review":"Forget architectural digest or Martha what's her name's books if you are a computer gaming addict, this is the book for your coffee (Jolt Cola) table. &quot;High Score&quot; is a broad and complete history of computer games from arcades, consoles and computer games on multiple platforms. From the completeness, great pains have been taken to cover all aspects of computer game development from enabling technologies to new ideas of game play. There are enough trivia tidbits that even the most hard core gamer will find something new. The only caveat is that depth is sacrificed for breadth, making it more of a book for browsing than reading. The book is also valuable in that it reveals that fun comes in many forms and is sure to inspire game developers beyond the derivative ideas that pose as game play innovation."},{"Title":"High Score! The Illustrated History of Electronic Games","review":"Remember when games were made by handful of coders and they're names were featured prominently on the box? High Score is great book that provides a history of electronic gaming from it's beginnings with spacewar all the way up to recent titles such as Unreal. The book is divided by decades and is further subdivided by game companies. I wouldn't really call it a &quot;coffee table book&quot; because it's definitely a book you can sit down and read just for the history.The pictures are amazing, each company has pictures of developers, screenshots, and boxshots. The book tends to focus on computer games more than console, and doesn't talk much about more modern arcade games. IMHO, I think the book focused on the right points, there is no way you could have unabridged illustrated history without ending up with a 1000 page monstrosity. If you've played games for a long time like me, this book will bring back tons of memories. Younger gamers would probably like it for the history, but older gamers and even people who just work in the industry will appreciate this book."},{"Title":"High Score! The Illustrated History of Electronic Games","review":"While my gaming platform of choice is firmly the PC, and even that this book does evoke wonderful nostalgia for my old Apple II and those old PC games I used to play, I wish there was better coverage for console and arcade games, especially those ones after the Atari 2600 crash, such as the NES, Genesis, and the SNES.. Even the mighty Playstation only received a few pages, while much more detailed coverage was given to PC game companies with (arguably) less impact on the general scheme of things such as Trilobyte (7th Guest). I wished that they had more to say about the newer consoles than a quarter-page of text and two pages full of screenshots.Perhaps this is understandable given the background of the writers, and don't get me wrong, I loved the book anyway, I just wish that I could read as much about the creation of Street Fighter II as I could about the creation of the King's Quest series or the Cinemaware computer games. But by all means, if you're in your 30s and are nostalgic about playing Pitfall ! on your Atari 2600 and Ultima II on your Apple II+ like me, get this book !!"},{"Title":"High Score!

It's a great coffee table addition."},{"Title":"High Score! The Illustrated History of Electronic Games","review":"This book is more like a huge 320 page Computer Gaming World special feature (of which co-author Johnny Wilson was editor for many years) than a comprehensive history of \\"Electronic Games\\" (as well, except for a microscopic thanks in the first couple pages of the book along with 100's of others, Arnie Katz, Bill Kunkel And Joyce Worley get absolutely no credit for their pioneering game journalism or for coining the phrase this book is built upon, but I digress).What we have is a nicely illustrated grazing of a history that was covered much better in Steven L. Kent's \\"The First Quarter\\". Still, the illustrations, images, and interviews contained within are quite compelling, and prove to make this book a good purchase, even if it does have holes the size of Montana in its main focus coverage, (the so-called Golden Age of games in the 80's), not to mention the appallingly thin coverage of anything released past 1991.What it does, it does do well. It covers the major bases and players in 20/20 hindsight that had the biggest impact on computer games and to a much lesser extent, video games. I would have liked to see a bit more information on the Tramiel era of Atari, Europe, The Atari ST/TT/Falcon, Amiga, Spectrum, MSX as well of some pioneering game companies/personalities like Synapse, Big Five, FTL, Starpath, Datamost, Gamestar, First Star, APX, Roklan, Llamasoft/Jeff Minter, Chris Sawyer, and Spinnaker to name a few, but that is more of wishlist for what I'd like to see in volume II than a complaint.I'd suggest that for the next volume (and lets hope there is one), the authors/editors add a few more people to their team that have intimate knowledge of different parts of gaming than the tunnel-vision that passed through the editorial halls of CGW for the past decade or so.

How can Rare/ACG not be in the index? And the phenomenon of type-in listing magazines (e.g. C&amp;VG from the UK, Ahoy from the US) that started off a generation of games programmers.There are some European (Peter Molyneaux) and a goodly amount of Japanese developers in there, but it seems a comprehensive book cannot fit into that number of pages.But it is simply the best book available. And that is why it is worth quibbling with the views that various interviewees put over (e.g. Sonic outclassing Super Mario World - the Genesis game for all its good points is so short!), because it is worthy of a second edition once the industry has read it cover to cover and sent in &quot;helpful corrections&quot;.

The fact is, it's really really nice in a lot of ways. I love the layout, the lavish color photography, etc. And it does TRY to cover everything. Unfortunately, there are just a few too many holes for my liking, and a few too many things that were just glossed over. First of all, it's really annoying to me how they insert this 120 page section on the history of individual computer game companies, one after another, into the middle of an otherwise mixed, chronological history. While computer game history suffers from such less-than-optimal organization, console game history suffers from a lack of sufficiently extensive coverage to begin with. Certain MAJOR consoles don't even get a passing reference; for example, the Magnavox Odyssey 2. It was the sole major competitor for the Atari VCS for two or three years, but according to this book it might as well have never existed. Various other consoles, also, are completely absent or get barely any coverage, particularly those of the 90s. You like arcade game history? Great, you'll be totally satisfied as long as you think arcade games disappeared from the face of the earth after 1985.Anyway, I have my problems with the book, but I don't regret buying it, not for a second.

It covers an incredible amount of information (albeit not in the depth some might want)-But the thing that allows it to rise above in my opinion is the high quality, HUGE range of photographs, some very rare. As games are a visual medium, this is important to me. Home games or arcade games, both are covered well, and the beautiful layout will have you returning to this book again and again.The 'Ultimate Guide to video games' (Also available) goes into greater details, but has very few photos-I prefer this, but I would recommend both to any game fan, as both are excellent, and together they make a fantastic companion set."},{"Title":"High Score! The Illustrated History of Electronic Games","review":"Hi all,This book is a terrific look at the games past and present that have shaped the video game industry as it is today! As the title suggests, much of the book is in picture form with many shots of games (video, arcare, computer) and other material of years past.As much as I love the book, the reason I give it 4 stars is the written descriptions that accompany the book. I personally love history and wish that more written material could have been included. What is presented is adequate but I was left wanting for MORE background info!As it is, the book is still a must buy for any video game fan or history buff. One also might want to check out &quot;The Ultimate History of Video Games: From Pong to Pokemon--The Story Behind the Craze That Touched Our Lives and Changed the World&quot; as well."},{"Title":"High Score! The Illustrated History of Electronic Games","review":"I had seen this book while browsing around on Amazon but based on the description, it did not interest me. However, after stumbling upon the book in a bookstore and having a chance to browse through it, it became almost a MUST BUY.The pictures in the book are outstanding and are pretty much worth the price of the book. Classic game screenshots, boxes, and other historial items from the late 70's until the dawn of the current era of videogames (PS2, etc) are displayed.The book only gets 4 stars from me because while the book title does say \\"The Illustrated History of Video Games\\", the brief written descriptions accompanying the pictures left me wanting for more (I am a slight history buff)However, the book is still a great gift for anyone who perhaps played the games or is a interested in the history of video games."},{"Title":"High Score! The Illustrated History of Electronic Games","review":"This book has become the all-time favourite around the office, despite almost none of us being anything like hard core gamers. Just take a quick flick through High Score's pages and you will immediately see why.I haven't played games for years. I've got Riven, two editions of Myst, once owned SimCity 2000 and kept copies of a 3D version of Breakout and a Centipede clone on the Mac for my wife to bang away at after a hard day at work. And a form of Dungeons and Dragons was popular on the mainframe computer stashed away in the Physics department when I was at art school. I rarely played, but I was impressed by the invention, the creativity so evident in games and gaming, although I do have my reservations about shoot'em ups.Flicking through High Score brought all those memories to vivid life, and reminded me of the good times I had around computer games in the past. The book is an amazing repository of electronic games history, lavishly illustrated with full colour screenshots, storyboards and sketches, packshots, PR photos and developer group portraits, and all those games consoles, cabinets and computers that are now long gone but not forgotten.There is a legion of fascinating stories, too, about companies once at the top of the field but now vanished, high hopes and dashed dreams, amazing inventiveness, and truly remarkable individuals. I have read and reread High Score many times now, and each read is as rewarding as all the others. This is a classic."},{"Title":"High Score!

The book covers pretty much every significant game from the 1970s to today that i can remember and some that i had forgotten. A must buy if you've ever been held in awe by a video game in the last 30 years."},{"Title":"High Score! The Illustrated History of Electronic Games","review":"... Now that it's out and I've had a chance to see it, I'm disappointed, big time. It's not a huge book (300pages) and a lot of what's inside is either fluff (photos of game covers... yawn) or very derivative of other books that came out years ago and did the same stuff better. Maybe I'm just not a big fan of \\"illustrated history\\" books because I expect more from a book than a bunch of pictures that I can find online, and brain-dead thoughts on how nonviolent Pac Man supposedly paved the way for characters ranging from Mario to Sonic to... Lara Croft. Some of this stuff is just insultingly bad. And useless as a history of games.What little there is on consoles is hugely inaccurate and probably tossed-in as an afterthought to make this book appealing. A few huge inaccuracies in stuff about the Saturn (\\"built-in modem?\\" \\"flagship title at launch: NiGHTS?\\" \\"Virtua Fighter 3 for Saturn,\\" \\"Yuki Naka?\\" Huh?) and other systems make for unintentionally humorous reading. One page a piece on game consoles like the PlayStation? N64? But 2/3 of a page for a picture of the cover of Duke Nukem? And how ridiculous is it that these guys keep quoting themselves and patting themselves on the back over and over again.I wanted to give this book one star because it is so sloppy, but it has decent work on computer game companies, if that's what you want, and a few decent pictures, but I want an accurate book about games. This is not it. Not by a longshot."},{"Title":"High Score! The Illustrated History of Electronic Games","review":"A beautiful, magnificent book chock full of sumptious photographs, not just of the games, but of the surrounding artifacts, too: advertisements, sell sheets, internal documents, Atari's trademark registration certificate, Ed Logg's design sketches for Asteroids, bits of design documents of unreleased games, Al Alcorn's hand-wired home Pong protoype...There are also plenty of behind-the-scenes anecdotes.Of course, text-wise, there's not as much detail here as you would find in books like Game Over or The Last Quarter, but it's a terrific (essential, even) visual companion to those two excellent books. Plus, it covers more of the *computer* gaming side of the industry than the other videogame history books I've read.The authors' love of the subject material shines brightly on every page. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Energy Medicine in Therapeutics and Human Performance, 1e (Energy Medicine in Therapeutics & Human Performance)","review":"James Oschman has done it, he's presenting us with the rare gift of a breakthrough understanding of the human condition that includes a profound new theory of the mechanisms of life, one with critically important clinical implications. In prose that reads like a good adventure story he presents with great clarity, comprehensiveness, and extensive endnotes a mind-boggling story from the frontiers of biophysics. Reading merely the introduction to this immensely important book will open your mind to a radically different paradigm of human functioning, one that is laying the foundation for more fully understanding all kinds of phenomena of living processes that heretofore have remained insoluble mysteries.He discusses the nature of scientific revolution and how once shunned and ignored ideas move into the mainstream of orthodoxy only to be replaced in turn. It is time for some of the most fundamental assumptions of medical and life sciences to be examined, time for these new ideas to be tested.Dr. Oschman cites voluminous evidence from scientific journals demonstrating that along with the communication systems we are most familiar with, the nervous and endocrine systems, there are other communication and regulatory systems that can only be understood when we look deeper into ourselves than the realms of organs and cells and even molecules with all of their complex iterations and interactions. We must go into the quantum realm of subatomic particles if we would understand the nature of life.Biophysicists have been doing this in their labs and specialized journals but their discoveries have had little effect outside their field. What Jim has so ably accomplished that no one else has done and which is so vitally important is to carefully scrutinize this burgeoning material with the eyes of a comprehensivist and synthesize it into a new paradigm that sheds light on so many mysteries from the everyday questions of how living organisms regulate disparate functions, generate energy, et cetera. In doing so a number of fascinating questions arise in the mind of the scientifically literate that scream for investigation. So many questions that have resisted our best minds' efforts at understanding appear now ready to be answered, and give rise to the next layer of questions.Life functions cannot be understood so long as the investigation holds to the familiar realms. We now have the tools and with Jim's contribution the theoretical framework to carry our investigation of life and especially human life into the next domain of quantum realities. The practical results, if this work is given the resources it needs, will surely be immensely important. Questions about the extraordinary and well-documented events that sometimes occur in activities like sports, the martial arts, and various healing modalities can now be investigated rationally - and perhaps someday if we do the work these now rare and inexplicable phenomena will be harnessed and reliably produced for the well-being of us all.The evidence for this \\"second\\" nervous system, one that functions much more rapidly, is near infinitely more complex, and magnitudes of order more sensitive than the nervous system we are so familiar with is conclusive. And this system has been right in front of our eyes and under our hands all along, we just didn't have scientific tools with sufficient sensitivity to perceive and investigate it until recently. I urge everyone interested in these vital issues to get this book and spread the word.Randy Mack"},{"Title":"Energy Medicine in Therapeutics and Human Performance, 1e (Energy Medicine in Therapeutics & Human Performance)","review":"Anyone reading the title of this book might justifiably assume it was going to deal with the type of energy manifested in Qi Gong, EFT (Emotional Freedom Techniques), acupuncture, Quantum-Touch and many other energy therapies - subtle energy it is often called.The author does not want to deal with this type of energy, and admits as much, though he is careful to say he does not deny its existence. His book is devoted mainly to electromagnetic phenomena, of which there are plenty, of course, but this is not the healing energy as I understand and use it.I have to give it four stars as it is very thorough in its limited scope; otherwise I would only have given it three precisely because it does not deal with what I see as the primary healing energy, but only with what I regard as secondary phenomena.It's an expensive book and I am sorry I bought it, it may be useful to some, but not to me."},{"Title":"Energy Medicine in Therapeutics and Human Performance, 1e (Energy Medicine in Therapeutics & Human Performance)","review":"So much fascinating information about the human bio electrical system, and how even the tiniest current of electricity can effect it.

This is an invaluable antidote to the unthinking leftist myth that somehow in Chile a fascist dictatorship murdered the liberal, democratically elected president, orchestrated by the CIA, etc... The book, although dry and overly comprehensive in some places, can actaully be an exciting read.On the down side, Whelan's style seems to focus on the rote facts, while leaving the fun anecdotes for the footnotes (of which there are LOTS). There is not as much color or personality here than one would wish unless you read those footnotes.Also, readers should know that Whelan's impecably reasearched and reasoned annalysis of the CIA's non-involvement in the coup has been trumped somewhat by recent de-classified documents. It turns out there WAS more invovlement than reported in this book (although not decisively so, in my opinion). The book ends dissapointingly in 1988 as Pinochet is ousted by public referendum, and one has to look elsewhere for the story of how Chile managed to keep from slipping back into the Socialist swamp.Nevertheless, if you want to get as close to knowing the TRUTH about what happened in Chile, and not just the nonsense rumors that get passed around the left-wing media landscape, this is the book to read. In that sense it is an important history for any student of myth-busting reality."},{"Title":"Out of the Ashes: Life, Death and Transfiguration of Democracy in Chile, 1833-1988","review":"Whelan reviews Chilean political history up to 1989. He carefully traces the circumstances leading to the military takeover in September of 1973. He presents the changes brought by the military government and highlights the process involved in reestablishing and redefining democracy in Chile. His work is meticulously documented. This helps to sustantiate his observations and argument, but at times his extensive use of tables tends to become tedious. I first purchased this book in Chile soon after its publication--almost immediately after the election that occurs at the book's conclusion. At that time I found it to be a facinating reflection of recent Chilean news stories and the perspectives that I was encountering among the people. Now,it would be interesting to have a follow-up study analyzing Chilean politics and social developments during the 1990-2010 time period."},{"Title":"Angelic wisdom concerning the divine love and the divine wisdom","review":"In The Garden of Eden there lies the TREE OF KNOWLEDGE.If its roots could talk this book would be it's byproduct.To explain love, what is spiritual, and God I would have thought impossible untill I read this book.

He alluded to this goal repeatedly in his published books of philosophy, particularly the \\"Varieties of Religious Experience.\\" But, as was the \\"Varieties\\", James other philosophical works such as \\"Pragmatism\\" and \\"A Pluralistic Universe\\" consisted of lectures while \\"The Meaning of Truth\\" consisted of a collection of essays, most of which had earlier been published separately.Late in his life, James tried to realize his project of giving an exposition of his philosophy in his final book, \\"Some Problems of Philosophy\\" which is aptly subtitled \\"A Beginning of an Introduction to Philosophy\\". James began writing this book in 1909, but illness slowed and ultimately stopped his work well before it could be completed. Before his death in 1911, James authorized the publication of what he had written with the note: \\"Say that I hoped by it to round out my system, which now is too much like an arch built only on one side.\\"The book James left is a mixture, with some sections that are suitable for a beginner in philosophy and with other sections that are highly technical. The book is of interest because James clearly wanted to integrate the two primary philosophical ideas developed in his earlier works: pragmatism and radical empiricism.James introduces pragmatism in chapter IV of \\"Some Problems in Philosophy\\" in discussing the relationship between perceptual and conceptual knowledge, where he states that \\"the pragmatic rule is that the meaning of a concept may always be found, if not in some sensible particular which it directly designates, then in some particular difference in the course of human experience which its being true will make.\\" In evaluating the truth of falsity of a concept, for James, the important consideration is the use of the concept and the difference it makes in understanding experience. If the concept is of no use, it is likely empty. James developed his theory of pragmatism at length in his books \\"Pragmatism\\" and \\"The Meaning of Truth.\\"James introduces his discussion of radical empiricism, or pluralism, in chapter V of \\"Some Problems of Philosopy\\" titled \\"Precept and Concept -- The Abuse of Concepts.\\" Pluralism became increasingly important to James as he developed his philosophy and in a work such as \\"A Pluralistic Universe\\" it greatly overshadows pragmatism and may be inconsistent with it. James argues against monism and rationalism, finding them \\"forever inadequate to the fulness of the reality to be known.\\" He maintains that concepts, while useful in understanding reality for specific purposes, ultimately distort and limit its nature. Reality for James is found in the experiential flow -- the stream of consciousness of immediate experience -- rather than in any conceptual system engrafted upon it. His teaching on this point was heavily influenced by the French philosopher Henri Bergson, and it also bears similarity to the phenomenology of Edmund Husserl.In the remainder of \\"Some Problems of Philosophy\\", James expounds upon the significance of his radical empiricism, as he explores problems of causation, chance, and activity. The rationalistic, scientific universe is, for James, a deterministic, fatalistic universe which leaves no room for creativity or for growth. Interestingly, James's discussion of these issues includes some rather technical treatments of the mathematical philosophy being developed by Bertrand Russel and others. James argues that causation, as explained by Hume and Kant, is a conceptual overlay on experience which does not explain causation as an activity analogous to human will. He suggests, as he did in \\"A Pluralistic Universe\\" a theory of panpsychism, to explain the nature of causation and free activity. He alludes to the problem of relating the activity of the will to the physiological activity of the brain (the \\"mind-body\\" problem) but, unfortunately, at this point the book abrubtly ends. The book closes with a brief appendix \\"Faith and the Right to Believe\\" drawn from the concluding chapter of \\"A Pluralistic Universe\\" and alluding to James's early essay \\"The Will to Believe\\".\\"Some Problems of Philosophy\\" does not succeed in becoming the systematic exposition of his thought that James hoped it would be. I don't think it adequately integrates pragmatism and radical empiricism. On James's own account, its treatment of both doctrines is sketchy. But the book is well worth reading for its hints of the direction in which James's thought was going. Thus, this book will be of most interest to those readers with a good grasp of James's thought as developed in the \\"Varieties\\", \\"Pragmatism\\", \\"A Pluralistic Universe\\" and the essays.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"E.

Nesbit, not the trilogy itself!"},{"Title":"E. Nesbit's Psammead Trilogy: A Children's Classic at 100 (Children's Literature Association Centennial Studies)","review":"E. Nesbit's writing is superb. She doesn't preach down or dumb down but fully expects children to be as alert interested, articulate and imaginative as they are if you let them.I read her books at around 12 years old and enjoyed and remembered them. My smart 7 year old has had many of her books read to him a few times but the adult who reads it gets as much pleasure and interest as he does.There's nothing cutesy or predictable. Her stories are about real children who act, feel and think like three dimensional children. Gore Vidal felt,in the Dec.3rd 1964 New York Review of Books, that E.Nesbit was crucial childhood reading. He says it better than me so google it. The Psammead is an ancient curmudgeonly wish granter. The fact of receiving what one wishes for may not be as ideal as one hopes for and the varied scrapes these children find themselves in are interesting. Their relationships as older and younger siblings are dealt with in a real and lively way. E. Nesbit wrote in England during the Victorian era and so the settings and trappings are of the period but her expression of human thoughts ,feelings and behavior are very fresh and not at all stilted. The children are trying hard to live up to the values they believe in and often fall short but find ways to try to repair any problems they have caused or tripped into. E. Nesbit was a very interesting character ahead of her time in many ways (again Google and Wickipedia provide more than I can). Her books teach ethical, honorable and compassionate behavior without a hint of preachiness. They also teach kids to think for themselves clearly and creatively. They are a lot of fun.

Utilizing some of the better companies in the business world today, Robert Fulmer and Marshall Goldsmith offer concrete examples and guides for producing an educational program within your corporation that will increase productivity and loyalty. Globalization of the economy, increasingly complex technology demands, the need to drive corporate strategy, the Internet, and e-commerce - these are just some of the forces pressing today's managers, CIO's and CEO's. Clearly, the very concept of what it means to be any of the aforementioned is undergoing a radical transformation. Now more than ever, corporate leadership is being asked - no, required to master many areas. Training and education programs are a must according to authors Fulmer and Marshall. Drawing on research done with a number of well known corporations such as Johnson &amp; Johnson, HP, GE, Saturn and the World Bank, just to name a few, old style managers are becoming extinct, if not outdated. Based on their research, the authors indicate that today's managers are being asked to substantially increase their participation in shaping the strategic direction of the company, to accepting more responsibility for initiating business change projects and to become more aggressive in introducing new technology into the organization. Corporate universities are a strategic force that any company big or small must invest in, if they intend their managers, CIO's, CEO's and employees to become new-economy leaders."},{"Title":"The Leadership Investment: How the World's Best Organizations Gain Strategic Advantage through Leadership Development","review":"The Leadership Investment gives invaluable insights into the executive development and education programs of some of the best companies in the world.

The poetry is consistantly alive and amazingly free of flab for a book of over 300 pages.Young takes the difficult task of responding to visual art in words and succeeds admirably. The selection of Basquiat as the subject is a suprisingly good one that allows Young to draw on the words and themes important to Basquiat. Young's use of Basquiat's painted slogans ties the experience of reading the book to the experience of viewing the paintings in an unmediated way. Basquiat's esoteric painted slogans work well in Young's clear accessible poems.Basquiat's touchstones of boxing and jazz allow for detours that hint back to Basquiat's life and art. The long poem on the boxer Jack Johnson is particularly good."},{"Title":"To Repel Ghosts","review":"I'm mystified by some of these negative comments, which all seem to be either about some meta-conversation about the book (was Basquiat exploited? sure, but not by Kevin Young!) or its author (how the hell does anyone here know how poor or rich he was growing up?). Those who have actually read the book know how thoughtful, gorgous and rich it is; those who have not yet ought to, especially before writing barely-literate rants against it."},{"Title":"To Repel Ghosts","review":"Do Not Believe The Previous Reviewer. Of course this book is words, it's a book! Young, whose first book Most Way Home was impressive if uneven, has taken quite a leap forward in his poetic life. Basquiat morphs into something other than his paintings, he becomes Young's poems, he becomes a monster and a genius, he becomes something close to mythic.This is not a picture book, you can't read poetry expecting to see images of the dead man's paintings, if you only want to read a description go and get a gallery catalogue!Instead, here, immerse yourself in Kevin Young, a poet who imagines America through the prism of a single, talented young man. A masterful work (that I was lucky enough to see just before its publication, lucky me!). Cheers."},{"Title":"To Repel Ghosts","review":"Let me see if I understand the previous reviewers problem with this book. Much as he states that the words didn't do enough for him, the most straightforward attack seems to be that Kevin Young wasn't poor as a child! IS the reviewer suggesting that only poor people can write about poor people, Southerners about the South? It's a silly line of reasoning that eventually leads to everyone just telling their exact life story again and again. It's a very boring literary legacy that the modern age of poetry and prose believes that just because you say exactly how something happened you've done something profound. The most profound thing an artist can do is to take the incomprehensable world and polish it until we can see and understand it better. This is what Kevin Young was trying to do with the book and the degree of success or failure shouldn't have much to do with whether or not he born in a mansion or a mudhut."},{"Title":"To Repel Ghosts","review":"I wanted to enjoy &quot;To Repel Ghosts&quot; so much.

Although Kevin Young is a fine writer whom I've favored in the past. There seems to be no growth or honesty in his writing. There are passages that are riddled with the voice of someone elses soul. It is not that of artist Jean Michele Basquiat. It is of Young trying to capture himself as something more than Young. I have seen many young writers fall into this dilema. It is unfortunate that Kevin Young try to romantazise a troubled artists life.

I read the book. I did not buy it and thought it was not worth buying. I agree that it is pretentious and nothing more than a romantic way of looking at Basquiat. I also agree that one doesn't need to be poor to write about the poor but the flip side to that is to understand more and not simply romanticise or exploit. Like painter, Julian Schnabels' film adaption of Basquiat(titled the same! I apploud those who champion Youngs' work. They are fighting for a voice that repels more than ghosts."},{"Title":"To Repel Ghosts","review":"I read to Repel Ghosts and thought it was okay. It is a bit phony for someone like Kevin Young who comes from such a privileged life to write about street life as if he had ever experienced it.

This book simply gives you a safe and untrue moment that is in a way enough for many, but not sincere enough for me."},{"Title":"To Repel Ghosts","review":"ive been 'a writer' in the loosest form of the word for omose twenty years now and on occassion i'll pick up some other people's poetry and see what's what... i was standin in a bookstore flippin thru mr. young's 'jellyroll' and instantly loved it! - i didnt buy it tho - i'm cheap and i'm thrifty and 'to repel ghost' seemed to be the better buy for my money (there's like abillion poems in this thang!)...i started off pretty intrigued/fine and dandy...brotha young is hit and miss, but overall, he gives us a pretty good effort...(does his own personal background matter? i dont know... but it doesnt really make much difference to me. being raised 'well-off' doesnt prevent a person from experiencing hardship...)((umm, i get sidetracked pretty easily, so let me get back to my review/thank you!))my biggest gripe with this book is proly more a reflection of my own patience than of mr. young's writing skills...quite frankly, I GOT TIRED OF READIN ABOUT THE SUBJECT MATTER... i found myself moanin & lamentin as i turned each page, hopin to not see either 'basquait' or 'warhol' in print EVER AGAIN... but it never quite played out that way...i do think that brotha young tried a lil too hard to capture basquait's 'essence'... i think i'da rather seen him write about his own interpretations of the artwork, rather than try to tell the painter's life thru biographical poetry...this might have been a much better experience if it was only HALF its length... some of it reads well... other parts are more tedious... but im grown. i guess i coulda stopped whenever i wanted to... but like i said, i'm cheap and i didnt wanna feel wasteful...aint nothin worse than to trudge thru some poetry...(...tho, many people have said the same thing about my own 'writings' ...the @#%&!#&-ers!!!)...anyway...much of this is 3 to 5 star material. my overall rating of '2' is more my anti-basquait-angstisms coming into play."},{"Title":"Machine Design","review":"This book was written for the two year engineering technology student and the actual designer and nails that role.It is direct and covers the topics in an understandable way. The examples are extremly relevant. It should possibly have more problems but the section on the art of design and patents was good except the patent laws have changed slightly"},{"Title":"Machine Design","review":"This book is essentially written for technology studnets rather than engineering students. Though the book covers all the topics that are normally included in a traditional machine design book, it eliminates most of the scientific and rigorous examination of the theories that are required to understand the design process. Thus it is suitable for technology students who can directly apply the formulae without knowing the way these have been arrived at. Many of the formulae are also highly simplified. It would have been better if the book has included more practical information which would have helped a practicing engineer."},{"Title":"Machine Design","review":"My son needed the textbook for class. The textbook is actually out of print so the new looseleaf version of the book worked out just fine and saved us a few dollars."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"Almost all of the overwhelmingly favorable reviews of this nifty book mention how well the author presents Paris, pianosand people. But what about Carhart's (I have trouble with that name), skill as a writer? In the hands of a lesser writer this memoir could have been a sentimental, possibly over technical bore. But as Charles Bukowski liked to say \\"he lays down a good line\\". His prose is clean, fast, to the point---in a very few words he gives you a complete feeling for a new character or an old piano,yet there is great emotion, tenderness,even passsion in his clear writing. Bravo Carhart (or whatever your name is.) Let's have more.ajh"},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"If you love Paris or love the piano--or both--you will enjoy this book thoroughly. The author, an American writer, is living on the Left Bank with his family. His musings, wandering through the neighborhoods and making personal discoveries, are charming and touching. Interwoven are many facts about pianos and their history, but the book is never dry. We make the acquaintance of some of the characters in Thad Carhart's world and enter that world with him."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"This book is a delight for francophiles and music lovers alike. It gives an enormous amount of information about the history and science of pianos along with a charming picture of Paris and its enigmatic residents. It's a \\"must-read\\" for anyone who is in love with pianos or with Paris."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"Memoir or anecdote? This book is most certainly not a novel or a story. And because of that, I started reading with trepidation since I am not a fan of either memoirs or anecdotes.Despite that, this book kept me reading page after page. The author's love for the piano, Paris, and French culture was infectious. I felt like a voyeur in the most positive and virtuous sense.And I knew the author had accomplished his purpose when I found myself, chapter by chapter, wanting to run out and buy a classic piano, move to Paris, and experience for myself all the wonders he was sharing.Gladly, I give this book 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"What virtues could a lighthearted memoir of a man looking for and caring for a piano have? Firstly, through seemingly superficial events and conversations, Carhart manages to convey his deep love for an instrument and the music it creates without trace of affectation. Secondly, he writes well and gives rounded and sometimes quirky character portraits that generates a sense of delight in every chapter. He does this without putting down anyone. Thirdly, his obsession with pianos of every make and provenance gives the book a structure that, while repetitive, can be delightfully comical. Fourthly, this book is well-informed and factual about history and music but never dry. Most importantly, and this is probably the reason why I like it, anyone trying to learn the instrument for pleasure will find a kindred spirit in this book."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"This book is so much more than a book about pianos! It is about an American living with his family in Paris and slowly discovering through the local piano shop a whole world he has lost. It is a shy book: having thrust the piano aside in disgust as a thoughtful child who wanted to enjoy music in quiet rather than be shoved onto some terrifying stage, the author in midlife finds a piano shop on the way to dropping his children off to school, eventually gains admittance and slowly chooses his own instrument to take up again what he had abandoned perhaps thirty years before.This lovely and irreplacable gem of a book is not about the grasping scramble for recognition in an art, but loving that art privately and humbly as the owner of the piano restoration atelier values each instrument he rebuilts for itself. It is a book of reclaiming dreams we felt were lost but on our own terms. One walks through Paris neighborhoods and hears music through windows in these pages. A joy....and not least the drunken piano tuner and the barrel-chested man who carries the piano up the steps alone!Stephanie Cowellauthor of the novel \\"Marrying Mozart\\""},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"I found a used copy in my local Half Priced Books and since it had to do with Paris, especially the Left Bank, I thought I'd give it a try. I do not play the piano, never could, but I did sing so, I'd like to think I had a music sensibility for this book. That being what it is, music knowledge set aside, I have to say it was one of the best books I have read all year. It was such a treat to find and read. I felt that I could feel, hear, & see everything the narrator shared. There are very few like this one."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"I came across an excerpt from this book in a magazine some time ago and decided I needed to read the whole story! I just love this book. From the time I was a very small girl, I have loved pianos, especially grand pianos. My dad taught in a small college when I was a teenager, and in their chapel was a magnificent old Steinway that must have been built in the late 1800's. How I loved to slip into the chapel when no one was around, and \\"commune\\" with that piano.And today my very own precious antique baby grand, an anniversary gift from my husband, stands in my living room...........Thad Carhart's story struck a very \\"strong chord\\" for me. His stories of the various pianos that he met while visiting Luc in the piano shop revealed how each was almost like a living breathing individual to him. I learned so much about these gracious, tuneful instruments from his book: how they are constructed, and the fact that different pianos lend themselves to different types of music, etc. His descriptions of Paris draw me to that city! The way he wove his family life into the story and his dips into his past piano experiences when he was a boy make for a joyous reading experience.From one piano lover to another, thank you, Mr. Carhart, for writing this book!"},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"Don't try to read this book unless you have a passion for the piano, for pianos, and for the wonderful sound they provide. But if that is the case you will love this book loaded with serendipidy finds and beautiful sound. The setting is Paris, the once in a time center for high art and music. The book will inform about pianos and about listening to perfect pitches."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"I've had this book for ages but didn't get around to reading it until recently -- and was able to read it straight through in a single sitting. Wonderful story, very educational -- I enjoyed learning about the different makes of pianos, particularly the Faziolis and the French Pleyels and Erards, enjoyed reading about the author's experience at a master class, enjoyed meeting the quirky characters he encounters -- the tuner who drinks too much (Jos) and the other piano lovers. Although I enjoyed Perri Kinze's Grand Obsession (which I would also recommend), I liked this a bit better; both books are educational as well as entertaining. At one point, the author was describing an occasion when he overheard someone playing Beethoven's Diabelli variations -- which he compared to Bach's Goldberg variations. I was not familiar with the Diabelli variations, so I turned to the back inside cover of the book to make a note to myself -- I was delighted to see that a previous owner of the book (I purchased it used) had already made that note there -- obviously, the book spoke to both of us in a similar way. Overall, I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning more about pianos, Paris, or music in general."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"This is one more offering in the tradition of Peter Mayle's books about ex-pats moving to France. But unlike Mayle, Carhart does not seek to ridicule his French hosts. He has the wholly serious goal of buying a piano and again learning to play it. (The scene where the piano is moved into Carhart's upper-story apartment on the back of a workman is unforgettable! ) After reading this charming book one wants to take piano lessons, attend master classes, to visit Paris. And above all, to read more about pianos."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"A short time ago, I needed some diagnostic work done at my local hospital. The doctor involved and I had a very wonderful conversation regarding classical music, recordings, performers, etc., and what came out of this talk was his recommendation of several books that he thought I would enjoy. Well, one of these books was this one, and I must say that \\"my new musical friend\\" that I spoke with during these procedures, was spot on in all of his suggestions, but particularly this truly lovely story.We are taken into a very private world of a small, nearly invisible wonderland of used pianos, waiting to be re-built, restored, and recycled back out into the world of those who love the instrument for what it is, what it does, and history of individual instruments, etc., and how lives of individuals are changed through this process.I would be remiss if I did not say that this small book is truly one of the very finest volumes that I have ever had the pleasure to read (in this case a paperback edition....but I am currently seeking an original first edition hardback for my library). This is one truly touching, enlightening, and entertaining view of the Paris neighborhood that Mr. Carhart lives in, and photographic clips from his childhood, his private life, interaction with many others, and, of course, his learning about, getting to know, and \\"histories\\" of the many instruments he comes to see in this shop. Woven in also are interpersonal stories of many interesting and wonderful characters...people one would truly love to know in one's own life, etc.I cannot recommend this book too highly....it is one of a very few truly truly wonderful pieces of writing and story telling that I have come across in many years....do yourself a truly wonderful favor, and get a copy of this book and nourish your inner soul with this marvelous story.Personally, I wish I had the financial resources and the connections necessary to get this book made into a movie...what a wonderful story to bring to the cinematic screen for the enjoyment of all, not just the music lovers who would simply be blown away with it, but everyone interested in good storytelling, character development, and, of course, historical documentation....especially seen through the very special vision of Thad Carhart.Who knows, perhaps someone with this ability might read this review and take my suggestion seriously and create a film that would certainly be a great credit to the film industry (if, of course, they follow the book and do not \\"re-write\\" as often happens...this book is a perfect jewel as it sits, and it would be a shame to change any part of it).I would love to share comments with others (below) on this wonderful book....please feel free to leave them here for myself and others to enjoy!~operabruin"},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"If you need a break from heavy reading, this is a great book to consider. While it lacks a real story line, the book is nonetheless engaging and interesting, even for a \\"plot girl\\" like me. It was a breath of fresh air following Hardy and a book about Nazi Germany.I wish the French phrases were footnoted, as I don't speak a word of French.

Maybe not."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"Just over 23 years ago, due to increasing &quot;adult&quot; responsibilities and high school activities, I left the piano behind me. This was done just a few short years after REALLY coming to appreciate the years that my mother nudged, prodded and cajoled me through many lessons. Years later, with children of my own, I promised myself that I would start lessons again when I had my boys start .... six months ago. I've indeed started another &quot;love affair&quot; with the piano, but this new found love has been fanned into an inferno by Thad Carhart's book. I finished the story this afternoon and excitedly passed the book on to my piano teacher -- one of two other people who share my passion.If you've ever played, or even if you have just a passing interest in the piano, you'll find this story enchanting, at least, or, like me, deeply moving.Thank you for a wonderful story Mr. Carhart!"},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"I bought this book on a friend's recommendation. When it arrived, I opened it and cried: &quot;No! It's nonfiction!&quot; Okay, I'm a &quot;novel&quot; addict. But this book is entertaining as well as beautiful. Thad Carhart takes the reader into his own, off-the-beaten-track Paris neighborhood as well as sharing his passion for the piano. All I really wished for throughout was a little less of Thad and a little more of his family. I loved learning about the owner of the shop, but how about more of Thad's personal dynamics? It was, after all, a very personal story, but it ended up leaving out a big piece of who he was. And for me it turned out to be rather more than just a good read. It inspired me to find a piano teacher again. And when a friend told me he'd recently bought a Fazioli, I actually knew what he was talking about."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"I picked up this book several times and put it down thinking that it was too esoteric and narrow for my interests. I finally did read it at the prompting of a friend and thoroughly enjoyed every page, first to last. Instead of the Parisian travel analysis or piano history discussion I expected, I was pleasantly surprised to discover a thoughtful discussion of one man's search for friendship, beauty and truth among other things. I highly recommend this book. Some of the chapters are so good I have reread them several times."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"Grew up as the atonal curmudgeon in a thoroughly musical household -- my mother got her BA in music at age 70 and still teaches piano at age 80 -- but Carhart walks one through the &quot;quartier musique&quot; in such a fashion that even I thoroughly enjoyed the stroll. His rediscovery of the piano begins with his own story but fear not, the book moves briskly away from the personal and captures the reader's attention and interest as Carhart writes of the wonderful complexity of this commonplace thing: the piano. The descriptions of the master classes and the visit to the Fazioli piano factory are brilliant concluding pieces to this very well-crafted volume. In essence the book embodies much of what Carhart has to tell us about the piano. As well he treats Paris and the French with due consideration and appreciation and never condescends to his reader. A delightful read that gains momentum."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"Thad Carhart describes the awakening of his passion for the piano. While the back story is about how Thad meets Luc and re-discovers the piano, the bulk of the text is a review of the history of the piano. Actually, other books cover piano history in better depth, and this is largely a re-statement of that material. The character decriptions are pretty flat. The character of Luc seems pretty mysterious and one dimensional throughout the story, until the end, when we learn that he can tango and is a romantic frenchman after all. Perhaps, some things were lost in translation since the story is told through the Paris and very French experience. At times, Thad seems mostly obsessed with piano construction. The description of the Fazioli piano factory was probably the best part of the book. However, you don't get the impression that his knowledge of the piano literature is really that great. In fact, it's obvious that in spite of several years of lessons, he never advanced beyond the advanced beginner or intermediate level. I didn't get the feeling that he really was connecting emotionally with the music. A much better book for that would be Russell Sherman's &quot;Piano Pieces.&quot; Overall, a light enjoyable story of piano and french music without much drama."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"This book is truly one-of-a-kind. I sat, rivited, reading page-after-page about pianos, the people who play, repair, and worship them. I was delightfully engrossed by minutiae. This book has no real story, but the characters, intertwined with their pianos, are thrillingly alive and compelling. Anyone who loves music will love this book. Anyone who does not understand classical music might do so, after reading this book.Christina Britton Conroy, author of ONE MAN'S MUSIC"},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"If you are a pianist, or ever had a love for pianos and piano music, this book will be a magical, tender experience. From the very first chapter I found myself mystically placed in Paris, smelling the coffee and baguettes, hearing the sounds on the street, and feeling the mystery of the shop that intrigues the writer. I could almost see the shop, sniffle from the dustiness of it, and loved the earnest of the man wanting to enter into the mysterious world of this shop.When at last he does, it's a delight, feeling the energy of all those pianos, the descriptions making a pianist salivate with desire to see them all, to touch all the woods, to play the keys, to learn how to tune for oneself even, to become friends with Luc. And the French manner of friendship, the wine and discourse and even disagreements, it's all so wonderful to read about.I love the background of the writer that he shared, his piano experience, the performance issues, teachers of the past, and I understand his personal, private relationship he feels for the piano that he does not need to share as a performer. This I do understand, but I learned something in performance of piano that makes the difference, and that is that you do hear music better, clearer, sharper, when you know others will hear it. It's one thing to play for oneself, and I grasp that, I love the intimacy and magic of solitude with my piano, but when it comes to the MUSIC - over the piano, performance really becomes a key to a new level of understanding and hearing music truly, like never before.But those are just my thoughts, nevertheless, I understand the journey this man goes through, I appreciate his insights and relations with various people, tuners, musicians, and again, for any pianist or lover of pianos, this book is just a delight, a different world to go into and revel in the almost absurd, obsessive quality of the passion of piano and the music piano produces. Who can understand it but us, the piano lovers of the world?Enjoy this book to the fullest. I know I did."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"As a former library clerk I found this book originally quite by accident on the shelf. I eventually had to buy my own copy so I could read it over and share with friends. Sometimes non-fiction books connote boredom or difficult comprehension, this book takes you into a world of pure pleasure. You don't have to be a music buff nor a pianist to appreciate the quality and happiness you feel when you read this.

That book was A Romance on Three Legs: Glenn Gould's Obsessive Quest for the Perfect Piano. When I stumbled across The Piano Shop on the Left Bank I felt a little thrill and knew I was in for another treat, and I wasn't disappointed.While A Romance was a book more focused around one particular piano and the lives that it touched, The Piano Shop deals more with the technical aspects of repairing, restoring and re-awakening a love of music in Thad Carhart, the author of this memoir. Parts of the book read like a novel, a story about a man finding again his love and pleasure in creating music - and other parts of the book read like a technical manual, detailing the various processes of repairing and restoring pianos (something I was already somewhat familiar with, my own father being a piano technician for many years). There's history - stories of famous composers, performers and piano builders, there's opinions, some of which I share and some of which were new to me. And most of all, through it all, it's easy to feel the love that the author has for music and for beautiful instruments in the way he thoroughly and thoughtfully weaves together the story.Recently, while in Chicago I experienced an old bookstore. I walked in, smelled the musty smell of books that have seen more than I ever will in my lifetime. I chatted with the owner who sized me up with just a few questions and was able to match me with a book that was perfect for me. Much like the wand-maker in Harry Potter (for those of you who are still searching to understand what I'm talking about), Luc finds and matches up individuals to the perfect piano for them.By the time I finished this book I found myself wishing I lived in Paris, just so that I could stop by Desforges and look for myself. I felt an aching to experience, once again, the feel of a perfect action and the sound of a well-tuned instrument. Maybe someday I'll get to go there, it's definitely something that's made its way onto my bucket list."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"Thad Carhart draws you into his little neighborhood in Paris. I learned so much about pianos through Carhart's friendship with Luc the atelier's master!

A short but satisfying read for a wide range of audiences that takes you through a very typical, quiant neighborhood in Paris and a special shop where friends are made slowly and carefully but permenently if you make the grade. The author is skilled at creating the textures, sounds, smells and pulse (very slow at times in such shops) of things in Paris. The story unfolds to reveal how some are truly gems that are given a new home to truly appreciative owners. A marvelous story where you can truly feel the pulse of this fascinating and unusual world of pianos, their craftsman and the musicians like the American-in-Paris author who revel in stepping back into history to continue it with these old pianos."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"I came across this book after playing the piano for almost 2 decades. I studied piano at an \\"Academia da Musica\\" where all the pianos are as old as my grandmother. I hated them. And of course, none of my contemporaries and professors around me like them. We all love the modern Steinway and Yamaha. It's a joy to play on them --- and that's our standard how we view the piano.As my teacher would often say, \\"Pianos are unlike the violins. The more you play on them, the older and cheaper they will be.\\"This book guides me to the colourful world about vintage pianos and learning how to appreciate the old and sweet sounds they give. And of course, recalling my childhood memories of this romantic and mysterious town of Paris --- it's one of the most visited cities in the world. Everybody knows the Eiffel Tower and Arc de Triumph, but how often do we really enter the world of the local Parisians?It's a good book to understand both the vintage pianos and the city from another perspective."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"If you are a piano lover, this is a great book for you. It's one man's story, but he is successful in conveying not only his story, but a comprehensive exploration of all subjects related to the piano: buying one, piano lesson styles, tuning, history, etc. Very enjoyable and informative. If you are not a pianist, it will make you want to learn."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"This is an enjoyable, light-reading book. It is non-fiction structured like a novel, without a plot but with interesting characters, and is well written, aside from a few too many annoying lines of untranslated French (the language is only peppered in here and there - usually it's translated, but not always). The book is the narrative of an American living in Paris (who spent time as a child in France, also, and first studied piano there) who befriends a man who has a shop where he renovates pianos. The craftsman who owns the shop is an authority on the piano and its history, with an artistic yet pragmatic sensibility. The narrator, himself an amateur pianist, buys one of these renovated pianos and begins to once again formally study the instrument after 20 years.The book follows the narrator as he learns from the craftsman and others about the nuances and design of pianos and learns how to play music written for the instrument. The musical talk in the book is of the classical genre but anyone who enjoys piano music (classical, jazz, or otherwise) and has an interest in the instrument itself should find the book worthwhile."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"My piano teacher recommended that I get this book. I had seen it on Amazon's website, but I didn't feel that I wanted to order it. I am so glad that I did. As others have said-it is an easy read. However, Thad Carhart captures the joy that I , and I'm sure others, have felt regarding pianos,music,composers,music history, and taking piano lessons.If you love playing the piano as much as I do you will enjoy this book. I even put a quote from the book on the back of the recital program for my students. -&quot;I was again struck with how deeply satisfying it was to play any kind of music at all on my piano. Emotionally, physically, intellectually, spiritually; its satisfactions were limitless, its impact on my life profound.&quot;I can't say it any better than that. Lovely book!!"},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"In Thad Carhart's engaging memoir, \\"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank\\" (2001), Carhart, an American writer who lives in Paris, describes how his love for the piano was rekindled upon finding a quaint piano repair shop in Paris and its eccentric owner, Luc. At one point after Carhart purchases a used piano from Luc, a baby grand made by a defunct manufacturer called Stingl, Carhart learns that he needs to make a repair to the instrument's pedal mechanism. Luc encourages Carhart to do the repair himself and instructs him how. When the repair is not fully successful and Carhart returns to Luc for more advice, Luc delivers the line that is the title of this review. In the double-entendre, Luc was reminding his customer of the need to avoid too much tension in the pedal mechanism if it is to work properly. But the advice, and the words \\"play\\", \\"soul\\" and \\"machine\\" are at the heart of this book and speak volumes about the piano and about music. How has a large, heavy and clumsy instrument become the way to capture music, beauty and passion in the hearts of many pianists and music-lovers?Carhart's story begins when he chances upon the piano shop and makes the acquaintance of its owners. He soon decides to take up the piano again, which he had studied as a child years before, and purchases the used Stingl baby grand. We learn a great deal about the author, about Luc and his circle, and about Paris and its customs as the Carhart's story undfolds.But mostly we learn about the piano and its magic and about music. There are chapters in the book where the author recollects his youthful music lessons and the piano teachers he finds in Paris after beginning to play again. There are fascinating chapters involving the manufacture and tuning of the instrument, the way the mechanism works, and lore about past and present manufacturers of the piano in France, the United States, Germany, Japan, and elsewhere. An excellent chapter near the end of the book describes the manufacture of the Fazoli piano, probably the most expensive and best piano now made, in Italy. Carhart describes the schola cantorum, a small private music school in Paris where Claude Debussy once taught and where the author enrolled his children for music lessons. During one of the most enjoyable scenes of the book, an elderly tradesman at Luc's shop sits at the keyboard and enthralls his listeners with the performance of a Scarlatti sonata. In addition to Luc and Carhart, a host of characters come to life, including the alcoholic tuner Jos, Luc's ladyfriend, Mathilde, Carhart's teacher Anna, and the pianists Gygory Sebok and Peter Feuchtwangler who appear in the book as leaders of master classes. Luc himself, part hard-headed businessman and part lover of the piano, falls in love successively with many of the instruments that come through his shop, Steinways, Erards, Pleyels, Gaveaus, and others. As Luc evocatively says at the end of the book, \\"You can never have too many dream pianos\\".I studied piano as a child, stopped during college and law school, and returned to the instrument when I went out on my own. I haven't left it since then. I took lessons for an initial few years and then, regrettably, have tried to learn the instrument by myself. The piano has meant a great deal to me over the years.This book will appeal to any serious student of the piano or to lovers of the inexhaustible literature of the instrument. The book will also make a wonderful and unsual gift to those on your list who love or who work with the piano.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"Thank you, Thad, for so beautifully capturing the vast range of emotions that pianos stir in their aficionados. What a gem! This book will become a classic, just like the classic pianos that mysteriously show up and pass through Luc's atelier. I greatly enjoyed Thad's command of language, his keen and affectionate observations of his French collegues (only in France would Thad be viewed as an American, in any other culture a person with such an in-depth understanding of the culture and fluency of language would have been adopted as a local), and the manner in which he conveys the feelings pianos evoke in him. I also enjoyed the growing familiarity between Thad and Luc and the evolution of humour in their discourses. And despite the tragedy of the situation, had to laugh when Thad - with utmost sensitivity - points out how the unfortunate alcoholic Jos would wake up in train stations across France.My preferred piano is the Sauter - I love the warmth and richness of its song - and most generously my mother gave me the piano that once brought much joy to dad. Just like Thad observes so well, one is often greatly attached to a particular instrument because a loved one who has since passed on used to play it. And hearing music come alive again, music that was once played by someone who no longer is alive, can cause strong emotions to surface. Shortly after my father passed on I attended an Evgeny Kissin (sp?) concert, and when EK started playing one of my father's favorite Chopin pieces, I could no longer control myself ... (I guess in a quiet concert hall you just try and quietly blow into a handkerchief). I also remember piano lessons I took as a child in France, and reading Thad's desciptions brought back memories. The teacher I had back then was not as gifted as some other ones in other countries at drawing out my enthusiasm for this wonderful instrument. Thad's logic when looking for an appropriate teacher for his children made a lot of sense.The Piano Shop on the Left Bank is a most evocative book and a must-have for anyone who is affected by the sounds of a piano as well as the beauty of language."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"This book is by a man at peace with the world, and with himself. He's an amateur pianist with limited skills, but rather than show frustration (he seems to have little of that--and he's not afraid to confess embarrassment), he uses this middle view to describe pianos as cultural objects with a range of &quot;characters&quot; that's almost human (and this is especially fascinating because pianos live longer than people). He makes acquaintances with pianos and the people who play, repair, and make them, and the world is a beautiful place from his gentle, civilized vantage point. Almost everyone who has ever played the piano is only mediocre or worse, so this book is likely to be extremely valuable to anyone who's been captivated by the instrument but may not necessarily be able to produce the greatest music firsthand. I recommend this book to anyone who has a little extra time.... history, technical descriptions, and a small surprise of a love story."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"In the \\"Straightforward Instruction\\" to his Inventions Bach addresses the \\"amateurs of the keyboard, and especially the eager ones.\\" In today's music world the amateur is basically a dilettante and concerts of classical music are becoming increasingly events of specialists playing a specialized repertoire for specialists. Yet, historically, it was always the amateur who stood at the center of musical culture in Europe. An amateur, an \\"amator,\\" is a lover-and true love is an art.Thad Carhart's relationship with the piano evolves very much like a good solid love story, from his being seduced by a mysterious Parisian piano shop, from his first coy attempts to outsmart the reclusive owners, from the way he succeeds in gaining entry into a magical world of piano lovers, to his buying of an instrument, taking piano lessons, maintaining the instrument, and participating in piano related events such as house concerts, master classes, etc. With genuine charm and ingenious simplicity the author describes how the nurturing of this love enriches his daily life, how it builds strong personal rituals, generates growing enthusiasm, knowledge and meaning. This cult of affection is not just a short-lived entertainment for Carhart but the enthusiasm slowly pervades all aspects of his life. The author gradually derives more pleasure from his sojourn in Paris. His observations become more adventurous and under the busy surface of modern Paris he discovers a quaint yet very substantial reclusive culture, a secret circle of enthusiasts, a part of society which would always remain hidden from the eyes of a tourist. The persons he meets-piano dealers, piano builders, technicians, professional musicians, teachers-are described as enthusiastic idealists who have preserved and developed the quality, the integrity and the dignity of their respective profession. Through the help and influence of these inspired professionals the author quickly advances from amateur to piano connoisseur and learns to appreciate the unique place of the piano in European culture: It may be an elegant piece of furniture, a rare antique, a collector's item or an exquisitely crafted mechanical instrument. But the piano is also a vital link to the past, and the hands of an experienced pianist can instantaneously revive 300 years of history. Last not least a piano can be seen as a living being itself, complete with birthplace, with an individual history, a time of maturation and finally death.Carhart's \\"gumption\\" and his strong emphasis on quality remind me of Robert Persig's \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,\\" but Carhart in his narration never acts as a philosopher or teacher. He never fails to inspire and, while reading The Piano Shop on the Left Bank, I somehow regretted being a professional pianist myself. Otherwise I surely would have fallen in love with the piano all over again."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"I loved reading The Piano Shop on the Left Bank. Thad Carhart's rediscovery of the piano, set within a Parisian neighborhood, is the subject of this engaging memoir. Thad comes across the atelier in route to taking his children to school. Yet this piano retailer/repair shop is exclusive, and Thad is denied immediate access. Thad eventually gains entry rights and befriends Luc, the atelier's owner. Luc proves to be a great resource of piano lore, and Thad is a most apt pupil (not in the creepy, Stephen King way). Luc imbibes his passion for this instrument to Thad, replete with repertoire, an outline of the evolution of the piano forte, and a \\"consumer reports\\" of sorts for the best and worst makers. Thad in turn shares this acquired wisdom with his readers, supplementing his memoir with references of books and articles on piano construction and history.Thad had played piano as a child. While he had enjoyed playing for himself, he had never liked feeling pressured to perform. As an adult, Thad's renewed passion for piano is on his own terms. The second-time-around pianist will play for himself and for the sheer pleasure the instrument brings him. Luc \\"senses\\" which piano will make a good fit for prospective buyers, and he matches Thad up with a Stingl babygrand. Yet Thad's relationship with Luc and other frequenters of the piano shop does not end with the purchase of the Stingl; it only intensifies. Thad soon realizes that he no longer needs to contrive reasons to visit the atelier with piano shopping and maintenance issues. The atelier is an open door for Thad, along with other piano shop regulars who share a great passion for the piano and music in general.Thad resumes his piano lessons and seeks out an appropriate music school for his two children (he eventually chooses the Schola Cantorum, where the likes of Claude Debussy once taught). Anna, Thad's piano teacher, reintroduces technique and solo repertoire not only to Thad, but to us the readers, many of whom, like myself, are dilettantes. When a piano-tuner recommendation goes dreadfully wrong, Thad must assure Anna that her piano is not beyond repair. Jos, an expert tuner of perfect pitch notoriety when sober and a case of tin ears when soused, had tuned Anna's piano while intoxicated. Fortunately, he is able to re-tune and repair the piano when in a better frame of mind. Both Luc and Thad admired Jos's skill and worried about his welfare. We the readers are left worrying about Jos's well-being after hearing about how this vulnerable man was manhandled when he was caught sleeping on a train w/o paying fare.The book ends on a high note (okay, I couldn't resist the corny pun). We are introduced to Mathilde, Luc's girlfriend, in the latter chapters; she bonds instantly with the inner circles of the Atelier. This posse of piano lovers celebrate their shared passion and inspire the memoir's readers to rediscover their \\"forgotten passion.\\"As I wrote earlier, I really enjoyed and savored this book. I started piano lessons when I was 19, and took lessons on and off throughout college and vocational training. I'm the first to admit that my practice habits were deplorable---a few hours before my lesson and maybe a half an hour after my lesson and the next day, followed by days of neglect and lost learning in-between my lesson times. Unfortunately, I can't afford to take piano lessons at present (the occasional voice lesson is costly enough); yet I feel that now that I am more mature, I would be self-disciplined enough to stick to a regular practice schedule. Ahh well, I still love to hear piano music and especially love live performances. This book only helped to reinforce and expand my love for music and appreciation of this wonderful instrument."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"While this book may not be for everybody, if you're like me and you love pianos you will find it delightful. It evokes wonder at everything from the craft of piano maintenance, to the excitement of hearing the personality of an instrument, to the awe of hearing a Bach or Schumann masterpiece. If you've taken lessons as an adult, you will recognize a lot of the author's experiences. Highly recommended if any of this appeals to you. Probably not recommended if it leaves you cold."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"Following my rule of picking up books with interesting-looking covers, I got [pulled] into Thad Carhart's Piano Shop on the Left Bank within minutes.It's a lovingly detailed memoir and travelogue of one man's rediscovery of a love for all things piano. Set in the picturesque and romantic Left Bank, the reader is soon engulfed in images of walking down cobbled streets, getting coffee and fresh bread, and hearing music sung and played from every window. This book fills up your senses nearly to the point of overload, and leaves you hungry for more.The book centers on Carhart's introduction and friendship with a piano restorer named Luc who slowly exposes and educates Carhart about what makes a certain piano \\"live\\" and why even expensive pianos can be missing their soul. On the way, Carhart manages to navigate some of the more tricky aspects of the insular Parisian \\"vie de quartier\\" and gets a firsthand experience with the quirky, private French nature.There is enough enlightening musical material and information about pianos and their construction to give you something to take away with you as the end comes all too soon, and you begin to look at that largish space in the corner of the living room..."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"Thad Carhart's The Piano Shop on the Left Bank is a disarmingly simple book on the surface that will appeal to piano dreamers -- anyone who has either owned or enjoyed playing a piano. The book is slow in the unwinding of its story, and you can easily put it down and pick it back up at your leisure.The story focuses on the growing relationship between the author, an American in Paris, and Luc, the very French owner of a piano shop tucked away in Paris' Latin Quarter. As the author spends time in the piano shop, his love, interest, and knowledge for this instrument reawaken after years of lying dormant. He realizes his dream to own a piano and begins taking lessons again.The friendly piano shop owner, Luc, has a passion for pianos from all eras. He brings every piano to life as though each large, cumbersome instrument that passes through his shop were a special person. He wants to match up pianos with the right owner. The most shameful treatment is to leave a piano sitting in a corner, unused and unloved.The book also weaves in the beautiful history of the piano, from the piano's origins in Italy to its heyday at the turn of the 20th century. The piano, one of the most popular and revered musical instruments, was at the center of Americans' social life before the invention of radio and TV. There is a sadness as you realize that the golden age of the piano has passed. All piano makers of the early 20th century are in decline, with only Steinway surviving as an independent company.The author leaves us with hope as he describes a new piano maker on the scene -- Fizoli. Fizoli had a dream to build the best piano, challenging the way all pianos were built and starting over from scratch in his development of them. Today, his dream has become a reality as he builds pianos world-renowned for their special soundboards and rich, melodic tone. Ironically, the best piano company is in Italy, home of the piano. And with piano shops like Luc's reviving and fixing up old pianos, the piano will continue to be the world's best-loved instrument. The dreams will live on."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"This is one more offering in the tradition of Peter Mayle's books about ex-pats moving to France. But unlike Mayle, Carhart does not seek to ridicule his French hosts. He has the wholly serious goal of buying a piano and again learning to play it. (The scene where the piano is moved into Carhart's upper-story apartment on the back of a workman is unforgettable! ) After reading this charming book one wants to take piano lessons, attend master classes, to visit Paris. And above all, to read more about pianos."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"Brilliant reading from a musician's point of view - I'd love to find the real piano shop but I'll leave that to my imagination and my next trip to Paris."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"This book was chosen for our tennis club's monthly book and the review from all was \\"enjoyed\\" by all!"},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"My husband and I discovered Thad Charhart's, The Piano Shop on the Left Bank while we were in Paris for a month. Paris is precisely the place to read it for readers are introduced to the lives of people who live in one of the local districts - arrondisements - of Paris, a life that is largely reserved to long-time native residents of the area. In reading, I discovered that we were living in this very arrondisment and although we did not attempt to penetrate the activity focused on the piano shop, we felt as if we had experienced it. The love of pianos is a vibrant theme of the account. On returning to the U.S., I ordered four copies for friends who are equally entranced by Paris and pianos."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"I don't think I've ever used the word charming before, but I think this fits the definition. Delightful too. Light,easy to read, and yes, possibly boring if you're not into piano or music. If you are, I think this really conveys the passion and devotion an instrument can inspire. Kind of made me want to hug a piano.To be fair, it did get a little long, but I really enjoyed it."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"Thad Carhart's delightful \\"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank\\" is a joyous and captivating tale of a man's entrance into the remarkable world of the piano - not especially as a player, but as an owner, onlooker, afficianado, and senstive human being. You meet a wonderful set of characters from the Paris in which Carhart lived and moved, central of which is Luc, whose \\"Piano Shop\\" is store, shop, museum, wonderland, gathering places of good folk with good minds. And all things have a wonderful charm, nostly Gallic, but always ineffable.Read this book because you wish to spend some truly enjoyable hours with new friends, and along the way, learn some things about the Piano."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"Somewhere between a travelogue, a semi-scholarly history, and a personal memoir, Thad Carhart's lovingly feels his way through various meditations on recovering the role of music in one's personal duty to life. The initial two chapter delight in the extreme: one of the most honest and charming portraits of hidden world Paris (unabashedly sentimental but described in such rich detail), Carhart believes in old world etiquette, sincere handshakes, and artisans who live their lives, anonymously, for the sake of a holy craft. This initial story arc -- how Thabad came to access the secret atelier and came to own a piano -- really do waltz along in keenly revealed passages. The kinds of Masonic formalities required to even access the showroom are nothing short of hilarious -- but probably quite familiar to anyone who has tried to negotiate the Old World networks of luthiers and auctioneers.After the initial three chapters -- the purchasing plot -- the book splits off into different directions. Carhart writes something of a Biography of the Piano. Although highly informative, and intricately technical, these sections will polarize readers, who will either find them boring and excessive, or fascinating and detailed. I assume, though, if you're reading a book whose theme is piano building that you'll probably be in the latter category.The other sections, perhaps the least satisfying to me, depict the author's gradual absorption in the Parisian milieu. Their world, without question, possesses an understated elitism. This is not the Paris of the rioting suburbs, but a rather effete society of lessons, leisure time, and extended dialogues. Carhart reminds us, perhaps one too many times, that he was once a corporate shogun who, although fabulously wealthy, felt personally unsatisfied. Hence the trip to Paris to become a writer, and a piano student on the side for augmented expression. So, in short, the book tends to function as distinct vignettes: piano history, personal narrative, and Collette style social observation.Still, at its best, the antique environment of faded sheet music and restored pianos reveal a kind of France that, I suspect, many of us want to believe in. Carhart, always convincing, hits the heartstrings with real skill."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"This book is terrible. It is a poorly written plotless vanity project only held together by the very obvious device of incorporating the historical information about the Piano. The characters are all caricatures, two dimensional stereotypes. Jos the drunk but well meaning loser, Luc the reserved understated sage. Nothing more to them. What was Jos' back story? Luc's? The narrators wife and children are ghosts, mere placeholders. The author talks about discovery but presents none. The character does not grow or experience anything beyond perhaps improving his playing. Even here we get no sense of what that experience must have been like. We are told, but we do not feel. I wasted my time with this do not waste yours. There are more entertaining books about the piano and its history without the nonsense of a plotless and pointless narrative"},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"Reading The Piano Shop on the Left Bank was like enjoying an extremely great meal with a very good glass of wine--only the book lasts longer! Every morsel in the intermix of music, French culture, the dynamics of life and friendship that flowed through Luc's atelier and the detailed history of some of the great piano makers and composers was a rich treasure. It certainly gave me a renewed appreciation for how marvelous an instrument the piano is. I have since re-tuned my own piano and hope to find the right kind of teacher so that I, too, can once again begin my own musical journey --that had stopped so many years ago. This is the kind of book that does not have to be read,(and perhaps should not be), in a single sitting-- but one that you can pick up from one day to the next and savor. I thank Thad Carhart for sharing his music of word."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"This is a wonderful book for anyone who loves music, and in particular, piano, as well as traveling, even if not particularly in France. The author gives a genuine and sincere account of his feelings about his life in Paris, as well as the realities of living in a foreign country, of foreign ways of doing business, forming relationships, and of course, his love of music and the piano.These loves of music and the piano are so evident, so full of life. Some people might be bored or distracted by Carhart's details regarding pianos, however, as a music lover, but one who do not even play piano, I loved reading about the details involved with the instrument.As a lover of travel, and a person who has spent considerable amounts of time in a number of foreign countries (although France is not one of them), partially so that I could learn others' ways of living, I also thoroughly enjoyed reading about real-life details of living in another country.I also enjoyed that unlike &quot;A Year in Provence,&quot; &quot;Under the Tuscan Sky,&quot; &quot;A Cottage in Portugal&quot; and many other books such as these, Carhart does not spend the entire book writing of the difficulties of getting anything done in these countries (even though it's true!). It was nice to read about other aspects of living abroad.I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves music, piano and other culture's and their idiosyncracies."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"Wow! I received this book from my piano teacher as a birthday gift. She said it was her favorite book, and it's now a favorite of mine. The book is captivating in its tale of friendships built around music and the refurbishing and selling of pianos in France. The book is full of life experiences from stage frieght and quirky piano tuners to romance, anticipation and disappointment. The love of music is evident throughout, and well as the love of community."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"I enjoyed everything about this book. From the very first page I enthusiastically followed Thad Carhart through his journey. His thorough description of the music, his passion for providing such incredible detail of each piano enthralled and beckoned the heart of a piano player who had almost forgotten her passion. I must admit that his descriptions inspired my enthusiasm for my own beloved instrument and I have been playing and enjoying every note since I read this book. I went out and bought a copy (I would not part with mine) for a dear friend who has taken up the piano again after 25 years. She is ecstatic!!!"},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"Carhart has produced a wonderful book about his experiences as an adult piano student, the history of the piano, and life among a fascinating &quot;off the beaten track&quot; set of friends and acquaitances he met in Paris. The tales about the old, rotting Pleyel piano, the nervousness and professional musicians and the power of music to draw people together are especially good."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"This book is a warm and sensual experience for anyone who has ever studied piano or lived in Paris...or simply wanted to. I found myself wrapped up on the simple, daily life of a small Parisian neighborhood...engaged in sweet memories and wonderful people and along the way I learned a hell of a lot about pianos, music and the joy of rekindling childhood passions."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"This is such an enjoyable little book to read. In addition to information on pianos and music are the stories of quiet lives lived with a satisfaction and ordinary magic about them. One of the themes is simply the pleasure of playing the piano for oneself rather than in public and especially not in the yearly recitals of childhood. The structure of the book is ideally suited to bedtime reading; chapters just the perfect length that you can actually get through one before the book hits your nose, and chapters that weave stories in alternating threads, so that your interest never lags. This is a little jewel that readers will find themselves talking about with friends, and that does not require any previous personal experience with music or pianos to enjoy fully."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"I've been a student of the piano for eight years. Though I already have a deep affection for the instrument, this novel strengthened my fondness for the piano even more. Carhart manages to give interesting background to the piano and how it works as well as himself, the piano shop, and classical music without sounding dry and scholarly. Though the book reads like a novel, it provides lots of interesting information about the piano, and will make you want to sit down at a piano bench and dash off a couple of pieces.

Apparently it had originally been published in hardback in early 2000 in the UK. I had read Noah Adam's book &quot;Piano Lessons&quot; a couple of years ago and, although not piano player myself, enjoyed the subject. Picking it up off the shelf at the book sellers, this one looked equally interesting -- and was even more so.This book has a wonderful scope of coverage -- it's a story about Paris, a particular neighborhood, and a local culture as well as being a great book about pianos, their history and evolution, etc. Once hooked, I brought the book along as my spare time reader while the rest of the family was touring and to read while on the long airplane flight home. It's a book to savor and enjoy."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"Thad Carhart's book fits into a rare category. It's for piano enthusiasts but it isn't really about pianos so much as about the kinds of feelings people have associated with them. This is a wonderful book and frankly anyone who likes this book as much as I is on my wavelength. He describes so many rare and wonderful pianos including his own Stingl baby grand, numerous Pleyels and his trip to Fazioli in Italy which for piano enthusiasts is like finding the holy grail. I gave this book five stars but frankly for me it goes way off the scale. A must read for a certain kind of adult piano student, someone returning to the instrument perhaps after a long hiatus."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"Yes, of course this little book is a love letter to the piano. But it lives because of the people who share their lives with the instrument: an itinerant piano tuner, a self-deprecating entrepreneur, an accompanist, a teacher, and a hair-raising piano mover. It is also a love letter to Paris from a man who achieved the dream of many Americans to live and be at home in that wonderful, maddening city.I hope this book will be the first of many from this author, he writes with elegance."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"Really, from the very first page something magical happened to me. My mother is a piano teacher and indeed, I grew up in a home with two pianos and the of voices of students from the local university taking singing tuition from my mother as well. Suddenly, experiences from years ago have come rushing back.Thad Carhart's return to the piano has now prompted me to take up piano lessons again. His uncritical delight in and acceptance of a different culture has been an education. I have a profound appreciation for Beethoven, and after reading the chapter on the chance encounter of a performance of his Diabelli Variations, I simply HAD to get a recording of these variations [I settled on the fabulous Piotr Andreszewski recording.] I sort of constructed my own soundtrack to this wonderful book as I went along. I do hope this is not the last I see from this writer.

It's the kind of book you might consider taking in on a rainy day (if you're \\"down\\") or better yet, on a warm day sitting in the sun.I'm a pianist who found the nicest parts of \\"The Piano Shop\\" had to do with the people the author encountered.... my favorite was Jos, the overly-boozed piano tuner, though I did appreciate Carhart's insights into piano construction, reconstruction and the musical elements that are essential in completing the package of what goes into making a fine piano. He introduced me to a term I had never encountered...\\"fall board\\" (the piano key lid).My one objection is the author's continued \\"over fascination\\" with pianos. It really sounds more like a fetish and if he had been able to tone down that part of the book he would have had a more compelling story. Still, it's a book to be recommended, as I heartily do."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"Perhaps I misunderstood that this was a memoir, and not a novel... In fact, it is a piano-lover's passionate (and true) tale of finding the perfect piano, bringing it home, and enjoying it.

The story in this book seemed analogous to a story about a guy searching for his dream car and recalling personal and \\"deep\\" anecdotes along the way. Yes, a piano is unique in many ways, but I don't think Carhart writing 268 pages about this uniqueness was justified. It could have been rewritten as a short story, with all of the interesting facts about tuning, piano history, etc. in an appendix.Again, the entire time I was reading this, I was anxious to finish it because it was so boring."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"One of the longest 242-page books ever published.

It's interesting to try and understand the nuances that go into making or refurbishing a piano. The author, as an amateur pianist, doesn't get too detailed because I'm sure it would be over his head. He does appreciate what goes into it though, which is what he parlays through the book. I imagine it would be a fairly difficult read for someone who's not a musician, but I think the core audience of this book is musicians, specifically pianists."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"Although classified as a non-fiction memoir, Carhart's brilliant work reads like a novel in its vivid character descriptions and joyous reverence for music. The author pulls us into his Parisian existence, in the center of which lies Desforges Pianos, a small, but magical atelier which houses passions for history and music. We follow Carhart on a hero's journey, all the while learning immense amounts about the making and history of pianos.The key figures in the book are characters but not caricatures. Carhart views his life in Paris as an adventure, and the reader is held in joyful anticipation of the next discovery in chapter after chapter. Rather than the Louvre, the Champs Elys?es, and Le Tour Eiffel, Carhart's Paris is a human community brought together by a love of music.Full of technical details and historical interludes, Carhart's memoir is informed, but not burdened by its own knowledge. The author's writing style is fluid and whimsical, touched with a dry humor that keeps his lofty homage to music at a very urbane level. Even those who have never been to Paris or have no connection with music whatsoever will enjoy this book as it is really a story about the childhood passions we so easily forget at adults."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"You can smell the dust and the food down the street and around the corner.

He soon discovers no one can just visit the store, indeed, the owner seems adverse to new customers. One must be referred by an established patron. Carhart works hard at it and finally gets in, meeting the wine-loving, piano-loving owner, and his adventures in piano buying and playing begin. This all sounds like a mystery tale, and it is, but when the music starts and the Beaujolais begins to flow, Paris takes on a new look and feel.I read the work twice, and loved it even better the second time."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"Bought this for my husband as a Christmas present, read it myself in a matter of days.. as a pianist I enjoyed it (the story of an adult fanning the flame of a childhood love of classical music and piano studies), and the insiders look into life in France was interesting. Not a bad read, peppered with piano trivia (I learned a bit about French piano makers, models relatively unseen in the U.S.), a very casual and vaguely romantic plot line.. I loved the aspect of the piano shop owner acting as a &#34;matchmaker&#34; for people & the piano of their dreams."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"I found this book to be charming and it constantly made me smile. I've recommended it to many of my friends who either play or have played piano once in their youth. It's a relatively quick read, and worth the time."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"I picked up this book with never having heard of it before and did not know what to expect. Sometimes books captivate you from the beginning and sometimes they take a while to get into. The Piano Shop on the Left Bank hooked me from the moment I read the synopsis on the back cover.While you can find a piano in many homes throughout the world, they are most likely used as \\"furniture\\" rather than as an instrument. Yet, the piano has a vast history and many connections to the past and throughout the book, the author, Thad Carhart, dedicates chapters to the workings, antiquity and people behind one of the greatest instruments. Though it was interesting to learn how a piano really works and what each particular piece that makes up the piano inside and out is called, I did feel that the chapters dedicated to these descriptions were a bit long. Maybe it's just because I have a short attention span and always need \\"book action\\" to be happening, but while I found it a little boring during these particular chapters, other readers may be extremely captivated by how a piano is built, how it produces sound and who has left their mark on the piano world.Since the book is a memoir - non-fiction - the characters are based off of real people in the real world. The \\"characters\\" we are introduced to in The Piano Shop do not disappoint and really make up the entire book. Carhart introduces his readers to a lover of everything piano and the future owner of the piano shop, past piano teachers that were both good and bad, and even a drunken piano tuner. The people Thad befriends throughout his music quest and his encounters with each of them, which he dutifully describes throughout his writing, is what really makes the book so good. The people in the book are so endearing that Thad even says in his acknowledgments, \`Please don't try to find Luc or Mathilde or any of the others; they are not waiting to be discovered'.Finally, the description of his Paris neighborhood, the knowledge he provides for the instrument he loves and the different experiences he shares with us, that's what kept me reading to the end. I finished this book in such a short time because I wanted to keep reading and I wanted to share it with my sister whom has played the piano for many years and is currently studying French.I highly recommend reading The Piano Shop on the Left Bank by Thad Carhart. Music, Paris, pianos, a love connection between a man and an instrument...who doesn't love that?!"},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"I was lent this book in the first instance and loved it so much I bought myself a copy, and copies for my friends. The only problem was we had just bought a Regency box piano and, though we are not exactly talented pianists, after reading this book we felt that we wanted to rush out and buy more pianos! Seeing as we couldn't afford to and it wouldn't be practical anyhow, space-wise, I think this book should come with health warning! We made sure we didn't come in contact with any pianos for sale for a few months till the effect wore off! That said...buy it, it's delightful."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"I can't even begin to express in words what a joy it was to read this book. Thad Carhart has written a book that should appeal to a broad spectrum of readers that includes musicians, piano lovers, novices and professionals alike. Yes, even those who think a piano is just a piece of furniture will learn a lot, and probably be shamed into getting back to practicing once again. If you already own a piano, wish to own one, or just want to know more about pianos &amp; their history this book is an excellent source of information. Did you know that \\"Fazioli\\" concert grand pianos costs well over one hundred thousand dollars, and that only sixty are made each year, and there are fewer than one thousand \\"Fazioli\\" pianos in existence, and each are essentially handmade? This book is chuck full of information that is so interesting, especially about the 16th and 17th century pianos. There is also a lot of technical information about how piano's work, that explains everything about the instrument, strings, sounding board, etc.Wait, I can't stop yet. Not only is this book full of history and excellent information about pianos, there is a story, too. Thad passes a little piano storefront in his Paris neighborhood each day while taking his two children to their school. One day he decides to enter the shop to check it out, meets the grumpy owner &amp; is rebuffed, but eventually gets the right introduction, (you have to be referred by an established customer) and the shop then becomes a daily part of his life. Here he learns from Luc, the atelier's master, the history and art of piano's. Luc becomes a valuable friend. He helps Thad find a piano for himself that he loves, a Stingl baby grand from Vienna. In Thad's almost daily visits to the store's atelier he meets many interesting and charming people. They all share their love of piano's, music, and life over a glass of wine. It made me wish I was part of their group.The piano has always been my favorite instrument, and it has always fascinated me with it's beautiful sound. Yes, I am one of those people who have become lax, and not devoted enough time to keeping up with my piano playing. This book is certainly an inspiration to anyone who appreciates the piano. A wonderful &amp; fascinating story, and detailed history of the piano. Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"A beautiful musical instrument can be compared to a great vintage wine; one does not need to know all its subtleties in order to appreciate its fine texture, bouquet, and unique taste. Familiarity with art, for example, bolsters one's appreciation of its many forms, and puts one in a frame of mind never to take it for granted. In ~The Piano Shop on the Left Bank~ we are permitted entry into the world of the connoisseur of fine pianos and the magic of superior music. This book describes a re-acqaintance with a love affair of pianos, against the backdrop of romantic Paris and the diverse and unusual characters that make-up this world.An American living in Paris comes across a little piano repair shop that lies almost hidden from the frantic vagaries of modern life. Something about the little shop captures his attention - a spell is cast, and with some persistence, he gains admittance into a secret world for the initiated only - and his journey begins into that predominately guarded artisan society in Paris which the general, foreign public believe only exists in 19th century novels. This elegant text is written with thoughtful care and attention that displays an attitude of mind that is quite rare.Because Carhart is honest about his love affair with the piano and the Classic and Romantic music that we associate with the instrument, Chopin, Mozart, Beethoven and Scarlatte, the reader cannot help but remember personal associations with this world. While reading the text, images from my own past concerning music and the piano rose to consciousness - lying at my mother's feet while she played Chopin, being facinated by the movement of her feet as she depressed the foot pedals and the distinct fragrance of the wood. This beguiling book captures many such images and much more.The book is also unique in so far as the reader receives a history lesson on the piano, from its beginnings in 16th century Italy to its height with the American Steinway to its circular return to Italy, the Fazioli, the finest hand made piano in the world. We actually meet Paola Fazioli in the book and experience the utter majesty and beauty of his creations. To be sure, without question, I felt humbled in the presence of this man and his works of art, following Carhart as he's invited to sit down and play the legendary 'Faziloi 308' - 'the world's most expensive piano' - actually feeling the instruments power of tone through the words on the page.~The Piano Shop on the Left Bank~ is one of those texts which is difficult to put down, but you do so anyway because you want the reading experience to last. And once the book is finally finished, there is a certain sadness that the experience is complete, however, the beauty of a good book is that you can return to it time and again, entering its world.This mesmerizing little book is recommended to any lover of music, no matter what genre or classification. Carhart manages to harness music's universality, its common-shared magic that without, life would be much harder to tolerate. This book will enter, in time, the realm of classic. A pleasure."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank is a beautifully-written book that will appeal to three different, although probably overlapping, audiences. The first audience is comprised of people who love playing the piano as adults. I recently resumed lessons after an interlude of half a lifetime, and Mr. Carhart's book expressed many of the feelings through which I have progressed in returning to pianos and to piano lessons, albeit far more elegantly than I could ever express them.The second audience is comprised of people who love pianos. I also fall into this group; I love pianos for themselves. They are unsurpassed musical instruments, and this book gives you a glimpse at their history as objects as well as their existence as music-makers.The third audience for this book is comprised of those who love to get behind the scenes in Europe, viewing a lifestyle that is hard to find (although it can be found) here in the United States. Luc, the primary craftsperson in the book, is immensely appealing both for his craft (and art) and for his perspectives on the world. He runs his piano shop as he feels it should be run, and because his customers appreciate his worth, he can do so successfully. Mr. Carhart manages to become part of the shop's world, and vividly takes the reader with him.In short, this is an immensely appealing book that makes the reader eager to rush out and find a Luc for themselves."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"An enjoyable read even for a reader unfamiliar with pianos or playing music who gained a better understanding of both through the author's rediscovery of a long-lost joy. I skipped a part or two that seemed to bog down - went back to them later - this is the kind of memoir that doesn't demand a linear read, the vignettes can be picked up and savored anywhere along the way.A small intimate story free of any attempt to impress, Piano Shop earns its keep for sincerity and the pleasure of accompanying the author on a meaningful search - and for the prodding it provides to anyone who has lost touch with what it means to learn and practice an art. An added bonus are the refrains of French life caught from apartment windows, in music classes, in the ateliers of neighborhood shops.All in all, a good book for those times when you feel the need to slow down and reconnect with simple pleasures."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"Unique and delightfulReviewer: Joanna Daneman from Middletown, DE USAThis book may be less meaningful to you if you are not a piano player (I happen to play, myself.) But Thad Carhart includes so much atmosphere and quirky French character in his memoir \\"The Piano Shop\\" that if you like memoirs, especially about life in France, you will be as charmed as I was whether you know one note from another or not.Andre Watts, the great American pianist, once remarked that he is unable to walk in a room with a piano without going up to it and touching it. This urge is not unusual with piano lovers--most of us are pulled into any piano shop, compelled by the same love of the instrument, each one of which is as individual as a person. And this individuality is despite the fact that pianos, as Carhart points out, were one of the first mass-produced items in modern industrial society.Carhart, too, is irresistibly drawn into a mostly-shuttered piano shop in his quartier of Paris. It seems unlikely the shop is merely a piano repair studio--do they, perhaps, sell secondhand instruments? Carhart, who loves to play as an amateur, decides to find an instrument. The crusty owner will hardly divulge information. Slowly, Carhart penetrates the mysterious, very private and French world of the piano shop, and it becomes a part of his life.The shop owner Luc, his drunken tuner Jos, and all the other characters are well drawn and interesting, even tragic sometimes. The book ends up being about a lot more than pianos. This is a real treat of a book to curl up with in an armchair, perhaps with a glass of wine or a cup of tea and find yourself lost in a twisty Parisian alley, peering into dusty windows and wondering how what goes on behind the shutters of a dark Paris atelier.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED (even if you don't play piano!)"},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"I held my breath throughout this enthralling account of Mr. Carhart's rekindled love of pianos and their potential to hold listener and performer spellbound. This is a marvelously written book to treasure for all the reasons other reviewers have already noted, including a fresh visit to an old section of Paris; Desforges, the special piano shop that invites personal introspection and new friendships amid the clutter of a wide variety of pianos and their disembodied parts; the seemingly impromptu lessons in piano history, construction, and restoration that offer wonder in the process as much as factual information; and a revisitation to a boyhood love-and-struggle relationship with the instrument and his teacher's expectations of its mastery. Beyond these attributes that keep the pages flying by, &quot;The Piano Shop On The Left Bank&quot; teases the reader's sense of reality. Is it a novel? Is it non-fiction? At times, I felt lost among the genres, not through any fault in the writing; quite the opposite, the immersion in this volume was so complete for me that at times I had to put the book aside to convince myself that I was not sipping tea and eating madeleines with a very different author. I appreciated Mr. Carhart's openness in drawing the reader into an intimate world that described a sensitive boy deriving tactile, visual, and, ultimately, aural pleasure in lifting up the piano's revealing fall board. And there are so many other moments to savor. Just a few include: visits to Luc's musty atelier and the once-weekly watering of its well-worn floor boards; Carhart's moment of boyhood pleasure at an upright in a hotel bar; the childhood lessons and recitals that caused such anxiety; his solitary delight at the Bechstein in the music room of his sister's school; the bonds he forged with Luc as they went through the process of deciding upon a piano of his very own; his joyful expectation while awaiting its delivery; and the return to his music studies as an adult, this time on his own terms. I hope that this special book will be read widely; it has much to offer beyond the subject of the piano."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"Classified as autobiography, this book is more about pianos than people! Although the reader is introduced to a number of characters in the book, few are developed or described to such an extent that one feels you know them. Carhart himself never really becomes more than a conduit for an introduction to a piano or another character. Luc, the owner of the piano shop, is arguably the person the reader learns most about throughout the book, and that is not overly much.This, however, distracts nothing from the book. As a matter of fact, it tends to enhance the mystique surrounding the piano shop and its owner. The book remains true to its title and the author ventures on all sorts of musical pathways that either lead from or to the piano shop or its owner. It provides insight into the piano as a musical instrument without becoming technical. This makes for easy reading but a good learning experience at the same time. This reviewer experienced an urge to listen to the compositions described in the text and to actually do that, would further enhance the reading experience, but is definitely not a pre-requisite to enjoy the book.The book also provides a little insight into the lifestyle of the Parisians, which is interesting and suits the theme, but it could just as easily have played-off in any of the other full-of-character cities of Europe. It is an enjoyable read and the short almost independent chapters allows one to read it over a period of time, although it should pose no problem to read it in one session if time allows. People interested in music in general and pianos in particular, will find this a worthwhile read, while readers of biographies and/or non-fiction could also try it."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"There is a class of books- of which this is one- that are neither great works of literature nor of great historical, philisophical or scientific import, yet are so delightful that you gladly make a place for them in your library. Books like Lawrence Wechsler's &quot;The Museum of Jurassic Technology&quot;, Rinker Buck's &quot;Flight of Passage&quot; or John McPhee's &quot;Oranges&quot;, that take a little corner of the world and tell a story in vivid detail.This is, nominally, a book about a little piano shop in Paris, and the author's rediscovery of his love for pianos and piano music. Pianists and musicians in general will understand, but you needn't be either to appreciate it- any more than you'd need to be a pilot to enjoy &quot;Flight of Passage&quot; or an orange to enjoy the McPhee book. Carhart paints such a vivid picture of the places and people he encounters that you may well find yourself imagining that you, too, are sitting in that atelier one Friday afternoon."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"Thad Carhart has written a charming story about his love-affair with the piano which should appeal to both amateur and professional musicians. An ex-patriot American writer raising a family in a more remote corner of Paris' Left Bank, he daily passes a quaint piano shop while taking his children to school.Curiosity leads him inside, only to be abruply dismissed by the grumpy owner. A later attempt fares better, when he is be-friended by Luc, the younger man in position to take over the business. He politely informs Carhart that to do do business with them he needs an introduction from one of their customers! As startling as this seems to Americans reading this slim volume, it sets the stage for more than just buying a used piano from a venerable old Paris shop: it proves an introduction into a totally different Parisian way of doing business. Carhart is gradually drawn into Luc's workshop where pianos of all ages and condition repose, waiting to be drawn back to life. Carhart is seduced by the stories the instruments have to tell, and by Luc's uncanny ability to revive them to play again for a new generation. How Carhart finds his own instrument will warm the hearts of all pianists. A long list of characters float in and out of the shop, including a burly delivery man who casually plays a piece by Couperin (standing up!) while waiting to finish his business, to the strange young Dutchman who tunes for Luc, and spends his nights sleeping in railway coaches at various Paris train stations. The story contains alot of technical information about pianos that most professional pianists should know (but probably don't!), and it should prove interesting for others who know little about the actual workings of the instrument. There is a charming restraint about the work, especially about getting to know people slowly and letting the personal information about themselves mature along with the friendship. It proves a valuable insight into the daily life of Parisians, and explains many of the stereotypes about the French being cold to outsiders. All you need in an introduction!"},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"Contrary to some reviewers, I do think this book will appeal most to those who play and love the piano. The human story of relationships between the author, the piano shop owners, piano teachers and other characters is well told and interesting and so is the feel for the real Paris (from a resident's perspective) that we get. However, there is a lot of technical information about pianos as well as a good deal of history of the instrument. I have played and loved the piano for nearly 35 years and really enjoyed those parts, but I have to believe they would be rough on someone who doesn't love or appreciate the instrument, its history and its musical repertoire.The book does make me long for the day when I can buy a home and finally buying the grand piano I've always dreamed of."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"A beautifully written book on an unusual subject;an atelier dealing in old, fine, pianos.The author provides a delicate,sensative and at times quite humorous insight into this world and in doing so gives a sympathetic understanding of the French.I liked the book so much I ordered six copies so I could give them to friends."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"I play the piano, I love piano music, and this is a marvelous memoir. (It doesn't hurt that I love Paris too!) However, I honestly don't know if I would have enjoyed this book if I did not play the piano and love piano music. I give this book 4 stars instead of 5 because, by the end of the book I found myself wishing the author was more emotionally involved in his own piano playing; it seems like he was avoiding that kind of emotional disclosure to his readers - an unfortunate choice. However this is only a small problem in an otherwise great read."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"This is a wonderful book. It is a fascinating weaving of information about the history and physics of pianos, French culture, especially as seen from his experiences with people he met and dealt with, and finally, the author's own young experiences with the instrument and his decision to revive that relationship with the piano decades later. I enjoyed all of three of these segments--each as much as the other.My hope is that ways are found to bring this book to the attention of audience beyond those who play piano and enjoy musid with a passion. Other than those who have been professional French-bashers in the spring of 2003, this book deserves a wider audience."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"If you like Paris, if you've ever wanted to visit Paris, if you've ever fallen in love with Paris--this charming story is for you. Combine Paris with the joy of rediscovering old (forgotten?) passions and dreams, and it becomes almost inspirational. Finally, add a fascination with (or even merely an interest in) pianos, and you have an authentic winner. Well--and lovingly--written, this book is a delightful read."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"Thad Carhart, although born and educated in the United States has spent most of his life in France, first as a child when his father worked in Europe and for the last twelve years by choice. In The Piano Shop on the Left Bank he describes the joy of quotidian life in Paris, the serendipitous discovery of a tiny caf&egrave;, bistro, boutique or in this case, piano shop, that lurks just around the corner. While performing the daily ritual of walking his young children to the neighborhood school he came upon a store front with a simple sign: &quot;Desforges piano, outillage, fourniture-pianos and piano tools. Behind a heavy, gauze curtain lay the interior of the shop that would enhance his life.In the slow, incremental French way in which trust is developed and friendship fostered, Carhart made new friends and rediscovered the joy of music and piano playing. What differentiates the sound of one brand from another, what makes a great piano tuner and incredibly, how one man can hoist a 600 pound piano onto hisback and carry it up a flight of stairs in less than three minutes.But you don't have to know anything about pianos to enjoy the richness of Mr. Carhart's detailed descriptions that burst with humanity."},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"with so many rave reviews, but I found the book a little slow moving and light on substance. I liked it well enough and don't want to be too critical -- it's the author's first book -- but it would have been a lot better at half the length.There's not much to the story, and almost nothing to let you know it takes place in Paris if the author didn't keep reminding you. Some unforgettable characters could have easily offset these weaknesses, but in 300 pages you'll meet very few Parisians, none of them all that interesting or particularly French. (Carhart admits having trouble getting to know the French.) And even for an American ex-pat, he's unnaturally fond of the bygone, of the quaint and picturesque.There's also plenty of veneration of great names, of both piano makers and composers, and readers with a taste for that, or those who like to poke around inside old pianos, should probably add another star.If your piano interests are farther ranging, however, you're going to be disappointed. There's little in the book to indicate anything has happened since the 19th Century or that France of the 1990s could have Carrefour \\"hypermarkets,\\" TV, McDonalds, and Disneyland -- as well as be-bop, blues and jazz.For further history of the piano, its mechanics, innovations and cultural impact, I can highly recommend James Parakilas' \\"Piano Roles.\\""},{"Title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier","review":"While the author has an engaging style, this book seemed quite padded with extraneous material that leaves you with little to remember at the end. There are some childhood memories sprinkled in, some interesting history on the evolution and culture of the piano but the actual scenes in the atelier in Paris are lackluster. Such a book might be enjoyed by piano or classical music devotees or expats wanting to relive their time in France.

The first chapters are quite charming and entertaining as we get to know the main characters and their appreciation for the piano and some of its history in Western Europe, which satisfies the piano enthusiast in me. The introduction of the piano's mechanism is adequate but not very engaging, as the nature of topic, perhaps. After the focus shifted essentially to the author's social life in Paris, however, the book becomes a tiresome series of journal entries and seeming existential profundities. The characters become progressively less interesting as they're examined, but not quite human enough to induce empathy.

Crown was a \\"rising star\\" in the late-eighties glam rock era, only to find fame escape him as quickly as it came. He reaches immortality away from the world of rock and roll when he is tabbed to become the next protector, a race of elevated beings who hold the forces of evil at bay from unsuspecting humanity.

I have an original edition of this book...published in 1903. My grandfather read it to my father, who read it to me, and now I've read it to my children. As much as I loved this book as a boy, I love it more as an adult. This is a story of a shy, sensitive child who endures the taunts of other children, and who runs away to meet the man in the moon, live in the moonhouse, and ultimately to become a man and claim his destiny in the garden on the other side of the moon. Modern kids who live on Nintendo and R-rated movies will struggle at first to adjust to the delicate childishness (in the best sense) of the language and plot, but this is a book that is hard not to love. Read it, and you'll never look at the reflection of moonlight on the water in the same way again. Pyle's illustrations are at least as valuable as his text. They add to the sense of tender melancholy that pervades this book. Pyle fans who are used to his swashbuckling adventures are in for something very different here. The best way for a child to absorb this book is sitting next to his mom or dad on the couch, an arm around his shoulder, listening to the words while studying the pictures. If Pyle's other books are like Wagner's The Ride Of The Valkeries, then The Garden Behind The Moon is like Erik Satie's Trois Gymnopedies."},{"Title":"Garden Behind the Moon a Real Story of T","review":"Every night in the fishing village where he lives eleven-year-old David, a moon calf, sits alone by the shore watching the path of light that stretches across the sea until it almost touches the moon. Wondering where it goes, he decides to talk to Hans Krout, the cobbler, about it and learns that the cobbler has been out on the moon path himself. That same night Hans takes him to the shore and ties to teach him how to cross but David gets scared and falls into the water. Then one day he hears the voice of the Moon Angel down by the shore. Moon Angel makes people happy when they're sad, but he also takes something away from them. He tells David that he, Moon Angel, is the Master Cobbler, and David should have Hans bring him to the moon path again. That same night Hans and David make another trip down to the moon path, and this time David crosses it. Once he's on the other side he discovers that the path leads to a magical world behind the moon where David's adventure begins.When he enters the magical world, the first thing he discovers is the Moon House where the Man in the Moon lives. It's dark and quiet, and every time David looks out a window, he sees something different. A few days later he discovers the Moon Garden. It's a peaceful place with a lot of children living in it. The children begin talking and playing with David, and they don't make fun of him like the children in the village where he lives, because they're all moon calves too. He leaves the Moon Garden, but the Man in the Moon decides that David will be allowed to go there for three days every month. During one of his visits he meets a girl named Phyllis, and they start to become really good friends. They do everything together. But five months later, the guardian of the children tells David that he can't come to the Moon Garden again because he will soon be 12 years old. Children can't live there once they're 12 years old because they have to learn how to become a grown man or woman. She also tells him that Phyllis is a princess, and that he was really sent there to find the Wonder Box and the Know All Book in order to bring them back to the brown earth again. The guardian says he must first battle a giant and then see an old woman in a red petticoat, who will tell him what to do next. Then while in the Moon House one day, David sees the Moon Angel, and passes behind him.Now David finds himself on the shore of the sea ten years in the future as a grown man. He goes to the old woman's cottage and learns that Adam and Eve lived in the Moon Garden, where the Moon Angel gave them the Wonder Box. He told them that it held the greatest joy in the world, the Know All Book, but not to open the box because, if they do, sorrow will come upon them. However, a few days later they opened it and end up captives of the Iron Giant in his Iron Castle. In order for David to find the Wonder Box and the Know All Book, he'll have to travel to the Iron Castle too, but he'll have to outsmart the giant in order to succeed. Will David win the battle, and get the Wonder Box and the Know All Book back to the brown earth?I liked this book because it was very magical and exciting. If I had been David, I would have been sad to leave the Moon Garden, and scared to battle the giant.

The Garden Behind the Moon is without question the best children's book I have ever read. It teaches some important concepts in a way that young children can understand: the reason why David cannot remain in the moon garden, how and why David must do the task he was sent to do, how David completes the difficult but necessary transition from little boy to grown man and how he ultimately brings the Know-All book containing its wisdom about the greatest sorrow and greatest joy to earth.This book along with the Wonder Clock and the King Arthur stories have made my son and I Howard Pyle fans.

It never goes into much detail, just sort of skims over everything lightly touching on the main points. When I read it I felt like I was in a haze, nothing really stood out, so basically it is less than it's cracked up to be."},{"Title":"Garden Behind the Moon a Real Story of T","review":"I bought two copies of this book, one to keep and one to share, because I loved it so much. I've been a Tolkien fan for 34 years, and have tried mostly in vain since then to find other fantasy stories I could love. I suspect, though I don't know, that this story may have influenced Tolkien (it predates him.) If you loved Roverandom and Smith of Wooton Major and Book of Lost Tales, you'll love this haunting story.One thing I especially liked is that the hero of the story, though it's not entirely clear, seems to be a Downs child. It is clear that he was modeled after Pyle's own son, who died young. This would be an inspiring story for a child who is a little different from other children."},{"Title":"Garden Behind the Moon a Real Story of T","review":"I've always loved Pyle's The Merrie Adventures of Robin Hood and was disappointed in how inferior this book is. [...]BR> I have one major and several minor objections. The big one is the (typically Victorian?) view he presents of Death as good and kind. It appears from the dedication that he was trying to comfort himself for the death of a young son, but I still think death needs to be recognized as an enemy.Minor annoyances include the disjointedness of the plot until halfway through, the simplistic, portentous language (with repitition of such phrases as \\"this is not nonsense after all\\"), and addressing the reader as \\"little child\\". (I'm middle-aged and find this last merely annoying - an older child would probably hate it.)There are some good things - the idea that seemingly foolish, dreamy people may be wiser than more businesslike ones, the lyrical beauty of some passages, the fairy tale that comprises the second half, and the plot twist at the end. In one place he may even be adapting the Highland legend of the washer woman foretelling disaster in battle to a totally new use, which would be cool - then again it may be a co-incidence.African American readers may object to a rather patronizing but well-meant story about a slave woman, who is repeatedly called a \\"poor black woman\\". He does describe the horrors of the slave trade (though not too graphically for children over 7 or so) if you can stand the syrup.Extreme romantics may like this book, but I didn't much. It's gloppy."},{"Title":"Quebec 1759: The Battle That Won Canada (Campaign)","review":"Four years ago, the very capable historian Rene Chartrand wrote Osprey's Quebec 1759 in the Order of Battle series. Now, Osprey has decided to publish a campaign title on the same subject by author Stuart Reid. Chartrand's earlier volume was so comprehensive that it seems a waste of time to recover this same ground, and the only value added in this new volume are the 3-D maps and the battle scenes (which frankly, are not very good). Indeed, Reid's Quebec 1759 accomplishes much less in the same 96-page format than Chartrand.Quebec 1759: The Battle that Won Canada begins with a short introduction, a campaign chronology, and a very brief section on opposing commanders. The section on opposing armies borrows heavily from Chartrand's earlier volume, although the author neglected to discuss the Royal Navy's participation. The section on opposing plans is also rather brief. There are a total of five 2-D maps (the Canadian theater of operations, the river war in June-August 1759, the proposed St Michel Operation, the landing at Montmorency on 31 July 1759, and the landing at Foulon) and three 3-D Bird's Eye View maps (two of the Battle on the Plains of Abraham and one of the Battle of St Foy in April 1760). The three battle scenes are: the landing at Montmorency, the storming of the Foulon and the Battle on the Plains); however, the battle scenes in this volume, by artist Gerry Embleton, are not as good as in most other Osprey volumes.Reid is a British re-enactor with considerable insight into the 18th Century British Army, which he showed to good effect in his earlier books on Culloden. However, Reid has a tendency toward a jingoistic, pro-British bias that can be annoying. In the introduction, Reid takes the time to criticize George Washington's &quot;inept leadership&quot; on the Monongahela four years earlier, while noting that the British General Braddock was merely &quot;unfortunate.&quot; This biased opinion does not square with the facts. Reid also infers several times that Wolfe was fortunate in having virtually no colonial troops in his command at Quebec (although he could have mentioned that many British units were brought up to strength by men recruited in America). Reid's recurrent dismissal of French General Montcalm's military talents also seems overtly jaded; wasn't this the same Montcalm who defeated the British at Fort Ticonderoga? The subtitle, &quot;the battle that won Canada&quot; also betrays a narrow interpretation of that event; the French would see it as &quot;the battle that lost Canada.&quot; Reid is certainly knowledgeable about the kit and tactics of British infantry in this period, but his objectivity - or lack of - is a cause for concern.The only other noticeable difference between Reid and Chartrand is that the former bases much of his narrative on the letters of General Wolfe and other official British correspondence. There are virtually no sources quoted from the French perspective. Reid's discussion of the development of Wolfe's final battle plan is a bit tortuous, as most other attempts at analyzing the young general's decision-making process tend to wallow through a sea of assumptions and guesses. No matter whom you read, it is clear the Wolfe arrived at Quebec with only a hazy plan of action (based on ridiculously bad intelligence) and then decided to play it by ear. The landing at Montmorency was a disaster that demonstrated how effective Montcalm's area defense was, as well as the paucity of British tactical options. Wolfe's decision to land below the city was anticipated by the French and most British writers fail to mention just how narrow a margin of error the landing at Foulon was conducted. Wolfe got very lucky and got ashore in strength, but had the French been a bit more alert, the landing at Foulon would have been a replay of Montmorency. While the capture of Quebec in 1759 was certainly a great British victory, it was based far more on luck than good operational planning."},{"Title":"Quebec 1759: The Battle That Won Canada (Campaign)","review":"While credible in basics, this work does little to fully explore the battle. It is sadly deficient in enumerating the activities and names of French regulars and militia. It does bless the reader with photographs of the fix-bayonet sequence of period British regulars (whatever that has to do with anything).Not equal with other Osprey volumes (Ren&eacute; Chartrand's Monongahela for example)."},{"Title":"Quebec 1759: The Battle That Won Canada (Campaign)","review":"While I was reading the book, I was suprised at how little the French side was covered. It was as though the French didn\`t even fight, and just let the British bow them over. I felt that a bit more balanced coverage of the campaign would have been better. Having only the colors of the French metropolitian regiments shown as a representation of the French forces was too little. Of all of the Osprey books that I have bought, this one is probobly the one that I am most disappointed in. It was a fair account of the British side, but even that, I found it annoying that the depection of a member of the 13th Regt as a stand in for other regiments in the campaign was a bit off. There are plenty of North American British reenactors of regiments in that campaign which could have been used. I\`m currently a Masters student and if I had submitted something like this for a paper, I would probobly fail."},{"Title":"Quebec 1759: The Battle That Won Canada (Campaign)","review":"Recently I had read \\"War That Made America - A Short History of the French and Indian War\\" by Fred Anderson. I was particularly taken with chapter 21 - \\"The Plains of Abraham\\". A pivotal battle, two seasoned commanders, events hinge on apparent chance and then both leaders are killed in battle - an amazing story told extremely well. I made a mental note to check Osprey Publications to determine if they have a title related to this battle.My search was fruitful and I purchased \\"Quebec 1759 The Battle That Won Canada\\" by Stuart Reid. Utilizing extensive illustrations the author introduces us to the principal French and British officers; provides detailed descriptions of the various forces and their uniforms and equipment. The focus in this book is the military events, who were the belligerents, what equipment they use, where they camped, how many soldiers each army fielded, how many cannons they employed...you get the idea. This is not a geo-political analysis describing why the British traveled to Quebec in 1759 and fought the French. That very interesting story is told in \\"War That Made America - A Short History of the French and Indian War\\" mentioned above.Readers new to Osprey titles should be aware all books from this published are similar in size to a National Geographic magazine with a thicker paper cover. The page count of this title was 98 and contained many period artwork and drawing reproductions, several full color painting created especially for this title and 3 double pages maps showing troop placements and battle progress."},{"Title":"Harvest of Thorns","review":"In Shimmer Chinodya's \`Harvest of Thorns' we are shown the glories of revolution along with the darkest costs in them. We are torn in thinking that perhaps the cost is too dire and severe. We are shown the inadequacies of humanity. Yet after all this we are given to understand that the cost is probably worth it at the end of the day. Most of all this book is a book about colonialism. The horrors and errors that this system of societal proselytizing created.The novel does not make any great effort to make judgments on its own. The characters are all flawed and no clear good or evil exist. In many ways all the players are neither good or bad. What is clearly evil is the system in which they exist. The colonial backdrop can be easily used to trace the root cause for the worst of the evils shown to us in the novel. Even this is not stated in so many words in the novel. The novel works far harder at showing us the story and allowing us to make a judgment. I am sure the author is confident what our determination will be but yet he allows us to come to this realization on our own.The most interesting paradox in the book is how the realities of colonialism exist even in the guise of freedom. One would think that Colonialist ills would be primarily acted out against the native African population by the non-native Caucasians. This is not necessarily the truth. Although whites do not come across as good or benevolent they come across as more disinterested individuals more concerned about power then about involvement. The Africans who are in power and those who rebel against them act out this same action but without the disinterested separation. Their conflicts are personal and often lack any moral compass rather then an ingrained conditioning by the environment that they are an unwitting participant in.The institutions and traditions introduced by colonialism inherently resist change regardless of the desire of a majority to move onto something else.This is the last question. Even if change is desired and even if the most overt aspects of colonialism are cast down and reviled what change do we move to. With oral histories forgotten, fragmented or distorted and previous institutions long lost and forgotten what form of social order can arise. Unfortunately this is the natural breeding ground for dictatorships and Zimbabwe was no different. Although not detailed in this novel if a natural order is forgotten and only power or its vacuum remains rest assured someone will step into fill that vacuum? Someone always does and Zimbabwe was no different. If takes decades if ever to recover a social norm after a century of colonialist existence. The scars will never go away."},{"Title":"Harvest of Thorns","review":"One of the greatest struggles anyone goes through, is simply to figure out who they are. There is nothing simple about this process, weighing past experience, where you come from, and your family. Shimmer Chinodya identifies the growth of oneself in a more hostile environment, the liberation wars of Zimbabwe in the late 1970's. The main character Benjamin revolts against his families' norms, of living a content quiet life, collobrating with the oppresive system of Rhodesian Apartheid. Benjamin looks to find himself, leaves his school and joins the Zimbabwean liberation armies. The book serves as Benjamins recollection of his identity, his experience in the bush fighting, his personal relationship developed during the struggle, the family he has abandoned, and the oppression he fights. Wrapped into Benjamin's identity is the story of his parents, moving to Harare, their hardships with their new life, their adoption of Christianity, their worries over their son. Benjamin survives to see a free Zimbabwe, but now finds his world and identity unresolved. He is a husband, a father, a soldier, a philospher, and a forgotten hero. Benjamin returns home to juggle his new life and forge a better future for his infant country. Harvest of Thorns story is not only endearing, but accurate and informative. This story fits well into the historical context of the plot, accurately describing the struggle of Zimbabwe's independence, colonialism in Zimbabwe, and the forgotten hero's of the independence movement. The reader must dig deep into their own experience to find themselves at the end of the novel and wonder who or what has made them the person they are today. For this credit, it is clear Shimmer Chinodya's self-reflection into his native country have created a magnificent story."},{"Title":"Harvest of Thorns","review":"Divided into four parts, this prize-winning novel provides a glimpse of the guerrilla war fought against the apartheid rule of Ian Smith following Rhodesia's split from Britain in 1965. It's not very clear why the book is broken into four parts, or why they fall out of chronological sequence (indeed, I am inclined to suggest reading them in the following order: Part 2, 3, 1, 4). Chronologically, the story starts with a young rural girl in the 1950s who is ardently wooed by a polite and dapper young man who serves tea at a colonial district office. The seventy pages of Part 2 tells of their marriage, move to township housing, religious conversion, and raising of three children. By the end of this section, it is the mid-'70s and their teenage son Benjamin is chaffing at their strict rules, and along with everyone else his age, protesting against the oppressive racist government. Here, the author is clearly drawing upon his own experiences, as some of Benjamin's encounters mirror that of the author. The details of township life and daily life under white rule, are all well-handled and quite interesting.Part 2 is the longest (130 pages) and details Benjamin's flight to join rebels hiding out in the border countryside, training, and several years of soldiering with a small squad in the bush. The physical and moral hardships of the guerilla life are given vivid detail here, as Benjamin's squad spends a great deal of time waiting around, with brief bursts of activity, including political education of villagers, ambushes of army troops, fleeting encounters with women, and brutal retribution against informers. In a sense, the events and mood are no different from portrayals of any other bloody guerilla war of liberation, but it's well done and well worth reading by anyone with an interest in Zimbabwe's Bush War.Parts 1 and 4 take place after the war has been won, as Benjamin returns home after several years away. Although he's now a citizen of a free Zimbabwe, he finds that has little practical meaning, as he can't find a job, and has to fight all kinds of administrative red tape concerning his service in the liberation forces. He a freedom fighting hero who not only never gets a hero's welcome or laurels, but also now must live with the things he's seen and done. Further compounding the tragedy is the depressing reality of what has befallen the country since independence under the corrupt Mugabe regime. After strong-arming his way into power, he and his cronies have been lining their own pockets for years while abstaining from any true effort to rebuild their country--disgracing the sacrifices of people like Benjamin."},{"Title":"Big Dreams and Dark Secrets in Chimay: A Novel (Paso Por Aqui)","review":"Wonderful read.

Many great artists to be sure, but Richard Corben has always captivated my eyes and heart. As an artist I was blown-away by his sculptural eye, and unique color techniques. No one has ever come close to creating the same style in their characters.This tale of Sinbads adventures is easily among the best work Richard Corben has ever produced! Rich and sensuous, the characters truly come alive! Jan Strnad has been one of Corben's best collaborators, and the story is tight!If you don't know Corben from Kirby, this is the best book to become introduced to one of the best, and certainly under-rated comic artists of our generation.

Upon his renunciation of a life of aristocratic wealth and worldly pleasure, Tolstoy longed for the sense of true peace that he saw in the peasant class. Thus he embarked upon a search for meaning and happiness through a life of simple faith, manual labor, and poverty. He formulated his own Christian philosophy based on Christ's Sermon on the Mount stressing the existence of the Kingdom of God within the human heart, civil disobedience, and total pacifism. This &quot;law of love&quot; is explored deeply in confessional form throughout the works in this collection. Although this particular approach to living the life in Christ ultimately did not cultivate in Tolstoy the deep inner peace that he yearned for, I feel that many of his ideas can be beneficial to people both within the Church as well as not. Regardless of the validity of his doctrine, it cannot be denied that this is an authentic, genuine, and very human confession of a man searching for God and the meaning of life on earth. Although I personally disagree with many of Tolstoy's points, I still hold his Confession to be a universal work that deserves a fair exploration by all who have ever felt a similar need for inner peace and true reconciliation with God."},{"Title":"A Confession and Other Religious Writings (Penguin Classics)","review":"This is a very interesting book. Penned by one of the greatest writers in history, &quot;A Confession...&quot; by Leo Tolstoy provided me with great insight into his life, work, and relationships. I read this for a religion class in college and ended up keeping it. It is rather short and easy to read. Of interest to those who are seeking truth and those who have found it. It is fascinating to follow him thru his early religious experience, falling away from the church, and coming back to a unique faith in the end. Recommended."},{"Title":"A Confession and Other Religious Writings (Penguin Classics)","review":"Tolstoy was a tremondous writer and intense human being. I approached this work expecting a great deal, and while it was certainly very much worth the effort, it was not as good as I hoped it would be.After acheiving fame, fortune, artistic achievement, family and everything else that most people long for, Tolstoy had a philosophical crisis in which he searched for the meaning of life. This is his chronicle of his despair and search, which ultimately ended in his acceptance of a unique brand of Christian socialism (not to mention ascetisim, vegetarianism, pacifism, etc.,). However, I thought much of the book, especially its sections on philosophy, to be rather poor in quality: either too simplisitc or complex but very poorly worded and expressed. While this book is ok, if anyone wanted to know Tolstoy's later philosophy of life I would recommend his later short works of fiction such as The Devil, the Kreutzer Sonata, and the Forged Coupon. They are masterpeices, while this work is simply interesting."},{"Title":"A Confession and Other Religious Writings (Penguin Classics)","review":"Tolstoy's \\"Confession\\" is a description of my own religious journey.

Why should I live? Is there any meaning in my life that will not be destroyed by my inevitably approaching death? \\"I searched for an answer to my questions in every area of knowledge acquired by man. For a long time I carried on my painstaking search; I did not search casually, out of mere curiosity, but painfully, persistently, day and night, like a dying man seeking salvation. I found nothing.\\" He also took to observing other people to see how they responded to this absurdity and found his peers escaping this problem in either ignorance, epicurianism, suicide, or weak survival. Tolstoy feebly chose the latter, holding on to an obscure doubt, a hope of something more. As Carruth writes, \\"The mind of man, which he did not ask to be given, demands a reason and a meaning.\\" Confession personifies our search for more than just vague answers to questions of meaning which are so vital to man's existence."},{"Title":"A Confession and Other Religious Writings (Penguin Classics)","review":"Next to the Bible, this is the MOST IMPORTANT Book on EarthTolstoy provides revelations about existence, meaning of life, purpose, the root of social horror and only path to peace in a way uncontemplated and unexpressed by this generation. Most of the world, as he says, is caught up in a sheep-think herd mentality, taken captive by a collusion of Scientism and Priest in a horrific flanking and fleecing of a people whose downfall is thinking they are clever, and so easily brainwashed into believing knowledge about materials is intelligence & brings morality, little realizing these are of NO VALUE AT ALL in transforming man's character flaws and lusts, which drive the ruination of earth, man and child in his time and today.Tolstoy gives a singularly unrivaled and stunning analysis of:1.) How the 1% Ruling Class Maintains Power2.) How Scientists Hypnotically Coerce the herd3.) How Scientists and Priests work together to keep people from what Jesus actually taught4.) How it's impossible to be human and not be religious5.) How there is no rival to Jesus' teachings6.) How Jesus' teachings are THE ONLY SOLUTION to the present crisis7.) How before Jesus men were barbarians and how it was Jesus who changed that in cultures practicing his teachings.8.)

There is the Tolstoy whose mind and capacity for creation, whose ability to observe human life and transform it into the highest form of Literature- this is the first Tolstoy. The second Tolstoy is Tolstoy the man of appetite, the sinner who not only endlessly forced himself upon his wife but who took tens of peasant women for his own pleasure. The third Tolstoy is the would- be- saintly Tolstoy of the 'Confession'. This is the Tolstoy who longs for simplicity in life, for renunciation of wealth and sensual pleasure, for a kind of Christian- like total Love and Devotion to others.It is true that Tolstoy's greatest works were created before he wrote 'The Confession' And it is true that as his age his physical powers diminished somewhat. But both of those Tolstoys remained with him all his life even if in diminished form. And this third Tolstoy this holy character who nonetheless made his wife and some of his childrens' life a torment, he too persisted with Tolstoy to the end.Is this to say that the great man was a hypocrite?

How can a person carry on living and fail to perceive this? That is what is so astonishing.

In order to escape the beast the traveller hides in an empty well, but at the bottom of the well he sees a dragon with its jaws open, ready to devour him. The poor fellow does not dare climb out because he is afraid of being eaten by the rapacious beast, neither does he dare to drop to the bottom of the well for fear of being eaten by the dragon.

Yet he still clings on, and while he is holding on to the branch he looks around and sees that two mice, one black and one white, are steadily working their way round the bush he is hanging from, gnawing away at it. Sooner or later they will eat through it and the branch will snap, and he will fall into the jaws of the dragon. The traveller sees this and knows that he will inevitably perish. But while he is still hanging there he sees some drops of honey on the leaves of the bush, stretches out his tongue and licks them. In the same way I am clinging to the tree of life, knowing full well that the dragon of death inevitably awaits me, ready to tear me to pieces, and I cannot understand how I have fallen into this torment. And I try licking the honey that once consoled me, but it no longer gives me pleasure. The white mouse and the black mouse - day and night - are gnawing at the branch from which I am hanging. I can see the dragon clearly and the honey no longer tastes sweet. I can see only one thing, the inescapable dragon and the mice, and I cannot tear my eyes away from them. And this is no fable but the truth, the truth that is irrefutable and intelligible to everyone.The delusion of the joys of life that had formerly stifled my fear of the dragon no longer deceived me. No matter how many times I am told; you cannot understand the meaning of life, do not think about it but live, I cannot do so because I have already done it for too long. Now I cannot help but see because it is the only truth. All the rest is a lie. Those two drops of honey, which more than else had diverted my eyes from the cruel truth, my love for my family and for my writing, which I called art - I no longer found sweet.\`The family...,' I said to myself. But my family, my wife and children, are also human beings. They are in exactly the same position as I am: they too must either live a lie, or face the terrible truth. What do they live for? Why do I love them and look after them, bring them up and watch over them? In order to reach the same state of despair that fills me, or in order to be dull-witted. If I love them I cannot conceal the truth from them. Each step taken in knowledge leads them to this truth.And the truth is death."},{"Title":"American beauty","review":"&quot;True&quot; Baldwin, an aging millionaire, is ordered by his doctor to get out of the Chicago after the 1929 stock market crash takes a toll on his health. His daughter takes him for a drive to Connecticut to visit his birthplace. When True last knew the place, it was a rural farm land that was known for its crops of tobacco. Still having money, he is interested in purchasing a farm house and taking up farming.True remembers his lost love, Judy Oakes. The Oakes were a historic family -- having owned the largest plantation in the county. However, Judy is long dead but her majestic house still stands. Ferber takes the reader into a long journey into the past concerning the history of this domicile. The story starts in 1700, with some of the first Americans to settle in the area. It covers the growth and struggles of the people there: their interaction with Indians, the harsh winters, and taming the land.Ferber has done her homework and appears to know the ins and outs of tobacco farming. She also knows the mores and living conditions of the Polish farmers. The primary focus of the book is a love story set in the late 1890's. Judy's adopted niece (a reincarnation of an Oakes who died from exposure in the 1700's) and her hired Polish man, Ondy, fall in love and try to continue the Oakes' family line.The book was interesting and I found myself absorbed. The characters are colorful and add charm to this book. It certainly wasn't action packed and there wasn't much as far as suspense, but it caught my fancy. I think the book has historical and social interest and I learned about what it must have been like to live in the late 1800's on a Connecticut tobacco farm. The title appears to come from the appreciation of all the events that went into making the Oakes' mansion. Ferber's clear writing is similar to Ellen Glasgow without the feminist overtone."},{"Title":"American beauty","review":"One of my gripes with modern &quot;great literature&quot; is the omnipresent dysfunctional family. Well, this book is seventy years old and goes to prove that wacky families are nothing new in literature. It includes the last of the Oakes clan - early Yankee settlers who are now running away to the circus, crazy or simple. They can't farm their own land so enter the Polish immigrants. What follows is a clash of cultures, bigotry and a little romance.While the plot could be part of contemporary fiction, it is the tone and style that sets this book apart. Some of the writing would not pass any political correctness test. Still, in other ways there is a gentle and calm quality that makes this book quite readable.The good/bad part of the book is that my book group all agreed on it. We found it a pleasant window into a world that was fairly interesting. Still, it didn't incite much passion in any of us, let alone providing any juicy meat for disagreement."},{"Title":"American beauty","review":"Ferber fans will be disappointed by this derivative book.

It was not very flattering for them, and I wonder what they think when they read this book. I am sure they lay it down quickly and don't finish it. But, I know how people talked long before language had to be politically correct and I understood while not necessarily agreeing with the assessment of that nationality. The fact that the author was Edna Ferber lent credence to the book in my opinion."},{"Title":"The New England Image,","review":"Samuel Chamberlain's ineffaceable black &amp; white photographic images of New England landscapes and interiors are vividly captured in this book. This book serves more or less as a summary of over fifty years of Chamberlain's efforts and works published in numerous books, which are now highly sought after. Many of his best photographs are represented in this single volume. I consider this to be the best book of photographs taken on New England because it represents the spirit and essence of the land and the people who inhabited this region of America through the first half of the twentieth century."},{"Title":"The New England Image,","review":"I highly recommend this book because if you are unacquainted with Samuel Chamberlain and his work this book will give you insight and appreciation for his legacy as one of America's greatest photographer artists. This book stands as a compendium to works on his best known subject, New England. Samuel Chamberlain was one of America's preeminent photographers during the early and mid 20th Century. He is conspicuously and sadly forgotten today. I use the word conspicuously because if you every see his photographs as originally published he no doubt would have left you intrigued and impressed by the richness of the work. It is amazing how his black &amp; white photographs could actually capture the colors of the New England foliage. One can feel the sun shining through autumn colored leaves. I think his greatest passion and love was the rural New England setting. I was recently very pleased to see \\"The New England Image\\" back in print and on the bookshelves. The first printing, which was bound and printed by Conzett &amp; Huber, Zurich, Switzerland, 1962 is one of Samuel Chamberlain's best-known and most popular books.

Excellent resource for an architecture student or anyone interested in New England architecture."},{"Title":"The Wrath of Khan (Star trek)","review":"This is my favorite Star Trek movie novelization. It contains so much more than a play-by-play of the movie, but it also delves into tremendous characterization.. In the novel, Peter Preston Engineer's Mate is so much more. The reader also becomes aware that the young cadet is also the son of Scotty's sister. This revelation gives so much added meaning to the scene in which the chief engineer brings in the young man's charred remains after Khan's surprise attack. The theatrical release gives little more than Bones' heart-felt apology. The network television showing (which would appear from time to time on ABC) added scenes which did bring out this important plot point, but this has not been shown for many years. Why not issue a Director's Cut of this a la the original Motion Picture DVD. It would bring so much added meaning to this already classic film."},{"Title":"The Wrath of Khan (Star trek)","review":"This book suffers from the affliction that all novelizations of exciting and dramatic motion pictures must suffer from. It is simply not possible to put the dynamic tension of the Kirk/Khan battle and the sadness of the sacrificial death of Spock into words. In my opinion, some of the finest acting ever done was by Ricardo Montalban in this movie. Playing an intelligent lunatic has to be very hard for the region where it is done well is very narrow.Nevertheless, McIntyre manages to capture enough of the drama to make this book worth reading and a few literary embellishments are added. It is a quick and simplistic read; my passage through it caused the involuntary recall of images from the movie to appear in my mind. Not surprisingly, shortly after I finished this book I was motivated to watch the movie once again."},{"Title":"The Wrath of Khan (Star trek)","review":"With the ability to clone we're that much closer to making a race of Kahn Sighs than we think Forget Jurassic Park for a moment.

This is the region of traveller universe where most adventures were designed for along the almost 30y of the game existance. The sector has been covered twice before. First in a classic traveller module in the usual UWP (universal world profile) database without much detail. Second as an appendix of megatraveller Library data, also in a UWP database. Now SJ games covers them in detail giving a small text for each planet yet allowing many misteries for each game master to develop his own adventures. Also detailed are the major politics between the states and the corporations of the region. The versions differ from each other in world profle and even frontiers, but that is easy to be solved by the Game master. It's an excellent book lacking only a colored map in the old traveller style.

Hopefully someone at SJ games will read this review and solve this..."},{"Title":"GURPS Traveller Behind the Claw: The Spinward Marches Sourcebook (GURPS Traveller)","review":"Traveller is in my opinion the best developed sci-fi setting ever. The Spinward Marches in the Reign of Emperor Strephon are the default time and place, the setting where everyone goes back to sooner or later. They are the heart of traveller.Traveller is an RPG in a heroic setting like a traditional space opera. It is medium level sci-fi, not \\"hard\\"(as realistic as can be) or \\"soft\\"(mostly romantic) . There is plenty of room derring do and so on, but the derring do is made believable by the incredible work gone into drawing up the setting. Though little known, I believe Traveller is a work of genius and can be compared with Dune in complexity and surpasses almost any other work ever written.The Spinward Marches are a vast hostile border between the Third Imperium and the Zhodani Consulate, a semi-civilized area of wars large and small. Here you can find worlds that are the pinnacle of wealth and technology, and backwater worlds where nature still holds sway. This volume gives an encyclopedic description. From the political structure to the numerous business interests, to the various races and ethnic groups that inhabit the region, as well as history both recent and ancient. Added to this are short descriptions of every planet in the region. For any Gamemaster planning a campaign here there is more then enough. And for those like me that don't play but simply devour information for it's own sake there is more then enough. The information here can suit for an epic campaign, or a low key adventure or anywhere in between.

Readers should note it does not compete with the 2003 Bennett and Elliott's Physiology and Medicine of Diving. B&E; is more a physiology of normal persons while diving and is geared to being as factually driven as possible. Bove focuses on medical issues and the physiology that makes it happen, with substantial discussion on diagnosis and treatment of diving illnesses and of ill people [Diabetics, Asthmatics etc.] who wish to dive. There is an amount of cross over between both text, but Bove's expert opinion approach fills the many gaps of facts in B&E.; You MUST own both texts to cover the field in toto.Tip: You can read Bove very quickly by reading the last paragraph or sentence in each section, it summarizes the whole block of text very succinctly.I previously reviewed the 3rd Edition, just received the 4th, and after a cover to cover dissection must applaud its extensively updated chapters notably cardiology, decompression science, treatments and diagnoses, updated appendix on Diabetes mellitus and diving. More focus is made on hydrostatic pressure spikes in the reduction of bubble formation, data that although present in the 3rd Edition, did not get as much emphasis. The timeliness of the updates is in tune with the zeitgeist for bubble decompression models used in technical diving gaining momentum since Year 2000 [VPM and RGBM.]The quality of the book's hardbound production has diminished, as the rugged linen-type cover binding, extant in the past WB Saunders Editions, has been replaced by a glossy paper overlay on cardboard, reflecting a new philosophy of the books publishers, Elsevier, and of WB Saunders to a fading trademark. The print itself seems sharp, and appears more like a laser printer output on 'economy' mode. The cover binding is hastily pasted in my edition, compared to the meticulous tight binding, and near flawless lines of the 3rd Edition. There are over a 100 new pages in this edition. Bookmaking, a dying art!The editing is superb, near typo free, to this reviewer at this time, compare against typos present in 2003 B&E; and the 2000 NOAA Diving Manual. Inconsequential, but reflects the rigor by which Dr. Bove put into crafting this textbook."},{"Title":"Diving Medicine, 4e","review":"My practice is in neurosurgery, but dive medicine is taking up more and more of my time. This is an excellent review of all the pertinent physiology, pathology, and treatments for diving related illness. It builds very nicely on the prior editions. A great resource for dive medical officers, as well as serious divers wanting to build their knowledge base."},{"Title":"The Battle On Snowshoes","review":"I am the author of The Battle on Snowshoes. The popularity of my book speaks for itself: it is the best-seller of the 30-plus French and Indian War titles currently offered by my publisher. Thousands of copies have been sold nationwide, and at this writing the book is about to go into its eleventh printing.I'd like to thank everyone who has sent me letters saying how much they enjoyed my book, and I would also like to thank the talented reviewers who have praised my work.Muzzleloader magazine's book reviewer, George Larrabee, says, \\"It is a vivid, accurate, and readable account.\\" (January, 1998.) Tim Shaw, Eastern States Director of the Cohalition of Historical Trekkers, calls it \\"OUTSTANDING.\\" (Letter, July 10, 1997.) Jim Fredell, in On the Trail magazine, says \\"This book is highly recommended as it fills a long-neglected gap and provides a balance to the information available about the Battle on Snowshoes...Rogers and Langis met four different times. Read the book and find out how often Langis won.\\"Additionally, I was honored to have Nick Westbrook, Director of Fort Ticonderoga, write a wonderful foreword to the book. Renowned historian and author, George C. Neumann, wrote the foreword to my most recent book, French and Indian War Battlesites: A Controversy. Both of these scholarly men attest to the careful and meticulous research of my books.Unfortunately, some anonymous online reviewers are using this web site to take cheap shots at me. I don't wish to dignify their remarks or waste the reader's time by addressing all of them here, but I do defend my work. I certainly did not \\"invent\\" any history regarding this battle: whenever I added dialogue or an anecdote, I clearly stated that \\"perhaps the conversation went something like this...,\\" etc. If those reviewers could not understand that clear distinction, maybe they should go back to school and learn to read for comprehension. Evidently, their biases got in the way of learning anything from my book, and it's a shame they have such closed minds. I welcome the sharing of ideas and comments, but I resent these cowardly anonymous remarks and the lies being spread about this book, and I would love the chance to debate the nameless reviewers any time, any place-if only they would reveal their identities. Their weak claims could never stand up to the evidence and proof of my research and actual experience.They accuse me of \\"contriving\\" the facts, but they can't even get their own facts straight. One glaring example is the reference to \\"Captain Langy.\\" Langy was never a captain; he was an ensign for most of his career, and was promoted to lieutenant just a few months before his death by drowning. Come on, if you want to argue with me, you'd better do your homework!These anonymous reviewers can't accept the idea that after the battle, Rogers and his exhausted remnant Rangers would not have attempted to thrash their way through the deep snow to the top of Bald Mountain, when that would not have been necessary, prudent, or even worth considering. Reviewer of March 8 also says that I do not mention that the climb from the saddle between Trout Book and Hearts Bay is fairly gradual and not inaccessable for a frontiersman on snowshoes.Better review your readings again, guys. On pages xx and 70, I make no less than 3 references to the ease of the Trout Brook/Hearts Bay notch and use that very fact to reinforce my theory that Rogers and his accompanying Rangers probably did take that very route, rather than foolishly climbing up a mountain they did not have to.One reviewer says that I \\"obviously\\" did not consider the \\"boulder studded crevice...\\" as a possible route of escape, but indeed I have, and dismissed it because, again, it would have required the Rangers to climb Bald Mountain.The bibliography was purposely kept to a minimum in this book; the emphasis being on my first-hand experience. However, the major works cited contain references to dozens of other documents. For example, I cite Burt Loescher's works, but I did not feel it necessary to duplicate the sources listed in his bibliographies, even though some of my information surely came from those other documents. The same goes for O'Callaghan, Parkman, Cuneo, and the others. I also did not think it necessary to list every book I've read over a lifetime.You've got to use your head. Everybody knows that even Rogers' own Journals, while an excellent resource, is not completely reliable. Nor are a lot of so-called \\"primary documents.\\" That's precisely why I wanted to test the evidence myself. One of the reviewers seems especially fond of Robert Cochran's notoriously corrupted account. While I am aware of all of the available documents and have read them all, I did not feel compelled to cite spurious works, nor was that the point of my book.To the unnamed critics I say this: there is no one who has ever done more research or field work on the Battle on Snowshoes than I have. If so, I would know it, because I would have seen him in the research libraries, at Fort Ticonderoga, or on the battle site, on snowshoes!I encourage any doubters of time estimates, travel difficulty, terrain, weather, etc., to come to the Adirondacks, in below-zero conditions, with four feet of snow on the ground, and, as my guest, let me show you things that the sentences in a book will never bring home.I welcome the chance to debate my findings with you at a public gathering anywhere, any time. Let's present our viewpoints to the people and let them decide.Of course, anyone without the guts to sign his name would never take the challenge.I stand by my research, my beliefs and my convictions. I have signed my name. Where is yours? -Bob Bearor, August, 2000."},{"Title":"The Battle On Snowshoes","review":"Let me start with a comment to all the contributors of the reviews on this site (myself included)...... Way to go people! We've taken a topic that we all share a common interest in and have a deep love for, a subject that is dear to each of us, and have managed to turn what could have been a friendly and informative dialogue into a sniping contest. Good job folks! During the many years I've known the author of this book, he and his friends have ENJOYED many spirited conversations, many of which took place over winter campfires very near the actual battlesite, speculating on what took place during this fascinating winter battle of 1758. I emphasize the word &quot;enjoyed&quot; because although we often disagreed, we all cherished the opportunity to debate with other knowledgeable folks who also love this subject; folks who loved sharing information and debated with an open mind. Those dialogues were in part what inspired Bob to write his book. I only wish this messageboard experience could have been similar. That being said, I want to make a couple of points and then be done with it. However any readers may feel about this book, there is one very important difference in Bearor's handling of the subject that needs to be emphasized. The Battle on Snowshoes of 1758, just like Rogers' other winter battles, was nearly unique in its circumstances and very different from almost all other battles before or since. If you read any of the literature previously written on the 1758 battle you might note what I feel is a general lack of appreciation for how extreme cold and the general difficulty of movement on snowshoes affected the ability of the battle's participants to function normally. No matter how well-conditioned soldiers are, cold and snow change how they function in an adverse way; any activities become more difficult than during other times of the year. Neither Bearor in his book nor I would disagree with the Anonymous Reader from New York when he states that Rogers and his people were CAPABLE of retreating over Bald Mountain and finding a way down east side, all that is being argued is that that route was the most UNLIKELY of the available withdrawal routes considering the circumstances. My belief is based partially on primary sources. Rogers makes no claim to having retreated up the mountain; no one else who was there, excluding Cochrane, mentions it. While the Cochrane account presumeably originated from Cochrane himself, who was an eye-witness, it only came to light as a third-hand source, from a man who knew a man who claimed he heard it from Cochrane. In addition, it was far from unbiased, in that Rogers' supposed escape down the slide was used to illustrate how he (Rogers) displayed &quot;his usual adroitness&quot; when his &quot;personal safety was concerned.&quot; This is hardly a source I feel comfortable in relying on. When Rogers remained a loyalist during the Revolution he acquired many enemies and the storyteller was obviously one of them. Can you trust him to tell the truth? And how accurate is any third-hand source? My other &quot;evidence&quot; is the same as the author's, it is experiential. I have, like Bob Bearor, snowshoed around and over Bald Mountain many times, including the routes south from the patrol trail saddle and up Bald Mountain from the west side. This route is, just as the Anonymous Reader from New York states, relatively easy, depending on snow conditions. However, for tired, freezing, frightened men, for men in a hurry who have just come from a slaughterhouse of a losing battle, for exhausted men who most likely are snowshoeing in the dark, it is neither a logical route nor an easy way to get home. The Anonymous Reader assumes that both Bearor's and my estimations of what Rogers' people could or could not do on snowshoes is based on our own inability, at our advanced age, to cover the same ground on snowshoes. That's simply not the case. Neither Bearor nor I EVER said that climbing Bald Mountain on snowshoes is &quot;not humanly possible&quot; or anything to that effect. Bald Mountain, depending on the snow conditions, is easily climbed on snowshoes, as are all the other mountains surrounding Lake George. And yes, I've read many other contemporary accounts of such feats; most are during scouts, not during or after a battle nor at night. Bob and I have climbed most of these hills over the years and continue to do so, as enfeebled by age as we are. (And I also run the Boston Marathon every year in well under four hours, soft as I obviously am). To emphasize the most important point of Bob's book again; snow and snowshoes affect everything about this battle. Without understanding how dramatically they change the equation one simply cannot completely understand the battle. To the inexperienced, snow is just snow. To a snowshoe traveller, snow conditions vary in DOZENS of different ways, all of which greatly affect the ability of a man to travel or fight. A good illustration of this fact of life is the case of Lt John Small, an officer who was at Fort Number Four in December of 1759. Small had a small party of snowshoe-equipped men with him and planned to cross Vermont in order to return to the fort at Crown Point. Small's party made several attempts during December and January but each attempt was thwarted by deep, drifted snows in central Vermont. Finally, in mid-february, they were successful - the snow conditions had changed and the heretofore impossible trip became easy. If you read other contemporary sources Small's experience was not uncommon. Snow has a way of inconveniencing people. Terrain that is easy to negotiate in the morning is sometimes very difficult in the afternoon due to changes to the snow wrought by the sun, wind, rain, more snow, a thaw freeze. This same phenomena held true for Rogers and his men. As strong and tough as they were, they were not immune. To sum up, I heartily endorse Bob Bearor's book as a well done addition to the literature concerning the Battle on Snowshoes and especially appreciate and recommend his unique perspective as a writer with long experience as a woodsman and snowshoe traveller. In his earlier review the Anonymous Reader from New York said that the last words on the battle had yet to be written. I certainly hope that he's correct. Perhaps the Anonymous Reader himself will take up the pen, since he obviously knows a great deal about Rogers and the battle. But remember, there's been precious little good history written by anyone named &quot;Anonymous&quot;. You've got to put yourself on the line like my friend Bob Bearor has done. And he's done very well."},{"Title":"The Battle On Snowshoes","review":"I am amazed at the vituperation I found in the reviews of Mr. Bearor's book. I first read this book after reading Craig L. Symond's Stonewall of the West in the spring of 1998. At the time I was not interested in the French and Indian War at all. However, my father rated the book highly, and gave me a copy and encouraged me to read it. I was pleasantly surprised, and enjoyed the book very much. Admittedly, I know little about the French and Indian War. However, this book rekindled my childhood interest in this area, as well as the American Revolution. Furthermore, I did not find this book as badly researched as some of it critics claimed. It may not be in the academic format I prefer, with a clear delineation of primary and secondary sources. What distinguishes the book is that it is the product of the experiental research of a living historian. Many historical myths can be brushed aside by partaking in living history. Ambiguous terms or misinterpretations of primary sources are often clarified when one actually goes out in the field as a living historian.Please note that Mr. Bearor never held his book out as the last word on the Battle of the Snowshoes. It is the interpretation of a living historian, or his practical hypothesis. But, if one truly wishes to surpass his book, then I suggest that his critics sit down and write a book on the battle in the format and style of Lawrence E. Babits's A Devil of A Whipping.A few final words -- I am a native of Ischua in western New York and appreciate Mr. Bearor's comments on the weather. Unlike many of the anonymous critics, I will display my name. I am a historian by avocation (my BA and MA are in history) and an attorney by profession. I am also a living historian in the 4th Virginia Infantry Regiment, Company A of the Stonewall Brigade."},{"Title":"The Battle On Snowshoes","review":"I must admit, I'm amazed at the individuals who seem so threatened by Mr. Bearor's book. One would assume that persons reading this, or similar titles, would do so in the pursuit of truth, and perhaps a fresh perspective. I grew up on Lake George, hunting and fishing through all of the country this book deals with, and I find Mr. Bearor's senario of Roger's escape route, not only plausable but probable. As to the question of &quot;bias&quot; where Robert Rogers is concerned, the fact of the matter is, Mr. Bearor's account makes Roger's escape, under impossible conditions, even more heroic than he recorded in his own diary.

Unfortuately, depsite the enthusiasm of the author and his fellow trekkers in the winter woods, this book is almost worthless as &quot;history&quot;. Its main failing is that it invents so much of the history that needed no invention, history that is otherwise clearly documented and that should have been carefully consulted and analyzed before any writing began.Footnotes, which one myopic reviewer considers a sign of an &quot;armchair&quot; historian, often supply the only evidence to prove an historical point, and verify the truth. But that serious study and documentation should be dismissed so cavalierly by the author's friends is, perhaps, in light of the book itself, not so surprising.A modern day hunter is not necessarily the best equipped person to write a HISTORY of hunting; and modern-day Ranger reenactors, no matter how extensively they have reenacted, are not necessarily the best equipped to write a HISTORY of Rangers.The evidence from the account of Captain Pringle clearly notes that the pursuing Indians attempted to &quot;intercept&quot; the fleeing Rangers after the battle, and in some cases succeeded. That Rogers and a number of Rangers were forced to turn to escape by climbing the mountain suggests such an interception, and one quite far from the battlefield, too. Both pursued and pursuers traveled far afield, and in many directions. Even Montcalm noted that those Rangers who had escaped the Indians would &quot;perish of want&quot; in the wilderness. Rogers' own servant was separated from him as the Rangers fled; and survivors kept trickling into Fort Edward days after Rogers himself returned to it.There is absolutely NO contemporary source that states that the companies of captains Hobbs and Speakman ever wore grey duffle coats or jackets, as the author implies.The author's other reviewers forgive him for putting buckskin hunting shirts on the early Ranger companies; but are uninformed readers allowed this charitable luxury?Rogers implies that the battle started after 3 PM; but the accounts of the battle received at Fort Edward, from the mouths of other survivors, and subsequently recorded in diaries of soldiers there as well as in reports sent to newspapers, clearly agree on the 3:00-4:30 PM timeframe.Rogers' Leap was the name applied to &quot;Rogers' Slide&quot;---as we know it today--- as early as October 1760 by a British officer travelling up Lake George: just two and a half years after the battle. In 1766 &quot;Rogers' Rock&quot; was noted in a land petition. Why? Mountains are not named after men merely because they happened to have hiked in their vicinity.The author of the book insists that climbing to the top of the Rock in wintertime would have been foolish. This is clearly a case of the author not having done his homework--or fieldwork. That some Rangers DID make their way to the top of the Rock after the battle is indeed verified in the testimony of survivor Robert Cochran.As for Rogers himself---and his Rangers in general---crossing and climbing the mountains around Lake George in wintertime was not the challenge that aging modern reenactors evidently feel it to be. In March of 1759, for instance, Rogers and his men engaged pursuing French and Indians in a running battle from the south arm of Lake Champlain several miles westward through the mountains leading to Lake George, and in weather much more severe than they had encountered on March 13, 1758. Rogers climbed &quot;a very steep mountain&quot; west of Fort St. Frederic in the winter of 1756, possibly today's Bulwagga Mountain or Coot's Hill, to make observations; and took a British Engineer to the top of today's Mount Defiance, in the winter of 1759, to observe Fort Carillon. In February of 1758, Rogers rushed a party across the snowbound mountains east of Lake George in an attempt to cut off a French and Indian raiding party that was heading home via South Bay.Meanwhile, other Rangers and even Provincial soldiers were ROUTINELY cimbing the mountains around Lake George in the dead of winter, AND on snowshoes; and no one ever wrote that it had been such an impossible or daunting thing, as modern reenactors seem to believe it was.It is regrettable that the friends of any author should be so partisan as to defend him even when he errs so flagrantly and fabricates so much that he is presenting as &quot;truth&quot;. This is a disservice to everyone involved, including the author; but the biggest loser here is neither author nor friend, reader nor reviewer. Rather, history itself becomes the ultimate victim."},{"Title":"The Battle On Snowshoes","review":"As soon as I read the previous review of this book I felt I had to write this. The Battle on Snowshoes represents a new and different approach to writing history. It is NOT, and more importantly makes no pretensions of being, a typical, footnote-laden historical textbook. What this book IS is a fine and interesting narrative of one of history's most savage partisan battles, a battle fought entirely on snowshoes by seasoned woodsmen, volunteers all, who represented the best &quot;small war&quot; fighters each side had to offer. One problem authors have always encountered when writing about Rogers or other partisans of that era has been a relative lack of detailed primary source material. The participants of that 1758 winter battle left only a very few records, the most complete being Rogers' own accounts (an after-action report and a similar version in his famous 1765 journal) and a letter by an English officer/volunteer who was captured after the battle. Other contemporary accounts are a few short, anecdotal interviews with the battle's veterans and second hand reports by various officers. All are maddeningly sketchy and devoid of good detail. That the author has carefully studied the primary sources and has full command of all things relating to the battle there is NO question. He also clearly explains to his reader that he has tied together the rather large gaps in the documentable story with details that he speculates MAY have occured. He does not deny using this process; rather, that is one of the stated purposes of the book, to try to present a fuller story than the participants have left us. If the author were a typical armchair historian I would not trust him to do this, however he is FAR from your typical writer. Bob Bearor is a very fine woodsman, a respected reenactor, a serious student of the French &amp; Indian War, a former paratrooper, has longtime experience with flintlock firearms and has spent years on snowshoes doing long-distance camping trips in the Adirondacks, carrying a pack. The forementioned experience is a good pedigree, indeed the ONLY pedigree, that enables Bob to write about this battle the way he's written. And he's done a wonderful job of it. To address anonymous previous reviewer's complaints: Bearor does NOT claim there was no pursuit of Rogers. We know there WAS at least a short pursuit. Bearor simply claims that he believes the pursuit was very short due to the nature of the circumstances. The source for clothing for Speakman's company is from the Massachusetts State Archives - records of articles issued to that company upon mustering in 1756. ALL serious students of Rogers know that Goodenough's journal was fiction, (but Remington DID study his primary sources....). The battle did NOT start at 3pm as the reviewer claims. Rogers himself states that he waited until 3pm to let the French morning patrol pass by, then marched a mile and a half further north before encountering Langis' lead elements. Moving that distance TACTICALLY on snowshoes would take at least an hour. Any old infantryman could do the math. As regards Rogers' famous &quot;slide&quot;; yes, it COULD have happened, certainly. But after having been over that ground many times in winter on snowshoes I agree with the author of this book - I SERIOUSLY doubt it occured. The terrain is not easy and it makes no sense to pick a difficult and long retreat route when it's dark, when you're cold, exhausted, frightened, and in a hurry. And it also makes no sense to leave a trodden down snowshoe trail to scale a mountain when you're being pursued, and to break trail for those very pursuers. A suggestion for the previous reviewer - Close your books, take off your glasses and try going out-of-doors sometime in winter - you'll find it an illuminating experience and might even enjoy it. Try actually DOING some of the things that Rogers writes about. Perhaps even strap on a pair of snowshoes and try sliding down that crevace you mention on Bald Mountain. I guarantee you WILL get to the bottom in a hurry! And to all prospective readers: Bob Bearor's book is NOT your typical history book - if you love footnotes don't bother with it. History is usually written by watchers, not doers. this book is different. It was written by the sort of person who is usually involved in MAKING history, not watching it. If you want to know what it was really like to be at that long-ago snowshoe fight in 1758, get yourself a copy!"},{"Title":"The Battle On Snowshoes","review":"I found, The Battle on Snowshoes, a good read. I was impressed with the author's knowledge of Ens. Langis. This partisan fighter has been mentioned favorably in other accounts I have read on this topic, and I enjoyed the expanded insight that Mr. Bearor provided. Langis would appear to be one of those fairly unknown participants of the French and Indian War that deserves more than a passing glance. It was quite clear that the author holds Langis in high regard; justifiably so in my opinion. It was even more clear that Mr. Bearor feels that Langis has been slighted by the historical record, and I can't say that I disagree, however, I do believe that the French and Indian War in general has been given less than its historical due. Mr. Bearor, using his knowledge of Langis, skillfully related how the ensign probably conducted himself during the battle. Primary source documents can never fill in all the blanks; however, an author who possesses an intimate knowledge of his subject material can go a long way in presenting a reasonable recreation of what actually happened on the battle field. I also give Mr. Bearor high grades for actually trying to put himself in the shoes-or should I say, snowshoes-of the participants by attempting to relive their experience in the field.I did find one element of Mr. Bearor's record of the battle that differed from other accounts I have read. The author stated that the Ranger ambush which initiated this battle was sprung too early due to the premature firing by a nervous Ranger. I would like to know what his source was for that statement. The other accounts I have read indicated that Rogers fired the signal shot.If there was a negative contained within the pages of, The Battle on Snowshoes, it would be with regard to certain depictions of Robert Rogers. I felt that the author was perhaps a little harsh when describing the later events of Rogers's life. The historical record indicates that Rogers was very much mistreated by both Thomas Gage and Sir William Johnson for a variety of reasons centering on both men's self-interest. There is no doubt that this mistreatment caused Rogers many problems and may have pushed him toward desperate straights. The study of history does involve a certain amount of personal perception, and nothing that I have written regarding Rogers should dissuade anyone from reading this fine book."},{"Title":"The Battle On Snowshoes","review":"The author deserves an A for enthusiasm; but the book itself is so full of misinformation, and is so replete with errors in interpreting the very few sources he did consult, that it is almost worthless as history. More amazing still is the author's constantly expressed hubris in the face of such poor scholarship. It would require a book of at least equal length to rectify the damage done to the actual history of the event in this 95-page work. The book claims, for instance, that the Indians would not have chased the surviving Rangers after the battle, considering the difficulty of the snowbound terrain; yet Robert Rogers himself says that not only were the fleeing Rangers chased by the Indians, but many of them were eventually captured. British Captain Henry Pringle, who was also there, noted actually seeing the Indians engaged in this pursuit. The author asserts that the earlier companies of Rogers' Rangers were clothed in &quot;buckskin hunting shirts&quot;, but offers no evidence for this. He goes on to say that the companies of Hobbs and Speakman were clothed in grey duffle, his only source for this being nothing more than a &quot;memoir&quot; by a fictional Ranger penned by the very imaginative Frederic Remington. He gives a physical description of Rogers as having &quot;thick lips and a large protruding nose&quot;, but offers no primary source for this unless it is the mezzotint &quot;portrait&quot; of Rogers produced in London in 1776, which art historians agree was completely fraudulent in all respects, from facial features to dress. The author is frequently inventing scenes and moments out of his head: e.g., having the lead Indian of the French and Indian advance guard suddenly stop in his tracks on the Bernetz Riviere. &quot;Why he stopped is still a mystery&quot;, writes the author; but offers no source for this. He gives us the thoughts of the leaders every now and then, and even a piece of invented dialogue, in the best tradition of a novel writer; yet this book is being presented as history. He offers 4:00 pm as the time of the start of the battle, when the actual accounts agree that it began at 3 o'clock and ended at 4:30. He also completely invents a vignette of three Canadian marksmen downing at the same time, under the direction of Captain Langy, a huge bearded Ranger, whose &quot;scalp would not be worth taking&quot;; yet the author claims this is &quot;history&quot;. He says that Rogers would never have attempted to climb up Bald Mountain in his retreat; yet he does not mention that the climb from the saddle between Trout Brook and Hearts Bay is fairly gradual, not inaccessible for a frontiersman on snowshoes; and that even if Rogers did not make the remarkable feat of going down via the &quot;Slide&quot;, there is a quick trail down the deep crevice at the southern end of Rogers' Rock---with painted boulders marking it today---that would have brought him down to the lake in a matter of minutes. Rogers was not unversed in climbing the mountains around lakes George and Champlain in the wintertime: as chief commander of Rangers for the British Army in the region, that, essentially, was part of his job. As a 24 year-old 6-footer of uncommon strength for his day, the climb would not have been an unusual challenge for him. The author cannot believe that Rogers or any Ranger would have thrown away his coat that cold night; but he ignores the evidence that states this is what both men and officers did do during the retreat, to make them run faster: a common frontier practice when fleeing from a pursuing foe. There are so many other points to criticize here, that to do so would be overkill. The abovementioned examples ought to suffice as a warning to any potential reader. The last word on this battle has yet to be written; and this book's only distinction is that it not only distorts and invents much of the history, but manages to misrepresent those few chunks of actual documentation that the author did take the time time to consult."},{"Title":"The Battle On Snowshoes","review":"I must admit, I'm amazed at the individuals who seem so threatened by Mr. Bearor's book.

Not even the partisan praise from the book's editor should convince would-be readers that what they are about to read is something they can rely on as factual. Only a thoughtful re-write, devoid of the author's arrogant assumptions and contrived &quot;facts&quot;, will rectify the damage done to the history of the event by this book.These reviews have not been written to disparage the author's character or intent. Rather, to present an opposing view born of experience and study in the very same area. This includes actual first-hand study of the geography under discussion, many times over and over many years in fact. Unlike the author and his friends, this reviewer HAS descended the broken, boulder-studded crevice at the south end of Rogers' Rock, suggested by Robert Cochran as his place of desent during the retreat, as well as being one of the theoretical lanes of retreat for Robert Rogers himself.It is also quite clear indeed that the author DID NOT examine all the available documentation, as this reviewer has. If he did, he refrained from including much of it in his book---perhaps because it clashed with his preconceived notions about what could have been possible that long-ago day in March, 1758. The book's editor should not make such prounouncements about the author having examined &quot;every scrap of information about the battle&quot;, when obviously he did not do that. One glance at his Bibliography shows that it should have been some three to four times longer, if he had indeed scoured all of the available documentation.It is admirable that the author is a long-time reenactor who has hiked and camped in winter conditions that approximated those at the time of the battle. It is understandable how such experience might give the author and the editor the impression that he has therefore the Rosetta Stone of historical interpretation forever after in his exclusive ownership. It is also understandable how the uninformed will find his work pleasing and entertaining. But at the end of the day, for the author, editor, and their readers to deny that this book is not the truthful treatise it purports to be, that it fails to quote and disseminate ALL of the available sources, is erroneous in so many of its conclusions and even simple facts, is behind the times as far as Ranger history and material culture is concerned (especially in the area of winter campaign wear), and lacks an understanding of the true ecological condition of Rogers' Rock as it stood in 1758, will not be to any of their own long-lasting reputations."},{"Title":"The Battle On Snowshoes","review":"Perhaps the best way to begin this review is with a compliment...the artwork by Joe Lee is excellent. Unfortunately, that is where the compliments end. This book was suggested to me as &quot;a good buy&quot; because the author had spent a good deal of time investigating the terrain/conditions on the orignal sites of the 1st and 2nd Battle on Snowshoes. Having done that...does that give the author the license to re-write history to their own personal agenda? Some might say that this book is an &quot;apology&quot; to the French partisans who operated in the Lake George/Lake Champlain corridor during the French &amp; Indian War...to me, it appears that it is merely a device that goes way out of its way to &quot;trash&quot; the reputation of Robert Rogers and the Rangers. For example...the author writes an interesting little anecdote about Rogers and some of his new recruits being surprised at &quot;Five-mile point&quot;, by Langis and company who fired on them from ambush. The author points out that as Rogers was leaving the skirmish...he showed his backside to Langis, a sight that Langis had seen many times. Really? Where does that information come from? This author seems to like to dabble in Historical Fiction. An example of this is in a meeting between Rogers and a French officer, M. Wolff. During a parley, Rogers asked Wolff about a previous raid that he had led...that was obviously an embarrasment to the French. Wolff responded in kind with...&quot;..to be careful of himself when he comes again,...&quot; That passage is based on fact. However, the author adds to it that Rogers felt a chill as Wolff..&quot;..fixing his frosty blue eyes on him,...&quot; and then giving his warning &quot;..in a low measured voice...&quot; Again, where does that information come from? Does the author have an original portrait of Wolff? Or is &quot;frosty blue&quot; just a favorite color? There is even a section where the author discusses Langis' &quot;three favorite marksmen&quot;? Documentation? None given. This book would also have us believe that Rogers died in a debtors prison. That is simply not true. Any amateur historian of the French &amp; Indian War knows that Rogers did spend time in debtors prison...but was eventually released. This book was not well researched...and as stated before, goes out of its way to paint a bad picture of Robert Rogers. It's too bad the author had to resort to such tactics to bring to light more information about Langis. This &quot;book&quot; is certainly not worthy of an intrepid partisan fighter such as Langis."},{"Title":"The Battle On Snowshoes","review":"To the experienced researcher, reenactor, trekker, and armchair historian all books regarding the colonial period are valuable and we can learn from them. The key word here is experienced.People who fit into the experienced categorie above are able to read Mr. Bearors books, \\"The Battle on Snowshoes\\" and its sequel, \\"French and Indian War Battlesites: A Controversy\\" and filter out the parts which are pure conjecture. The first book is 95 pages and the second is 99 pages long, a total of 194 pages. If you filter out the pure conjecture but leave in the approximately 39 pages of interesting photo, maps and Joe Lee's, as always excellent illustrations, you are left with a pair of very thin pamphlets of quotes from primary and secondary sources that, taken out of context, as many seem to be, would be practically useless to almost anyone.To the beginner, (and apparently to some not so new beginners that one would think should know better), these books could possibly be very misleading. Mr. Bearor and his personal friends reviewers all seem to place a great deal of emphasis on his experience as a reenactor, muzzle loading shooter, trekker, Adirondack guide and researcher, all applaudable accomplishments, but the reader should not be mislead into thinking that because of all these that what the author puts forth is pure irrefutable fact.Because the author has walked the Southwest Patrol Route in different seasons, in period clothing and equipment seems to imply that it was the same as when the French and their Native Allies did so long ago. Knowing the historical times and distances traveled corrupts any modern attempt to duplicate it, plus the missing key ingredient of any combat patrol, the other guy who is out looking for you. (I know the author is an experienced war gamer but I do not believe he said that he did this research during a war game to get the same results.).The author seems also to imply to the reader that he is the first person to do this type of research in this geographical area. He states in the preface that the probability for this book started when his father took him in 1954, as a young boy, to visit Fort Ticonderoga and bought him a toy flintlock musket. In 1954 there were older boys armed with real flint lock muskets and dressed in period clothing with period equipment who were already scouting the Patrol Routes, setting cold \\"flying camps\\" on Bald Mountain and various other \\"trekking activities\\" that had no name back then. Oh, yes and the tricorn hats disappeared very quickly as they made a great place to accumulate snow and rain to be dumped into your lock when you check the primingThe best I can say in regard to Mr. Bearors book is that thankfully we live in a country where people are able to state or print their opinions no matter how slanted they are.

In addition, the author's friends, in positively reviewing his work, consider fact-based and logical criticisms of it &quot;a sniping contest&quot;. So much for amateur historians and their flatterers.The FACTS about Robert Rogers and Rogers Rock exist. The author did not touch upon the following FACTS of the battle and its aftermath, because they conflicted with his theory that tired men, after a battle on snowshoes, could not have, and would not have, retreated up Bald Mountain. These FACTS are:1.) Rogers himself offered a sergeant to Captain Pringle and Lieutenant Roche &quot;to conduct us THRU THE MOUNTAIN&quot;, in Pringle's words. (So much for the 9/15 reviewer's contention that Rangers did not climb over mountains in wintertime &quot;during or after battles&quot;).Clearly Rogers expected his men, and himself, to escape OVER the mountain range at their backs, by whatever route offered itself. The saddle route was the most obvious, and easiest, way; but even Pringle noted that the pursuing Indians were running in different directions to &quot;intercept&quot; those Rangers who had already begun their retreat. Do the author and his reviewer friends have any contemporary evidence that disputes this, or that can point to the ACTUAL escape routes of the survivors?2.) Cochrane's testimoy, as published by Timothy Dwight in 1802, is NOT &quot;third-hand testimony&quot;. The reviewer of September 15 mixes up two SEPARATE pieces of information supplied to Timothy Dwight, two SEPARATE oral accounts that place both Rogers AND some of his men on the summit of Bald Mountain on the night of March 13, 1758. The first account is related by the guide escorting Dwight on a voyage up Lake George. The anecdote that immediately follows it was heard by Dwight from an unidentifed second party who, in fact, might have been &quot;Colonel Cochrane&quot; himself, considering the way it is worded. The reviewer of 9/15 also makes the erroneous assumption that the man relating the first of these accounts &quot;was far from unbiased&quot;, forgetting that the &quot;bias&quot; in Dwight's relation of it was no doubt Dwight's own perspective on Rogers.3.) In 1760--a mere two years after the battle, what we know today as Rogers' Slide was being referred to as &quot;Rogers' Leap&quot; in the diary of a British officer.4.) In 1766 a land patent in the area also refers to Bald Mountain itself as &quot;Rodgers' Leap&quot;. Oddly, that same year, another petition calls it &quot;Rogers' Rock&quot;.5.) By 1777 one American soldier travelling up the lake noted Rogers' feat of &quot;descending a part of {Bald Mt} with his Detachment&quot;, and that &quot;one would doubt the fact IF NOT SO WELL AUTHENTICATED.&quot;6.) The reviewer of 9/15 says that the route up Bald Mt. from the saddle is &quot;neither a logical route nor an easy way to get home&quot;. It certainly IS logical, and more attractive than the alternative, if there is no other way to &quot;get home&quot;. The Rangers fled by individuals, or in very small parties of twos and threes, in typical Ranger fashion after such a bad defeat. Rogers clearly mentions Indians both pursuing AND capturing some of his men---a fact verified in Pringle's contemporary account. Can the author and his reviewer friends say with any preciseness just HOW FAR those Indians actually kept up their pursuit? That the saddle path was already being travelled by Indians in pursuit of Rangers would indeed suggest why some Rangers, including Rogers, veered instead to the top of the mountain to find another way to escape.7.) The reviewer of 9/15 talks about how snow deterred some 18th century travellers, but again fails to recognize that it rarely made a difference to Rangers. While the snow was indeed deep during the Battle on Sbnowshoes, conditions for Rogers and his men were much worse during Rogers' scout of March 7, 1759, in which he and his men fought a two-mile running battle with French and Indians out of Fort Carillon, across the ice of Lake Champlain, then over the deeply-snowed mountains between the south arm of the lake and the northern end of Lake George; and after repelling the enemy Rogers led his men down the ice of Lake George to warm campfires at Sabbath Day Point. It was the most excruciating of all of Rogers' winter treks---a total of fifteen miles of hard fighting, of climbing up and over snow-clad mountains, and over wind-swept lake. Thus it dwarfed, for sheer endurance, the retreat after the Battle on Snowshoes; and in fact many Rangers, including Rogers, came down with frostbite after the agonizing experience.So much for historical facts decided around the campfires of modern reenactors.The saddest fact of all is that, with all the errors, poor research, and unsupportable contentions made in this book, it is still being defended by some as &quot;a good book...done very well&quot;. Robert Rogers indeed deseves better."},{"Title":"The Battle On Snowshoes","review":"I was pleased to see that the author of the &quot;book&quot; finally took the time to respond to the many different reviews of his work. Unfortunately, he decided to take the &quot;high road&quot; and not defend any of the many (intentional) mistakes he made throughout the book. To do so would mean admitting error...yet at this point it should be obvious to the author and his reviewer friends that that is his only recourse. Even though the reviewer from New York State continually backs up the true, known facts of the Battle On Snowshoes with hard evidence...the author refuses to &quot;dignify&quot; these questions with a response. (something smells funny) The author states that the reviewers let their bias get in the way...yet in his own book he makes statements like &quot;Rogers already inflated ego...&quot;! I would call that a biased statement. The author also stated in his reply that &quot;There is no one who has ever done more research or field work on the Battle on Snowshoes than I have.&quot; Talk about your inflated ego...are you sure about that? It appears that the reviewer from New York State has got the real goods...for at least that reviewer is backing up their claims with facts. The author states that &quot;I certainly did not invent any history.&quot; Does the author really expect us to believe that Langy had his &quot;three favorite marksmen&quot;, (did you just want to get your friends pictures in the book?), that they encountered a&quot;fat bearded ranger&quot;, and that Rogers died in a debtors prison? The author and his reviewer friends must know that this is pure fabrication...the reviewer of 9/15 should know better. Those points are just the tip of the iceberg! Further,the last two points should show perfectly just how bias the author is toward Rogers and the Rangers. (and of course there are more examples) This is revisionist history in the worst sense of the word. Finally, the author stated that his book is the most popular F &amp; I War book that his publisher is selling. So, high sales make for good history? The National Enquirer enjoys high sales as well....yet no one takes it seriously."},{"Title":"The Battle On Snowshoes","review":"Maybe it is best to open a commentary such as this with one simple idea; I have found over the years that the best contributors to historical or cultural discussion are those who do not take themselves too seriously. I have been on a journey through living history with people like Bob and Fred Gowen ( please see his related review) for the better part of two and a half decades, and the implicit value when someone like Bob Bearor touches pen to paper is that he does not take himself too seriously. Oh, he did plenty of work and research, all right, but he never felt he was the last word or definitive authority. There is not a lick of false pride about him.That adds a golden value to his writing. I am not looking for another Rise and Fall Of The Roman Empire, nor do I expect an honorary Doctorate to be bestowed on Bob Bearor. Neither does he.The beauty of the Battle On Snowshoes is that Bob walked the bloody path in the dead of winter, and got to do what many Historians have to be envious about...he got as close to the moans, wails, bloodshed and gunfire in the wintery forest as a fellow can without actually disappearing into a time warp. I know this for a fact, because I was with him on some of those scouts on the French Patrol Trail, or the battlefield near Ticonderoga, and I've been drizzled and snowed on with him. I felt the awe of standing on the ground the French walked on when it was cold, treacherous and getting dangerously dark. That does something to your perspective...maybe more so than all the written sources heaped in one big pile can ever do.Having said that, and having been helped by so many other people in my own living history journey, let me conclude this brief review with the highest compliment I can possible pay a fellow writer;Bob did not take himself so seriously as to imply growth of his own reputation or status. His book makes you think, it makes you imagine, it makes you wonder. That is its credential...that's why I want it on my shelf with all the other authors who may be...&quot;replete with errors&quot;...to paraphrase a colleague's commentary. When you are done with Bob's Book, you'll want to know more and seek other books. It may not warrant the Nobel Prize, but it certainly merits a noble prize for that achievement."},{"Title":"The Battle On Snowshoes","review":"....Readers must be madeaware that if they are looking for the truth about the Battle on Snowshoes, they will find very little that is truly &quot;solid&quot; in this book.For example, the author claims that Robert Rogers and his men could never have climbed Bald Mountain that night, yet he conveniently skips over the evidence of winter mountain climbing, on SNOWSHOES, made by Rangers, Provincials, French and Indians all the time, without complaint. Because the author and his reviewer friends cannot, in their 40s and 50s, duplicate this common 18th century &quot;feat&quot; made by much hardier men in their early 20s, they consider it not humanly possible. Fieldwork indeed! And what an insult to those heroic scouts, who had, to quote one admiring contemporary, &quot;constitutions like lions!&quot;Nor did the author make any discussion in his book about the gradual climb from the saddle to the top of Rogers' Rock, as he claims he does. He merely mentions the trail that leads OVER the saddle to the LAKE. He should take the time to read the criticism of his work much more carefully. He might learn something he never noticed before---about something he apparently never walked on before, despite all his claims of having explored the area!He calls any evidence that does not support his claim that neither Rogers nor any Rangers ever climbed to the top of Bald Mountain &quot;notoriously corrupted&quot;. (Just WHO determined the &quot;corruption&quot; of the evidence?). He also claims to have scoured all the available accounts, and their bibliographies; yet he obviously did a very slipshod job of it in light of all the details about this battle he left out---details that would have made his book much fatter than the simple monograph it now is. He also fails to mention the new data on this battle that has come to light in the decades since Loescher, Parkman and Cuneo wrote about it. Had he done this additional research work, and arrived at conclusions more objective in light of ALL the documentation, his &quot;book&quot; would not have been the fair game it now is for critics. He must learn to live with the reaction he has generated.So much of this work is inaccurate when it shouldn't have been. For instance, the Rangers' early uniforms are described as including &quot;buckskin hunting shirts&quot;, with two companies dressed entirely in &quot;soft grey duffle&quot;. Oh really? What contemporary document shows these as items worn by Rangers?Where is Rogers described &quot;as having thick lips, and a large protruding nose&quot;? Who wrote it?He offers the unsupported rumor of Rogers early in his life &quot;engaged in the smuggling trade&quot;. Again, where is the supporting evidence? He says that young Rogers got involved in a scheme with &quot;some notorious counterfeiters&quot;, when actually only ONE &quot;notorious&quot;, roving counterfeiter, Owen Sullivan, was behind the scheme.He claims that &quot;Rogers and his vanguard were lost&quot; while Howe's advance detachment approached Carillon on July 6, 1758, when in truth Rogers and his men knew exactly where they were at the beginning of the engagemnt: at their assigned post on the Ticonderoga River, having taken possession of a bridge. When the fighting began, Rogers' men attacked Langy's party in the flank, and helped defeat and nearly destroy it.The author claims that Rogers was &quot;hated and distrusted&quot; by his commanders-in-chief, failing to acknowledge that Rogers generally had the full confidence and cooperation of Lord Loudoun, and the admiration and even emulation of Lord Howe; that Rogers' influence effectively &quot;Rangerized&quot; the entire army under General Abercromby in 1758 and to some extent Amherst's in 1759; and that Rogers got along famously with the grandly critical Amherst, in whose journal and correspondence there is almost nothing deprecating about the Ranger leader. In fact, Amherst chose Rogers to go west in 1760 to receive the surrender of the distant French outposts on the Great Lakes. &quot;Hated and distrusted&quot;? By some, perhaps; but the author, with his all but admitted partisanship for the French side of the war, may be engaging in some wishful thinking here.The author also notes that &quot;Rogers' ego and reputation for bravado&quot; would have had him boasting of a slide down Rogers' Rock had he done that. The author seems to forget that Rogers' Jornals and scouting reports were very modestly and economically written, and that his contemporaries often made complimentary note of this.The author also over-praises one of the leaders of the French force at the Snowshoes fight, Langy, while denigrating Rogers' own continuing fame. Unfortunately for his argument, Langy was just a small fish in a big pond, while Rogers remained a big fish until his fortunes hit the wall in the post-war years. It is absurd to compare the war record of the two men, with Rogers commanding large detachments not only of Rangers, but also Provincials and often Regular troops, in many of the war's major campaigns, and playing pivotal roles in the attacks on Louisbourg, Carillon, Crown Point, the posts and towns along Lake Champlain, the village of St. Francis, and then of course taking possession of the French forts in the West. There can be no comparison. Rogers remains the greatest partisan leader of the French and Indian War, no matter what his subsequent history was.In tandem with such a jaundiced view of things, combined with poor scholarship, the author has fabricated evidence and invented scenes and dialogue that never existed. On the one hand he says &quot;perhaps the conversation went something like this&quot;; but on the other he invents completely the &quot;mystery&quot; of why &quot;the lead Indian stopped&quot; on the frozen Bernetz Riviere (which was NOT called Trout Brook until long after the Revolution), and presents it without a qualifing statement to remind the reader that such a moment and &quot;mystery&quot; never really transpired. He invents other scenes no less preposterous...."},{"Title":"Great Books of the Western World Volume 40: American State Papers - Federalist - J. S. Mill","review":"This was a great find.

It remains the best place to eat in the area with excellent food, both in quality and quantity.The author of this book grew up in the Amanas in the early part of the twentieth century and this is her story of her experiences. The colonies were a communal society, where each person was assigned their task and when you needed something, you contacted the person and their services were free. Since the colonies were not completely self-sufficient, each colonist was given a credit allotment that they could spend in the stores.Elders that adjudicated disputes and needs on an individual basis governed the society. It was a society based on religious revelations and their specific religion was founded in Germany, so the primary language of the colonies was German. Their society was somewhat rigid in nature in that non-conformity was severely frowned upon and even marriage was considered to be less pure than a single lifestyle. When people departed from what was community policy, they were disciplined using tactics from being demoted in the church hierarchy to outright banishment.The great depression affected the colonies just like all other aspects of the American society and forced them to incorporate and allocate shares of stock to the members. It was also necessary for the colonies to open up to the presence of outsiders by opening restaurants and hotels. Yambura was in her teen years when this happened and she took a job as a waitress in one of the restaurants. She also attended a public high school and then college. After college she married an outsider and left the colonies, although she acknowledges the deep roots that remain.This book is interesting because it gives an inner description of the Amana Colonies in the time period, how the society was organized and what daily life was like. Although the modern reader will consider it a repressive society, it was highly ordered and free of all but petty crime. The society has proven to be adaptable and survives to this day, which is also a significant accomplishment."},{"Title":"Motivos De Conversacion: Essentials of Spanish","review":"I used this book in a 1st year college course and found it to be very thorough in it's content, It did not assume I already new the basics but explained every section thoroughly.

She has become noted for her knowledge of traditional Japanese culture, and this book is an excellent example of the author's deep knowledge of the subject. In great detail, accompanied by simple but clear illustrations, she explains things that were once common, but are rapidly disappearing. One of the most interesting segments for me was the section on traditional thatched-roof houses. They are plentiful in Nagano, where I live, but I didn't imagine that any were left in Tokyo. Not only does the author interview a person that makes thatched roofs, but she gives an interesting and detailed account of life in a thatched roof home, both from point of view of the older generation who can't imagine anything else, and the younger generation who aren't as enthusiastic. Like all other developed nations, Japan's traditional crafts are rapidly disappearing, as young people become accustomed to convenience and expediency. Kiritani has preserved, in text form at least, an important part of Tokyo's and Japan's cultural history."},{"Title":"Vanishing Japan: Traditions, Crafts & Culture","review":"This book is written by my cousin and is illustrated by her husband - excellent book, easy reading and very interesting.

Without any reservation, I put this book in a class that includes the worst works in all publishing, not just physics publishing. The undue prestige that surrounds this book is a terrible misrepresentation which is based on the competitive and corrosive academic environment it creates instead of a collaborative and fruitful one. I have personally witnessed students exiting the sciences because of this book. The primary causes for such a poor book is due to the complete lack of any serious editing and the financial greed of the publisher for allowing it to be published and used for teaching a generation of scientists and engineers.A fine textbook is based on clarity and thoroughness. From chapter to chapter, and from subject to subject, this book is chronically vague and incomplete. In many places it is even convoluted.

The book explores fingerprinting, fake money, recognizing hand writing, hackers, being able to ID a criminal, and identifying a victim from a skull.I learned a few new things. For example police have been able to anticipate possible places for where a crime will happen given on the location of other similar crimes. Many Criminals have a \\"comfort zone\\" and will steal in the same area of town.

The result is an informative, exciting and well-illustrated tribute to some of the most famous fighter pilots ever, legends like Preddy, Gentile, Shomo, Beeson, Hofer and Eagleston. Air combat buffs will want to search out a copy of this 1992 release from Motorbooks International.P-51 MUSTANG ACES survey the aces by theater along with a final chapter on RAF Mustang aces. The ETO chapter - Chapter 1 - is divided into 8th and 9th Air Forces, ace bios being arranged alphabetically. 'Bud' Anderson is the first Mighty Eighth ace covered; Bill Whisner, the last. Don Beerbower is the first 9th AF ace covered; Dick Turner, the last. Chapter 2 covers 9th AF TacR aces Clyde East and John Hoefker. MTO Mustang aces are described in Chapter 3; CBI Aces, Chapter 4; and Chapter 5 belongs to 7th AF/PTO ace Bob Moore. After the chapter on RAF aces, various appendices are included: P-51 Aces, Top Mustang Aces, P-51 Aces in a Day, etc.Entries on individual pilots run between 1 1/2 to 3 1/2 pages in length. The pilot's combat exploits are covered in great detail, many bios including actual combat reports. For many years Bill Hess was historian of the AFAA and knew many of the pilots covered. Consequently, P-51 MUSTANG ACES has a more personal tone than many of Hess' other military aviation titles. His entry for Dick Turner, for example, includes the statement that \\"while Dick Turner was a tiger in the air, on the ground he was one of the most gentle, compassionate individuals that (Hess) ever had the opportunity to meet. When Dick Turner passed away on November 15, 1986...I lost the best friend I have ever known.\\"The book is liberally illustrated with many photographs of pilots, aircraft, etc.Though there have been many 'Spam Can' books published, the Hess/Ivie volume is a must-have for Mustang and air combat buffs. It provides an excellent, exciting overview of P-51 top guns.

Now, as a 44 year old, I thought I would reread this book to take a stroll down memory lane. I wasn't disappointed. This story of the Brooklyn Dodgers in the late 1930's is the sequel to The Kid from Tomkinsvile. The &quot;Kid&quot; chonicles the season that leads up to the World Series and this book disects the seven game classic against the Indians.

Tunis is very good at getting the feel of what baseball was like in the 1940's, and &quot;World Series&quot; contains perhaps his best game-situation writing of all the novels.

Baseball is baseball, whether it was played fifty years ago or last summer. The Brooklyn Dodgers managed by Dave Leonard and starring Roy Tucker, \\"The Kid From Tompkinsville\\" are in the World Series, having won the pennant on the last day of the season. They are a battered team, their first string catcher split a thumb and cannot play. The Brooklyn pitchers are worn out from the long season and everyone else is hurting. In his first at bat of the series, Roy Tucker is hit in the head by a fast ball and is suffering from dizzy spells.This is a story about the drive to succeed and the desire to win. It is also about teamwork, all members working together to achieve a common goal. Manager Dave Leonard takes over the catching duties and by sheer will power, forces his forty-year old body to perform like it is once again twenty-something. He is leveled at the plate and holds onto the ball to save a run and get the vital out. I first read this story when I was in middle school, loved it then and enjoyed it just as much when I read it this time. It takes you back to an age when people played the game hard, for only a few thousand dollars a year and where winning was the only thing.This is a sequel to \\"The Kid From Tompkinsville\\" and Tunis is once again at the top of his writing game.

This volume takes that pessimism and puts it into a much more realistic context, dealing with World War I, the Great Depression, and an era of American History to which few of us today can relate. Sandburg's poetry is virtually prose in sections, reading very fluidly. It is fascinating to watch his evolution as a writer and as a man throughout the poems he wrote. I rarely sit and just read poetry, but I recommend this volume to my students--and to anyone else reading/listening--for a couple of hours when a novel just doesn't seem right.

Those from the Midwest can really appreciate his descriptions of the region."},{"Title":"The Complete Poems of Carl Sandburg: Revised and Expanded Edition","review":"Fifty years ago Carl Sandburg's poetry could be found in nearly every library, classroom and (in some form) home in America, but in the hurried twenty-first century, where too much bad poetry has spoiled whole living generations on the art, he is all-but lost to our social consciousness. This poet of freedom (even his poems disobey every respected rule of form) penned verses that celebrated the American spirit as no other writer had since Walt Whitman. If presented with a sampling of his most famous lines, the average American would probably light up and say, \\"Oh, yeah! Okay, I've heard that one.\\" Reading the collected works of this Midwesterner is full of such moments of re-discovery. All of Sandburg's published books are here, putting his many hundreds of poems on display. His finest work, the controversial, slow-moving, stream of consciousness piece \\"The People, Yes\\" alone makes this anthology a gift to modern readers, but many other unexpected gems await to delight, challenge, inform, or taunt with sheer irony. Though some of these poems date back nearly a century, at no time does Sandburg ever sound anything but cutting-edge and post-modern. He is one of the greats for all ages of man."},{"Title":"The Complete Poems of Carl Sandburg: Revised and Expanded Edition","review":"Hemiingway had indicated that Sandburg should have won the Nobel Prize before him.

Building a career on writing books about the culture you're descended from, but have never really lived in, seems unlikely to result in ethnically-accurate stories. I can't say whether or not Lord hit her mark but I did, periodically, feel like I could have been reading a book set in almost any place, so I don't feel that she really drew the reader into China.Steel Hope is the illegitimate son of Stone Guardian and his lover, Amber Willows. The woman he will know as his mother, Jade, is an odd mixture of an unattractive woman and a vain one, and is glad to claim Steel Hope as her own. Now she has given a son to the House of Li and still managed to maintain her figure. She even \\"allows\\" Amber Willows to serve as the child's wet nurse, bringing her crippled brother, Mountain Pine, too. In time, Mountain Pine will become Steel Hope's bookmate and best friend, neither boy aware of their blood relationship. The boys meet and befriend another young man, Firecrackers, and the three become inseparable - especially after it comes to light that Firecrackers is actually a girl and the daughter of the gravekeeper. They pledge an oath to always remain \\"brothers\\" and, despite the intervention of years and events, they do so.They are rarely together over the years; at most times two of them are together but the third is not with them. For years after the gravekeeper's death, it is Mountain Pine and Steel Hope who are together, as they further their educations. Firecrackers, in the meantime, has made a new friend of a woman named Mushroom. Mushroom has introduced Firecrackers to the theater where she, as Summer Wishes, begins a career that will bring her back to her brothers. The boys find themselves in the audience as the stunning Summer Wishes takes the stage, then in the same bomb shelter with the dazzling actress... but, although both boys are taken with her, neither recognizes her until she tells them who she is. The trio of brothers is now, and for the remainder of the book, a strange sort of love triangle, wherein \\"doing the right thing\\" tends to outweigh love and the boisterous, headstrong young girl that was Firecrackers becomes a weak woman. The books spans the remainder of the their lives and the decades of upheaval in China.I was bothered by some things - Firecrackers was a young girl who, posing as a boy, was presented as strong and capable and made of sterner stuff than Steel Hope, son of a wealthy family, and Mountain Pine, the cripple. Yet, as an adult, she seems to let everything outside of herself determine her fate in every way, from who she will marry and when she will marry him to the roles she will play. It's disconcerting that she is, rather abruptly to me, broken so easily. There is also the fact that Lord chooses not to name World War II or the Communist revolution or any other event that would help the reader differentiate between times. This gives the impression, for those not familiar with China's history, that she is writing about one very long, drawn out, even endless war, that lasts the length of Steel Hope's life. There seems to be little time during which the three friends' lives are not all about surviving the war just to die of old age - a strange, somewhat surreal effect that makes them seem even more tragic. Worse, since Chinese history isn't a big subject in American schools, there will be readers who remain lost most of the time and only recognize Mao and Tiananmen SquareLastly, every now and then, Lord writes in a vague way that's hard to explain. It is as if she expects that the reader should be able to follow this sort of odd, rambling, meandering, random train of thought process, so she put it down on paper - and I couldn't follow it. Thankfully, it wasn't frequent, but it was annoying, especially the times when the story was somewhat suspenseful. To suddenly have to try to decipher these ramblings was frustrating. All in all, though, a good book and an interesting story that could have benefited from a little less of that and a little more historically relevant info to put the reader in the right timeframe. I'd read more from Lord, but I wouldn't go out of my way to find it.- AnnaLovesBooks"},{"Title":"Middle Heart","review":"Ms Lord presents a wonderful story of the unknown China at its time of cultural disrupture in a comprehensive way, especially for Non-Asian readers.The only criticism is, firstly, the plot of the story seems rather constructed and out of place with the move of the last remaining heir to the United States.

I was surprised to learn that Ms. Lord lived in China at all since her work reveals such a shallow understanding of Chinese people. For a person born and lived in China, the plot of this novel is anything but plausible.

In this non-stop action novel, Mr. Benson admirably adds all the excitement of the movie in addition to in-depth character development and enlightenments of aspects of the movie that all Bond fans can appreciate.Mr. Benson has done a wonderful job of reviewing the Bond film in depth and for those readers who have seen the movie, the story is such that it was still \\"hot off the presses\\" - an analogy appropriate to the storyline. Another quality, I enjoyed in this novelization was how Mr. Benson has implemented his own artistic licence in quite a few areas of the storyline. For instance, the sequence of events between those at Saigon and those aboard the stealth boat are elaborated on, filling the slight gap that was present in the movie.In addition to the preceding novelization features, I believe that Mr. Benson should also be recognized for his intricate attention to detail and alluring descriptions of the setting. One thing is for certain - Raymond Benson means a good quality read!PlotA British naval frigate, the H.M.S. Devonshire, sinks off of the coast of China under mysterious circumstances and an international media mogul, Elliot Carver, sways the British into believing that the Chinese are responsible for the vessel's fate. With military plights arising between Britain and China, the head of M-I6 Intelligence, \`M,' sends her most capable agent, James Bond 007, to investigate the sinking within a forty-eight hour time frame. Bond's investigation leads him to Hamburg, Germany where he meets up with a former girlfriend, and recovers a device that could be responsible for the hostilities. Proceeding to Saigon, Bond allies with a beautiful Chinese agent, Wai Lin and discovers who is clearly the adversary in this incident... and it's not the Chinese. The only question is, will Bond be able to stop him before World War III begins?ConclusionRaymond Benson's novelization of Tomorrow Never Dies is an outstanding read, and perfect for those who like a good action/mystery movie. This novel has inspired me to read Mr. Benson's very own original James Bond novel, \\"Zero Minus Ten,\\" which is another example of this author's talent. An excellent job, Raymond!

The thing that makes this book work is the character development. Personally my favorite person in the movie was Stamper because he was sick and twisted and funny to watch. Well in the book he is even more sick and twisted, for example, instead of just giving the tape of the gunned down men from the devonshire to Elliot he actually gives a naration of it, and at one point he says &quot;look at that one, he tried to get away,oop got 'em&quot; Me and my friend joke about that all the time. well enough about Stamper.

I guess you just don't know good literiture when you see it."},{"Title":"Tomorrow Never Dies","review":"Raymond Benson really makes the story and characters of &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; his own in this adaptation of the script. He adds tons of background information on the rather thin characters from the movie, including a wonderful chapter introducing Wai Lin, the Michelle Yeoh character. (It makes you wish EON would let him write a novel just about her!) Compare this book to &quot;Goldeneye,&quot; a novelization written by John Gardner. Gardner just went through the motions, didn't inject any style or substance into the script, did your basic awful movie adaptation. Benson, on the other hand, goes above and beyond and makes a wonderful book out of the script. In my opinion, very few novelizations are worth reading. This one is an exception. It adds to and embellishes on the movie. Read it!"},{"Title":"Tomorrow Never Dies","review":"Excellent!!!Benson did a very good job in keeping his &quot;Bond&quot; similar to Ian Fleming's &quot;Bond&quot;.

Their only quandary will be whether to buy &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; by Raymond Benson, before or after seeing the picture. They would, with some justice, contend that once the Bond movies were under way even Ian Fleming began to shape his tales with a view to a screenplay, and therefore that novelization is the same deal turned back to front. I'm not convinced. Fleming was Mr Big, whereas Mr Benson's talents are strictly small potatoes. What is more, the novelization of &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; has a xxxxx case of movie hangover; the action sequences, especially, are dulled by a faint blur of stage directions. &quot;With the aid of this device, he was able to anticipate turns and obstacles before he could actually see them&quot;: how's that for a high-octane car chase? And when I read a sentence such as &quot;He swung, but Bond blocked the blow with a Kake-te manoeuvre&quot; all I can think of is Pierce Brosnan looking serious in a gym. Only someone whose senses have been drilled into submission by too many hours in a movie theatre would dream of writing, &quot;The first sedan exploded spectacularly,&quot; or, better still, &quot;Her figure was smashing.&quot; That one makes me laugh every time I read it[.]&quot;"},{"Title":"Tomorrow Never Dies","review":"I honestly believe it took Raymond Benson no longer than about 2 or 3 days to write this excuse for a novelization. Sure, novelizations are typically a waste of time, with the treatment done so simply and with no style, no extra drama, and little action, but this is the pits. Benson is not even a good enough writer for a screenplay novelization. He has zero style and zero feel for character. It's like he's describing the action as simply as he can and making it so distant that even as simple as the book is it becomes taxing to get through. Raymond Benson is the wrong choice for the new Bond writer and it's a damn shame. Watch Tomorrow Never Dies again. Don't even bother with this."},{"Title":"Tomorrow Never Dies","review":"Tommarow never dies is another continuing part of the good jolly old chap James Bond.

If you like action, fights,to sex then this is the book for you. I give it five stars because you can&quot;t put it down."},{"Title":"Tomorrow Never Dies","review":"The only difference here is that Raymond Benson, who is now writing the Bond novels penned this one. The problem with Benson is not his knowledge or understanding of James Bond but HIS WRITING. It's bad. Bottom line. The guy is a lousy prose writer, sounding like a high school English student in his explanations of scenes and descriptions. There is not an iota of drama or even action here. It's just plain wording of scenes on a page. This book is only of interest to big fans of the movie (which was top-notch Bond) and of the novels (for completists, as Benson's other 2 novels blow this turkey away.)"},{"Title":"Tomorrow Never Dies","review":"I don't normally read &quot;books of the film&quot; but after reading Benson's other two original Bond novels (&quot;Zero Minus Ten&quot; and &quot;The Facts of Death&quot;) I decided to give this a try. I did not care much for the film. Benson, however, must have added his own bits (unless they were dropped from the final film) which made the book much more entertaining than the movie.

Well done!"},{"Title":"Tomorrow Never Dies","review":"Even though this book is a movie tie-in, doesn't mean it can't be good, and a little different than the movie.

This &quot;novelization&quot; seems to be written by a ten year old. Poorly written with no suspense, no thrills. A boring Bond.The thrilling actions of the film just don't translate effectively through Raymond Benson's boring narrative. There's also dumb humour that didn't appear in the film. Also, the description of love scenes is essentially kitsch. Yes, Benson tries to flesh out some characters, but the characterisations fall flat. The villain Carver, for example, is just another angry son who is bent on revenge--an age-old cliche.Save your brain power and stay away from this so-called novel."},{"Title":"Tomorrow Never Dies","review":"There are a few sentences in which Benson could have written better, for example: &quot;Fility habit.&quot; Bond said to the unconsious man. It is obvious that Bond had been speaking to the man, who else could it be? It could be change to &quot;Bond shooked his head&quot; or simply &quot;Bond sighed&quot; Nevertheless, I still think the plot is good."},{"Title":"Tomorrow Never Dies","review":"This novel is based on the screenplay of he film, so the plot isn't going to stray to far from the movie (if you saw it). However, the novel contains one or two or more scenes in which the film didn't include. Such as: Wai Lin's mission briefing in China, Elliot Carver's history, etc. The book was good enough to read even after seeing the movie because it provided enough extras not in the film. They would tell you what each character was thinking, and would also elaborate more on Elliot Carver's past, Paris/Bond relationship, among other things not in the film. It is no going to be any kind of vocabulary quest, so it's a easy read, but if you like Bond, you'll probably like this book (even if you didn't like the film, as i didn't)."},{"Title":"Tomorrow Never Dies","review":"It is rare that a movie/novel tie-in matches the movie's quality. Action scenes don't usually translate well and obvious plot holes and inconsistencies become more apparent than ever. Raymond Benson's Tomorrow Never Dies adaptation is an exception. Using the framework scripted by Bruce Feirstein, Benson pulls off an in-depth, intriguing, action-packed novel that actually surpasses the movie it is based on. One of my main problems with the movie was the total lack of character development for the main characters. Stamper, Elliot Carver, Paris Carver, and Wai Lin all had little to no background which made them seem fake and uninteresting. With Benson's version, they all have detailed histories and are far more intriguing people to read about than they were to watch on the screen. Wai Lin, for instance, had an entire chapter devoted to her in the beginning. It detailed her involvement with the Chinese People's External Security Force, her training, her skills, and many other facets of her life that made her a real person. Her relationship with Bond is also much more realistic. From their first meeting at Carver's party, there is sexual tension between the two. Later in the novel, there is a mixture of mutual admiration and trust. Inevitably this leads to lust, but even that is done tastefully. Benson also fleshed out one of the biggest questions left in my mind after seeing Tomorrow Never Dies: just who was General Chang and what was his purpose. In the movie he was seen for about five seconds and talked about briefly. In the novel we learn that he was a high-ranking official who, before he defected, stole a large amount of stealth material. This is what Wai Lin was investigating when she went to Carver's party and met Bond. It was later revealed that he was working for Carver, not with. All these facts would have made the movie far more interesting. Another issue I had was in regards to Stamper. He came across as an inhuman freak that enjoyed pain. With no more background this seemed ridiculous; however, the novel reveals that his pain and pleasure sensors were actually reversed. As a boy, he was hired to kill Carver's real father whom he did with a sick pleasure. Ten years later he becomes Elliot's henchman and almost his child. Again, with more development, the character of Stamper works. By using the screenplay merely as an outline, Benson is able to create a novel that seems like it was never a movie. The plot is exactly the same as the movie, but much of the dialogue has been changed, as have the action scenes. The BMW car and motorcycle chases are still in there, but their content has been changed. Benson also took quite a few creative licenses and added fight sequences while cutting others; for example, Bond dukes it out with Stamper on top of the speeding Sea Dolphin II. Finally, the novel cuts out much of the in-poor-taste innuendoes that filled the movie. What results is a witty, well-paced novel with far sharper dialogue than its cinematic counterpart. Very well done! Power to the Bond fans!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Tomorrow Never Dies","review":"Tomorrow Never Dies was the first James Bond movie I ever saw, and I've seen it a few million times now, so I know the plot back and forth. Benson's novelization, while based on the screenplay, is so much better in many ways. One is that he added in a lot. Another is that he tells what the characters are thinking (a third-person omniscient instead of a third-person narrative), and he explains everything, like why Elliot Carver is evil, and even a bit about Bond as a schoolboy. All in all, great book. I also liked how he explains all the gear and weapons."},{"Title":"Tomorrow Never Dies","review":"I've always been a little weary of novelizations. Usually they're poorly written with little to add to the film, TV show, or whatever they are adapted from. The Bond films are much the same (John Gardner's adaptations of Licence To Kill and Goldeneye for example). Yet with the novelization of Tomorrow Never Dies, Raymond Benson does something almost extraordinary. He manages to take the film and make it seem like a genuine Bond book adventure.The Bond of the book is much the same as the Bond of the original literary novels written by Benson, meaning that it's pretty much Brosnan as Bond in both the novel and film. Yet Benson manages to keep the human elements of the character alive as well especially in the few brief scenes with Paris Carver. But as always, Benson's 007 is best in action and it is this part of the character that Benson really taps into with no problem.The rest of the characters are really well fleshed out and put their film counterparts to shame big time. We learn of the sinister rise to power of Elliot Carver which makes for one of the most chilling chapters I have ever read in a Bond novel. Plus Carver seems to be less of the film's super villian and more like a real, albeit evil, person. The same can be said of the Stamper character as well even though he is still at heart nothing more then a stereotype.The two other characters that are fleshed out are the two Bond girls. Wai Lin is given a whole chapter dedicated to her mission that led her to the party in Hamburg. She comes across less as a female version of Bond (being almost too tough for a Bond girl) as seen in the film and more as a real person. The background we are given on Paris helps out with her character as well. Even though she appears in even less here then in the final film she is a much better character here.The story also reads a lot better. Benson was obviously working from an earlier version of the script and from what is in the novel it is a shame that the filmmakers didn't stick to this one. Because let me tell you it's a much different story here. Not that the sequence of events is much different. But the nature of Carver's plan is much different and a lot more realistic then the one in the film. In fact considering the world today, the plan as seen in the book is chilling to say the least.As for much of the content, those of you familiar with the Benson 007 novels will have much to like about this. If you aren't then this is a book you should read to see how good Tomorrow Never Dies should have been. This might be the one time a novelization has actually been better then the actual film."},{"Title":"Tomorrow Never Dies","review":"I love this book. I think it is better than the movie by far. I have noticed they added some stuff in the book which makes it harder to put down. I would reccomend this book to any James Bond fan. I guess it stinks I never got to read the first one."},{"Title":"Tomorrow Never Dies","review":"As they say, &quot;If you liked the movie...&quot; Friends who read the novel before seeing the film were disapointed by the movie. And since the movie was a blockbuster that should tell you all you need to know about the novel. It fleshes out the characters of the film and adds detail that was missing. Most enjoyable is the chance to get inside 007's head and experience the action on a more personal level.
