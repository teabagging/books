I like this genre and would have thought there was no place left to go, but Donachie does \\"yeoman\\" service bringing this era to life. The book starts quite slow -- the book is half gone and they have yet to leave the harbor -- but the way he spins the yarn makes for interesting reading. Unlike other authors, he shows life before the mast and on the quarterdeck. His villain's motives are explained, and the villain, Ralph Barclay, is more of a complex man with weaknesses and pressures not appreciated by the crew, as opposed to a cruel man set out to be evil because that's the way he is. He isn't evil -- he's human, greedy, cunning, brave and foolhardy, just like anyone else. Life before the mast is more realistically depicted than in most author's books who tend to homogenize the lowly crew as a single entity. Donachie is able to show that it isn't -- there are cruel men, decent men, intelligent men, stupid men, dedicated men and more, all with their own intricacies and foibles and motivations, just like real people. Moreover, Donachie goes to great effort to describe the living standards of these men, the squalor of the ship and the day to day operation of a sailing vessel in a way O'brian never does. In O'brian's world, the crew are good or bad, happy or unhappy, work with a will or inept. He makes a few passing references to the stink below decks or to boys getting rogered over a gun, but Donachie brings these every-day things to life -- the stink below decks, the casual attitude towards sodomy of boys, the everyday meanness of back breaking work. He also goes to great pains to show the dawning awareness of who is truly cruel and who isn't, allowing the reader to discover that the world isn't as good or bad as one thing. It's refreshing to see this evolve. You can see the characters doing what they do because they are trying to impact their own futures within the confines of their nature, not as evil or good. The one drawback to me seems to be the fractured loyalties of the officers to the Captain. I believe if it were really as Donachie describes the English navy would have come apart and never been able to rule the seas. There is nothing in Donachie's depiction to pull the men together other than their brutish desire to fight. This seems unrealistic to me. There MUST have been friendship, cameraderie, patriotism, duty and so on among the officers as well as the crew, but in Donachie's world, the officers despise the Captain as well as each other. They constantly second guess the captain, something I believe would never happen in real life. Even amongst the competitive nature of their roles, there would have to be some friendships made, some reason for loyalty and some joy of their trade. The only ones who actually experience any joy at all are the protagonists. If the opposite were true for the rest, they would have killed themselves long ago because life aboard the frigate is just too depressing otherwise. Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed the book, especially the second half as the action picked up. I will continue to read the series and am grateful for another long stretch with characters worth learning about. It would be helpful if the main character, John Pearce, had a few character flaws along the way -- he's too uniformly smart, good looking, capable and lucky to be in his current predicament."},{"Title":"Digital Photography Bible (Desktop Edition)","review":"This 476-page book is principally written for beginners and intermediate users of digital photography, though some tips in it by the book's well-experienced author will also help advanced users. As the title indicates, it is a \\"Bible\\" and is structured to cover a great variety of subjects, from deciding the type of camera to buy, to taking great photos, to processing those in your \\"digital darkroom\\" (I love that term), to managing your images afterwards both for presentations and storage. It also has many practical tips reflecting the wide-ranging experiences of the author, including setting up a mini-studio on the cheap.One of the nice surprises was how the book links to a companion website where all the black-and-white figures used as illustrations can be seen in color. (Though for people with dial-up modems, this feature may be a bit frustrating for the extra time needed to download individual images.) Further, the companion website provides other helpful resources, including photography checklists you can print and have handy wherever you go with your digital camera.The book is conveniently organized into 6 parts on the following major subjects: 1) Laying the Foundation: Basic Digital Photography; 2) Taking the Next Step: Photographs that Wow!; 3) Tackling Different Photographic Subjects; 4) Doing your Own Image Processing; 5) Photography for Professional in Other Fields; and 6) Putting Digital Photography to Work. Each is divided into subparts and various topics with lots of illustrations to further carry the message, including some printed in the book in color.As I went through the book, some topics reminded me of articles on similar subjects I've read in the past in photography magazines for film-using cameras. But this Bible, updates those subjects to the digital age, and provides readers with easy to read information on how to get the best digital images possible, with some techniques unique to digital photography.I also liked the extended \\"Tips\\" added here and there after subjects. For instance, after discussing how to photography scenes and animals in nature, the author gave good short pointers on being prepared for bad weather when shooting in the wild. (I suspect some were painfully learned in the \\"school of hard knocks\\" which the author is helping us avoid!)All and all, I found this book quite helpful and will be using it in the future whenever I have questions about how to achieve good (or I should say hopefully excellent) digital images."},{"Title":"Digital Photography Bible (Desktop Edition)","review":"This book is absolutely packed with valuable information on photography, written by a working digital photographer, in a clear, concise style. You'll find lots of advice, tips, and tricks that will help beginners as well as experienced photographers.Frankly, it's about time that a guide like this should hit the shelves. Most of the \\"digital photography\\" books on the market deal more with image editing techniques than true photography. If you want to learn Photoshop, go buy a Photoshop book. If you want to learn how to use your digital camera to take great pictures, check out this book.The photos used as examples are good enough to make any digital photographer drool, yet anyone who reads this book carefully can probably go out and duplicate most of them. Simon sets the bar high, but at a level the reader can strive for.As with most books priced economically, this one relies on many black-and-white images, plus a color section where you can enjoy the full impact of the photos. However, unlike some other books I've seen, the reproduction of the monochrome images is clean and sparkling. You'll learn something from every illustration in this book.I particularly liked the special sections at the back of the book that discussed specific photographic genres, some of which (like real estate photography) haven't been addressed in this much detail in other books.

Atkins book is just such a noble work. Rare is it to find a technical text that reads more like a novel, but Atkins does. Not only is the topic fascinating on its own (mostly the physics of molecules), but Atkins raises it to the level of riveting. In those far off years of the university experience for this reader, it was said only a genius could grasp physical chemistry - not true, at least not with Atkins leading the way. Atkins uses varied tools with so many well-chosen angles on description that the reader sees things in nature never realized before. Most often through analogies to what we know well, e.g. the familiar constructive & destructive interference (wave mechanics) applied to wave functions (Schr&ouml;dinger's sometimes confounding quantum probability description) yielding electron orbitals with shapes that suddenly make sense. That \\"ah-ha\\" experience is so frequently felt while reading this book it's simply hard to put it down, for anything. There are apparently several versions of this 2006 8th edition.

A recently developed educational approach avoids ambiguous terms and describes such spreading out of energy as dispersal, which leads to loss of the differentials required for work even though the total energy remains constant in accordance with the first law of thermodynamics[38] (compare discussion in next section). Physical chemist Peter Atkins, for example, who previously wrote of dispersal leading to a disordered state, now writes that \\"spontaneous changes are always accompanied by a dispersal of energy\\", and has discarded 'disorder' as a description.[25][39][I added the following paragraph, which Wikipedia editors will probably quickly remove.- Ray Eston Smith Jr]The above statement, that \\"Peter Atkins...has discarded 'disorder' as a description\\", appears to be slander against Professor Atkins.

Even more frustrating, however, is buying a book to learn something from only to find that you've been hoodwinked in this department as well.I used this textbook when I first took physical chemistry as an undergraduate. Physical chemistry is a subject that most students struggle with enough, without having to add on top of it explanations that make no sense and nonsensical 'justifications' which are very lousy hand-waving 'proofs' done in an attempt to 'show' the student where certain quantities/formulas are derived from. Even in it's eighth edition the authors have not taken the time to clean up the myriad mistakes that riddle this textbook and pepper the minds of students with an indelible hatred of what they think is physical chemistry.This textbook does not teach nor even present physical chemistry, rather it presents a wonderfully displayed modern version of the emperor's new clothes. Going in the student thinks they are going to be taught physical chemistry, and trustingly they use this textbook as their fabric, the weaver being their teacher. When they emerge they are stark naked to the physical chemistry community having learned no actual physical chemistry, other than possibly the names of a few functions.I have taught several physical chemistry courses and we have used the textbooks by Simons and McQuarrie (my favorite) and another by Engel and Reed which does only slightly better than this one.The only reason I can find that people still use this textbook, other than they know or met Atkins, is that it provides a complete solutions manual-albeit with MANY glaring mistakes-and there are not always enough physical chemists to teach physical chemistry. But then again, Simons and McQuarrie also has a complete solutions manual-it has a few minor mistakes.

There's at least one typo on nearly every page (and more on others). Some of these errors are innocuous, but others completely obfuscate what the authors are trying to say. To make things more of a mess, the examples and mathematical derivations often gloss over several key points that make it difficult for students to follow. And don't even get me started on the problems, which make use of magical values that are nowhere to be found in the book. The solutions are even worse - it's as if the authors mixed up the numbers of the problems in the 7th edition without bothering to update the corresponding solutions.The representation of units is questionable at best. Who uses dm^3 instead of L as their de facto unit of volume? The authors take their cockamamie unit scheme one step further by representing all numerical values as unitless entities. For example, instead of R = 8.31 (J / mol * K), they'll divide both sides by the units and depict it as R / (J / mol * K) = 298. This baffling treatment of units is unnecessary, inconsistent, and, worst of all, distracting from the material at hand.In a word, terrible. Since this is my first physical chemistry course I have no frame of reference for judging the content (which is decent, as far as I can tell), but the presentation is awful. If you MUST get this book for a class, look for the International edition - the only difference is that the images in the International edition aren't in color.

From a book so thick and costing so much money, I'd have expected so much more in terms of content. I first used it as an undergraduate and at the time it forced me to try to use a more advanced textbook (which varied depending on the subject), until eventually relying on my lecture notes exclusively. Coming back to it as a Phd student, I again realized how useless it is.It merely offers an eagle eye view of thermodynamics and quantum mechanics which, in my humble opinion, isn't enough even for an undergraduate.Should you be an organic chemist at heart, with an adversion to everything mathematical/physical, there are much less expensive books that will help you get through your mandatory physical chemistry courses.If, on the other hand, you are even remotely interested in the field, invest some money in books that will last you longer than a semester: with just a bit more than 130$ you can afford three separate books on thermodynamics, quantum mechanics and kinetics.

Before you start reading through it, flip to the back and explore the \\"further information\\" section on mathematical techniques (it starts on page 1049 in my 7th edition), especially the calculus, especially partial derivatives. Learn it. Learn to love it. Live and breathe it. Only then are you ready for physical chemistry.Once you're ready for it, you'll discover how clearly and elegantly written Atkins' actually is. Initially it may seem cold and distant, but you'll see that the authors are actually caring and helpful. They're just also really concise about it.If you still feel like you're banging your head against a wall, that's normal for physical chemistry. Go bother your professor or TA. Read around topics. Do practice problems. Dig up your calculus textbook and do some problems from that.

In addition many of the problems require you to look up values from non related sources such as the CRC.

Hirshson's \\"General Patton: A Soldier's Life\\" is an average book. Leveraging the preface, Mr. Hirshson seems to offer an apology and justification to prepare the reader for the journey he is about to embark. Mr. Hirshson writes, \\"I take issue with the way previous biographies of Patton have been researched. Incomplete research has, in my opinion, led to interpretations that are at best dubious.\\" Published within a few years of Carlo D'Este's single volume biography of General Patton, Mr. Hirshson seems to rely not on his ability to present a compelling biography, but rather on his determination to find fault or deficiencies in the efforts of previous authors.Mr. Hirshson does present new and previously unmentioned events and anecdotes regarding the General. However, he goes out of his way to put a different spin on a number of well-known and universally accepted facts surrounding the Man. With 60 years of research and scrutiny relative to General Patton, it is difficult to believe that Mr. Hirshson is accurate in each of his claims. These claims come across as a desperate attempt by the author to separate his book from previous works. Several of the claims are, when viewed in context of the whole, unimportant. The single exception to this is the author's account of the atrocities committed in Sicily. Mr. Hirshson makes the absurd argument that these atrocities were the result of Patton's fire breathing and warlike speeches to his men. Mr. Hirshson ends the chapter by doing something that is unusual for a book of this type. After spending several pages walking the reader through his interpretation of the atrocities, Mr. Hirshson concludes by offering a half-hearted justification for even including this information. Mr. Hirshson writes, \\"Of what earthly value is uncovering and writing about such events sixty years after they occurred? The twentieth century might well be labeled the century of bold talk leading to holocausts and ethnic cleansing. The more such tragedies are discussed, perhaps the rarer they will become.\\"Love him or hate him, General Patton is a larger than life figure. Thus, even under the pen of Mr. Hirshson, the General still manages to leap off the page. For the individual who has studied General Patton, Mr. Hirshson's effort at chronicling his life will undoubtedly add to the fascination of the man. For the first time reader of General Patton, the book is bound to leave more questions than answers. The book does not sufficiently provide the background or circumstances necessary to place Patton's decisions, methods, successes, and failures in context. The book spends little time in describing Patton's formative years, his close relationship with his father, his West Point years, and other significant events such as his courtship of his future wife, his service during World War I, or his work in creating the first American tank corps. In bouncing over these important junctures of the General's life, the author misses the opportunity to capture the reader. More importantly, the lack of this detail makes it difficult to follow the General through his own development as a soldier and a Leader.Ultimately, \\"Patton: A General's Life\\" falls short in defining the complex, prejudiced, and brilliant General Patton.While socially acceptable behavior may change from generation to generation, the dimensions of the human spirit remain constant. It is with this in mind that one should examine the life of General George S. Patton, Jr."},{"Title":"General Patton: A Soldier's Life","review":"Books written on the life of the great American general, George S. Patton, prove the maxim that history is not objective, but interpretive. Certainly Hirshson's work is a new interpretation of mostly familiar facts, but does the reader accept Hirshson's version? After reading this book, I came to the conclusion that, while it is an admirable attempt by Hirshson, I still must consider D'Este's work THE Patton masterpiece. Hirshson does use new sources previously unused in other Patton biographies and his examination of the events occurring after Patton's death concerning his diary are intriguing. However, he lightly skims over, in my opinion, very significant moments in Patton's career and private life. Most disturbing to me is the emphasis on blaming Patton's \\"Blood and Guts\\" pre-battle speeches as the cause of atrocities committed by American troops in Sicily. I find that to be a real stretch on the author's part. However, the book is a good beginning for anyone discovering Patton, but I think it will leave them wanting more which, in that case, they should then feast on D'Este's deeply engossing magnum opus. I found the main difference in the two authors to be this: D'Este admires his subject; Hirshson does not."},{"Title":"General Patton: A Soldier's Life","review":"After an introduction where he first disparages previous biographies of Patton and then boldly promises something new and improved, I was ready to read this newer account of one of the more complex, controversial, and compelling characters in American history. After completing the full 700-plus pages of Hirschon's tome, however, I was left feeling that it could have been so much more.Much as been written in previous reviews regarding Hirschon's revisionist tendencies, so I will forgo my similar comments on that aspect of this book. The thought that I kept repeating to myself as I read was, \\"This seems well researched and documented, it is too bad the writing style isn't better.\\" I believe the author has done the historian' s task of seeking to probe the depth of his subject. Hirschon demonstrates quite well that he has explored the many facets of Patton's life and history. I enjoyed learning about his family history, his early education and some of his early struggles in life. Hirschon is to be congratulated on his diligence in digging through too often untapped resources to find new material about Patton. It is in his communication style as a writer of history, however, that I find the most glaring fault.This book could have stood with a healthy re-editing. There is so much repetition of material-quotes, stories, and themes-that I wonder if this could not have been trimmed by some 25 percent at the very least. I grew so tired, for instance, of reading in detail concerning Patton's view about the warrior spirit and Valhalla. I appreciated the idea the first time I read it, but by the fourth or fifth extended reference to Patton's belief that the Valkyries chose the most valiant to die in battle and to come to Valhalla, and that he was taught belief by his Father, and that Patton used this belief to help with his own fear in battle, I was insulted. Once a writer introduces a concept, usually a simple subsequent reference will suffice to remind the reader of its significance. If that were the only case of this sort of repetition, that would be one thing, but there there are so many extended quotes that are repeated later, in different contexts, that I found myself going back to check on the first occasion, to make certain that I wasn't imagining things.The other glaring problem I noticed is the inadequate uses of maps in the battle sections. This is almost inexcusable. If a historian is going to detail the battle plans of a strategist such as Patton. There are very few maps to begin with and the maps that are used lack any significant detail in reference to specific units and movements with the battles. After reading some excellent accounts of military history, I found this omission frustrating.Overall, I must say that the book is not a bad book. I did read the whole thing and I believe that I learned a great deal about George Patton, both as a man and as a military figure. I do believe that Hirschon's book demonstrates that in history, especially history written for a more popular audience, detailed research is only one aspect of a good book. If it is not combined with equal attention to the detail of writing and editing, then the work is not complete."},{"Title":"General Patton: A Soldier's Life","review":"Despite what Hirshson claims in his preface (over 12 yrs of archival research!), this book does not break new ground in Patton historiography. While he does uncover (or actually use) some new materials such as letters and diaries of John Wood, the 4th Armored div commander, most of his primary source is the same used by earlier biographers of Patton from D'Este all the way back to Farago. Unfortunately, his interpretations of the same materials are, to be kind, adventurous and certainly open to criticisms. One ex. is Hirshson uses Liddell Hart's claim that Patton didn't think mobile exploitation was possible in Normandy. From this bit (and as Mearsheimer showed, Liddell Hart was not above self-serving revisionist history), Hirshson claims that Patton was not nearly the armored warfare visionary his previous biographers claimed (a tough proposition to sell no doubt). He conveniently forgets the fact that Patton was talking about the terrain immediately after the beachhead (namely the bocage country) and the two month long struggle validated Patton's prediction.Another disturbing part of the book is Hirshson's claim that Patton's war speeches were responsible for American atrocities. This is just inane. Any serious reader of Patton's own works understands that Patton more than anyone else realized the difficulty of converting democratic citizenry into fighting men against an experienced Wehrmacht. Even more disturbing is Hirshson's focus on Patton's anti-Semitic views. While his views were deplorable and unjustifiable, they're hardly unrepresentative of his social peers (namely top American military generals). Considerable amount of this focus is present in his concluding chapter without really connecting how his views impacted his military conduct. He attempts to connect this to Patton's military governorship of Bavaria, but most Patton biographers and military historians would agree that it was Patton's political naivete and ignorance (after all, his political views were conservative to say the least) situated in a position where he was least suited.His work sheds some new light on John Wood, a Patton friend and his first 4th Armored commander. However, in the overall Patton historiography (despite Wood's accomplishments), Wood's importance is a minor one. Overall, a disappointing work that does not come close to superceding Blumenson's annotated Patton Papers or D'Este's monumental biography. However, I do believe there are plenty of Montgomery admirers in UK who would love to scoop up this book."},{"Title":"General Patton: A Soldier's Life","review":"I read somewhere that great men have great flaws and General George S. Patton was no exception. Gruff, volatile, arrogant, and self-promoting, Patton was nonetheless a bold tactician. Stanley Hirshson, far from presenting a hagiography, has decided to concentrate on the former. Indeed, it appears Hirshson has a sizeable axe to grind.Though no particular fan of Patton, I couldn't help but notice that much of the author's unfavorable narrative was not only anecdotal but defamatory. True, Patton was an extremely controversial figure with viewpoints any objective person would question, but Hirshson plainly contradicts himself when accusing the general of ant-semitism. His claim that Patton did not respect Jewish junior officers seems to be at odds with the fact that Patton sent several to free his son-in-law from a POW camp in Germany.One also detects a socialist ideologue deeply offended by the concept of meritocracy. Patton simply didn't share the author's worldview and Hirshson's dismay at this bleeds through to the written page. When not immersed in these complexities, Hirshson does the battlefield a disservice with maps that are basically worthless. The troop dispositions and maneuvers of the ETO's most daring general are completely ignored. Rather, we are given town names and not a heck of a lot more.Can Hirshson write well? He can. Did the book hold my interest? It did. But, as I closed the book for the final time, I did not feel the satisfaction that a good book provides. Instead, I felt I'd been piloted through the life of Patton by a man not disinterested enough to drive. 3 stars."},{"Title":"General Patton: A Soldier's Life","review":"Quite frankly, this is a dreadful book. It begins with an unbelievably self-serving and pompous introduction, in which the author strives to awe the reader with his credentials and the extent of his research, which sound most impressive, then proceeds to create a \\"biography\\" of dismaying shallowness and superficiality. While Hirshson repeatedly empahsizes the \\"freshness\\" and \\"newness\\" of his book, in truth the text lacks the personal insights and details of Ladislas Farago's \\"Patton: Ordeal and Triumph,\\" while at the same time falling far short of the military analysis--both in the area of strategy and tactics as well as the realities of military life--that are the hallmarks of Carlo D'Este's \\"Patton: A Genius for War.\\" Both are immeasurably superior to Hirschson's work. The reader is left with the distinct impression that the only times Hirschson went to any great lengths to analyze and interpret the wealth of material he allegedly accessed were in those passages where he sought to portray Patton as a proto-fascist or as the instigator of wartime atrocities. At the same time, some of the most significant events in Patton's career, particularly in his service in the ETO, are either given short shrift or ignored altogether by Hirschson. In doing so he has done a great disservice to the profession of historian. Equally disturbing is his prediliction for giving credence and lending authority to the military opinions of officers who never served at the command level that Patton did, but who felt themselves \\"qualified\\" to pass judgment on Patton's fitness for command and the decisions he made as commander of the Seventh and later Third Armies. Hirschson also makes a great song-and-dance over Patton's dismissal from command of the Fifteenth Army, building a myth that Patton's dismissal has been fraudulently presented to the American public as having been done in response to his anti-Soviet sentiments rather than his refusal to comply with Allied de-Nazification decrees. ... The [money] that would be spent on this book would be better spent on Farago and/or D'Este."},{"Title":"General Patton: A Soldier's Life","review":"Stanley P. Hirshon has written an average study of an important American war hero. Two and a half stars is really the rating I would like to give this book. Hirshon argues that he has written a different book from other biographers. While that is true, what he is really trying to do with that statement is distinguish himself from Carlo D'Este who published his Patton biography after Hirshon had invested four years of research into this project. He encourages his readers to compare his biography to others. I am not sure most people will do that, but I am also writing a book on the making of the film \\"Patton.\\" As a result, I have consulted and examined both biographies and what I find is that Hirshon comes to a number of different conclusions, but most of them seem to exaggerate minor differences and/or reflect a lack of familiarity with the military.Hirshon uncovers a number of vignettes about Patton's life that are new. His coverage of Patton's experiences in the Olympics is particularly good. One of D'Este's major themes was that the most significant factor in shaping Patton's life was his dyslexia. A major theme that Hirshon pursues without mentioning D'Este's name is that Patton was NOT dyslexic. He certainly has an argument, but he takes it too far. He also spends a good deal of time discussing Patton's father and the wide divergence in their political views. The senior Patton was an important politician in California, who played a key and underappreciated role in getting Woodrow Wilson reelected in 1916. While Patton's relationship with his father could have been better than it was and their different political values are part of that story, the differences are not what made the son historically important and the emphasis Hirshon places on them seems excessive.When most people think of Patton, they think of a 43-year old raspy-voiced actor named George C. Scott standing in front of a giant U.S. flag giving a war speech: \\"We have the finest food and equipment, the best spirit and the best men in the world. You know, by God I actually pity those poor bastards we're going up against. By God, I do. We're not just going to shoot the bastards, we're going to cut out their living guts and use them to grease the treads of our tanks. We're going to murder those lousy Hun bastards by the bushel.\\" Hirshon spends a lot of time discussing the real speeches that Patton delivered to his soldiers and argues that these were the basis for atrocities that troops under his command committed. The story of killing civilians is hardly as new as Hirshon claims--other historians have looked into these events--and while some soldiers at the time tried to say they were following Patton's instructions there is a world of difference between giving a blood thirsty speech designed to inspire men to go into combat, and giving a formal order to kill non-combatants. Hirshon believes that had this event been better investigated at the time that it would have led to Patton's removal from command. This argument is difficult to accept, but one on which the author places great emphasis.On other matters, the writing is adequate. The research is good and the author has consulted new sources that other biographers have not but their importances is open to question. What strikes me most is that Hirshon came to dislike his subject during this project and it shows. On the other hand, D'Este offers his readers a detached and balanced account that shows his readers Patton's strengths and weaknesses. D'Este is also quite alert to the details of military life. (I gave it five stars in an amazon.com review). You won't go wrong reading Hirshon's book, but there are other titles out there that are better on the same subject."},{"Title":"General Patton: A Soldier's Life","review":"Professor Hirshson spent eleven years writing this thinly veiled character assassination of a great field commander. Hirshson makes the wild claim that Patton's fiery speeches directly resulted in atrocities in the Italian campaign. This is pure speculation and impossible to support given the other well documented instances of spontaneous atrocities on the battlefield by the allies, in particular the British, Canadians and Russians. Furthermore, the author describes a civilian riot put down by allied fire as an atrocity. Hirshson also liberally quotes from sources with known animosity toward Patton. Wood, Devers, etc. were self-serving in their comments and Hughes was the worst of the lot. The most disappointing aspect of this book is what's missing. I had expected that Hirshson, as a biographer of General W.T. Sherman, would have spent some time drawing an analogy between their careers al la Victor Davis Hanson's book The Soul of Battle. Sherman and Patton were both great generals who cut wide swaths through the enemy with their armies. Both men were considered crazy by many of their peers. Both men's careers were jeopardized because of political naivete. In summary, this book is an hysterical portrayal of Patton and should be read only after more balanced accounts."},{"Title":"General Patton: A Soldier's Life","review":"I'll admit, I'm an avid admirer of George S Patton Jr and it was for that reason I was enthusiatic about reading &quot;General Patton: A Soldier's Life.&quot; I was very disappointed. I thought the author went out of his way to disparage GEN Patton but even when he sighted failures and controversial events, I was unimpressed with his supporting arguments. I also thought the book was poorly organized and at times confusing. The author would unexpectly jump forward or backward in time with little warning or explanation. I found it very distracting. Finally, I was confused by the author's seeming &quot;love affair&quot; w/Maj.-Gen. John S. Wood, CG 4th Armor Div. The book was about GEN Patton yet the author seemed to go out of his way to praise GEN Wood even when it didn't seem to have any connection with what he was relating about GEN Patton.I'm probably being generous by giving the book 2 stars but any book on GEN Patton starts out with 1. Read it if you've read all the other excellent books on GEN Patton and you have the time."},{"Title":"General Patton: A Soldier's Life","review":"This biography is splendidly researched, and that counts for a lot in a book that covers as much time and as many events as this one does. But, it is also rather bland. The writing is mechanical, merely an effort to get all the facts in place for the reader. There is never any fire to the words, no sparkle in the sentences.If you have never read a biography of Patton, this book will do. But, if you happened to have read the wonderful &quot;Genius For War&quot; that came out a few years ago, this work concerning George Patton's life will bore you. There is really no new information here, just a few different interpretations of that info.I had hoped, when I opened this book, that I would find a brand new take on the life of this fascinating general. However, it wasn't so, and that is not necessarily the fault of Stanley Hirshson. Patton was Patton. He was vibrantly, emphatically &quot;Patton&quot;, and he didn't leave a lot of room for anyone to reinterpret his life."},{"Title":"General Patton: A Soldier's Life","review":"This book is quite bad with the analysis, and if you want to read a book about Patton's life, D'Este's work is the one to go to. Some of the conclusions are simply lunacy, unfounded in anything but the writers opinion, as mentioned before of Patton's fiery speeches. Did these cause atrocities? Do not even kid me with this. I've read too much to be suckered in by this book."},{"Title":"General Patton: A Soldier's Life","review":"Overall, GENERAL PATTON: A SOLDIER'S LIFE is a good, solid, if unspectacular tracing of George Patton's life.There is a photograph in the book that shows Bing Crosby visiting a war zone to entertain the troops. The crooner has eschewed a steel helmet, and wears instead a less-protective soft cap. The caption announces that General Patton threatened, in fact, to have Bing Crosby court-martialed for his choice of headgear.Okay. So here's my question. Was General Patton being serious? (Which would mean he was a mean old son-of-a-gun.) Or was Old Blood and Guts just teasing? (Which would mean he had a caustic sense of humor). I don't know: nowhere in the body of the text is Bing Crosby mentioned.Similarly: George Patton's fatal car accident is mentioned. But we don't learn whether this was a dumb, avoidable car accident, or a one-in-a-million, odds-defying tragedy, or possibly a conspiracy. Stanley Hirshson, the book's author, doesn't take us to that level of detail.Similarly: we learn a good bit about George Patton's performance as an Olympic athlete. But we don't really learn what **Patton himself** felt about the experience. We just get second-hand stuff. Mustn't Patton have spoken or written about his pentathalon performance at some point? If so--let's have it!In short, this book will give you a good overview of Patton's life and it raises some interesting, even provocative ideas, but overall it remains just a bit flat and incomplete."},{"Title":"General Patton: A Soldier's Life","review":"His history is very interesting and exciting.

Anyone expecting to read a re-hashed version of the same war stories told in countless other biographies, will be shocked. Patton is shown to be more than the one dimensional warrior. It is indeed interesting to note the histories of the Patton families and how they affected Georgie Patton. It is also interesting to note the way that the Army of the early twentieth century worked politically. Details of his military actions were also well done, and at times surprising in what they revealed. This book will go to the front of my shelf of Patton books, in the place of honor."},{"Title":"General Patton: A Soldier's Life","review":"I am apalled at the tone that this book sets. While admittedly well researched, the author has gone to utmost lengths to disparge the memory of one of the greatest ever combat generals on all fronts.The ultimate accolade is when one's enemy admits to your greatness. In this &quot;Georgie&quot; was fortuanete. The German Army High Command thought him dangerous, Stalin was impressed, Eisenhower and Marshall repeatedly &quot;saved&quot; him for greater things, but Professor Hirshon is not impressed.Prior to D-Day, his presence in pretended planning tied up German divisions that could have been used in D-Day. His breakout and pursuit post D-Day was beyond compare. Turning the Third Army around and getting onto the offensive during the Battle of the Bulge even today is considered the ultimate in handling and Army at War. But that doesn't cut ice with Professor Hirshon either.One presumes that the decision to install his statue at west Point was made by a committee of morons.We are indeed luck that Patton's nanny and her closest blood relations to whom some form of oral history could have been passed on are long dead or not accessible to Professor Hirshon, or else he might have raked up something about how Patton didn't eat his food when he was three or maybe wet his bed.Whether Professor Hirshon likes it or not, George Smith Patton Jr., General, USA was and will remain a military icon, one of the best combat generals that the world has ever seen. A master in exploiting and executing the expanding torrent theory.The only reason this bok gets one star is because of it's subject.

I agree most with the comment re: \\"American Caesar.\\" I didn't expect this book to live up to William Manchester's portrayal of MacArthur, and it doesn't. Its prose is somewhat dull, but it is not poorly edited.I also don't think it's too anti-Patton. While reading, I find myself siding with Patton against his enemies, many of whom were as petty as he was at times. Ultimately, the book makes me want to read more, and I think that's a strike in its favor."},{"Title":"General Patton: A Soldier's Life","review":"Having read half a dozen books on GS Patton, including his Papers, War As I Knew It, Drive by his ADC, Charles Codman, and a host of WW2 Military History, this author wasted 12 years of research on his subject by attempting to advance preconcieved theories of little or no merit.Author Hirshson makes a big deal in his introduction of his research on Patton being the most exhaustive and belittling other authors on the same subject. Unfortunately he doesn't back up his brag with fact. Actually, Hirshson seems ignorant of many basics on his subject and the history of WW2.Repeating half a dozen times that Patton's ADC (Aide de Camp) Charles Codman had been a spirits buyer before the war, Hirshson claims Patton recruited him for that reason alone, without backing up the claim. He quotes third party conversations of Codman to Liddel Hart which are contrary to the material in Codman's book concerning Patton. Given that \\"Drive\\" was published after Codman had died in 1957, that published work must be considered to be Codman's final word on GSP, not nebulous third party conversations.Author Hirshson repeatedly tries to make out Patton as an anti-semite, if not closet Nazi. Patton's personal and professional associations included those of the jewish persuasion and he was certainly no more 'anti-semetic' than the normal WASP patrician of his age, including Roosevelt. This repeated claim is patentedly absurd.The narrative in this book is very confusing. While not all historians are gifted writers such as Winston Churchill, poor writers need to avail themselves of editors. This book is in sore need of an editor.For 30 pages the author refers to Grow without giving military title nor unit, so it is assumed by the reader he is referring to General Gerow and that it is a typo. Then we find out he is referring to a division commander, not an army corps commander.The tortured sentence structure and poor writing send the reader back to re-read the passage several times. At times there is no bridge between one section and another. All of a sudden we are in the midst of \\"Cobra\\" without explanation that it was activation of the Third Army on 1 August 44. Confusing to say the least.Much ado is made of the \\"slapping incidents\\" and a couple isolated cases of shooting POW's in Sicily. That's war, death happens. But it is clear the author has no personal experience in uniform and is poorly informed on such matters when he refers to army officers attending a party in \\"their dress blues\\". Sorry Charlie, Army has dress \\"greens\\" the Marines have \\"dress blues\\".Additionally, Hirshson in his attempt to paint Patton as an anti-semite, fails to mention the Third Army liberation of concentration camps and the order of GSP that the local German population be marched through Ohrdruf when that was liberated. Further, the author says members of the press came to Buchenwald and left in 3 minutes. Perhaps some of them did, but Edward R. Murrow's report from there on the radio certianly took more than 3 minutes research.This type of work is an example of modern historical \\"pull down\\" writing, where great men such as George Patton are pulled down by the works of insignificant little men such as Hirshson. That he teaches on a faculty at a University is more an indictment of our current educational system than is his work an indictment of a great military commander.There are many more glaring ommissions and absurdities in this book, but let this evil of the day suffice. The author spent so much of his time gazing at the forest he could not see the trees, nor write about either intelligently.This book needs an editor, a re-write, and a trimming of 200 pages of dross to render it good. As Artistole said, the truth is such that no man may grasp it entirely, nor may any man miss it entirely. That's the best way to sum up this volume."},{"Title":"General Patton: A Soldier's Life","review":"Grabbed this in an airport prior to a flight.

It took 12 years to research and write the book. I think it must have been researched as well as it could have been but then the author simply makes a dry listing of facts. The book comes out very large, with maybe a few minor details that were not common knowledge before. It is much less interesting than it should be. I think the author should have spent the extra time in the writing instead of pure research. The few personal ideas the author puts out are questionable in my opinion. For instance, he claims that the two massacres attributed to American troops in Italy were caused by Patton&#146;s fiery speeches before battles. Personally, I don&#146;t believe that would be sufficient cause for such an event. It&#146;s apparent that the author doesn&#146;t like Patton. Maybe I don&#146;t either, but he was the right man for the job he had in the war. I don&#146;t think combat generals should be required to be likable. Patton&#146;s use of tanks in the lightning fast attacks reminiscent of German blitzkrieg was a necessary tactic and only a few American generals realized that need. I thought that a few of the other generals looked worse than Patton in this listing and less competent. Even in this book, Patton is recognized as a tactical genius."},{"Title":"General Patton: A Soldier's Life","review":"I had to stop reading this book after about 60 pages, due to the exauhsting format of reading about everyone other than Patton.

But in many ways, like the historical fate of Ariel Sharon(another brash military genious), Patton has been attacked. Accused of not obbeying orders in Sicily(which he didnt), accused of doing little more in North Africa then let the Germans surrender(the British sopposedly having already beaten them) and accused of stealing gas tor ace across France while the British and american infantry did most of the work.Well lets analyze this more closely. THis book is a revisionist account. Well researched but badly presented. it starts from the beggining. it does not give Patton the credit he deserves for his genious in the Lousiana Manuevers. Then the author(due to his agenda) must disparige Patton in North Africa. Of course the reality is that the American army was a disaster in N. Africa prior to Patton, he energized the troops(who had been shattered in their first encounters with veteran German units).Then the author must repeat the accusation the Patton was a failure in Sicily. Lets get this straigt. Patton and his men went three times as far as the British units and crushed twice the opposition, eventually capturing the two biggest cities on the island, and thats a failure. Its only a failure in the eyes of someone who wants everyone tof ollow orders no matter how irrational. patton was unorthodox like Stonewall, thats what wins wars, not textbooks.Patton 'Genious for War' is the superior account. Written by veteran historian Carlo D'Este it presents a balanced and good portrait of this military genious, a true character, a lot better then General Wesly Clark(Ashley Wilkes)."},{"Title":"General Patton: A Soldier's Life","review":"Writing is about more than researching. This is the worst written, worst edited book I've ever read. Scribblings from Professor Hirshson's notes - I had to stop after 76 pages."},{"Title":"General Patton: A Soldier's Life","review":"Hirshson's Patton: A Soldier's Life is the only book I have read on the life of Gen. George Patton. Hirshson's book is a result of massive research and for that alone the author is to be commended. If the subject of the book were someone other than the colorful Patton, this would be a very arduous read.Like many who are drawn to the character of Patton, I think most would give credit to the movie in which Patton was wonderfully portrayed by the late George C. Scott. I can not intelligently say whether this book uncovers any new ground-breaking information on Patton, but the book is still worth reading.Patton believed he was destined to play some integral part in a major war. You get that sense from the book and the movie. It is hard to comprehend that someone could actually wish for war, but Patton probably more than anyone fits this description.Reading from letters written by Patton are all very informative as they would be about any figure in history. I especially was interested in what he thought of other generals. I knew he had some disdain for Gen. Montgomery, but he apparently was not too impressed with Eisenhower either. He even considered Gen. Bradley of the higher caliber of mediocrity.While this book likes to deal with Patton's faults and controversies, as any good book should, even Hirshson admits Patton was probably the greatest tactician of the allied commanders.Patton was clearly not a beloved general like a Washington or a Lee, but he was feared and respected. Patton had attributes that are worthy of rebuke, but he knew how to fight and strike fear into the hearts of the enemy."},{"Title":"General Patton: A Soldier's Life","review":"Mr. Hirshson tells us that he took some years to research the book. Well I guess when you try to find all the skeletons in ones closet, look long enough and you will find them. What really surprised me was the very short mention of G S Pattons so called accident that brought on his untimely death.A four star General has an accident and so little is written. Mr. Hirshson did not find any more or did not want to write more about it, we shall never know. Maybe it is better so. But the book is not worth riding."},{"Title":"General Patton: A Soldier's Life","review":"I will be giving specific examples of the problems with this book which some may consider plot spoilers.This is very poor scholarship. Besides being overtly biased it contains serious errors in logic. For instance, on page 182 it states Eisenhower utilized Patton's notes to earn good standing at the Command and General Staff College (see page 801 Blumenson's Patton Papers Volume 2 for confirmation of this) but in the next paragrap Hirshson says Ike graduated before Patton. Likewise, on page 197 he states Patton's writings were to justify the Cavalry's existence which blatently ignores Patton had been ordered not to write anything contrary to Doctrine. Something someone who spent years researching this book would easily have found. Similar errors abound throughout the text. On page 523 he says Patton denied General Woods a Corps command perhaps because he feared him, but on page 553 the author says Patton did his best to secure a Corps command for Woods-a complete contridictions of his previous statement. In fact, the author frequently cites General Woods criticisms of Patton as proof the latter was a poor commander. However, the utilization of Woods as a source is a poor choice because he remained embittered toward Patton. Feelings the author admits Woods had on page 564. Overall the book is a thinly disguised attack on Patton whom the author calls such things a 'right wing'. There are a number of more balanced biographies of Patton and anyone interested in this historical figure would be much better served by reading one of them."},{"Title":"General Patton: A Soldier's Life","review":"Aside from excellent points made by other reviewers, I found Hirsohson's book full of repetitions, untenable assumptions or conclusions and in some cases too much detail; all of which reminded me of the lecture of a brilliant history professor who has been kept on the job too long and whose mind is approaching senility. There is useful new information about Patton and some of his subordinate generals but this is not the \\"definitive\\" biography."},{"Title":"General Patton: A Soldier's Life","review":"While I'm not as well versed in the historical accuracy of this book, it's clear to me the author was diligent in his research.To me, that makes this book credible on nearly every level which is the most important part of a biography. It truly stinks to spend 2 weeks reading a book only to find out some of the information presented as facts are actually fiction. That is not the case here.The author does paint an unflattering picture of Patton at times, but I think he is justified because let's face it, Patton was flawed. He was an outstanding field general. The author points that out. But he was an egomaniac, a racist, and foul-mouthed even by military standards. Yet Patton was critical of other WWII leaders - especially Montgomery - for many of these same faults... clearly hypocritcal.My one big complaint with this book is a complaint I have with a lot of military history. I need better and more maps to keep track of what is going on. When ever I read military history I get bogged down in the details and lose focus. Including more maps that are easier to read seems like an easy thing to do, but for some reason this book has about 10 maps and they are not very helpful. How about 40 maps that clearly depict advances and detail troop movements the way they are actually described in the writing.I especially like the viewpoints of Patton's PR officer Quirk toward the end of the book. Those were very interesting. I also liked the way he portrayed Patton's dismissal and untimely death. He painted a picture of a man that was used as a scapegoat, then uses evidence to back that up. Patton's supposed lack of denazifying the German government was overblown and the author supports that point by detailing the outrage of the nation when Patton was dismissed. However, when you consider Patton's anti-semitic nature it is clear why the General was dismissed. And, I really like the way the author points out the fitting way that Patton was burried and dispells some of the myths of Patton at the end of this book.I would suggest if you are looking for a book on Patton, you could find a better read and would suggest reading some of the other reviewers who have suggested alternatives. However, I won't downgrade the authors somewhat slanted view of Patton. He credits the General when he deserves it and points out his flaws that were clear for everyone to see."},{"Title":"General Patton: A Soldier's Life","review":"Author went out of his way to avoid even the least amount of positive reflection upon Patton. Most work is taken out of context as the story jumps around. I would avoid this book as it makes no attempt to present any type of balance. Episodes which are well documented are avoided if they show Patton's ability.Other books do a more balanced job showing a man who is hard to define."},{"Title":"General Patton: A Soldier's Life","review":"This book reminds me of the excellent biography of Vince Lombardi by David Maraniss. Hirshson makes the case for the greatness of Patton not just because of the leadership skills so often turned into almost mythical proportions, but mostly because he happened to be the most knowledgeable cavalry officer in the Army. Hirshson's Patton is a great general and a great leader because he knew more than his reports or his peers about the nature of war and the method of success based on the technology of the day. Success came from more than leadership and willingness to act, it also came from sheer knowledge and preparedness to make use of that knowledge on the battlefield.Hirshson's Patton is more than a blow-hard, he was a student, a technologist, a practioner, and most of all, a warrior that made use of the other aspects of himself he honed before the battle.For anyone interested in Patton or interested in learning from great leaders, this is the book for you. For senior managers who strive to hire great functional managers but have difficulty controlling their independence, this book will also provide sustenance that contrarian experts are worth it, even though the cost of some obstinacy can cause the occasional stomach twitch or two."},{"Title":"General Patton: A Soldier's Life","review":"As noted by other reviewers, the author has a forward where he pats himself on the back for the extensive research he has done with primary sources that other Patton biographers haven't. But most of the sources prove to be a waste of time. The detailed material he provides about the Patton's ancestors is completely irrelevant to an understanding of the man, it is filler that could be greatly abbreviated. We really don't need to read quotes from letters they sent each other.The author also pads the book by repeating, word for word, quotes or paragraphs contining conclusions he has made in diffgerent parts of the book. Does he really think we've forgotten what we've already read? His writing is also strangely stilted at times, using verb and adjectives that don't seem to fit the context of the paragraphs.I was not offended by the opinion that Patton's irrational, hyperbolic pep talks to the troops encouraged the atrocities that they committed, I think that it is a fair conclusion and part of Patton's character as shown by other statements, acknowledged by other biographers, and Patton, himself. He shot off his mouth without thinking.Another flaw of the book is the maps. The author gives great detail about the places attacked, passed through, avoided, etc. but the maps show only the larger towns.The author's conclusion is that Patton was a great tactical general with many character flaws, which seems to be an accurate assessment.It just isn't a well written book."},{"Title":"General Patton: A Soldier's Life","review":"I really enjoyed reading this work. I thought the style was very readable and the of course the subject matter was very interesting.The other reviewers of this work dislike the fact that Hirshson blames Patton's speeches for the atrocities in Italy. Agreed the assertion is silly but it is clearly opinion. The author also clearly thinks that the general was too dismissive of academcs and reporters etc.All in all I think it is well worth the read. As with any work this ones shows the reader much about the author in addition to the subject. I learned much about WWII and WWI. I found the Tank/Calvary intellectual battle that went on throughout Patton's career very interesting.I would recomend the book. I would also note that the author is not a &quot;Blood and Guts&quot; kinda guy."},{"Title":"General Patton: A Soldier's Life","review":"This, is with out a doubt, the worst biography I have ever read. Although Professor Hirshson may be quite the historian and loves doing research, he really should have stayed awake during his composition writing class during his undergraduate studies.This book (all 700+ page) was nothing but pure agony to read.That was 50 hours of my life I will never get back. Save your time and money. Read something worth while."},{"Title":"General Patton: A Soldier's Life","review":"Having read numerous military biographies in the past I found this book quite interesting. As some of the other posts have stated this book is good but not great. General Patton was a great soldier, but he did have his problems and this is verified in history. I think the best part of this book is the fact that it is very detailed in General Patton's relationship with Ike, Monty, Bradley, Wood and so on. It also talked about the fact that General Patton only surrounded himself with the best staff. I think what was not so great is that there is a lot of detail about the Patton family history that I really didn't need to know. For example, I really didn't know what revalence Nita's (General Patton's sister) relationship with General Pershing added to the story. I would say that this is a story worth reading for comparison purposes alone. I also was a little disappointed in the end. I would have like a little more detail about his death and the reaction of America and the world's military leaders upon his death."},{"Title":"General Patton: A Soldier's Life","review":"This is a detailed and uneven biography of an interesting military leader who became a celebrity. The narrative is rich in detail and attempts to both tell Patton's life story in addition to providing an analysis of his personality, leadership style, and provide insight into some of Patton's very nasty prejudices. The verdict appears to be that Patton was an excellent Battle field tactical commander as well as one of the first to recognize the value of the tank and its impact on the battle field. But he had a hard time when it came to understanding the strategy of the larger campaign and being a team player. His anti British, anti Jewish, and anti Russian prejudice impacted his disastrous attempt to govern and de-Nazify Bavaria after the war. And Hirshson points out that the effects of Patton's \\"kill the bastard\\" speeches was disastrous leading to as many as five atrocities including the murder of civilians. And Patton's famous slapping of the soldiers in the field hospital is well explained from all points of view. So why did Eisenhower put up with Patton? Simply because he won! And victory in total war was more important than style points.I found the early pages of the book most entertaining and interesting as they cover Patton growing up in San Gabriel Valley in Southern California. His father ran for Senate as a Democrat and Patton then married into a rich Conservative (very right wing) family and adopted their views and prejudices as he got older.This is not a great book. For a really great book turn, for example, to William Manchester's \\"American Caesar\\". American Caesar demonstrates that Manchester is a most extraordinary writer. Hirshson is not a very good writer. But I do think Hirshson has a lot to offer in his controversial very detailed biography of General Patton. (From reading other reviews posted on Amazon I wonder if I read the same book as many others. Are so many so desperate for a hero without flaws?) I'm glad I never had to serve under someone like the REAL Patton when I was stationed with 14th Armored Cavalry in Germany. Decide for yourself and check this one out."},{"Title":"Shakespeare","review":"How often have you encountered a book on Shakespeare or his works that attains a level of writing that is often heart-meltingly gorgeous, even at times comparable to the beauty of the Shakespeare quotations it contains? Probably only once, and this is the book.A helpful introduction by David Lehman reminds us that Mark Van Doren was a celebrated professor of literature at Columbia University, and a poet of considerable accomplishment, who served as mentor to a long list of students who later achieved great things. In his courses he generally spoke without notes, and this 1939 book on Shakespeare's works was also written without notes or references, other than a well-thumbed one-volume edition of the works, printed in about 1906.Any modest power of description which I might possess fails utterly for this exquisite book. Instead, let me give a sample of Van Doren's commentary: \\"It may well be that Shakespeare in 'The Tempest' is telling us for the last time, or consciously for the last time, about the world. But what he is telling us cannot be simple, or we could agree that it is this or that. Perhaps it is this: that the world is not simple. Or, mysteriously enough, that it is what we all take it to be. Any set of symbols, moved close to this play, lights up as if in an electric field. Its meaning, in other words, is precisely as rich as the human mind, and it says that the world is what it is. But what the world is cannot be said in a sentence. Or even in a poem as complete and beautiful as 'The Tempest.'\\""},{"Title":"Shakespeare","review":"Highly recommended for someone who has some familiarity with the plays and wants to see this terrain through sharper eyes. This is not \\"CliffsNotes.\\" These are essays by a master critic who loves Shakespeare, written *for* readers who love Shakespeare. But be prepared when Van Doren plays the critic, not the worshipper. If your favorite is \\"Henry V,\\" for example, keep an open mind and wince along.A pleasant aspect of this book is that you can take the essays in any order. This means that if, like me, you know some of the more popular plays (Hamlet, Othello, Macbeth, Lear, Julius Ceasar), but not some of the seldom-performed ones (Titus Andronicus, Troilus and Cressida, King John, Pericles), you can see what Van Doren has to say about \\"your\\" plays and then come back when you have hunted up the others.Van Doren's prose is familiar, easy, and full of love. It is almost a conversation, and hardly less a joy to read than Shakespeare himself."},{"Title":"Shakespeare","review":"I have always loved Shakespeare but, even though I have studied it, sometimes, he is a little difficult to pin down on what exactly he is saying or meaning and it is often hard to get the feel or mood for certain scenes. After all, he was a playwright, not a journalist! And he wrote five centuries ago in the idiomatic English of that time. This critique is absolutely brilliant. Van Doren's feelings on Shakespeare are that he wrote his plays to be enacted on a mostly-bare stage in front of a noisy crowd of Joe Q. Publics, not enacted in an elaborate hushed stage setting in front of a group of phychologist, phychoanalists, etc. I have often felt that some critics see deep, mystical, dark meanings in Shakespeare that he never intended (I feel it is more a reflection of the critic's own phyche). Not to say that Shakespeare is shallow! I feel his &quot;well-written&quot; plays are awesome and unmatched by anyone, anywhere, anytime. Van Doren brings Shakepeare to the light of day in a clear, logical, yet so very elegant way.

Most people are unaware that the most decisive and the largest battles of WW11 were on the Eastern Front: Moscow, Stalingrad and Kursk. The well documented stories of Dunkirk, Battle of Britain, Normandy, North Africa, and Hollywood's celluloid myths about these are eclipsed in reality by the sheer size and ferocity of the war in the Eastern Front. The world will never see land battles of this enormous size again. And in these wars which produced a clutch of brilliant military commanders on both sides, Marshal Georgi Zhukov was surely the greatest of all.This book is factually very interesting to the student of military history and Salisbury's editing and notes are excellent. The only drawback, as usual, is the lack of larger detailed maps to follow the campaigns. It is also interesting to political students for the glimpses of Stalin as Soviet Supreme Commander behind this gigantic enterprise. He comes out much better than in the descriptins by Western writers, despite his initial blunders in this war when he failed to recognise the German threat."},{"Title":"Marshal Zhukov's greatest battles,","review":"Most Americans have no idea as to how the Russians suffered at the handsof Hitler's invading army. Still fewer realize that had Hitler beenvictorious there, the outcome of WWII may have been very different.After sustaining continuous and devastating losses to his military andcivilians, Stalin put Georgi Zhukov in charge of the entire defense. Thisbook is his own story of the battles- Moscow, Stalingrad and Kursk- thatturned the tide against Germany despite seemingly unsurmountable odds.He ends with the battle of Berlin, where the Germans pay so dearly fortheir earlier treachery and atrocities against Russia. There was nomilitary commander in WWII, and perhaps in history, who was smarter,tougher or more dedicated to his country than Marshal Zhukov. After thewar, Stalin delegated him to obscure duty in Siberia because he felt sothreatened by Zhukov's popularity. It was not until Stalin's death thatZhukov received the recognition he deserved. Despite appearing to suffer a bit in the translation, this book is a must read for students of WWII."},{"Title":"Marshal Zhukov's greatest battles,","review":"Marshal Zhukov was Russia's greatest World War II general and probably the greatest military figure to emerge from that war. In this account he tells for the first time the story of four of the most colossal military engagements of our day - the Battle of Moscow, the Battle of Stalingrad, the little known, yet crucial, Battle of Kursk-Orel and the climactic Battle of Berlin. This account of four of World War II's most colossal battles presents these epic conflicts from the perspective of the man largely responsible for Russia's mot decisive victories during the Patriotic War. But this is not merely military history. Marshal Zhukov reveals the inside story of conflicts and controversy between himself and Josef Stalin. Her writes in intimate details of discussions in the Kremlin leading to the critical decisions in World War II. He levies savage indictments against a number of Soviet military men. Marshal Zhukov in not only a towering military figure. He has participated in some of the most dramatic political events of the post war years. The Marshal's account of his greatest battles not only illuminates the history and course of World War II. It throws penetrating light on the muderous quarrels which raged within the Kremlin even while Russia's fate hung in the balance and Hitler's armies swept to the outskirts of Leningrad and Moscow and surged across the Ukraine, capturing Kiev and driving on to Stalingrad. Marshal Zhukov's narrative is presented with an introductory analysis and commentary by Harrison E. Salisbury, author of THE 900 DAYS. With maps, photos, 304 pages."},{"Title":"Marshal Zhukov's greatest battles,","review":"I ordered the book for my husband since he likes the military history. I've checked the book and want to compare it with the original Zhukov's memoirs. Yes,I've read an original Russian copy of the book that was first published in 1960 during the Soviet regime. I can tell the Russian one like 5 or more times bigger. It contains photos of the Marshal himself in different ages and stages of his career as well as photos from archives of the Wars. He'd started his military career before the revolution of 1917. The Russian version also describes a big part of the Marshal's life, not only the battles. His incredibly hard life as a child, those restrictions that he'd faced in the Soviet country. His 3 heart attacks that gave him not the wars but some of the heads of the Soviet regime. After the Great Victory, Soviet people treated Zhukov like the Savior and for sure Stalin'd seen him like the rival. The only thing that saved Marshal's life that time was Stalin's apprehension of the people who would never forgive the execution. Stalin's followers have also tried to hold the Marshal as far from the power as it was possible. The full version of the book would give you much more information and help to understand how he had become the one of the greatest generals of the history. I wish they would have the full version available in English. But for those who interested only in description of the battles it is a good book. Everything is proving by historians.

German lost more than 8 millions in this war.

Wrong statistics again?Yes, German started the war with 1,5 millions soldiers in JUne 1941, but by December 1942 they army had some much more soldiers.Besides, Romanian and Italian troops took part in Stalingrad battle. Italy lost in Stalingrad more soldiers than in the whole WWII, did you know that?I understand it's hard to believe in 1.5 millions loses after reading about \\"one of the most important battle in WWII\\" in Ameican historical books, the battle for Northern Africa, where 40,000 soldiers from both sides were engaged!

For instance, he said that the enemy lost 1.5 million soldiers, 3500+ tanks, 3000+ airplanes etc in stalingrad. He actually multiplied each figure with 10. If germans had lost 1.5 million (half of the their original total strength that attacked russia)men in stalingrad they would not have left much to fight with.

I have tried and TRIED, but the painfully cliched writing is only part of the problem. The events are so ludicrous and bizarre, and what's worse: unbiblical.I've read the Bible cover to cover a few times and have studied eschatology (end times) extensively. Trust me when I say the Bible says NOTHING about babies disappearing from wombs, Tribulation Forces, a Russian war on Israel...omigosh, I could go on and on (how do they come up with this stuff??). For a real examination of end times, read Steve Gregg's Revelation: Four Views. He lets the reader decide through a dissemination of the four main views of eschatology...because yes, Virginia, there is more than ONE view!Anyway, Right behind was a blast to read. It's laugh out loud funny and right on the mark. My only complaint is that it wasn't long enough. Maybe if more characters cried themselves to sleep?"},{"Title":"Right Behind: A Parody of Last Days Goofiness","review":"This book is EXTREMELY funny. Those who complained about this book making fun of \\"serious\\" concepts need to lighten up and take themselves less seriously... making fun of the \\"Left Behind\\" series is NOT equivalent to making fun of the book of Revelation, but it certainly DOES make fun of the Left Behind's rather far-fetched interpretation of Revelation. People, using the \\"Left Behind\\" approach to interpreting Revelation, you could make the Book of Revelations mean ALMOST ANYTHING YOU WANT IT TO BE and refer to ALMOST ANY EVENT. Books like \\"Left Behind\\" have come out every few decades, and guess what - their predictions are ALWAYS wrong!Anyway, this book does a great job with both the humor and the theology part. He does a great job showing the extreme silliness of the \\"Left Behind\\" approach to Revelation.To those who thought that this book was \\"making fun of Revelations,\\" I must repeat my objection that this book is NOT making fun of the Bible or the Book of Revelations. The author is definitly making fun of the following:1. The weak-mindedness that seems to prevail in too many churches.2. The poor writing style in the \\"Left Behind\\" series.3. The \\"Left Behind\\" series' rather far-fetched interpretations of Revelations.4. Dispensationalism and dispensational eschatology in general.Definitely recommended."},{"Title":"Right Behind: A Parody of Last Days Goofiness","review":"I should begin by saying I really hated 'Left Behind.' I felt it was glamorized, manipulative clap-trap on a 6th grade reading level. That said, if you did like 'Left Behind,' you should probably read this book anyhow because it will point out all of the flaws in 'Left Behind' and give you something new to think about.It is also hysterical. Parts were laugh out loud funny. To get the full effect though, you should at least skim 'Left Behind.' 'Right Behind' is a true master parody in that it doesn't simply make slapstick fun, but seriously critiques the ideas and implications of its source material. As a Christian, I had serious problems with 'Left Behind,' both in the ideas presented and the pitifully grade-school writing. 'Right Behind' made me realize why.It occasionally drags into problem territory where it speaks way to much above the story, in the process losing the reader's interest. The book sometimes needs to realize that what's so great about it IS the story. Overall though, I highly recommend this very funny and thoughtful book."},{"Title":"Right Behind: A Parody of Last Days Goofiness","review":"Absolutely great book.

I own 3 books which delve into the subject matter. I can honestly say that the 'Left Behind' series, while entertaining, certainly does not desearve the hallowed place which it currently resides within American Evangelical Christianity. End times prophecy is simply too symbolic and imprecise to draw any extraordinary conclusions.This book is a breath of fresh air. Right behind accurately hits on all of the fallacies commited by its famous namesake. Not only does 'Right Behind' point out the theological problems in 'Left Behind' but it also points out how poorly written 'Left Behind' actually is.This book had me going back and forth between it and my copy of 'Left Behind'.

But even those who have not read any of the &quot;Left Behind&quot; books will find some humor in this quick read.Wilson (and Mr. Sock) poke fun at not only the plot of the first (of 12!) &quot;Left Behind&quot; book, but at the practices of writing &quot;bad endtimes&quot; fiction.Some of my favorite bits were the ones that back away from the plot of the novel to examine the silliness of it all, such as when &quot;Buff&quot; argues with his editor about whether it's okay to use the same names that were used in the original novel, or if they'll all get sued for that.I'd recommend this to anybody who isn't so incredibly devoted to the &quot;Left Behind&quot; books that they'd be too put off by the humor of &quot;Right Behind&quot; to appreciate it."},{"Title":"Right Behind: A Parody of Last Days Goofiness","review":"This is the best way to deal with all the Left Behind stuff!The book doesn't make fun gently.

It picks apart every flaw from the book Left Behind. The series as a whole is good but the original book of the series leaves much to be desired, and I admit, I've thought of the things that Wilson pokes fun at in the book. Espically his spoof of the already lame names in the original book, such as \\"Buff Williamson\\" and Haddie: The Whore of Babylon. As a scale of humor alone this book was great. Naturally, it will be funnier to those who have read Left Behind. Everything from Buford Tin (a pillow obsessed flight attendant in this book) picking up left behind appendixes, make up smears and implants in the \\"big tube part\\" of the plane to \\"Old Nick\\" Jarvis the Anti-Christ in his lesiure suit to characters constantly crying themselves to sleep will have you rolling on the floor.Great book, one of the funniest things that I've seen, and I've seen a lot of funny things."},{"Title":"Right Behind: A Parody of Last Days Goofiness","review":"&quot;I laughed all the way through this book,&quot; I said.&quot;Is it really that funny?&quot; my wife said.&quot;Yes, I said.&quot;&quot;Why did you say 'I said'?&quot; she said.&quot;You will have to read the book to find out,&quot; I said. &quot;You will also find out lots of other interesting stuff, like what happens to your dental fillings and clothes when you are Raptured,&quot; I also said.I heartily recommend this book.

When you are ready to read something serious again, get a copy of Gary DeMar's _End Times Fiction_."},{"Title":"Right Behind: A Parody of Last Days Goofiness","review":"I must admit, this book was sort of a guilty pleasure for me. A satirical parody of the Left Behind series, it was one of the most fun reads I've enjoyed in quite some time. Certainly the only time in recent memory when I have laughed out loud for the entire length of a book! Which, at only 105 pages, meant a good solid 90-minutes of joy.Those unfamiliar or unaccustomed with satire should probably stay away from this one. On the other hand, anyone who, like me, absolutely LOVED the Douglas Adams Hitchhiker's Guide series will appreciate Wilson's writing style. On the surface, it may come across as just plain dumb, but it takes true genius to write something so intentionally stupid. It's really quite clever.Wilson's biting yet winsome writing pokes fun at many stereotypes within the evangelical culture, such as Christian bookstores, cable networks, and consumerism. Most of all, though, he critiques dispensational theology and the horrid writing style of most books in the genre of prophetic apocalyptic fiction.Enjoying this book probably depends on a prior familiarity with the original Left Behind series. As someone who actually trudged through all twelve of the LaHaye/Jenkins books, though, I was thoroughly amused by all of his subtle (and not-so-subtle!) references to the originals.Moment of self-disclosure here: I originally began reading the Left Behind series at about the time the sixth book was published. I devoured the first half of the series like it was candy, and was drawn hook, line, & sinker into LaHaye's system of prophetic interpretation. In my defense, I was a college freshman at the time, and didn't really know any better. I had never actually read much of my Bible, and certainly not any of the prophetic passages. It took a while to realize that God's Word is so very much better than fiction! By the time the last book came out I had seen the light. I no longer cared for dispensationalism, and had realized how terrible the writing was in the series... I just can't stand to not finish a series once I've started it!Anyway, if you are into satirical writing and not into the pre-trib Rapture, you'll want to check this one out."},{"Title":"Right Behind: A Parody of Last Days Goofiness","review":"It is important to laugh at ourselves once in a while.

Dig, study, learn, and never settle for simplistic preaching without scratching the surface to see if there is any real substance underneath.

Noone will need hold your hand on the journey any longer."},{"Title":"Right Behind: A Parody of Last Days Goofiness","review":"This book is good.

He shows in a very compelling way some of the flaws of evangelicalism, of which all of Christendom is a part. He points out the shallowness of the sentimentalism which causes a lot of warm, fuzzy feelings but never really drives anyone to action (James 2:14-17). Throughout the book, he shows that the church today cares almost nothing for the physical realm, only caring for that which is spiritual. Christians often say, \\"My citizenship is in heaven, so nothing on this earth matters.\\" This is the reason why much of the church today will pray about some need but then never DO anything about it. The church needs both of these if it wants to succeed. Nate Wilson explains in back of the book that we are part of the Evangelical community ourselves and that \\"In order to mature, Evangelicals need to move beyond the bumper sticker shallowness of the past four decades and long for true wisdom. Parodying our silliness is one small nudge in that direction. To whom much is given, much is expected.\\""},{"Title":"Right Behind: A Parody of Last Days Goofiness","review":"I never read any of the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series, but I know the theology and mindset all too well. This brilliant parody dismantles premillenial dispensationalism, the shallowness of the evangelical subculture, and the shoddy quality of the great majority of Christian fiction all in one hilarious fell swoop. The Antichrist, a former preacher from Tulsa (!), engineers a phony Rapture that leaves Christians stuck on ceilings, leaving behind their appendixes and any clothing that is not 100% cotton. The showdown between one of the &quot;heroes&quot; and the Antichrist in a Christian bookstore, where the Antichrist is pelted with Precious Moments figurines and is attacked with the help of a Thomas Kinkade painting is a real side-splitter.This book is definitely not recommended for Christians who have no sense of humor. Ah, what the heck, they should read it, too. Might be good for them to get a little offended now and then. After all, Jesus offended the religious of his time, although He did it in a much less satirical fashion."},{"Title":"Right Behind: A Parody of Last Days Goofiness","review":"It's gotta be something in the Wilson genes.

As a Born-Again, Bible-thumping follower of Jesus, an aspiring fiction writer, and an employee of a Christian bookstore, I can say with great confidence that there is much in the pop-Christian consumerist culture that is worthy of satirizing, and &quot;Right Behind&quot; is right on the money.(I think it's worth saying that while the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series has indeed been used to introduce people to Christ - more power to them! - it's not Biblical canon, and I'm a bit unnerved by those who treat it as such. After all, God uses the foolish things of man... &quot;Left Behind&quot; is also not the best of fiction, and the fact that the series has been so popular is perhaps indicative of the low expectations present in the Christian market. Then again, &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; is also a bestseller, so perhaps the fault is with the average American reader in general?)&quot;Right Behind&quot; is, to coin a phrase, a hoot. Wilson manages to nail the stylistic quirks, plot holes, and outright confounding contrivances of the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series, as well as some of the oddities of the Christian subculture in a brief amount of space and often with marvelous subtlety. I didn't get through a single page without an outburst of laughter. If you've enjoyed the satire of the magazine &quot;The Door,&quot; been fed up with the half-hearted quality of a great deal of Christian fiction, and have read the first of the &quot;Left Behind&quot; books, you should thoroughly enjoy this little gem.Even if you're a Fundie like me."},{"Title":"Right Behind: A Parody of Last Days Goofiness","review":"... yup, as an individual who actually sat through a year of Sunday morning Bible study of dispensational escatology taught by none other than Tim LaHaye, I have to say this book is a kipper.

It only fails in that Right Behind does a better job at keeping my attention with a fast pace ... and though a parody ... with better technical detail than it's &quot;Left&quot; counterpart.All the while it takes aim at the weird post-modern thinking that has infected the church through almost 200 years of anti-intellectualism ... with all the insane plot twists of the Hitchhiker's guide.In fact my wife, who also took the LaHaye class with me, is upstairs Right Behind my book marks, laughing out loud."},{"Title":"Right Behind: A Parody of Last Days Goofiness","review":"This book was priceless. True, its a whole 7 years too late in coming (sounds ominous, doesn't it? Isn't something supposed to happen seven years after the rapture spoken about in Left Behind? I guess this series hasn't been released in real time)... but hey, it needed to be written.I'll share some of my favorite passages:Page 19: \\"We left Buford surprised in the big tube part of the airplane. We join him again now. He walked out of the cockpit in time to suddenly see a woman walking toward him, but more importantly, towards the lav, which is what people in the know call the airline restrooms. She had the kind of look that attracts TV Baptists. Her hair was big, bleached, and beautiful. Her face was tastefully painted, and her outfit was a very classy evening dress. Buford smiled. For a split second he thought neither of Haddie nor his wife. His mind and eyes walked toward him in slow motion. Suddenly she was gone. Her dress was empty and it slid down onto the floor under a pile of blonde wig. Buford stopped. He was surprised. The people on either side of the aisle were surprised, at least those who were still there. Some of them had dissapeared as well.\\"Page 30 and 31: \\"...there are only two options when writing apocalyptic literature,\\" Buff said. \\"The first is as follows: When writing dialogue, at the end or in the middle of every line the author must insert the phrase 'he said', 'she said', or someone's name followed by the word 'said.' Of course, real authors of fiction prefer the word 'said' to all the many creative options that an amateur will come up with. But they will lace it through their dialogue, not distracting from what is being said by saying 'said,' but using it so the reader can keep track of the speaker. Only the good apolalyptic writer, or an eigth grader writing for an assignment, will give you the 'said' phrase following every speech. But there is also the other option. The second option is to leave the speaker completely unnamed. This is useful because he is it hip and keeps the reader interested, because he is always trying to discern the speaker. It goes something like this:'Why?''What?''Where have you been?''Nowhere in particular. How is the Rapture treating you?''Well, the traffic is rough.''Is your mother still a masseuse?''Sure, you need a rubdown?''Are you ready for a physical relationship?''No.'\\"In this way the reader is forced to go back and count lines in order to discover the speaker.\\"The humor extends to more serious points, which subtly point out the gross errors in dispensational eschatology and theology. Page 43 points out their neo-gnostic leanings: \\"She got on her knees and crawled to a window. It wouldn't open. In a last reaction against the evils of the material world, she kicked the glass and crawled out into the sky.\\"Thankfully the author doesn't only parody the two dimensional characters and amateurish dialogues. He also points out the errors of dispensational theology and makes it fun to read about.Finally, since I've been among those who shakes his head when I see so many people reading the \\"Last Days Goofiness\\", I really needed to read this book to get a good laugh. The last book that I read that was even remotely funny was \\"An Objetive, Scholarly History of the Early Church\\" by Dave Hunt."},{"Title":"Right Behind: A Parody of Last Days Goofiness","review":"Okay, I admit it, I read the first book in the Left Behind series. It was moderately interesting, but I can't say I was dying to read the second one. This parody is relatively short, and there were about three scenes that just made me roll on the floor! The one in the Christian bookstore was *priceless*, and the author truly captured our crazy Christian culture. There were some cute suprises in the dialogues, things that make you giggle to yourself.Here you find an excellent and thoughtful critique of modern pop-Christianity all wrapped up in goofiness. You will find yourself laughing and thinking at the same time. There was so much potential in this project that I feel it didn't quite live up to. But overall, it was a joy to read, and I even read a few of the scenes out to my husband, who laughed as loud as I did. Those scenes earned this book four stars."},{"Title":"Right Behind: A Parody of Last Days Goofiness","review":"The good folks at Credenda/Agenda, a journal of Reformed theology and opinion, have issued a line of parodies skewering various forms of silliness that have overtaken the Evangelical Protestant landscape. Any who have read Credenda/Agenda know it is sometimes caustic, usually challenging, and always Calvinist. This series shows they can also be extremely funny - shattering the common image of Reformed folk as people whom God has predestined to be humorless.Right Behind is a truly cutting satire that joyfully pokes fun at the pretensions, bad theology, and \\"bunker mentality\\" of the Left Behind series by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins. Normally, a good parody concentrates on a particular trait that in any other context would be amusing and brings it to the forefront. The difficulty here is that the entire series is a ridiculous concoction that can make no sense outside of a narrow and distorted understanding of certain passages of Holy Scripture. An additional hurdle is that many readers of the series have no idea how badly they are written. It is a tribute to Wilson's writing skill (and comedic sense) that he so successfully pulls it off.Wilson leaves few stones unturned in mining the original series for laughs. The implausible plots, the absurd dialogue, the lack of any sense of historical or cultural understanding exhibited in the Left Behind series all come under a barrage of brilliant satire. The \\"battle scene\\" in a Christian bookstore is absolutely hilarious. Even the cover contains pointed jabs with the fact that LaHaye is not actually involved in the writing noted by having a sock puppet (Mr. Sock) as the prophecy expert/co-author. The common practice of authors endorsing books they have not read is also lampooned by including endorsement blurbs by St. Augustine and John Calvin - among others.The reaction to the book is bound to be mixed. Those who are ardent fans of the Left Behind series will probably not find the suggestion of poor judgment on their part appealing. Those unfamiliar with the Left Behind series will probably not understand some of the allusions. However, those in the Church whom the \\"prophecy experts\\" never fooled or who now reject the distortions of God's word in such sensationalistic fare will find it highly entertaining. The latter group, in particular, may laugh heartily at the errors of their youth."},{"Title":"Right Behind: A Parody of Last Days Goofiness","review":"Great book! Both Right Behind and The Mantra of Jabez are great reading. These books are comic relief for the goofiness of contemporary evangelicalism.P.S.

I had been given a copy of Left Behind as a gift a couple years ago, and despite all the rave reviews, I couldn't read beyond the first dozen pages because IT WAS SO POORLY WRITTEN, nevermind the silly theology and completely implausible plot. So it was with great mirth that I read Right Behind, a book that not only spoofs this goofy Left Behind series, but at the same time pokes fun at all poorly written, shallowly developed, \\"action-packed,\\" bad-dialogue-driven, suspense-type novels that include a plethora of steriotyped characters.

Anyway, kudos to Nathan Wilson for a very funny book that also reminds us that the God portrayed in Left Behind couldn't possibly be the same God who created \\"the heavens and the earth by Thy great power and by Thine outstretched arm!

The book \\"Left Behind\\" was not meant to predict what the end times will be like but what it could be like, the Bibles book of Revelations has already done that. The Book \\"Left Behind\\" was written to make the end times more clearer for those who don't understand and what it could be like if people don't change their lives around for the better.If you haven't been watching the news lately, and I assume most of the people who made a remark here are Americans, another world war could be imminent.

It had a great deal of potential and the concept was amazing, but the execution was a little flawed. I am not sure if it was Wilson's youth or inexperience as a writer that lead to the let-down. Or maybe it was having read many of his more recent books and finding his fiction, especially in the 100 Cupboards series, almost 'Tolkienesque', that I had such high expectations. Instead, I read something like a Christian version of a fraternity joke. The style was a little rambling, the story inconsistent and it constantly made reference to the fact that it was an end-times book - characters referring to what evangelicals would and would not accept in the writing and also characters talking about their character and its focus or intent. Overall it was a let-down. I read it because I set the goal of reading all of Wilson's books and I will read the sequel to this but I know he could have done so much more with it if he had written it today!"},{"Title":"Right Behind: A Parody of Last Days Goofiness","review":"OK, OK, first the book. It was funny. I laughed at it. I have also read the Left Behind books and I have enjoyed them as well. Not because they are great works of fiction, but because they are fun. They also have a great message which has brought a number of people to faith in Christ. Some of the scenes have even helped strengthen my faith. Is Jerry Jenkins a great writer in the world of Christian fiction? I've read much better. But the books hold my attention and I enjoyed them. This book pokes fun at the series and Jerry's style of writing and I found myself laughing at it much of the time. I guess I have a sense of humor.I would have stopped there except I had to voice an opionion. What I find to be disheartening are the number of people (who I'm assuming are Christians) who are writing reviews of this book who think they all have THE handle on Bible prophecy and are intollerant to those of differing views. One guy actually says that we should &quot;never give in to the silly little modern Evangelicals who don't understand anything about biblical prophesy.&quot; Silly Evangelicals? Aren't we all fighting the good fight? Obviously not.I'm of the mindset (probably because its biblical) that Christians need to agree on the majors of the faith. On the minors, there should be tolerance. In everything, charity. There's too many people here thinking that eschatology is a major point of the Christian faith. I guess it ranks right up there with how one attains salvation, who Jesus Christ is, etc. There's too many people condemning and attacking \\"silly Evangelicals\\" whose view of the end-times are not the same as their own. Funny, but John 14:6 does not say that Christ, AND a non-dispensational understanding of the end-times, are the way to the Father. And how about some charity. Here are some quotes of people below: \\"never mind the silly theology\\"; \\"this book doesn't make fun gently\\" (true - always something I look for in a Christian book - NOT); \\"...weird post-modern thinking that has infected the church through almost 200 years of anti-intellectualism&quot;; &quot;crazy Christian culture&quot;; and of course, the quote about silly Evangelicals.Let's stop trying to divide the church and unite as a body. I don't agree with all of Tim LaHayes' stands but I still think he is a godly man whose fiction and non-fiction books have had an impact on many (myself included) - and I'm not arrogant enough to call him a silly Evangelical because he understands prophecy differently than I do. In all things, charity - this book falls short in that account, the only one that matters, really. Thus, my fair review."},{"Title":"Right Behind: A Parody of Last Days Goofiness","review":"Let me set the record straight on two things. One, I am a Christian. Two, I am a Christian who believes that Jesus has a sense of humor.&quot;Right Behind&quot; pokes fun at the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series, and the jabs aren't totally unwarranted. Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins should not win any major prizes for a series of books that, despite the compelling subject matter, are written at a sixth-grade level and can be devoured fairly quickly. But &quot;Right Behind&quot; simply isn't funny. In fact, the writing is even worse than in &quot;Left Behind&quot;, if you can believe it.Had this been a funny book, what a royally funny coup de grace it would've been! Instead, it is flat, lifeless and boring. Not even Jesus would laugh at this dreck, and I'm sure He laughs when something strikes Him funny."},{"Title":"Right Behind: A Parody of Last Days Goofiness","review":"With all the humor of the *last skit* of the evening on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, this book seems like it will never end. You'll be wishing for the End Times to come soon! There are about 6 pages of excellent humor, packed around pages and pages of repetitive boredom. One bit of humor was the naming of Buff. Unfortunately, it was remarkably similar to a scene from the television series &quot;Seinfeld&quot; involving George. The actual Great Tribulation itself can't be much worse than this book."},{"Title":"Right Behind: A Parody of Last Days Goofiness","review":"There is a fine line between satire and sneering, and Wilson has crossed it. The result is not even particularly funny. He would profit from studying the works of those papists Chesterton and Ronald Knox (or Swift, for that matter)."},{"Title":"Right Behind: A Parody of Last Days Goofiness","review":"This review points scale doesn't go low enough. This book deserves a -5. If you want to read something worth your time, you'd be better off reading a dictionary. These books are written by men who have no understanding of Biblical prophecy whatsoever and are absolutely clueless to what the end times will be like. The Left Behind series has done so much for spreading Christianity and no Christian has any business reading this filth. I'm sorry if i come off harsh, but mess with my God and ridicule an outreach the He's using, and you'll have to hear the truth. The Bible says that in the last days men will turn away from truth, and wanting to have their ears tickled, will turn to doctrines taught by deamons. This is precisely what we have here. This is heresy in it's purest form, and my advise is to avoid it all together."},{"Title":"Right Behind: A Parody of Last Days Goofiness","review":"This book ridicules the very series of books that God has given us to use as a tool to help lead others to Christianity. This book is something that I have found useful in helping to bring a number of friends to Christ. God has planted a seed with the LEFT BEHIND SERIES and that is something that should not be made fun of or overlooked. Overall I felt right behind was a book that makes fun of God and something he has used to bring many people to him."},{"Title":"Valentine","review":"This book was a fairly good read, but quite a letdown after the much better book by the same author, The Inheritance.

It makes you wonder...a lot of us have pulled pranks on people like Victor. I highly recommed this novel.

Reading it first will make the others seem pale in comparison!"},{"Title":"Valentine","review":"Possibly one of the most exciting books I have ever read.

Tom Savage weaves a tale of vengeance; deceit and horror that will not only floor you but also keep you awake at night for sometime to come.

In this book, nothing is as it seems, and as the mystery unravels, you get sucked in deeper and deeper into Tom Savage's mesmerizing narration. I stayed up until three in the morning; I just couldn't stop until I got to the end.I urge all fans of mystery and suspense thrillers to buy this book...NOW.

Although the film appealed to me (since it had an 80's horror movie feel to it), the book was much more absorbing. Unlike the movie, the characters, though rich and successful, drew upon my sympathy effectively. The many twists and turns pulled me into the story and the ending, well, as for those very few people who said they saw it coming a mile away... I DIDN'T. I couldn't for the life of me figure out what the &quot;twist&quot; was going to be. I was pleased and VERY entertained, and I'm feel sorry for Mr. Savage for the movie studios taking his wonderfully-written story and turning it into an exercise of Hollywood cliches.

I recently learned there is to be a movie made based on this novel, starring Boreanaz, of &quot;Buffy, the Vampire Slayer&quot; &amp; &quot;Angel&quot; fame, both of which I am a huge fan. I knew I would go see the movie, so, as I usually do, I read the book first. I first read the reviews from others, here, &amp; decided it was worth a shot. I am very glad I got a chance to read this one! It was amazing. I thought for sure that I had figured out exactly what was going on about halfway through the novel when--BAM! Savage threw in a very unexpected twist. I sat and read all 448 pages in one day. I could not put the novel down. Savage engrosses you in the characters so that you want to find out what happens to each of them. No other suspense novel has had such an effect on me.

It is about the stalking of 4 girls and some of them get murdered. All It was was a practical joke. But the joke backfired and it turned to murder. A boy was badly humiliated and about 2 weeks later kills his parents. Geuily creepy, suspenceful and probaly the most mysterious book I have ever read. Very Good."},{"Title":"Valentine","review":"I haven't read any of Tom Savage's books before. I picked this book up at a book sale because it looked intriguing. I didn't realize I was going to be in for such a treat! Savage is a master at placing red herrings and developing a fabulous psychological thriller.While in college, four girls play a prank that will later come back to haunt them. Unfortunately, their unpleasant joke was unknowingly aimed at a guy who was not quite right in the head. He get expelled, kills his parents and ends up in prison. While in prison he has 12 years to plot his revenge against the women who he blames for ruining his life.This book will take you into the midn of a psychotic intellectual who gets his revenge through hard work, preseverance and brilliance. You won't want to put the book down! I do admit that the very end of the story was a bit too pat. I think it would have presented a much more interesting dillemma if things had played out a little differently, but you will have to read it yourself to see what I mean.I am usually pretty good at figuring out the whodunit in books, but this book surprised me in the end and I am ready to go back and read it again to search for the clues I missed the first time."},{"Title":"Valentine","review":"I myself thought this was an interesting thriller book about romance pranks and payback. The twist is that the killer only kills his victims on ST. Valentines day.The main character in this book is a girl named Jillian. In college she was popular and had many friends. One day her and her friends pulled a prank on an innocent boy who wasnt real popular. She was pulling a prank on him about being is valentine. What they thought was a innocent joke would soon come back to haunt them.On Valentines day killian finds a valentine card which would soon haunt her. After being scared to death by the threat Jillian fights her way for life throughout the book, as the killer murders her friends who were in on the joke using the elements of earth to his advantage he picks them off one by one. I would recommend this book for a highschool assignment or jsut to read for fun no matter what this book will have u ont he edge of your seat the whole time keeping u interested."},{"Title":"Valentine","review":". . . which is saying something, isn't it? Savage knows how to plot a story that keeps you on your toes. There is only a real &quot;twist&quot; at the end of the story that I genuinely didn't see coming &amp; since I'm a fairly intelligent guy, I was a little disappointed with myself. :)If you're looking for a quick read that will get you through a four hour flight, this is a perfect candidate. Not too much deep thinking, not too gory for the most part, and good at keeping your attention."},{"Title":"Valentine","review":"Tom Savages \\"Valentine\\" is one of his best books I've read. I couldn't put it down. The book kept getting better and better after each chapter. It is full of terror and suspense, but best of all it's full of mystery. This bone-chilling novel with a terrifying twist is about a women named Jill who is the author of several murder books. Now a mysterious Valentine is sending her deadly gifts thats making her live in fright. Victor is her bloody Valentine. After Jill and some of her friends in collage tormented him and played a prank, Victor has grown with anger and is getting his vengeance by murder. He has gotten the other girls, but now his final victim is Jill. Could she survive the terror."},{"Title":"Valentine","review":"\\"Valentine\\" is one of those modern miracles that well never be fully appreciated and will certainly never be the stepping stone such as \\"Carrie\\" was for King and \\"Watchers\\" was for Koontz. Savage presents his audience with nothing too special, just a successful suspense novelist named Jillian Talbot, who has everything going for her: a beautiful home in Greenwich Village, a handsome lover, a boostering career, and...a stalker. She receives letters and threats from a mysterious man called \\"Valentine\\", who wants to avenge his misfortunes from the past. Jillian has to figure out who this madman is, why he is after her, and how she can save her own life. Savage takes the reader through an absolutely riveting roller-coaster ride full of scares, humor, and flat-out, hair-on-your-back tingling suspense. With only his second novel, Savage has created his own stepping stone into a prestigious group of horror/suspense novelists: those who not only create surprising, stylish novels, but create eerie characters similar to people that we encounter in our everyday lives--and that makes all readers' skin crawl."},{"Title":"Valentine","review":"A clicque of posh college socialites pulled a rather mean prank on Viktor DiMorta, a few years back. They didn't realize he was already a little unbalanced, and didn't need the added push over the edge. Now, many years later, Viktor's back, with quite a rap sheet, a bit of plastic surgery, and more than one murder behind him - including his own folks. (What a guy!) Viktor likes playing this little \\"valentine\\" game, on the holiday of the same name. Each year, he picks out one of the girls who played that mean little prank on him, and wooes her - to death.The plot couldn't be more hackneyed, but it reads wonderfully. Savage constructs a complex psychopath, pitiful yet terrifying, and lets the \\"excitable boy\\" out to play. The murders are graphic and gruesome, and the suspense is very cleverly handled. The last socialite in line knows pretty soon that her stalker is Viktor DiMorta - but who is he? He could be any stranger she happens to pass on the street...or even someone she already knows.Forget the movie - and forgive it. It really isn't that bad. It was cursed with the impossibility of presenting a book that isn't written to be performed, but read. Savage plays with perspective and reader expectations in a way that simply isn't possible for a movie to dramatize. And he does it very, very well."},{"Title":"Valentine","review":"I've never heard of Tom Savage, but after reading this book, I am definitely a fan. I love this book! I read it just days before seeing the movie, which is somewhat disappointing to say the least, when compared with this great thriller, and was so intrigued I finished it in one sitting (I was travelling...).I liked Jill, I liked Tara, I liked Nate, I liked the detective guy...and I sympathized with Victor DiMorta. I don't agree with what he did (taking human lives) but I can understand it, especially in this decaying society we live in where it's socially acceptable for the good people to be shunned in favour of the bad people.Well, on to the story. Victor DiMorta is a not-very-handsome college guy who is tricked one Valentine's Day evening by three of the most popular and beautiful girls on campus, Sharon (Earth), Belinda (Wind) and Cass (Fire), along with the help of a naive wannabe freshman named Jill. Victor is charged with rape, expelled, slaughters his abusive parents, is thrown in prison and transforms himself to take revenge. Each successive Valentine's Day, beginning in 1995, Victor, renamed simply Valentine, murders each of the three girls responsible until just mystery novelist Jill is left to defend herself. Now, as Valentine moves closer and closer, Jill and her boyfriend Nate must figure out which of the men Jill knows who could be committing the awful crimes. Finally, Jill, in a desperate attempt to catch her sanity, travels to a lodge for writers to spend Valentine's Day. Of course, Valentine tracks her down and Jill must battle Victor and pay for her sins from 16 years ago, with a shocking and unforgettable climax.I suggest all people who have seen the movie read this novel. Not only is it great at psychological terror and anguish but Tom Savage doesn't skimp on the bloodshed and death. This book is all that great suspense-mystery-horror novels should be and is more absorbing and frightening than the movie could ever hope to be. Tom Savage has a winner with this one and I'll definitely be searching for more from him in the near future."},{"Title":"Valentine","review":"Valentine, the movie, is one of the best scary movies I've ever seen, I truly loved it.

If you read it as literature, it fails at every point. Clearly, its intention is that it be pure genre, but does genre necessitate badness? From the minute you read the protagonist's name, which is right out of soap operas or romance novels, and follow her mannered, mechanical thoughts, you feel that you're reading about purely manufactured people. Even if the ending is a surprise, there is no suspense, because the story and characters are completely contrived, and the writing has all the style of a High School creative writing contest runner-up. If you like this sort of thing, then the real question isn't whether this book is &quot;good&quot; or not, but are you cheating yourself by allowing the regular ingestion of cardboard?"},{"Title":"Valentine","review":"As another reviewer has stated, don&#65533;t believe the jacket blurbs or the &#65533;professional&#65533; reviews. I&#65533;m now also skeptical of the Amazon Customer Reviews since someone pulled four or five of the well-stated 1-star reviews on Tuesday, October 09, 2001 and left virtually nothing but 4 and 5-star reviews.I wasted several hours reading this pedetrian drivel. There are so many problems I don&#65533;t know where to begin. The writing is mind-numbingly expository. Savage is constantly belaboring pointless facts and absurd situations instead of just showing us. As my freshmen-year English teacher used to say, &#65533;Show me, don&#65533;t tell me.&#65533; One of the 1-star reviews that are no longer listed said it best &#65533; It was written like the runner-up in a high school writing contest. Similar to the aforementioned complaint, Savage espouses every thought in each character&#65533;s head. We&#65533;re inflicted with even the most minor characters&#65533; insights and beliefs. It is unnecessary and gets old very quickly.There is an overwhelming mishmash of point-of-view changes. As an example, the reader is constantly asked to feel what the protagonist is feeling, then submerged into the best friend&#65533;s opinions, then whipped back over to the private detective&#65533;s thoughts about case or the protagonist herself. Sorry, but this style of writing (of lack thereof) has amateur written all over it; no pun intended.There is another seemingly minor point, but it illustrates the type of writing throughout this book. Savage uses the word &#65533;obviously&#65533; no less than fifteen times in this novel. This observation may seem picayunish, but it highlights a crucial point. If it&#65533;s that obvious, why state it, Tom?The worst part was that the so-called &#65533;twist&#65533;, the &#65533;awesome&#65533; denouement that the critics touted so highly on the book jacket, was incredulous and could easily be seen a mile away. All of these problems might possibly have been solved with a good editor. And in Savage&#65533;s defense, some of his over-writing is a direct result of the preferred style and confines of the Gothic genre, a genre I&#65533;ve never been a fan of. But if it was intended to be a Gothic, don&#65533;t advertise it as a suspense thriller. I&#65533;ll never know, because I have no intention of picking up another Savage atrocity."},{"Title":"Valentine","review":"When four girlfriends play a horrible practical joke on a young man on Valentine's Day, they don't realize the pain and murder that will be afflicted upon them in years to comeThe victim of the joke goes crazy...killing his family.

Every chapter contains a cliffhanger, and the ENDING...what a shocking ending.A MUST read!!!Nick Gonnella"},{"Title":"Valentine","review":"I definitely could not put this book down. It truly contained all the elements of a first-rate thriller! And the surprise ending -- WOW! Unlike many so-called psychological thrillers out there on the book market today, this one had an ending that was completely satisifying and commensurate with the level and build-up of suspense preceding it. Unfortunately it seems that many novels in the thriller genre today are admmitedly suspenseful, but invariably lead to a disappointing conclusion. This one does not disappoint! It is well worth the time to read it, and I assure you it won't take long to read because of the intense level of suspense. It will keep you up way into the wee hours ... but make sure you keep ALL the lights on!"},{"Title":"Valentine","review":"&quot;Valentine&quot; is a suprisingly stylish, well-written thriller that far surpasses any of Savage's other work. While &quot;Precipice&quot; and &quot;Scavenger&quot; were good novels of supense and terror, this 1997 masterpiece is one of the most enjoyable, riveting of its kind made in the late 1990s.Jillian Talbot is a mystery novelist who has finally cashed in on her hard work and has become a true success. She has an excellent boyfriend and best friend and she feels as if life could get no better. When she returns home from work one night, she discovers a Valentine's Day card in her home, only to realize that it is an eerie threat towards her survival. As the threats become more venomous, sincere, and close to home, Jillian must run not only from a killer, but the soul of a man she crushed with a college prank.Savage's antagonist, Victor Dimorta, is a first-rate evil killer, using his excessive charm and wit to bed women who are close to Jillian, only to kill them using the earth's essential elements (such as fire, wind, and water). As Dimorta gets closer and closer to Jillian, the novel unravels at a thunderous, hair-raising pace that magic-carpets to a wonderfully demonic finish. Beautifully sculptured story with just enough humor and wit, but overall a hauntingly exceptional read that will go down as a truly under-rated work of suspense."},{"Title":"Valentine","review":"Is the book better than the movie? It is all matter of opinion: Teenagers say the movie (starring David Boreanz and Denise Richards);Adults would probebly say the novel (by Tom Savage). The movie involves five grown-up women who are stalked by a former male student they scorned years ago. He goes around with a knife and a cupid mask. The movie involves harsh murders, and about who dies next. The book, however, does not have any of this. The book:Jillian, a successful author of murder mystery novels (of all things), and starts receiving threatening valentines from an ex-student she and her friends had pulled a nasty prank on years ago in college. There is no cupid mask, although there is a knife in it once. The book takes place after the other girls involved in the prank are dead, although Savage takes one chapter per victim to show what happened to them. The names aren't the same either. I don't suggest reading the book first, or vice versa, because they are so different apart, and they don't help people be aware of what the other is like."},{"Title":"Valentine","review":"I was wathcing TV and saw a comercial for an upcomming movie called &quot;Valentine.&quot; I knew by the ad that it was going to be another &quot;slasher flic&quot; following in the footsteps of the Scream movies, I Know What You Did Last Summer, and Urban Legends. In Valentine, the killer is after four girls that did something horrible to him in middle school on Valentines Day. He waits a good seven years before inacting his plan of revenge and dons a Cupid mask, calling himeself Valentine, and sets out to scare the hell out of, and then kill, each of the four girls that offended him long ago. Each girl now has a love interest and each man could possibly be the killer. Anyone who has seen any of the films mentioned above will know that this formula and style of horror movie is getting very old and overdone. I decided to pick up the book even though I'd never even known of the author before. I like to read books before they become movies to see the differences. The Valentine movie does not come out until February 2nd but I can tell you right now, the movie will stink and fail like so many other slasher films have, but the book is much better and well worth a read. In the novel, there is no Cupid mask and there is only one lead female with one male love interest. Not four females and four males like in the movie. When the book starts up (don't worry, I won't spoil a thing) the killer, still named Valentine, has already killed three of the four girls on his list. We spend the intire novel watching the last girl try to survive. Another difference is that the offence that the girls inflict on the Valentine character happens in College, not in middle school. In no way was the novel I read anything close to a slasher movie aimed at twentysomethings and teenages, as most of todays horror movies are. I guess my poit is this: if your thinking about reading this book then do, you will enjoy it and it will scare you. If you see the film and are as dissapoited as I'm sure I will be, read the book anyway because I guarentee, as with most novel to screen adaptations, the book is far more mature and intertianing that the watered down version of the film due out early February. -E.E.D.

It didn't take long to finish, nor to decide I could've spent my time better somewhere else.I'll admit, the story was fun. You could see it spilling out before you, and with a bit of imagination, could guess what was around the next corner. I liked the &quot;Elements&quot; angle (as I've always been a sucker for a serial-killer with a motif), and quite enjoyed the character of Detective Barney Fleck. Victor DiMorta was well-rounded, and I was surprised by one of the &quot;twists&quot; at the end.However, it all just seemed a bit flat. It didn't appear to be anything we hadn't seen before, and well... it just left me asking, &quot;Is that it?&quot;If you're looking for a quick, fun read - this is your book. But I have to agree with some of the other reviews and admit, if you're looking for something with a bit of depth; this won't be your cup of tea.For the one reviewer asking about the character of Max, sorry. There wasn't a single character in the novel named such.

I have read numerous reviews as well as directors interviews and the movie is going to be nothing like the book.

Jillian has a pretty good idea who it is, but with some research from Fleck, her guess is wrong.In the midst of all this, she is in love with her boyfriend Nate, and recently found out that she is pregnant. If I give you anymore information regarding the plot I will ruin your reading, which I don't want to do! &quot;Valentine,&quot; is a novel that is sure to scare you, mystify you, and just addict you to itself.

I read this book in a week, and it is the greatest book that I have ever read. The twist at the end was so outragous that I could not believe what I was reading.

Not a bad book, The plot is pretty straightforward; a geek with some mental issues gets screwed over by the popular college girls so he seeks revenge on them. (Why the popular kids are always nasty and mean is beyond me. If this was their personality, what makes them so popular?) The backstory on him is kind of cliched; kid and his mom are abused both physically and verbally by his dad. This sets him up as a ready victim until he finally decides enough is enough. While in jail, (and I won't mention why he's there), he manages to reinvent himself. Once he gets out, his plans for revenge on the girls kicks into high gear. Like I said, a little on the cliched side. The way he attacks them is interesting though and there is a nice sense of suspense through the book as we see each of his attacks play out. All in all a decent read but I can't really rate it as spectacular."},{"Title":"The Man Who Stole First Base: Tales from Baseball's Past","review":"If you like baseball and baseball books, you will like this one.

I also liked the fact that the romance was not spelled out in livid detail! Imagination is what reading is all about and this book allowed my mind to picture the scenes and the characters. I will look forward to another book by this talented author!"},{"Title":"A Way Out","review":"The international intrigue genre is ever &amp; always filled with limitless possibilities! The book is grammatically true enough to follow, in an easy read manner. The author has a good handle on the mood, dynamics and locales which are prevalent in his story. The characters are interesting and well-enough drawn but still leave us with a taste for more. The necessary romantic entanglement might still be somewhat underdrawn for my taste while the bloodletting is overdrawn but certainly different strokes for different folks is apropos. The protagonist is purposefully mysterious &amp; could be further revealed in future episodes?. Others in the cast are equally interesting, albeit mostly all nasty. Most impressive are the geographic locales and details, ie. the old town quarter of Tallinn, Estonia (how many readers even know of the city) and the wild happenings of the exotic market in Istanbul, one of the world's 10 oldest &amp; largest cities. I had some trouble reconciling the title of the novel with the actual &amp; eventual outcome but others may see more clearly or not be so mindful. &quot;A Way Out&quot; is a fast paced, globe-hopping, plot-twisting novel with an X-generation equivalent to James Bond, an interesting evolution. While perhaps best suited to eventual big-screen production, the classic best form of media is always literature in novel form. The author should only improve."},{"Title":"Mark Twain's Letters from Hawaii","review":"Having just finished reading Twain'sRoughing It, and having received this book as a gift, I decided to read them back to back. This is a compilation of the correspondence Mark Twain was hired to write from Hawaii (then the Sandwich Islands) for the California newspaper the Sacramento Union. These letters were written before he had published his first book, so he was still young and inexperienced as a writer. Yet all the elements of classic Twain are in here--the humour, the keen observation, the ear for vernacular speech. It is informative to notice that he used much of the material from these letters--at times verbatim--to create the last few chapters of \\"Roughing It\\". I would almost recommend reading \\"Roughing It\\" instead of these letters because the writing is more polished and edited for more readability, were it not for the fact that the letters contain some very interesting material that does not appear in \\"Roughing It\\". Specifically, Twain does an excellent job covering the trade and commerce of the Islands, specifically the whaling and sugar industries (I am a sucker for 19th century whaling stories), and delivers an exclusive report on the fate of the clipper ship 'Hornet', a ship that completely burned while on the open sea, stranding 31 men in open boats near the Equator. One boat made it to Hawaii and Twain was able to get a report off to California, the first anyone there had heard of it. This report later bacame the source for his piece \\"Forty-Three Days in an Open Boat\\".I would recommend this book to those interested in early Hawaiian, or even California, history and those who would enjoy some early Mark Twain. The subject matter jumps around a bit, as is the nature of this kind of compilation. The introduction by A. Grove Day is very informative and helpful for placing the readings in context. The reading is not always easy but usually entertaining."},{"Title":"Mark Twain's Letters from Hawaii","review":"What is it about the Hawaiian Islands that is so profoundly affecting? Twain was the ultimate skeptic, yet the Islands won him over in a minute. This collection of newspaper columns tells us why, and it is story that remains relevant to Island visitors and lucky residents. Twain was as well travelled as anyone of his day, and had no trouble identifying Hawaii as not just a pleasant place, but a unique place on earth. He hoped to live out his days on the Islands, but never made it back. Modern travellers sometimes wonder about the attractions of the Islands versus other places with warm climates. No one has explained it better than Twain."},{"Title":"Mark Twain's Letters from Hawaii","review":"This book is an excellent and quick read. It presents a picture of Hawaii that, unfortunately, will never be seen again. If you love the islands and/or Mark Twain's writing style, you'll love this book."},{"Title":"Mark Twain's Letters from Hawaii","review":"Written in 1866, at the front end of his career, these letters provide a nice overview of Twain's talents. There are the obligatory humorous stories, but there are also perceptive descriptions of the Hawaian economy that foreshadow \\"Life on the Mississippi,\\" itself a precursor of \\"Huckleberry Finn.\\" Other letters deal with the Hawaiian scenery at the time and its mode of government, in most ways similar to state politics in California. If you're planning on a trip to Hawaii, especially to Oahu, reading this book will enrich your visit. Even if you're not, you'll have the pleasure of viewing a fine mind at work."},{"Title":"Mark Twain's Letters from Hawaii","review":"The book itself cam in better shape than described. It appears to be brand new and unread.The young Mark Twain is a character I hadn't met before. He was fresh from the goldfields and San Francisco -- and was fascinated by the beauty and grace of Hawaiian life. He wasn't Politicaly Correct in his view of the Native Peoples, but then - - seeing them as equals was not thinkable in the 1860s.Nevertheless, his descriptions of songs, dances, chants, and especially hula are a valuable view of the authentic artistry. I have always questioned if hula and chants had become distorted during their periods of banishment by the Missionaries. I feared that what I saw at festivals today had been corrupted and \\"interpreted\\" by today's cultural masters.Not to worry. What Twain described seems to be identical to what I see and hear today. The arts may have gone underground, but they were tended and cherished by genius.A culture is termed \\"wealthy\\" if it has enough leisure time to develop a high art. By these terms, the Haida of the Pacific Northwest and the Native Hawaiians were as wealthy as any Aztec. They just didn't have metal to work with, and didn't need it, actually.Twain went to visit Kilauea Volcano, then, as now, in eruption.His enjoyment of social events, both high and low, make his stay in the islands what every traveller dreams of. He was enchanted.Usually I pass on used books; but this one is a keeper.Beverly in Honolulu"},{"Title":"Mark Twain's Letters from Hawaii","review":"This is the audiobook edition of a collection of dispatches that Mark Twain wrote, as a newspaper correspondent, to the Sacramento Daily Union in 1866 during his 7-month sojourn in Hawaii. Mark Twain impressionist McAvoy Layne very ably does the reading for the audiobook edition, bringing Mark Twain's written narrative to life.Letters from Hawaii provides a fascinating look at 19th century Hawaii -- the people, royalty, customs, culture, neighborhoods, infrastructure, commerce, government, volcanos, valleys, beaches, sea -- as well as a sprinkling of Mark Twain's inimitable humor. History buffs and Hawaiiana buffs will find Twain's first-hand, boots-on-the-ground observations of 19th century Hawaii uniquely satisfying.I found almost every dispatch riveting. One that comes to mind now as I write this mini review is Mark Twain's account of his visit to the active volcano, Kilauea, on the Big Island, which he viewed both during the daytime and at night. In addition to Twain's powerful visual imagery describing the lava flows, he also interestingly describes the sounds of the volcano. \\"It makes three distinct sounds - a rushing, a hissing, and a coughing or puffing sound; and if you stand on the brink and close your eyes it is no trick at all to imagine that you are sweeping down a river on a large low pressure steamer, and that you hear the hissing of the steam about her boilers, the puffing from her escape pipes and the churning rush of the water abaft her wheels. The smell of sulfur is strong, but not unpleasant to a sinner.\\"Whether you are a Mark Twain buff, history buff, travel story buff, kama'aina or a malihini, chances are you will find this book enjoyable."},{"Title":"Mark Twain's Letters from Hawaii","review":"This book is easy and interesting reading.

I read this rendition of Twain's reaction to 1866 Hawaii for a class in Hawaiiana. Being born and raised an &#34;island girl&#34; I was eager to see if he would capture the sensitivity and lifestyle of the Hawaiian people as he had with his &#34;on spot&#34; descriptions of characters in his many other writings. I was not disappointed. You see, living on an island dictates a particular way to live for its citizens having the major land mass 2,500 miles away. Your word is good as gold, your share with each other and do not rape precious resources (fish, seaweed, land), color of your skin means nothing except for the goodness in your heart. Being humble, tolerant, gracious, and respectful is what is needed when you live in the close confines of an island. In1866 Twain with his senitive awareness recognized this and writes beautifully about it.I have sent Mark Twain's Letters from Hawaii to several of my mainland friends and am sure there will be more sent in the future."},{"Title":"Mark Twain's Letters from Hawaii","review":"I moved from the Big Island a year ago and finally had an opportunity to read Twain's letters (after finishing Roughing It).

It is richly textured, well written, clearly defines the Bond character and has survived not only as good literature but as a great period piece of the 50s. It also gives us a glimpse of the often unseen smoke filled cocktailed night life found in Europe's plush casinos of that era. Clearly, James Bond is a worldly character that lives and breaths in this unseen world described by Ian Fleming in this novel. James Bond can easily adapt to any locale or situation, size it up and endure. He is both innovative and resourceful and he must rely on his talents and instincts to survive. This is a very good Bond novel."},{"Title":"The Crimson Bears (New American Fiction) (Pt. 1)","review":"This book was a total delight. I loved it so much I spent a year looking for the sequel (and found it here!). I originally bought the book because it looked like a text that could take me away from myself and into a world of fantasy and fun; and it did that and more. This tale of a brother and sister bear on an somewhat unintended adventure is so captivating that I could barely put it down. The plot twists and turns while at the same time the bear characters are so nicely developed that I found myself wishing I could visit their world. There are striking parallels in the world of the Crimson Bears to that of modern day society that are discovered when contemplating the Kingdon of the Bears, the fantasy inspired secondary characters and political/social circumstances involved. It's a fantasy novel that makes you think and turn pages quickly. When I was done with it I loaned it to a couple of friends and they have been looking for the sequel too! Besides the characters and plot being well developed the excecptionally descriptive prose used is truly outstanding, stimulating and mind-stretching.

His main point, which he drives like a spear into the heart of atheist materialism, is that no-one can say anything coherent about truth or morality without appealing to something greater than the material world. This argument is deadly in its effectiveness precisely because atheist materialists, despite occasional protests to the contrary, do not and cannot cease to say things about truth and morality. He explores the significance of the incarnation as the focal point of the miraculous, and he discusses various other issues related to the interaction of the natural and the supernatural, such as determinism.This excellent book is probably the most difficult and dense of all Lewis's work that I've read. Its approach is philosophical, not biblical-exegetical, and it is not for the unprepared reader. While that unfortunately limits the range of people I can recommend it to, those unequipped to grapple with its metaphysics are less likely to struggle with the objections Lewis works to defeat. Some of his theological weakness also shows through in the book (viz., his comments on Jonah), but this is brief and almost completely obliterated by his characteristically stunning holistic view of God's work in the world. In this vein, the chapter on the glories of nature is particularly tremendous and stimulating.For those looking for more, the series of letters published in Christianity Today between Douglas Wilson and Christopher Hitchens are illuminating and interesting (I can't link -- just google it)."},{"Title":"Miracles, a preliminary study","review":"This is the CS Lewis book that I have had the most mixed reaction to. I loved all of his other books that I have read thus far. They include Mere Christianity, The Screwtape Letters, Surprised by Joy, and the entire Chronicles of Narnia series. To me, Miracles is a mixed bag of some extremely good chapters and others that I did not totally agree with.This book is more philosophical than his other works that I have read. It is basically an argument for the existence of miracles, which he defines as an interference with Nature by supernatural power. The argument seems to be mainly directed against Naturalists. His arguments are very similar to those being used in the ongoing debate with atheists that is going on today. I'm sure this book has influenced this debate.One thing I confirmed in reading this book is that I do have theological differences with Lewis. Most of the other books I read of his tended to highlight the similarities of our beliefs, but this one did bring up some differences that I had expected. Chapter 10 is a good example to highlight those differences. In it he argues that things aren't always as they seem and people sometimes take scripture too literally and Lewis uses the example of people imagining that Christ is the literal physical son of a Father God. He then goes on to describe the traditional view of the Trinity. It turns out that I believe in the more simplistic literal view (I'm LDS). This chapter was an aside and not a part of the main argument, but it was interesting for me to see his view in this area.The other big doctrinal difference is his view of creation of the universe and man. He believes in the traditional view of creation out of nothing of both matter and man; whereas I believe God created things by organizing existing material, and that man pre-existed as a spirit prior to his birth. Lewis spends time discussing the problems of evil related to this belief, which don't apply in my belief system.One chapter I really liked was Chapter 8 where he discusses miracles and the laws of nature. I agree with him that a miracle does not have to violate a law of nature; just that it is caused by a supernatural force.I do agree with Lewis that the greatest miracle is the resurrection. I was fascinated to read his view on what the resurrection entails. Again, I have a much more simplistic view of the resurrection than he does. I do believe that resurrected beings have bodies of flesh and bone as do Christ and the Father. He believes more in a totally different state that is indescribable.Overall, this book helped me to better understand the differences between my beliefs and that of mainstream Christianity. Lewis is a master of explaining difficult concepts, and though I didn't agree with everything he said; it was still well said."},{"Title":"Miracles, a preliminary study","review":"This book requires you to leave children's Sunday School behind and have your mind stretched so you can start to experience an intelligent, mature, and insightful way of thinking about what Christianity is really about. As for agnostics and atheists they should spend their time critiquing this book instead of targeting Christian's who think like children. Lewis's use of language and metaphor, make his piercing logic very entertaining. The ocean of ideas surges forth. Another under appreciated book by Lewis, the Problem of Pain, is an excellent companion to this. How I wish Richard Dawkin's (of The Selfish Gene, The God Delusion etc) and his followers were arguing with CS Lewis and not the modern, superficial christian evangelicals. All concerned would be so much better off!"},{"Title":"Miracles, a preliminary study","review":"If you wonder if the supernatural is real, but are not sure, this will convince you it is. Better than Descartes."},{"Title":"Miracles, a preliminary study","review":"This is the fourth Christian C.S. Lewis book that I have read (the others: Mere Christianity, The Abolition of Man and The Screwtape Letters). This is typical Lewis style; a common sense approach to the writing that makes me imagine Lewis in a conversation saying something like, &quot;Come now, let's be reasonable.&quot;In the introduction, Lewis says what his subject matter will be. He notes that before one can look at historical evidence, one must settle the question philosophically (i.e. whether miracles are possible). If someone is persuaded that miracles, per se, are impossible then no amount of evidence will convince. So, it you are looking for argumentation regarding specific miracles look else (I suggest William Lane Craig; his defence of the Resurrection is the best available).I think there are better, shorter and more forceful defences of miracles but this book is not too bad. Other places to look for a defence of miracles: The Baker Encyclopedia of Christian Apologetics by Norman Geisler and Reasonable Faith by William Lane Craig.Lewis' first task is to define naturalism (I think he does a muddled job but the gist of it is: the doctrine that the world can be understood in scientific terms without recourse to spiritual or supernatural explanations or that only the physical world [i.e. Nature] exists). Lewis refutes this by showing that immaterial objects exist namely Reason (that is to say both the existence and validity of logic and the part of human beings that performs acts of reasoning) and the existence of morality or ethics (i.e. When somebody suggests that I ought not to sit in his seat in the theatre, he is not simply making an emotional statement, he is saying that I have violated a rule. The fact that the language of ethics, &quot;ought&quot; &quot;should&quot; etc are meaningful shows this).He deals with the objection that miracles are against the laws of nature or that experience in general is against miracles happening. Lewis also deals with the objection that miracles were believed and wrote about millennia ago because the people were simple-minded, misunderstood the world and lacked modern science. Lewis also deals with the &quot;problem&quot; of language (i.e. the literal &quot;v.s.&quot; metaphorical uses). The remaining portion of the book is on different topics...For example the chapter: Christianity and &quot;Religion&quot;, Lewis compares Christianity with pantheism. He says that modern people hold to pantheism because they think it is a sophisticated belief that doesn't have all the old-fashioned mythology et al that theism has. Lewis then goes on to show that merely because pantheism is easy or popular is no reason to accept it as true. In one of his insights, near the end of the chapter he says:&quot;Man are reluctant to pass over from the notion of an abstract and negative deity to the living God. I do not wonder. Here lies the deepest tap=root of Pantheism and of the objection to traditional imagery. It was hated not, at bottom, because it pictured Him as a man but because it pictured Him as king, or even as warrior. The Pantheist's God does nothing, demands nothing. He is there if you wish for him like a book on a shelf. He will not pursue you.&quot; (page 124)Lewis then looks at the issue of how probable miracles are. He then has a chapter entitled, &quot;The Grand Miracle,&quot; which is on the Incarnation, the Resurrection and the Ascension. However, it does not seem to be an argument as such to me, rather it is an explanation and discussion of what the Incarnation is. This is fine, but I don't think this sort of material is appropriate in work that is setting out to DEFEND Christianity rather than simply explain it. He also has a chapter on the general Resurrection.The book ends with an admonition to keep Naturalism out of our minds. I agree with Lewis that it is defeated as a philosophy; the problem is that it can easily gain a foothold in our minds and before we know we are thinking with naturalistic assumptions.This is a fairly good book but sometimes I wondered while reading it, \\"Where are you going with this, Lewis,\\" or, \\"How is this relevant?\\""},{"Title":"Miracles, a preliminary study","review":"Huh? That is the thought that clouded my reading of Lewis's Miracles more often than not. I readily admit that I am not the most steady reader of philosophy, so most of this book left me in the dust, coughing and confused. Nonetheless, reading Lewis unravel and re-knot the arguments for and against the supernatural enhancement of Nature (or Creation, depending on your view of the issue) was a treat. Before reading it though, a word advice, keep in mind Lewis's opening statement that this book is not meant to change minds, just put forth concepts and arguments. Those on either side of the debate fence will no doubt remain on whatever side they were at the book's beginning."},{"Title":"Miracles, a preliminary study","review":"After finishing C.S. Lewis's MIRACLES, I was reminded of a comment by one of the participants leaving a seminar on some convoluted, abstract subject: \\"We still don't understand,\\" he said,\\" but now we feel we don't understand on a much higher level.\\" Lewis's book might well have been the topic of that seminar, and for that reason I rated MIRACLES 3 stars worth of understanding.Lewis begins his case for miracles by defining them as \\"...an interference with Nature by supernatural power\\" and devotes the better part of his book laying the groundwork to prove the existence of the faith-based phenomenon. The author's argument is a series of proofs progressing from the concept of Nature to that of Supernature--the Supernatural; Lewis establishes that a Supreme Being--God, the King--exists, a necessary proof if one is to believe in miracles.Lewis applies logic to validate religious faith, the Christian faith, in particular; rather than simply saying, \\"I believe,\\" he makes his thesis an exercise in logic (Lewis contends that Man's reasoning, logical thought, and moral choice are manifestations of the Supernatural at work):\\"If one accepts A, then B must follow.\\" One has to attend closely to this proper Brit's thoughts; because of Lewis's formal style, I sometimes found myself simply decoding words instead of following the thread of his arguments.It is when Lewis applies his logic to the miracles themselves: Old Creation miracles and New Testament miracles (The Incarnation, Resurrection, and Ascension) that MIRACLES comes to life. Of particular interest to me in this section is the author's attempts to shed light on the nature of Christian Heaven: where it is, what it is, who will gain its glory and in what form. [It is because of the Ascension miracle, I believe, that Heaven has always been thought of as UP THERE somewhere.] Those of faith might take heed when Lewis states, \\"The letter and spirit of scripture, and all of Christianity, forbid us to suppose that life in the New Creation will be a sexual life...\\" and address such worldly concerns while they are still \\"in the, and of the flesh.\\"You might look at Lewis' book as an attempt to reconcile the doubters and scoffers of the world with those who steadfastly believe in the Christian story by applying logic to the issue. And while Lewis makes you ponder--perhaps question--your own beliefs, the truth of the matter is, whether you believe in a Divine Power, that there is a God and a Heaven, whether miracles have happened, can happen, or whether the whole thing is merely fol-de-rol, just a fanciful story, where it concerns faith, you either have it or you don't. No Venn diagram will convince you otherwise."},{"Title":"Miracles, a preliminary study","review":"A wonderful explanation of the supernatural... perhaps best read after Mere Christianity... also, the C.S. Lewis encyclopedia is good as well, especially for the explanation of myth vs. falsehood... Lewis' views on this are very different from the average persons'."},{"Title":"Miracles, a preliminary study","review":"Well written though the man is admittedly taking on a huge task to provide a logical proof for the existence of the divine and its willingness to \\"invade\\" the natural world. He does spend a lot of effort logically rebuffing naturalism to make his point. I'm not sure if it's a good thing to attempt to make a point by rebuffing another view. Maybe so. Anyway, be prepared to re-read several topics just to make sure you understand the man before moving on - or maybe I'm just a little \\"thicker\\" than I thought. I had a similar experience reading Stephen Hawking's \\"A Brief History of Time\\". I had to re-read a lot of the material to really get it down in my mind.So I'd had this laying around the house for a couple of years. I picked it up to read because though I was raised in an Evangelical church, I disown much of what my \\"old family\\" has gone on to achieve (such as Will Perkins authorship of Colorado's hate-filled Amendment 2 back in 1992... or was it 1988? Perkins was once my youth group leader - shudder). As a middle-aged man, I found I was having a great deal of trouble accepting much of what I see in the world today, like precious little children being victimized by sexual monsters, random killing on campuses, a President who claims to know God but has inflicted untold misery on hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions. I was really struggling with these issues. I needed something to reconcile what I wanted to believe (like Fox Mulder and his poster on his X-Files office wall professing \\"I want to believe\\") about the existence of God and what might really be the awful truth. As it turns out, this book is a step back toward God and Christianity for me (but not the Christianity of the evangelical right-wing, neo-con movement - that is a is a wolf in sheep's clothing and may very well be evil).Read, ponder, wonder, enjoy, ask, pray, and so on."},{"Title":"Miracles, a preliminary study","review":"This is a very deep and compelling book which explains and proves the existence of miracles. It also provides insight to human nature based on their inherent beliefs."},{"Title":"Miracles, a preliminary study","review":"This book by CS Lewis was probably his most philosophical work. As such, it is not a light read at all and would probably prove difficult for beginners who have not been exposed to heavily philosophical material. But for those who want a highly intellectual philosophical discussion of the possibility of miracles, this book is certainly worthy of one's attention.There are a number of strengths to this book which continue to make the book solidly relevant better than forty years after the revised edition came out. Lewis cuts to the heart of the matter very quickly in asserting that rejection of miracles apriori is a common attitude that at its core, is anti-intellectual. Attempts to base rejection of miracles on probabilities, as Hume tried to do, are philosophically untenable and require a betrayal of basic realities that are universally accepted.Lewis then systematically dismantles the worldview that tends to most cradle apriori miracle rejection, naturalism. He compellingly shows that naturalism is a worldview that cannot stand up to philosophical scrutiny. Key to Lewis's presentation is his argument that naturalism can be demonstrated to be false in its complete rejection of supernaturalism merely by the reality of reason. Logic and reason of the mind, by themselves, are supernatural acts that cannot be explained or accounted for in nature, as naturalism demands. Supernaturalism, according to Lewis is not only possible, but pervasive since the act of logical thinking itself is supernatural in origin.Lewis then eloquently argues that the relationship between nature and the supernatural are not hostile, but complementary. In Lewis's view, nature is quite pliable to accommodate and assimilate supernatural acts in ways that do not bring the kind of chaos and randomness that many naturalists believe to be reprehensible relative to the 'invasion' of nature by alleged supernatural acts. Lewis persuasively demonstrates that this concern is bogus.Once the reality, possibility, and plausibility of miracles has been established philosophically, Lewis moves to classifying the Biblical miracles as either old creation or new creation miracles. Here, readers might be a bit disappointed by the presentation. Those looking for an evidential defense of miracles in general or any specific miracle in particular will not find it here. This is a philosophical presentation that is chiefly concerned with whether miracles are possible and/or probable. It is not an evidential defense of the possibility of any specific miracle. Lewis's central point is that human beings are disinclined towards believing in the inherent possibility of miracles for reasons that are not intellectually honest and calls for a fresh reappraisal of the possibility of miracles with a fresh attitude of open mindedness and a sincere commitment to soberly seek the truth absent bias. On this point, he does very well.I noted that I thought the book deserved 4.5 stars rather than a full blown 5 stars. There are two main reasons why this is. First, his discussion of the Incarnation, while fascinating, was mostly off topic. The focus of Lewis's discussion was not on the miraculous nature of the Incarnation, but on its meaning to the believer and its relationship to nature. The discussion is good, but in a book on miracles, I found it to be misplaced. Second, and perhaps more crucial, is that Lewis succumbs to the very ad hoc skepticism that he argues so passionately against. Without elaboration, Lewis introduces the idea of 'Hebrew mythology' as being behind at least some of the miracles described in the Old Testament (Jonah and the whale being one). Why Lewis believes that some Biblical miracles are genuine while others are mythological is something he doesn't discuss. But the reader gets the sense that by taking this position, Lewis is caving in to the very kind of apriori rejection he repeatedly and rightly condemns throughout the book. Lewis's central argument is therefore undermined by his own unwarranted and unexplained backtracking from his own position.But because this slip of reason is confined to only one or two paragraphs of the book, it is a weakness that while noteworthy and unfortunate, is not fatal to his argument. One who remains skeptical about the viability of miracles should consider that Lewis revised this book back in 1960 (in response to the arguments of Anscombe) and to date, there has been no compelling rebuttal to its tenets. Attempts to erect a solid rebuttal have been presented and then systematically refuted as erroneous and mostly illogical. As a result, this book has stood the test of time and remains a compelling argument that should provide great comfort and assurance to those who believe the Biblical miracles on faith, but wonder whether this belief can also be grounded in reason and philosophical argument. It can, and we should expect nothing less from the Creator who not only created nature and supernaturally intervenes in nature, but who also created perfect logic and reason."},{"Title":"Miracles, a preliminary study","review":"This book provides readers with the best defense for thebelief in a living Christianity. As a Christian at asecular university Miracles has proven time and again to be asource of comfort and assurance that to be a Christian isnot to be lacking in intellect, unreasonable, or closeminded. Rather, it is the man (or woman) who is willingto open themselves up to God who is truly to be praised forbeing intelligent, reasonable, and open-minded because theyare responding to God's call to come and reason with Him --instead of alone.

For this,and for the many wonderful books he has written, he has myadmiration and gratitude."},{"Title":"Miracles, a preliminary study","review":"Not the best place to start if you don't consider yourself to be a first-rate thinker (Lewis' own _Mere Christianity_ offers some of the same arguments on an easier-to-digest level)... but if you're up to the challenge, I cannot recommend a stronger argument in favor of a fully supernatural Christian philosophy. NOT an attempt to explain the whole thing away as an allegory, as many so-called &quot;apologists&quot; do. NOT an attempt to use the Bible as a starting place, as many so-called &quot;apologists&quot; do. Lewis begins with only one assumption--one that every thinker uses for every theory ever attempted on any subject--and from that position carefully weaves the most detailed and skillful argument in my experience showing the existence and character of God. An extremely challenging book, especially for sceptics of Christianity, but one which they owe themselves to read (if nothing else, it will increase their faith in their own position and strengthen their mental habits!) This is the book which got me through college; and, next to the Bible itself, the most important book I've ever read.

I'm training for ordained Christian ministry and never expected, during my three years of study, to read any book as interesting and darned right clever as this one. Most of them are very boring!Like many people, I had only read 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' when I was younger but never knew how starved of Lewis' passion for Christ, which is reflected through his theological publications, I had been. He is clearly very much in love with God whom he sees as incomparable with Nature.The genius of 'Miracles' to me, lies in the fact that it is a very readable evangelistic text disguised as 'a philosophical preparation for the possibility of the existence of Miracles'. Lewis' method is very good. He uses a mixture of friendly sarcasm, reverse psychology and intense detail to get right alongside the reader who he assumes is not a Christian. As a Christian myself, I felt that the book was wasted on me, it should be being read by a person who does not yet know Jesus Christ as their Lord.Most of the book is dedicated to excrutiating explanations of the Incarnation, God's use of the Miraculous in His constant governance of the Earth and Prayer.If I had any problem with the book it would be that at times it is quite un-focussed on Christ. Lewis cites the Incarnation (God made Man in Jesus Christ) as God's primary miracle but he does not really explain what this means for the ordinary person in terms of grace (undeserved love of God for us all)and cancellation of sin through the Cross. Maybe, as an evangelistic type of person, I will never be satisfied with any book like Miracles! At times the book feels like a labour of love, his writing on the Law of Nature is painstaking and at times, a little tedious but this, I believe, is only a reflection of his passionate desire for the reader to know Christ. He just has to take you everywhere before taking you home to God!One last obvious and unintended problem is founded in the fact that this book was written for a different age when the post-modernist free for all denial of absolute truth was just a glint in the modernist's eye. Lewis would also clearly be shocked that unlike his own 'unvenerated' age, sexual intercourse has lost its mystery and need for self-control. I think he would be shocked by today's society - or lack of it.But really, this is a terrific book. Reading Miracles as a committed Christian, I can see the method he uses and where he will take the reader. It's as if he is speaking in code to Christians! But this code is no secret, to decipher it is to know the greatest gift ever given to humankind, the person of God in Jesus Christ.It is only when you are almost finished does Lewis just about admit that he had an alterior motive for writing Miracles. But by then, he hopes, the reader will be ready to begin looking into the riches of the Christian Gospel (good news), not just the possibility of the Miraculous!Go and read it or I could send you my notes on the book. Feel free to get in touch.Enjoy! Nicola."},{"Title":"Miracles, a preliminary study","review":"Lewis examines many of the ill-conceived views of miracles that alot of people hold. He exposes them in light of the Bible, human reasoning and other examining tools. This approach is great for people who are seeking a philosophical prespective rather than a scientific or historical one (since many people reject scientific or historical views due to philosophical presuppositions). Another classic from Lewis."},{"Title":"Miracles, a preliminary study","review":"C.S. Lewis destroys preconceived notions of miracles with a utilitarian look at the natural and supernatural. With patience and insight, Lewis discerns that, contrary to popular belief, miracles are not flukes, they are not interruptions of nature, but companions to it. Indeed, nature, adjusting automatically, receives miracles with seamless ease. Furthermore, these handshakes, as it were, of natural and supernatural should actually be expected.Throughout this book, C.S. Lewis drops kernels of wisdom that can provide some rather startling revelations. Of course, one sees as they are inclined to see, so the merely cynical may discover little. However, should you be willing to consider the probability or even the possibility of miracles, you might gain much from a reading. Miracles had a profound impact upon me. I sincerely hope it continues to do so. 5 huge stars."},{"Title":"Miracles, a preliminary study","review":"If both the natural and the supernatural are real, why should they be perceived as being at odds? There's a difference between superstituion and spiritual reality. To ignore that unexplainable \\"miracles\\" occur is to be so devoted to a lie that you refuse to see the truth. Lewis extends his exploration on this topic to speculations that other writers would not touch. For example, secularists insist that Christians are so \\"straight laced\\" that they percieve heaven as a place where we float on clouds and play harps. Yawn! They haven't read this book. C. S. Lewis speculates that if sex is about the ultimate enjoyment in this \\"natural\\" life, the joys of heaven will be so much more intense that sex will seem dull by comparison. I might add Billy Graham has made similar inferences in his writings.Periodically Christians will talk about God not being limited to time or space. Lewis elabortes on that by talking about God even being able to answer prayers \\"out of sequence\\" so to speak. He talks about the possibility of a prayer uttered at noon being answered at 10 am. God operates in an eternal \\"now\\" as Oral Roberts has been known to put it.In summary, this book sheds light on the awesome nature of God. We were created for His pleasure. He is not restrained by anything He made. Miracles go beyond the limits we normally experience.

Lewis only wrote children's stories, fantasy and science fiction tales probably wouldn't be reading this book anyway. But if they did, they would find a book written by one of the 20th century's great thinkers. &quot;Miracles&quot; begins with an early quote that sets the tone for the rest of the book: &quot;What we learn from experience depends on the kind of philosophy we bring to experience.&quot; Two experiences or worldviews are contrasted - the Naturalists who believe that nothing exists except Nature, and the Supernaturalists who believe in something beyond Nature. Lewis spends quite a bit of time examining the two views. Readers may think that too much time is devoted to this subject before getting to a discussion of miracles themselves, but the time spent is a necessary foundation to everything that follows.How exactly do you define a miracle? Lewis defines a miracle as &quot;an interference with Nature by supernatural power.&quot; Lewis then presents many questions. Are miracles in contrast to the laws of Nature? What exactly ARE the laws of Nature? Are exceptions possible? How does probability fit into the discussion of miracles? Later in the book, Lewis focuses on three categories of miracles: The Grand Miracle (God becoming man in Jesus Christ), Miracles of the Old Creation (miracles of fertility, healing, destruction, etc.), and Miracles of the New Creation (miracles of reversal, glory, resurrection). This last portion of the book I found to be the most fascinating as Lewis examines several specific miracles from the Old and New Testaments.&quot;Miracles&quot; is a relatively short book, but properly read will take a little time to read. Take time to absorb and contemplate each chapter. Lewis left us with a lot of things to think about here, regardless of your worldview. You may not agree with everything Lewis says, but it will cause you to think long after you've closed the book."},{"Title":"Miracles, a preliminary study","review":"There are glowing pages in \\"Miracles,\\" written with Dr. Lewis's almost uncanny skill for illuminating profound truth with vivid illustration. The book is, as its sub title states, a \\"preliminary study,\\" that is , a study preliminary to any historical inquiry into the actual occurrence of miracle.With most historians the decision against th probability of miracles is made almost unconsciously before the historical work begins. The purpose of this book is to shift the question of probability from the unconscious to the conscious plane, and it's main argument is directed to embattling the eighteenth and nineteenth century assumption against the miraculous.But, in the course of this, many subordinate questions are raised - the definition of \\"Nature,\\" the rival conceptions of her Laws, the different meanings of the word \\"Probability,\\" the status of metaphor and symbol, th imaginative elements in Naturalism, the antagonism between Christianity and mere \\"religion,\\" and others.A Brilliant work. Deserves greater popularity and recognition, as many of Lewis's other books have. This one is definitely among his absolute best!"},{"Title":"Miracles, a preliminary study","review":"Miracles, while not a perfect book, is certainly an excellent one, in which C.S. Lewis is at his philosophical best. It's not an easy read, by any means, but grinding through it is worth the effort. Recently, another review (by Widger) has widely misconstrued Lewis' argument in the first few chapters, so I would like to use this space, to help \\"hinder the hindrances\\" to a very good book.Widger makes three inadequate criticisms against Lewis' argument. The second and third basically amount to the same critique, so I'll group them together.1.)Widger says, \\"First, although he is right that a logical ground for a belief is not the same kind of cause as \`non-rational causation' and although he is also right that a belief being physically caused would not mean that it was proved, it does not follow that having a physical cause would ipso facto prove falsehood.\\"2.)Widger claims Lewis is arguing to the supernatural through ignorance, and then elucidates some problems with arguing from ignorance.1.) Lewis never says that having a physical cause proves falsehood ipso facto. He makes this clear by talking about human thought as the border of two frontiers. He says it can be physically accounted for in the brain, but that the brain itself can never give a fully adequate account of reasoning. Just because the water in a fishbowl always moves when the fish moves, doesn't mean the fish is the water. Or that all the movements of the water can be fully explained by the water itself.2.) Lewis is not arguing from ignorance; he's arguing from reason. He's saying you could never give a complete account of reason through irrational causation. Saying you could would be like saying you could have a round triangle. Now a person can always say, \\"Well, since you haven't seen every shape in the world, you can't really say there is no such a thing as a round triangle,\\" but it's only another testament to reason that we can declare that statement to be foolishness (And if a person can't see that, it's no use arguing with them). Lewis' whole point is that the very thing we mean by reason, cannot arise from what we mean by irrationality. Saying he is only arguing from ignorance is merely ignoring his argument. If you want to see this argument developed further, read the book, not a review of it. It's quite a fascinating bit of thinking."},{"Title":"Miracles, a preliminary study","review":"One of the most mocked aspects of the Christian faith is the existence of miracles. In fact, the very heart of the Christian faith is based on a miracle. How can one believe in Christianity unless one believes in miracles, or at least is willing to allow for their existence? The simple answer, according to C. S. Lewis, is that they can't. In his book, Miracles, Lewis defended the logic of believing in such supernatural events.In a fashion that those who have read his other Apologetics works will recognize, Lewis uses a type of \\"stepping-stone\\" or building argument. He starts with the notion of defining the difference between the belief in the \\"supernatural\\" and the merely \\"natural\\", and then goes on to systematically define what counts for supernatural, and, of the concepts under the umbrella of that term, what would count as a miracle.What makes this book effective is that Lewis actually shows a sense of history and skepticism. What I mean by this is that he points out the historical \\"lineage\\" of both the beliefs of Christianity in terms of the miraculous, and of the general anti-Christian naturalist philosophy. Granted, it is a very quick sketch, but that is what makes it so useful. It is quite brief, yet has the pertinent information. On the issue of skepticism, Lewis argues that most of the extra-Biblical accounts of \\"miracles\\" are probably not actually miracles, though they certainly could be.At the end of the book, Lewis makes a distinction between a \\"miracle\\" and something that would be said to be predestined, or a work of \\"Providence\\". He points out that such acts of Providence are not miracles, but this doesn't mean that they are any less of an example of God's supernatural power. The idea that, from the beginning of Creation, God designed that some \\"saving grace\\" should appear at such and such a time, is truly as awe-inspiring as any miraculous account.In a section of the book near the end, Lewis differentiates between the miracles of the \\"old Creation\\" (upon which we currently live), and those of the \\"New Creation\\" which we have had a foretaste of with Christ's resurrection and life before the Ascension, and which we can look forward to in the New Heaven/New Earth. Lewis admits that most of what he says on the subject of possible New Creation miracles is sheer conjecture, but it is one we ought to cling to and discuss for the sake of our Christian walk and growth. Randy Alcorn's premise in his very important book, Heaven, (which has changed my life and perspective, and I encourage all to read) was not the first modern call to return to the hope and study of Heaven. C. S. Lewis preceded him by nearly sixty years.This account and defense of miracles is one that I would Highly Recommend to others."},{"Title":"Miracles, a preliminary study","review":"There is no doubt CS Lewis is a brilliant thinker.

As a result, I feel that I have a deeper understanding of my own perspective on God's glorious creation in the context of the modern world. I feel more able to vocalize that understanding because of the way that Lewis has constructed his argument.I will probably read this book again, many times."},{"Title":"Miracles, a preliminary study","review":"How I've missed C. S. Lewis! I picked this book up to read for a book club, and settled into it like conversing with an old friend.The topic is miracles. Do they exist or not? Do they contradict with Nature or not? This is not a nuts and bolts proof book; it is a call to see miracles in a different light. There is, for instance, nothing miraculous about turning water into wine ... nature itself can do this. God has created a vegetable organism that can turn water, soil and sunlight into a juice which will, under proper conditions, become wine. Wine is merely water modified. Should it surprise you that one day, God short circuited the process, using earthenware jars instead of vegetable fibers to hold the water?As in this example, Lewis's arguments sometimes amount only to warm fuzzies. Pantheism, he explains, is nothing special, for people are merely predisposed to believe this way ... pantheism has hung around like an unwanted parasite from the beginning. In contrast, a the story of a dying and rising God is surely true because nature itself teaches this concept, as any farmer knows. Now, beneath the surface, these two arguments are similar, but Lewis manages to draw the desired results from each with a bit of conversation made elegant in one circumstance and ugly in another.Lewis errs also in his science, imagining that \\"every event in Nature must be connected with previous events in the Cause and Effect relation.\\" We know better today (Lewis was writing in 1947), and thus the foundation crumbles for many of his arguments against Naturalism. (Lewis attempts to argue that there must be a God who is not a part of Nature, and reasons that this God must surely be our creator.)But it's the way Lewis writes that so grabs the imagination! I absolutely love reading his books. There is a spellbinding discussion of Morality and Human Reason herein (their divinity earns their capitalization). Yet I cannot honestly award the book five stars, because Lewis never accomplishes what he sets out to do. Lewis's God is elegant and beautiful, but no less unlikely for Lewis's efforts, and must remain a matter of faith. Yet for those who already believe in this particular God, this book cannot fail to lift their spirits.Very much recommended."},{"Title":"Miracles, a preliminary study","review":"After reading a borrowed copy of this book, I had to have a copy for myself. Now my mother is reading my copy. C. S. Lewis is a deep thinker, so this is not light reading. Once he establishes and defines all of the prevailing theories and arguments, he brings everything together and proves his case that miracles are genuine and possible. It is really a great book!"},{"Title":"Miracles, a preliminary study","review":"In some works, C. S. Lewis comes across as a popularizer, while in others, one could swear he was a professional philosopher. \\"Miracles\\" is Lewis at his most deeply-philosophical, and perhaps his most theologically-correct book as well, although that's a tough judgment to make.The main point of this book is to explain how and why miracles are possible, and why, in fact, they're not just possible, but -must have- occurred in the past, and will occur again in the future. There's nothing encyclopedic about this approach. Miracles aren't classified or divided into categories. Rather, the point is to explain why a resistence to faith in miracles is unjustified.In this spirit, the first several chapters directly address one of the biggest obstacles to belief in miracles; naturalism; the belief that the universe is all there is. Lewis does a good job addressing the subject, making several proofs which indicate clearly that naturalism cannot be correct. He then moves on to misunderstandings of what the term \\"miracle\\" means, refutes the arguments of some anti-religious philosophers, then gets rather deeply into the subject of miracles as seen in history, in the context of the Christian faith, and finally ends by addressing the anticipated miracle of the universal resurrection of the dead, and the importance of continuing to believe in this miracle.I liked it. Lewis' arguments stand the test of time, and his refutations are as valid today as they were when he was writing them. Naturalism still hasn't found any way to get around these key points. In fact, if anything, the case against naturalism has grown even stronger since Lewis wrote this.For example, one of the philosophers who Lewis addresses most centrally was David Hume, who said that because nature is absolutely uniform, nothing is more unlikely than a miracle, and that therefore, if a reasonable man is asked to guage whether a miracle is a probable explanation for something, he'll always need to answer \\"no.\\" Therefore, even if a miracle -did occur,- no reasonable man could justify admitting or recognizing it.Lewis responded by pointing out that Hume has actually made two claims.1. That nature is absolutely uniform.2. That miracles don't occur.He then used the first to try to justify the second. The problem with doing this, Lewis said, is that both of these claims mean exactly the same thing, and this is therefore essentially question-begging in favor of miracles not occurring.Furthermore, Hume doesn't prove that miracles don't occur, even using this trick.Now, I use this as an example because since Hume's day, probability theory has progressed quite a bit, and there are even stronger arguments against his position now, based on that. To illustrate this, Hume's judgment was based on the following understanding of probability...-Each event has an intrinsic probability, which must be taken into account when guaging whether or not we should believe it occurred or might occur.-While still true, this understanding of probability is not -sufficient- by itself. There are many other rules to follow in modern probability theory, including...-In addition to the intrinsic probability of events, one also needs to take into consideration how probable it is that the proposed event might -not- have occurred.--Furthermore, one needs to consider how probable it is that, if the proposed event -had not- occurred, we would have the same evidence that we do have.-The question of what provides the best explanation in terms of its total scope, whether it's a sufficient explanation in degree, whether the explanation covers all the facts... All of these things need to be considered when guaging the probability of an event, and yet Hume considers none of them; trying to reduce the measuring stick of miracles to only their -intrinsic- probability, and worse yet, and intrinsic probability based on nothing more than his own assertions.Hume's work seems, therefore, to be utterly obsolete.Fortunately, though, Lewis' work continues to stand the test of time, though as I said, the arguments in favor of Christianity have progressed since then, and even in the last twenty years. It's precisely this kind of book, which shows where we came from and where we've headed, which I most enjoy; sound arguments phrased in an accessible language, while still being complex and logical enough to hold the attention of the most distractable of faithful Christians."},{"Title":"Miracles, a preliminary study","review":"C. S. Lewis relects more than just on the phenomenom of miracles, he draws a path to where science and human faith in God may convene temporarily, yet not necessarily harmonously."},{"Title":"Miracles, a preliminary study","review":"\\"Miracles\\" is a book by Christian apologist C.S. Lewis. It was first published in 1947 and subsequently revised in 1960. It's Lewis' most philosophical book, and could be read as a heavier sequel to \\"Mere Christianity\\", his most well known non-fiction work. Both books explain and defend a fairly traditional form of Christianity. Lewis was an Anglican, but usually attempted to write from a kind of all-Christian perspective. Both Protestants and Catholics appreciate his works.\\"Miracles\\" became quite notorious due to a debate between Lewis and the analytic philosopher Elizabeth Anscombe in 1948. The latter supposedly demolished Lewis' entire argumentation, and made him withdraw from philosophy, humiliated. This version can be found in \\"Jack\\", a friendly biography of Lewis by George Sayer. Interestingly, Anscombe herself denied that this is what happened, pointing out that Lewis actually rewrote one chapter of \\"Miracles\\" to better counter her arguments - hardly an action taken by a humiliated man who broke with philosophy. Anscombe believed that it might have been *Sayer* who was shocked by her criticisms. Besides, Anscombe was a Christian herself, so the point of her arguments was hardly to disprove the existence of God.Lewis deals with two principal issues in this book. First, he argues that the supernatural exists and that miracles are therefore possible. This is the most interesting part of the book for a non-Christian (roughly chapters 1 - 13). Second, he explains from a more theological viewpoint how the miracles of Jesus should be interpreted. He also briefly deals with some other issues, for instance the difference between theism and pantheism. The book is well written, lucid and occasionally witty.An atheist reviewer here at Amazon has repeatedly called Lewis \\"the atheist's favourite Christian apologist\\". I agree. It's not so much the arguments that mark him out. It's his style of writing. Lewis is strangely unassuming and yet completely unapologetic (in the vernacular sense). In plain English, he is honest. This is not a man who flees to some kind of pseudo-postmodernist ivory tower every time his beliefs are challenged. Nor is he on the attack, in that rabid sense typical of fundamentalists. No, he wants us to \\"reason together\\". And although I disagree strongly with his conservative political outlook (his anti-feminism being particularly galling), he even makes salient points. His criticism of logical positivism in this volume is a case in point. Indeed, how could the positivists be anti-Nazi if they believed that moral commandments were simply a way of saying \\"boo to killing\\"? If chimpanzees could speak, they would probably ream out such \\"philosophers\\". Or bash their skulls, as it were.\\"Miracles\\" may not be convincing to atheist-agnostic, and strike Mean Green Meme seekers like yours truly as somewhat problematical, but it's nevertheless a relatively competent introduction to the Christian criticism of naturalism.Five stars."},{"Title":"Miracles, a preliminary study","review":"Miracles is an example of the precise way that Lewis used his logical skills to explain complex Biblical teachings that are under a great deal of skeptical pressure in the modern age. Using deductive reasoning, Lewis takes the reader of this work from a theistic understanding of what miracles are as opposed to the prevalent naturalism, to the core of Christian teaching in the miracle of the resurrection.For Lewis, miracles are simply a part of the natural order of creation and they are described either as shortened times of creation or things reflecting a new, incorruptible creation. Lewis is more concerned with the nature of God and how he communicates and manipulates creation. He defines miracles as any interruption of the natural world by a supernatural power. Within the theology of Christianity, Lewis argues that all miracles point to the central miracle of the incarnation of Jesus and that even minor supernatural beings, like all angels, act according to how they are allowed to act by God.Lewis develops his arguments and thoughts in this book in much the same way that he developed his reasoning in Mere Christianity. He begins by defining his argument. He then defines what miracles are. He then addresses contemporary challenges to miracles in naturalism. Miracles are defined as being part of a supernatural system that acts outside of normal natural occurrences. Lewis then argues for what the concept of miracles means in the context of Christianity. His teaching ends in the discussion of the greatest miracle in the Christian faith, his \\"grand miracle\\" of the incarnation and redemptive work of Christ on earth.In arguing for miracles, Lewis uses an ad hominem approach. He intentionally uses logic and reason to examine naturalistic and rationalistic objections to miracles. First, his arguments for anything beyond the naturalistic world challenge to the inconsistencies of those who hold to reason alone. No one, he argues, can be a consistent naturalist. No one can claim that this world is all there is or ever will be. All men everywhere appeal to outside forces of morality and fairness that are not immediately apparent in nature. Before Lewis can argue for any particular miracle, he has to argue for the possibility that they exist by way of establishing the supernatural nature of the world.For modern society, the arguments of Miracles are developed to show the futility and the often ordinary objections to the possibilities of divine miracles. For the modern religionist who objects to the direct Biblical miracles as being represented by a more primitive age, Lewis argues that the belief in miracles did not come from a specific primitive line of thought, but from very sophisticated thinking. His turn of arguing for the possibility of miracles to forcing modern men to argue how their thinking is possible in the light of the grand miracle forces men to consider the call of Christ on every area of life, not just the sacred.Lewis demonstrates that any thinking about dividing reality into a scientific world and a sacred world is nonsense. God created the universe and its usual natural laws. He intervenes constantly, and from the incarnation all natural events have their meaning. This book encourages believers to not be afraid to believe the miracles of the Biblical narrative or to not be afraid to rely on them and realize their importance to everyday life. Miracles are not things that have happened historically, but represent the ongoing action of a God who constantly upholds and intervenes in his creation."},{"Title":"Miracles, a preliminary study","review":"C.S.Lewis is so good. Every intillectual who thinks he has it all figured out should read this book and all of Lewis' books on Christianity for that matter.Between reading this and Mere Christianity so much makes sense in the Christian faith that was easy to doubt in today's world."},{"Title":"Miracles, a preliminary study","review":"I have been a fan of all-things Lewis for many years, but this is the most difficult of his books to understand that I have read. I was fascinated by his broad coverage of the topic and that which I could understand, but too much of it I just could not follow. It is philosophical, deep, important, but not for someone looking for the clarity of Mere Christianity or fantasy of Narnia. It is the only one of his books that I have read that I thought was not written for the common man; however, I attribute my lack of understanding to my own limitations and not to Lewis' content or style."},{"Title":"Miracles, a preliminary study","review":"Miracles is one of my favourite CS Lewis' books. Started reading it in my early twenties but found a few chapters difficult. Nonetheless, it has given me a basic framework for what it means to believe in miracles and how that is integral to the Christian story, that would not have been without the Incarnation (dubbed the 'Grand Miracle'). The next decade, I found it easier and even more illuminating, as it had many electrifying passages that cured the 'dabbler of religious ideas' in me, that came subconsciously under the spell of the New Age pantheistic mood that was floating around. In this decade, where some fiery brand of atheists (naturalists in Lewis' term) made a comeback argument against belief in the supernatural, this book is ready at hand to buttress one against its angry rhetoric. Leave aside the big guns - William Lane Craig or David Bentley Hart - for the moment, this brief volume alone is sufficient to blow the rehashed Humean circular logic out of the water together with many other such sophistries. All this is to say that Lewis' works never seem to go outdated.Having read quite a fair bit of the bible scholar NT Wright on the themes of Resurrection and the New Creation, the chapter 'miracles of the new creation' brought up several 'aha' moments and close connections between these two intellectual giants. This makes 'Miracles' such a pleasure to read ... it offers moments after moments of delightful serendipity. It is like old wine. It gets better with age and yields a special flavor as one reads and grows with it."},{"Title":"Miracles, a preliminary study","review":"If I was reading a contemporary Christian author's reflections on the same topic, I would expect a straightforward, simplistic, hackneyed discourse. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised by C.S. Lewis's honest, thorough, and utterly unexpected approach to the topic. How refreshing! The central topic of the book definitely revolves around miracles; however, naturalism versus supernaturalism, philosophical assumptions, the incarnation, the resurrection, and prayer are delightfully discussed along the way. C.S. Lewis rightfully deserves his reputation as one of the most intellectual (so intelligent that he makes me feel idiotic), honest thinkers ever. I wish Friedrich Nieztche had been born half a century a later--would he have detected the \\"lying theologian's instinct\\" which he denounces in his book \\"Antichrist?\\" I doubt it. Delusion perhaps, but not dishonesty. If you're looking for high-quality Christian theology/philosophy, this is as good as it gets."},{"Title":"Miracles, a preliminary study","review":"The bad reviews of this book just don't seem to understand it. One reviewer says Lewis 'shoots himself in the foot' on page 8. The reviewer says that on the one hand, Lewis says the Naturalist doesn't believe in free will; but on the other hand, the reviewer notes that Lewis says we can 'circumvent the natural order'. The reviewer, I guess, sees an inconsistency. Really? Is he serious? Lewis says a Naturalist doesn't believe in free will for a reason. Namely, if Naturalism is true (as Lewis defines it), Nature is all there is; if Nature is all there is, then there is nothing but this grand, 'interlocked', series of events, all of which are causally related to each other. Free will implies 'independence' from such an 'interlocked' nexus. And that is why Lewis said the Naturalist doesn't believe in free will. Now, is there inconsistency between this and Lewis' earlier comment that everyone believes we can circumvent the natural order? Well, let's look at the context.And I have no idea where on page 7 Lewis says that everyone believes they can circumvent the natural order. That's because it's not there. The only context clues that are given are examples Lewis gave to illustrate different meanings people attatch to the word 'Nature': the unwashed dog in its 'natural' state: and the 'natural' way it felt to kiss a girl, even if you felt it to be wrong. Okay . . . But how in the world does this mean that people believe they can circumvent the 'Natural Order', as Lewis defines it? In this sense, 'Nature' means 'the grand interlocked set of events stretching back to the beginning of time and forward to the end of time, all of which are connected by the relation of cause and effect'. In sum, where is the inconsistency? There is none. The reviewer is just a bad reader. He can't follow a line of argument, and, because of that, he gives it one star. What else does he say?The reviewer then says Lewis just assumes what 'Naturalism' means, and then argues against that assumption. As far as I can tell, Lewis defines 'Naturalism' in a very fair way. The spirit of the definition is in line with how many philosophers of religion define it. Almost no Naturalist disbelieves in what's called the 'casual closure thesis', which is basically Lewis' definition stripped of the jargon. The reviewer also says that Lewis doesn't provide examples for his assumptions. Excuse me? This is one of the main reasons why I love the book. It is chock-full of examples, analogies, metaphors, and similies. Lewis was a literature professor, and could bring to philosophy a wealth of imagery, which assists our imaginations in better understanding abtruse concepts. Lewis excels at this brilliantly. In terms of philosophical sophistication, Lewis isn't an authority, for that wasn't his specialty. But he did get a '1st' in philosophy from Oxford and taught and mentored students for a while, before moving on to English. His philosophical intuitions are better than average, and his style of argumentation is some of the best I've read. He combines Chesterton's wit with Aquinas' rigor for 'form', all salted with a poetic imagination. It's just such a great mix to feed off of. It just makes me sad that the reviewer is too obtuse to notice this. It's not given a second chance, and he clumsily gives it one measley star.Lewis is then accused of hypocrisy, since he said that historians sometimes bring their naturalistic assumptions to their work. I've read about this tendency from alot of places. Historians are also regular men and women. They have beliefs about the world, what it is, what it is made of. Lewis is making a very good point. Historians aren't philosophers. When they do their history, they don't notice, and they sometimes don't feel the need to notice, that they judge some things to not have happened because their philosophy of the world excludes it. But somehow the reviewer thinks that Lewis can't say this because he's not a historian. What? Why do you need to be a historian to say this? Lewis isn't saying it as a historian; he's saying it as a philosopher - he's commenting on how historians also have a philosophy, and that philosophy can shape how a historian studies historical events. And it's true. It's a good point. But the reviewer is blind to it.The reviewer then quits here with a quote from Joseph Cambell. It's utterly irrelevant. Lewis doesn't try to prove God's existence in the book, which the reviewer would know if he read the book. It looks like he got to page 9 and put the book down. Nothing else is said anywhere about any other point Lewis made in the book as a whole. Nothing about Lewis' brilliant arguments in chapter 3, being resurrected in various ways by Reppert and Plantinga. Nothing is said about Lewis' thoughts on the relation between language, thought, and imagination in 'Horrid Red Things'. No thoughts on 'watered down religion' in 'Christianity and Relgion. No thoughts on Lewis' critique of David Hume in 'On probability'. No thoughts on Lewis' eye-opening exploration of the Incarnation in 'The Grand Miracle', or his musings on the miracles of the old and new creations.The book is given 1 star. I pick on this one review because it is a microcosm of how Lewis is treated by people who probably just don't like him. They heard from others how blindingly awesome he is, and they go to the books to prove that wrong somehow, no matter how dumb they sound. Sorry folks! Lewis was a 1st-rate scholar, and he's deserved that honor. These petty, amateurish reviews are laughed at by people who actually took the time to read his book."},{"Title":"Miracles, a preliminary study","review":"C.S. Lewis presents a great deal of solid philisophical material here. One suprise for me was that at a couple points, Lewis seems to come across as more presuppositional than evidential in his approach to apologetics. That is not to say that he is necessarily like that in all regards, but I did find some strong hints of it in this book.I'm clearly not as big of a Lewis buff as some other people I've met. In fact, I have some serious reservations about some of what he believes. However, this particular book is the real deal and I highly recommend it to those who feel they are not getting sufficient answers elsewhere."},{"Title":"Miracles, a preliminary study","review":"A great philisophical work.

But it doesn't take a rocket scientist or a doctor from Virginia to know whether a natural explanation exhists in an occurrence of a physical healing.

It was metally and spiritually refreshing to read, though it took me a while. I strongly recommend it to anyone who loves reason."},{"Title":"Miracles, a preliminary study","review":"\\"Miracles\\" is another book in which we are blessed with Lewis' flawless logic. I enjoyed this more than most of Lewis' other non-fiction work because, for some reason, it seemed a little less dry. Lewis necessarily spends a lot of time setting aright our incorrect preconceptions about the \\"natural order\\" of things. He carefully goes through the commonly accepted views of modern man (nearly the same now as fifty years ago) and states what is wrong with each idea in turn. After laying out what, logicially, is a more accurate view of the universe, he masterfully builds up his case for why miracles are possible. Lewis gives many convincing arguments and ends with a wonderful conclusion, answering the age-old question \\"How then shall we live?\\". Highly recommended, especially if you are looking for logical refutations of naturalism and pantheism."},{"Title":"Miracles, a preliminary study","review":"In this work, the master of Christian apology tackles a difficult subject: miracles. The question is easy enough--do miracles really occur?--but the answer is far more complex and difficult. True to his style, Lewis picks apart the question and analyzes it with the scrutinizing eye of a skeptic who has seen the light and wants to help others see it too.The scope, of course, goes far beyond miracles. In analyzing the probability of such events, Lewis examines Pantheism vs. Christianity, and the idea of a Nature that is completely independent of any outside interference (even God\`s). His argument that the laws and \`nature' of Nature are not violated by miracles is convincing, as is his argument that miracles are, in fact, necessary. For Lewis, a miracle wrought by the Creator of mankind is really nothing extraordinary. Some miracles, such as the water being turned into wine, simply skip a step or two. Instead of water nourishing a vine that eventually produces grapes for wine, Christ merely eliminates the intermediary steps. Other miracles, such as Christ's Resurrection, are simply a glance at what's to come, when everyone will be resurrected.Whether or not you agree with Lewis, his argument is worth considering. Like most of his work, this book is written for believer and skeptic alike, and provides a stimulating analysis of the probability of miracles occurring. This one belongs on the shelf of any Christian thinker, and will prove a stimulating read for students of philosophy as well."},{"Title":"Miracles, a preliminary study","review":"First off, I have to say that C.S. Lewis is my favorite author. Secondly, I am a Christian. Therefore, I have not given this book 3 stars because I disagree with his arguments. It is the form of them that I disliked. This book is extremely difficult to read, more than his others (and I have read almost everyone of them). I had an easier time with The Abolition of Man then this book. I got lost in chapter 3 when he begins to discuss \\"ground and consequence\\" and \\"cause and effect.\\" I have attempted to read through this book 3 times and have put it down every time. I am kinda disappointed, being a Lewis fan, that I cannot finish it, but maybe someday I will.

I like C. S. Lewis' writing in most cases, but not in this one. So dull I didn't even finish reading the book."},{"Title":"Miracles, a preliminary study","review":"The late professor of Medieval and Renaissance literature at Cambridge University, C. S. Lewis wrote his Christian apologetics in a popular style. In his book on miracles, he states that \\"logical thinking--Reason--had to be the pivot of the argument.\\" Indeed, in chapter three, \\"The Cardinal Difficulty of Naturalism,\\" he depends so completely on the contention that human reason can only be explained by invoking the supernatural that he bets the farm upon it. I will also briefly repond to Micah Newman's review in which he attempts to rebut my observations of difficulties in Lewis's argument.What Lewis points out is that a belief caused by a \\"logical consequent from a ground\\" is an entirely different cause than the \\"non-rational causation\\" to which Naturalism is supposedly limited for giving explanations of events in the world and in people's heads. Moreover, he explains that a physical cause is not a valid ground for an inference. For example, we do not consider as valid the conclusion that unicorns are real if the evidence for them is the experience of someone whose brain is chemically dosposed to having hallucinations of unicorns. As Lewis succinctly puts it, \\"To be caused is not to be proved.\\" Therefore, according to Lewis, the difficulty of explaining rational thought from \\"non-rational causation\\" justifies us in concluding that its cause is actually supernatural, thus opening the door to the miraculous. However, his argument suffers from at least three serious problems.First, although he is right that a logical ground for a belief is not the same kind of cause as \\"non-rational causation\\" and although he is also right that a belief being physically caused would not mean that it was proved, it does not follow that having a physical cause would ipso facto prove falsehood.Secondly, the same argument for the supernatural cause of rational thought may be applied with equal utility to irrational thought. For in both cases, we are equally ignorant of how to give a full account, in terms of \\"non-rational causation,\\" of the natural brain functions involved. Shall we conclude that our cognitive errors are also caused by the supernatural? If so, then our supernatural source is either unreliable or even malicious--necessary conclusions that will obviously be unwanted by proponents of miracles.Thirdly, Lewis appeals to our partial ignorance of the mystery of human consciousness and rational thought, and he uses this ignorance to support supernaturalism and the miraculous. Micah Newman contends in his review that I have misunderstood and misrepresented Lewis's argument here. However, for Lewis's case for miracles to not be an appeal to ignorance, there must be examples of faculties of the mind that are not brain-dependent. Neither reason nor moral judgement nor any other function of the mind can be shown not be brain-dependent. As is obvious from books like that of neurologist Richard M. Restak's \\"The Modular Brain,\\" change the brain and you change the person--even \\"spiritually.\\"Moreover, appeals to ignorance cannot prove the existence of the supernatural. For example, it would obviously be erroneous to conclude that the acceleration of a car by merely pressing a small peddle was miraculous just because we were too ignorant of electrical and mechanical functions to explain it from natural causation. By the same token, without knowing everything about the natural functions of the human brain in the process of creating rational thought, we have no rational validity in jumping to a supernatural explanation.What his book proves, therefore, is not that we now have rational grounds for belief in miracles. What it proves is that miracles have always been believed not on rational grounds but by the faith that \\"is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen (Hebrews 11:1). For although his argument fails to prove supernaturalism, belief in it nevertheless continues."},{"Title":"Miracles, a preliminary study","review":"Lewis warns about arguments that presume their conclusion in the first few pages. Then -- at least to my reading -- he rejects Naturalism (as he defines it) because it is obvious to him that reason is not \\"natural\\".I also think he was too slick about the \\"Naturalism\\" vs \\"Supernaturalism\\" split that he sets up. At first he admits that \\"Supernaturalism\\" could mean any number of things (say polytheism). Later he basically assumes it to mean/imply his concept of the Christian God. So almost through misdirection, he gets from showing (what he believes are) inconsistencies with one ontology to using that as support for a different ontology."},{"Title":"Miracles, a preliminary study","review":"As an atheist myself, I had heard Lewis was the best Christian apologist there is. If these arguments are the best Christianity can come up with, atheism doesn't have much to worry about.Lewis is correct that it is impossible to prove that God and the supernatural do not exist. The reason for this is that we certainly can never know everything about everything. There might be something happening somewhere for which God is really the best explanation there is. But I haven't found such a thing yet.Lewis believes that human reasoning is of supernatural origin. Neurology has been making great strides lately in explaining how the brain produces the effects that we experience as mind. In my opinion, evolution is perfectly adequate to explain human thought. It's true that the human brain didn't evolve with the purpose of being able to do calculus. The brain evolved for other reasons, such as being able to navigate a complex social world and carry out cooperative hunting and food-gathering. That the brain, once evolved, also turned out to be good for calculus was simply the sort of accident that happens occasionally in evolution.Lewis has a tendency to assume that atheism is equivalent to believing that nothing really matters. As an atheist, I do in fact believe that the universe doesn't care if I'm unhappy. However, that also means that the universe doesn't care if I'm happy. So I choose to live a life that is happy and meaningful to me, and to put a lot of effort into things that I believe make a difference to humanity. The universe has no objection to this.Lewis also assumes that naturalism is the same as determinism; that every movement of an atom is fixed from the initial conditions, so there can be no free will. This is simply a misunderstanding of modern physics. Modern science has a very large role for chance and non-linear dynamics (chaos theory) in the unfolding of events at all scales. This leaves plenty of room for free will.Lewis spends a lot of time discussing the Incarnation, the Redemption of Man, and how this all works. This simply makes me laugh. Part of the reason atheism makes sense to me is that atheism has intellectual coherence. Atheism doesn't have to twist itself into knots over the problem of how God became man while remaining God, or how God can be good when the world around us often seems filled with evil and injustice.Lewis has a reputation for being a logician. In my opinion, much of his \\"logic\\" is absurd. Contrary to what Lewis claims, perfectly plausible natural explanations exist for the reported miracles of Jesus. Let's take the loaves and fishes for an example. The first possibility is that it's simply fiction, which certainly can't be ruled out. Another possibility is that Jesus had a wealthy follower in attendance at his preaching that day. Since we know Jesus had some wealthy followers, this is not a big problem. Suppose this wealthy follower saw that it was getting to be lunchtime, realized the people were getting hungry, and decided to be generous. He sent a couple of slaves with money to the local market to buy bread and fish. The slaves were instructed to say nothing about where the food came from, but simply returned and handed it around. In this situation it is all too easy to see how a rumor could get started that the food had appeared miraculously.The problem with admitting miracles occur is that it is very difficult to sort out why they happen at some times and not others. If you believe that Christ raised a man from the dead, what is there to stop you from believing that Muhammad received the Koran from the Angel Gabriel? The level of evidence that we have for both of these events is about the same. There are plenty of Mormons who believe that Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon from a set of golden plates. Since we have first-hand, contemporary accounts from people who claimed they saw the plates, this is stronger than any evidence we have about Jesus' miracles. I don't believe in the plate story, and I don't see that the evidence is strong enough for me to believe Jesus or Muhammad did miracles, either.If Christianity really worked to make bad people good and good people better, I would be the first to sign up. If Christianity was an effective way to relieve poverty and bring peace, I would definitely consider it. If Christianity were just a silly hobby that made people feel good and harmed no one, it wouldn't bother me. Unfortunately, that isn't what I see. Even when in power, Christianity has made little or no progress in solving the social problems that it deals with, such as poverty and violence. Christianity systematically ignores the most serious problems of our times: overpopulation, exhaustion of resources, and pollution, among others. Why does Christianity ignore these problems? Because they receive little or no attention in the Bible.As far as the book itself, Lewis is a fine writer who is never boring. For that reason I give the book two stars. Before taking it too seriously, however, I would strongly recommend reading other points of view. As far as the major problems of our times, I would suggest Kunstler's \\"The Long Emergency.\\" For a defense of atheism and the naturalistic worldview,I would suggest Carl Sagan's \\"The Demon-Haunted World\\" or Taner Edis' \\"The Ghost in the Universe.\\"I read \\"Miracles\\" because I feel as a scientist that it is important not to simply dismiss religion as silly, but to give Christians their chance to convince me. If you're a Christian, are you willing to do the same for the other side?"},{"Title":"Miracles, a preliminary study","review":"I was disappointed that I ordered directly from Amazon and received books that had a different cover than was pictured, were made of poor quality \\"pulpy\\" material and one of the books actually had ~25 pages folded over and glued into the binding!

Not good.I hope this is not the new level of service Amazon will be providing."},{"Title":"Miracles, a preliminary study","review":"As someone who believes in God and miracles I can't get over how poorly this book attempts to affirm my own beliefs.It doesn't take Lewis long to shoot himself in the foot. On page 8 he claims that naturalists (atheists) don't believe in free will but on page seven he said that everyone can agree that humans can circumvent the natural order. His own examples are a man washing his dog so it doesn't get fleas and restraining oneself from kissing an attractive woman.If I wrote a book claiming that Christians didn't believe in free will because they believe everything is part of Gods plan, I would be wrong, but it would be more accurate than his assumption because I could draw a parallel between what many describe as \\"God's plan\\" and the definition of predetermination.Unfortunately this wasn't an isolated incident. His entire defense of miracles consists of stating assumptions about \\"naturalists\\" as if they were facts, making no attempt to provide examples for his assumptions, then finishing off his straw-man with a great leap of logic.The book's premise is flawed considering he starts by saying the problem with many historians is that they set out to study religion with the presupposition that miracles aren't possible thus influencing their conclusions. Said by the man who admits that he's not an historian and then wrote a book criticizing them by starting with the presupposition that miracles are possible.Doing the opposite of a mistake doesn't mean you're doing the right thing. You're probably just making the same mistake from the opposite direction.Just stick to your religious texts of choice. It's rare for an apologist to outsmart anyone but himself.\\"If the existence of God could be proven, what would be the value of faith?\\" - Joseph Cambell"},{"Title":"Miracles, a preliminary study","review":"Out of all of C. S. Lewis's books in theThe Complete C.S. Lewis Signature Classics, I would recommend reading this last. Due to the conceptual density, this does not make for as light as reading as his other more accessible books. In fact, this books requires several prerequisites. Begin with \\"The Abolition of Man,\\" the three chapter dynamo that is the keystone to Jack's philosophy. Second, round out the arch with \\"Mere Christianity\\" and \\"The Problem of Pain,\\" paying particular attention to Chapter 2 of the latter book. Furthermore, read \\"Weight of Glory,\\" \\"Transposition\\" and \\"Is Theology Poetry?\\" inThe Weight of Glory. You may also want to readChristian ReflectionsandGod in the Dock: Essays on Theology and Ethics, just to get a feel of his lines of reasoning.This is a lot of preliminary reading, but trust me it is worth it. These books and essays contain core concepts that he describes in full, which he only alludes to in \\"Miracles.\\" The ides are so subtle an novel that I recommend getting a full chapter explanation as opposed to the two paragraph version we get in this book.This is needful. Due to the delicate, complex, and absolutely fundamental nature of the ideas, this book seems wordy. But as I review and re-review the text, I keep saying, \\"Let it stand, and let the chips fall where they may.\\" I wish someone like Peter Kreeft or Ravi Zacharias could write an annotated version of this book. Until that time. . .Lewis begins his argument (not a revelation, but argument) by discussing the fundamental nature of Nature. Is nature all there is, or is there a Supernature? His main reason for believing in the Supernature comes from man's ability to think. He is, in essence, asking (my words, not his), \\"How do we go from rocks to DaVinci's brain, unless there is some ever-present intrusion.\\"Personally, I find this argument compelling. Carl Sagan finds no compelling evidence for a soul (The Dragons of Eden: Speculations on the Evolution of Human Intelligence). The staunch atheist Ayn Rand also argues for the supremacy of man's mind, but she never accounts for it's origin. She denies evolution, but remains suspiciously quiet on this core aspect of her philosophy. (For the New Intellectual: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand, 166;Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology: Expanded Second Edition).Lewis's explanation has more explanatory power, greater explanatory scope, plausibility, no ad hoc-ness, and is superior to Rand's rival hypotheses.I give Lewis credit for summing up Christianity in two propositions: 1) Men tell coarse jokes, and 2) they feel the dead to be uncanny (Ch. 13), which means, we have a fallen, animalistic nurture, and second, we are uncomfortable with our mortality. In fact, this is why Lewis is such a genius. He moves from the commonplace observations, to the deep treats of Christian theology.He concludes by discussion the central miracles of Christianity: the Incarnation, the Redemption, and the Resurrection. If miracles are inadmissible, the Christianity is pointless. The central feature of the gospel is not so much biography (as found in the Gospels), but the historicity of these miracles. The point of the Atonement is to transform men, and to save souls. Everything else is secondary.*Of all of Lewis's books, this has to be the hardest to read. Part of it has to do with all the preliminary reading that must be done. You need to be familiar with so much of his other writing to understand his points. Even within the book, chapters 1-11 are prep work to actually discussing miracles in Chapters 12-17. The chapters are longer, and in several instances could have been sub-divided. And he tends to wander a bit within the chapters. In Chapter 13, Lewis jumps tracks by discussing the fall and redemption on other planets. This is interesting, and is the basis for hisSpace Trilogy, but not quite germane.However, all of these meandering tangents do have appoint. They reveal connections between ideas that most people do not see. Thus they are a more comprehensive vista from the airy altitudes. You have a better view, but the thin air dulls the impact. Nonetheless, people still climb mountains.So you may want to read other books first. But when you read, pay especial attention to Chapter Two in \\"The Problem of Pain.\\" I think he does a better job of explaining nature in this one chapter than in chapters 1-11 in this book. But once you finish the book, you know that you have touched the mind of a genius. Remember the AHEM and chocolate analogy in Chapter 16, and laugh with his brilliance!"},{"Title":"Miracles, a preliminary study","review":"You would be hard-pressed to find this book in a conventional \\"Christian Book Store\\" as they have gone to primarily stocking sensational and new age writings. There are just so many feel-good books available, based only on the sensational and imagined, that it is so refreshing to see a fellow christian author who remains true to scripture and God by taking the unpopular road of truth on topics such as this. C. S. Lewis's works remain faithful and trustworthy for anyone truly looking for truth. In fact, my own writings were in a way inspired by some of the things he wrote merely in passing.

And when Lewis says it, he says it with beautiful eloquence that will break your heart. He begins a conversation that we must return to and continue.The Anglican Bishop Tom (N.T.) Wright said this is the best he has ever seen anyone deal with the Resurrection. He also says, \\"Space, Time, and Resurrection\\" by Thomas Torrance is a close second."},{"Title":"Miracles, a preliminary study","review":"I recently read this for the first time in years. It's funny how easy it is to forget so much about a book read once. I was pleasantly surprised and refreshed at the bracing logic and intellectual honesty to be found in these pages. Reading C.S. Lewis is always such a clarifying experience, and _Miracles_ is as prime an example of this as any.The title may be a bit misleading to the first-time reader, so be warned: Lewis is here primarily concerned with analyzing the shortcomings of philosophical naturalism rather than discussing the historicity of certain miracles. He acknowledges that he has a background in philosophical but not historical methods, so the thrust of this book is in laying a framework for epistemology, and exposing fallacies in common objections to the supernatural.Good timing for me to want to write a review of _Miracles_, so I can have the opportunity to respond to the previous review, by Jonathan Widger, as well. The \\"three serious problems\\" Mr. Widger raises are a series of compounded misunderstandings/misrepresentations of the arguments propounded in _Miracles_. Mr. Widger astutely points out that \\"non-rational causation\\", that to be caused is not to be proved, does not necessarily make caused beliefs false. This is true, and is worth pointing out. While reading Lewis's explanation of this main argument of his, there was a nagging sense in the back of my mind that there was something missing from it, and I think Mr. Widger has hit upon it. But while it does not follow, ipso facto, that a caused belief is false, to say that we arrive at reasoned, universal truths by way of a determinist chain of causes and effects is so far afield from the way anyone believes in or practices epistemology and logic, that it does not bear up under any amount of scrutiny. Presumably, Lewis considers this too obvious to point out explicitly. As he illustrates, the whole way in which we argue demonstrates how epistemology works: one of the commonest methods of debunking an opponent's views is to say \\"you say that simply *because* you are (an academic, a liberal, etc.).\\" The only workable treatment of the very foundations of reason and thought are that they are \\"super-natural,\\" although Lewis admits that this is a very different use of the word from what we are used to. \\"Self-caused\\" might be clearer, although that term doesn't hit on the point as directly, which is that will and rationality cannot be reduced to a mere dependent chain of events.This brings us to Jonathan Widger's third point (I'll get to number two), which is that ultimately Lewis's premise rests on an \\"argumentum ad ignorantum.\\" A more thorough misapprehension of Lewis' point could scarcely be conceived. It is not because we do not know *how* the mind works that we must invoke a supernatural explanation, but the mere fact that (as Lewis takes pains to explain) the process of reasoning, in order to be as meaningful and valid as we make it out to be, must be placed *outside* the cause-and-effect chain of natural events, means that its basis must be \\"super-natural\\" (self-caused). I would guess that eventually a reductionistic quantum-mechanical description (it will probably be called an \\"explanation\\") of the workings of the brain during the process of thought will be formulated, but this will not change the fact that \\"natural\\", causative explanations of rationality will be as self-defeating as they ever were, if not more so. Lewis' main argument, as always, remains intact.Widger's second objection is perhaps the most confused and incoherent of all. Wholly dependent on the whole \\"argumentum ad ignorantum\\" idea, the converse of this second objection seems to be that naturalism can somehow offer a better justification for distinguishing between true and false beliefs than even Widger's badly misunderstood version of Lewis' argument can. Once again, it is not that we don't *understand* mental processes enough to offer a natural explanation, the point is that a \\"natural\\" explanation, by definition, would be out of court with all human experience, and would leave us with no workable system in which rationality itself could be trusted. Not only would it not make any conceivable difference what we believed, but any conviction that we *chose* so would have to be utterly illusory. Incredibly, Widger compounds his misunderstanding even further by treating a \\"supernatural cause\\" as though it is just another natural cause, so that \\"our supernatural cause is either unreliable or even malicious\\" if someone's thought process is irrational! However, it is clear from the definition of independent will that one may choose irrationally, and from human frailty that we may be in error unwittingly. Supernatural entities may be corrupted just as natural ones; indeed, any corruption in the dependent natural world implies some corruption in the supernatural realm. This is the rational basis for a belief in the existence of actual evil, which naturalism once again gives us no grounds for."},{"Title":"Miracles, a preliminary study","review":"It might first be said that this work is quite unlike many of Mr. Lewis' other popular texts. While his clarity of thought and his uncanny ability to transfer thought to page in such a manner that the reader can clearly understand the author's logic remain present in this text; this work is, by no means, light or easy reading. That is, this particular work faces the tremendous challenge of formulating a logical and reasonable argument from the position maintaining that supernatural events are not entirely illogical or unreasonable. Mr. Lewis has successfully presented his argument in terms of both sound logic and persuasive argumentation; however, the presentation delves into the philosophical depths to achieve these ends. As such, the reader should be prepared for an experience which will require thoughtful contemplation if the subject matter is to be appreciated to its fullest, or any subsequent degree of entirety.While this work is, as the title suggests, about miracles, one might want to avoid prematurely associating this work with other experiences had with similar subject material. The concept of miracles can be a stumbling block for many and, as a result, the subject might be overlooked or avoided as to not feel uncomfortable in one's own beliefs. However, this text presents the subject in an extremely approachable manner which will be appreciated by anyone who both wishes to tap into this particular issue and seeks logic in any explanation, argument, and position. If the curious reader is concerned about the depth of the subject matter, they may wish to first preview this text through any number of means before purchasing it as it might become quickly apparent whether or not that which the reader seeks to gain can be drawn from this work. Whatever the case may be, with time and a willingness to entertain the concepts contained within the pages of the text, much insight can be gained in this, yet another, masterpiece composed by C.S. Lewis."},{"Title":"Miracles, a preliminary study","review":"Without doubt, one of the most powerful books I've ever read. C. S. Lewis considers the possiblity of miracles, raising all (and I mean, all) the doubts that vaguely rumble around in my head. Lewis articulates those doubts with masterful grace and clarity.In the first half/two-thirds of the book, he argues for the possiblity of miracles as such. He then turns to the specific miracles of Christianity, particularly the Incarnation, and makes his case for believing them.His thinking is profound, but his expression is clear and fully readable for the average person. Much of his thought centers on the question of Nature--is the natural world everything that exists, or is there more? Lewis lived in a highly materialist culture where people were conditioned to think that science is \\"real\\" and religion is superstition. Since we're in the same situation, Lewis' patient yet mercilessly logical arguments still hit us in all the right spots.Two quotes to give you a flavor of his writing...\\"If we are content to go back and become humble plain men obeying a tradition, well. If we are ready to climb and struggle on till we become sages ourselves, better still. But the man who will neigher obey wisdom in others nor adventure for her/himself is fatal.\\"[Writing about the Incarnation.] \\"The credibility will depend on the extent to which the doctrine, if accepted, can illuminate and integrate that whole mass. It is much less important that the doctrine itself should be fully comprehensible.\\"Lewis has made me think about Nature in a totally new way. He makes God more than a mere idea. He makes God real, alive, concrete, tangible. For a Christian reader, I think \\"Miracles\\" will strengthen belief because it relies on and appeals to common sense and serious reflection. The non-Christian reader should also enjoy the book; Lewis is unwaverlingly polite and respectful of all points of view. This is not surprising, since Lewis himself had been a serious skeptic before his conversion."},{"Title":"Miracles, a preliminary study","review":"This is not a book about the miraculous in every day life- about how miracles occur for the average person, and how to experience them. There are a lot of good books on those subjects. This is not one of them. It is however a much-needed book on the theoretical miraculous. Can miracles occur? What does it mean when they do? How do they fit in with reality?Lewis answers in the affirmative- miracles do occur. Indeed a substantial portion of the book is an apologetic explaining how the miraculous can and does occur, despite the misgivings of philosophical Naturalism. For this purposes he initially sets up the proofs of a spiritual realm and of God. Ironically for a theoretical work, Lewis shows us how the miraculous is not contrary to the natural and physical world, but fits fully within it, or rather without. While not actually being part of the physical the miraculous partakes of the physical, or rather, the physical partakes of it. This is perhaps the genius of Lewis' book, that he shows how a miracle never suspends the laws of nature, but is fully what we would expect if there were laws of nature as well as a divine nature.From here Lewis looks at particular miracles, particularly the greatest miracle of all, the Incarnation, and how this moment was what all of space and time leads up to and reflects upon. He also analyzes miracles and the different imports of various types historically recorded. Throughout he writes with his customary wisdom and wit, analyzing in common language what we had always somewhat already known, but never well enough to emerge into the conscious mind so that we could act upon it. For that, we need C.S. Lewis.I found this book immensely illuminating. Though theoretical, it encourages the reader to embark on a journey beyond the mundane, to expand the horizons, to see the reality that is beyond all reality. Miracles exist for a purpose, Lewis tells us. They are not just dropped as a \\"God in the gaps\\", to fill a niggling problem that we cannot otherwise solve. They exist to reveal something greater, namely God. I was encouraged, overwhelmed with joy, as I read what Lewis revealed in new ways- the great miracle of the resurrection. But it doesn't end there. For just as miracles are part and parcel of the natural order, so is the resurrection. Above all the Christian religion can not be divorced from the miraculous. Nearly every other religion could survive without it- in Christianity, one particular miracle is so central that without it there is no meaningful religion. If Jesus is not God made man, and subsequently died and resurrected, there really is no point to believing the whole yarn.And the resurrection allows for the resurrection of us all. Lewis has shown us that Christianity is not a mystical spiritualist religion, denying creation. Dualism of that sort was considered heresy millennia ago. Just as miracles could not deny the natural order without denying both science and the central doctrine of Christianity, so the resurrection mandates a resurrection of the physical as well as the spiritual. That's exciting news. Not just a new Spirit, but a new creation. Lewis forced me to contemplate that anew as he delved into what that might mean. What it fully means we can not this side of Eternity truly know. But it's going to be fun.I wish he had stopped there. For his final page dampens the ardor of the book. There he discusses how miracles are unlikely to occur for the average person- they occur but rarely in history.Ironically, Lewis seems to fall for the same problem he has been attacking throughout his book. He explains how the Naturalist is unable to accept the miraculous because they allow the natural mind to take control, rather than their reason, which itself is evidence of the supernatural. Lewis has not taken the time and study to look for the miraculous and to practice it in everyday life. For make no mistake, such requires time and study. It requires a willingness to be observant and attendant, and to practice, again and again. Not to make stuff up or assume the miraculous is present when it is not- Lewis is right in warning us against that error. But in an age of Naturalism, we have become attuned to not look for the miraculous, and we are all susceptible to this. Just so then we must needs train to see it again.Secondly, I and others I know have experienced many miracles in life. They are rare, assuredly. But they do occur.Lastly, Lewis does discuss these \\"everyday\\" miracles in his second appendix on Providence. He does a very good job of explaining there how predestination and free-will intermix to allow for the miraculous. But he would seek to reduce this to the natural order of things. God in all His foreknowledge determined the right order of events, incorporating our prayers, and answers to our prayers, within His divine plan. Well and good. But if this then denies the miraculous element of answers to prayers, it also strips away the miraculous from*every* event. For the miracles of Jesus would also then be simply part of His divine plan. Indeed, more so than any other, the Grand Miracle, of the Incarnation and Resurrection, are part of His divine plan, and therefore part of providence. Stating that an everyday answer to prayer is providence and therefore not miraculous cheats the miraculous of any power it has at all.To find out how miracles can be every day, how they are freely available, how healing can be part of your life in a meaningful way, pick up another book, like those by Peter Wagner. To find out how miracles are possible, how their presence allows us to transcend this earthly plane by fully incorporating the earthiness of life, read and dive into this book."},{"Title":"Miracles, a preliminary study","review":"Miracles, originally published in 1947 and revised in 1960, is a book on Christian apologetics by C. S. Lewis. Using philosophical and logical arguments, Lewis asserts that man's ability to reason proves that something (God) exists beyond Nature. From here he goes on to argue that this God (he assumes it's the Christian God) can and has in fact done miracles.This is a short book, but it can be tough. Readers without logical or philosophical training, no matter how intelligent, may quickly become lost, especially early. The reader may at this point decide to either give up or just take Lewis's word for it.Lewis's arguments aren't always airtight - he's always been prone to let his arguments come down to \\"A versus B\\" without allowing for the possibility of \\"C\\" - but he always talks a good game and is usually able to get through the weak spots on wit and readability. And so, for the most part, it is here, the more inscrutable parts of the work notwithstanding.Miracles is hardly Lewis's most accessible work, and it seems unlikely to persuade too many atheists, but it's worth a read for anyone interested in a logical or philosophical approach to Christian apologetics."},{"Title":"Miracles, a preliminary study","review":"The greatness of Lewis' books on theology/God/religion/faith/etc. is that even the most hardcore atheist will come out of these books with something. *Miracles* is full of intelligent thought, brilliant philosophy, witty remarks, and everything that makes a classic Lewis book. This one is no exception.*Miracles* is subtitled *A Preliminary Study* and indeed it does the groundwork one must do before tackling actual miracles; so do not expect this book to be an enquiry into specific miracles with historical details and such: this is more of a philosophical enquiry into the possibility and nature of miracles, what they are, what they imply if they exist, and how they could exist.*Miracles*, as any other book by Lewis I read, is a delicious read. Not one page is dull, not one empty moment. This is one of the few philosophers that I really feel like are bringing something true and important to my life."},{"Title":"Miracles, a preliminary study","review":"In this book, C.S. Lewis looks at the essence of what miracles are and how they relate to Christianity. He begins with a few chapters trying to prove that miracles have occurred and are occurring. In these chapters and at other points in the book, he examines what miracles are to us psychologically and why individuals have a hard time believing in them. Lewis talks intelligently about a subject that many would consider only a matter of faith and not reason. While I am not wholeheartedly ready to jump in the boat on every single one of his ideas, I found his thinking to be enlightened and very interesting. One of Lewis's main points is the difference between the belief that the universe is the whole of existence with nothing possible outside of it and the belief that God is the surveyor of all there is with our universe being only one of other realms. He makes this and his other points clearly and intelligently. Reading through this book is invaluable in deepening one's faith and understanding of Christianity."},{"Title":"Miracles, a preliminary study","review":"\\"Miracles\\" is probably my favorite non-fiction book by Lewis. It is his most philosophical work, and one in which he builds a logical argument one step at a time throughout the entire book. I still remember the feeling after my first reading: a feeling of just having gone through an incredible and wonderfully articulate thinking process.What seems to have led Lewis to writing the book is the question, \\"How reliable are the Gospels and the other New Testament writings that tell us about the life of Jesus?\\" It is a question that has been hotly debated in the last few hundred years, especially among German theologians of the 19th and early 20th century.What C. S. Lewis criticized about this debate is that since the supernatural is essential in the Gospels, the discussion has often centered around philosophical presuppositions rather than historical evidence. Theologians such as Rudolf Bultmann, Lewis maintained, doubted the historical reliability of the Gospels not because they had historical evidence to do so, but due to a philosophical presupposition that miracles do not happen. Which is an assumption they could not have possibly obtained from reading the Gospels. It is something they brought to their reading. But where did they get it from? How did they know that miracles do not happen?Thus C. S. Lewis wrote \\"Miracles,\\" where he presses the question about the reliability of the Gospels to an even more essential question: \\"Can the events told in the Gospels - including their miracles and predictive prophecies - happen at all, or are they absolutely impossible?\\"That is a question the Gospels will not answer for us. It is a philosophical question we have to deal with before we approach the Gospels. If we conclude beforehand that certain stories in the Gospels cannot possibly happen, no amount of historical evidence will convince us. As Lewis says, if someone who disbelieves in angels one day sees an angel, he will probably say that it was an illusion. Supernatural experience will not convince someone who holds an anti-supernatural philosophy. \\"What we learn from experience depends on the kind of philosophy we bring to experience.\\"Likewise, what we learn from the Gospels depends on the kind of philosophy we bring to the Gospels. \\"It is no use going to the texts until we have some idea about the possibility or probability of the miraculous. Those who assume that miracles cannot happen are merely wasting their time by looking into the texts: we know in advance what results they will find for they have begun by begging the question.\\"Thus Lewis discusses miracles not on the ground of Experience but on the ground of Reason. Is it reasonable to believe in the (at least theoretical) possibility of miracles? (And by \\"miracle\\" is meant something that interferes with the natural processes of this universe, something that acts into Nature from above.)To greatly simplify his argument in \\"Miracles,\\" the answer to this question is so obvious that many people do not see it. They cannot see the wood for the trees. They forget that everyday they experience causes from outside of Nature acting into Nature. They forget about themselves. They - that is, Homo sapiens - have the ability to interfere with the natural processes of this universe. We are in a very real sense a miracle!Talking about Nature as if there were nothing unnatural about it and as if miracles were something utterly unreasonable is not well thought out, Lewis maintained. Miracles are theoretically reasonable because they are an interference with Nature, and our own experience demonstrates that Nature has already been interfered with. WE are in it. Miracles are therefore nothing entirely different from what every human being has already experienced.This, of course, does not mean that miracles (other than the miracle of the human being) do in reality occur (and Lewis has much more to say in the book). It only means that they do not contradict Reason, and that they are not so foreign to our experience as some people would make us believe. They are not an insult to the order of existence, since such \\"insult\\" happens all the time by our hands.If one agrees with Lewis' reasoning, one can start approaching the Gospels with an open mind instead of rejecting its miracles from the outset.- Jacob Schriftman, Author of The C.

Lewis's goal in Miracles is to convince us that miracles are not unreasonable. He does this admirably. He points out that one subscribing to materialism has no real grounds on which to criticize miracles. In fact, the materialist has no warranted grounds for his choice of materialism because Reason itself is not grounded in materialism. However, the chapter \\"Christianity and 'Religion'\\" looms as the most brilliant in the book. In it, he delineates a god that men create from the God who is. He concludes the chapter with the following statement: \\"There comes a moment when people who have been dabbling in religion ('Man's search for God!') suddenly draw back. Supposing we really found Him? We never meant it to come to that!

As with all of his works, this is a must read for Christians.Although this book may not convince a lot of skeptics, it will certainly make them reconsider their reasons for doubting.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Miracles, a preliminary study","review":"Miracles is one of Lewis' longer apologetic works, and I think, perhaps the most complicated. This is not because Lewis has lost the wonderful, taut, reasoned writing that people have grown to expect of him, but rather because people's views on miracles can be terribly hard to unknot. This, I think, is also the most purely philosophical work he wrote, though that should not scare anyone away, as he lays out everything in a very clear, readable way.Lewis starts with a bang, in that he shows that miracles and the uniformity of natural laws are in fact bound together. He turns the materialists' (or Naturalists', as he calls them) own guns on them by showing that Reason cannot be accounted for in science--I should also point out that these objections have also been raised by professional philosophers in epistemology and ethics, but Lewis is the only person to raise them for a wider audience. I wish I had read this book earlier, when I was first encountering David Hume, as C.S. Lewis in this part of the book exposes the philosophical sleight-of-hand Hume used to \\"disprove\\" miracles.With this, C.S. Lewis then addresses religions which state that God does not work miracles because He does not see fit to interfere with creation and a variety of other bad metaphors and misconceptions that have cropped up. I continue to wonder at Lewis' clarity, and his understanding of the modern mind which allows him to diagnose its fallacies so well.Academics and many other modern citizens do not question the possibility of miracles, or at any rate adhere to some faulty reason for denying their existence. I hope this book can help shake that up and get people talking about this issue with greater clarity."},{"Title":"Miracles, a preliminary study","review":"When I first read Lewis at 19, I was bowled over by him. Now, 40 years later, I feel like shaking him because he ought to have been better than the specious reasoning that informed his apologetics. In any case, I just finished \\"Miracles,\\" lent to me by friends, and found it argued with Lewis's customary intelligence, imagination, and wit.Unfortunately, the book in general reminds me of nothing so much as the \\"Alford Defense.\\" Earl Rogers, a successful defense attorney of 100 years ago, got a man named Alford acquitted of first degree murder. Alford had confronted a man named Hunter who had cheated him and shot Hunter to death in a public place, pointing his weapon downward at the victim's abdomen. Rogers insisted on having the victim's intestines brought into court in a jar and then began to tell the jury a story of how the bullet would have traveled at the same angle if Hunter had been in the act of leaning over and beating Alford as the defendant lay on the floor. In other words, he told it exactly backwards, but the jury found his account so interesting that they voted for acquittal.It seems to me that Lewis does something similar here. Stories of Christian miracles are not as doubtful as your run-of-the-mill myths and legends, Lewis explains, because Christian miracles have a purpose. This purpose was accomplished by the incarnate Son of God whose acts, such as walking on water, began to demonstrate the changed relationship between nature and regenerate man. Still, we must not expect spiritually transformed people in general to walk on water, even though such events seem implied by John 14:12 because, after all, \\"God does not cast miracles about like flakes from a pepper shaker.\\" As to prayer, since all time is now to God, we may indeed expect our prayers to affect events that happened even before we prayed, because God already knew of our prayers and took them into account. Still, we mustn't go too far and pray for the life of someone who died yesterday, since that would indicate a lack of submission to God's will (which makes the whole episode of the raising of Lazarus a little strange).Sorry, but as one reads this, it's hard not to hear, in the back of one's mind, a still small voice chanting \\"Heads, I win; tails, you lose.\\"The book is well known for its chapter entitled \\"A Cardinal Difficulty of Naturalism.\\" In it, Lewis argues that thought itself would be impossible in a purely natural world. The best way to sum up his argument might be to say that \\"A clock shows time; it does not *know about* time.\\" Lewis believed that our physical selves were mere automata, responding to sights, sounds, and appetites, but unable to form a train of thought about anything. This was true, he argued, for two reasons: first, because, if evolution were true, we had not evolved to analyze metaphysics but to find food, shelter, and mates, leaving our minds incapable of complex meta-cognition. The second reason was that, in a purely physical universe, all our thoughts must be predetermined by the thoughts that preceded them and would, thus, be entirely out of our control.I read this chapter twice to make sure I was not misunderstanding Lewis, but lest there be any doubt, he reiterates his point on page 205 of the edition I read, when he says that when we think a thought, we may believe we are commanding the atoms in our brains to behave a certain way, but we would be unable to do what we call thinking without supernatural aid. Indeed, the very presence of reason is the ground on which Lewis argues for a supernatural world at all.In other words, Lewis says, without Divine aid, we cannot think or reason at all (as opposed to simply experiencing a progression of disjointed thoughts that are nothing but responses to immediate stimuli). This must mean, among other things, that we cannot so much as tell time or balance a checkbook unaided by supernatural agency.Whatever the merits of this argument may be, it has the rather awkward consequence of making the Deity actively complicit in every premeditated crime ever committed since, by Lewis's logic, natural man would not have been able to devise any plans at all, for good or ill, without supernatural help. It is one thing for the Deity merely to abstain from scrambling the thoughts of a would-be malefactor so as to grant him moral agency; it is quite another to be the sole agency by which he can plan his assault, robbery, or murder in the first place.I suppose that in a way, none of this should surprise me since Lewis, as is well known, was the son of a prosecutor, and he argues with the same ingenuity and vigor. Just as importantly, he was not merely a logician but a poet, and poetic language undergirds Lewis's own passion for his subject. Despite what one actually knows about the Old Testament God who sent a bear to maul the children who taunted the prophet or his later New Testament self who struck Ananias and Sapphira dead, the reader may indeed find himself wishing that Lewis's account of things were really true, and that one could really know, and surrender to, the Being who is the \\"primary fact before all facts, the source of being,\\" etc. Kenneth Tynan wrote that if were ever tempted to stray into the precincts of religious belief, it would be from having read the likes of Lewis, and it is easy to see why. But sooner or later, one is reminded that Lewis's work is likely one more chapter in a centuries-long \\"Alford Defense\\" of an improbable system of thought--quite irritating on one level, though poignant on another, when you consider that the book's title refers to events that even many Christians believe no longer occur."},{"Title":"Miracles, a preliminary study","review":"I first read the book in my late teens or so. Impressed as always by Lewis' brilliant writing, the book furnished my mind with arguments and ways of looking at life that have benefited me ever since. But Lewis didn't really answer my main question. My question (overlooking the subtitle, maybe) was not, \\"Might miracles happen in theory?\\" It was \\"Do they happen in reality?\\" Reading Miracles, I felt a bit let down, as the atheist Alan Orr felt when reading Richard Dawkins' The God Delusion:\\"Since when is a scientific hypothesis confirmed by philosophical gymnastics, not data!\\"Afterwards I went to Hong Kong as a missionary with lots of questions, and found empirically that sometimes, God does answer prayer in remarkable ways. I wrote a book (Jesus and the Religions of Man) with chapters on \\"Miracles\\" and \\"Impractical Magic\\" arguing that allegedly supernatural events fall into distinct patterns, and that one set -- exemplified by the works of Jesus -- do seem to happen. (Not recognizing, perhaps, how many of my insights might be traced originally back here!)This summer I was back in Hong Kong. A church that I spoke at gave me a gift certificate to their book store, and I renewed my old acquaintance with this book again.How much rich and profound thinking is in it! This is a gold-mine of lucid, important thinking, maybe the best of Lewis' directly apologetic books. The book is not just about miracles; it is an introduction to life, from a Christian point of view.Talking with skeptics recently, I wanted to quote long passages from this book at them. Lewis answers, in a balanced and simple way, so many of the challenges skeptics continue to offer about miracles, showing that far from \\"violating\\" the laws of nature, they show that the Lord of Nature continues to work in the world, in ways that lend new meaning to Nature's otherwise sterile patterns. Miracles are, Lewis teaches us, the least arbitrary events in the universe. They make Nature itself arbitrary by comparison.If you're a skeptic, you'll need an open mind to benefit from Lewis' argument. He doesn't overawe you with scientific data; he coaxes reader to conclusions as the sun coaxes flowers to open in the spring. But if you take in his arguments, and consider human experience from this perspective -- talk to a few missionaries! -- I think you'll find, as I have over the past 30 years, that Lewis' comments here are deeply illuminating."},{"Title":"Miracles, a preliminary study","review":"According to C. S. Lewis, this book is intended as a preliminary to historical inquiry. It does not, therefore, examine the historical evidence for Christian miracles, but is intended to put readers in a position to do so. Lewis states: \\"It is no use going to the texts until we have some idea about the possibility or probability of the miraculous. Those who assume that miracles cannot happen are merely wasting their time by looking into the texts: we know in advance what results they will find for they have begun by begging the question.\\" In his appeal to the \\"common reader\\" and not specifically to theologians, Lewis defines a miracle broadly as \\"an interference with Nature by supernatural power.\\" This distinction between the natural and supernatural is presupposed and posited up front because Naturalists, according to Lewis, believe that nothing exists except Nature (Nature is considered \\"the whole show,\\" the \\"Total System,\\" etc.) which, if true, rules out the possibility of the supernatural. Nature is considered by Lewis, and Supernaturalists in general, as a partial system within reality, not Reality itself. It is a created thing (abstractly speaking), not the self-existent Creator. Lewis argues by analogy and uses human reason and morality as examples of the supernatural that are distinct from Nature. In fact, Lewis argues that humans, as compositions of the natural and supernatural, intervene in Nature by supernatural acts (which he considers self-determined acts not caused by another in some inevitable causal chain). But he admits (see Chapter 6) that such acts are not what many equate with \\"miracles\\" since they are both familiar and regular (not to mention humanly caused). Therefore, he ends Chapter 6 by saying in effect that the rest of the book will concern itself with miracles as special divine interventions.For Lewis, the cardinal difficulty with Naturalism is the existence of human reason and its thoughts which can be either true or false, unlike events in general which are not \\"about\\" anything and therefore cannot be true or false. According to Lewis, the Naturalist believes that reason, sentience, and life itself are late comers in an historical, evolutionary process that was not DESIGNED to produce a mental behavior that can find truth (including moral truth). Therefore, Naturalism doesn't adequately explain the existence of reason (and morality). For theism, on the other hand, reason (divine reason) is before Nature and our own concept of Nature depends on reason. Later, in Chapter 13, Lewis argues that theism ratifies faith in the scientific principle of uniformity [which is used by some, like David Hume, to argue against miracles], but disallows making uniformity absolute. But if Naturalism is true, then we have no reason to trust our conviction that Nature is uniform in any sense (general or absolute). In Chapters 14 - 16, Lewis tries to present the central miracles of the Christian Faith in such a way as to exhibit their \\"fitness\\" into Nature w/o setting forth any abstract conditions which \\"fitness\\" must satisfy because \\"our sense of fitness is too delicate and elusive\\". By \\"fitness\\" Lewis means their historical probability [i.e., compatibility w/ Nature] which he distinguishes from the \\"antecedent probability of chances\\" [i.e., mathematical probability]. In Chapters 7 & 8, Lewis responds to objections that Nature doesn't allow miracles. In Chapter 8 he points out that the laws of Nature don't cause anything because \\"every law, in the last resort, says 'If you have A, then you will get B.' But first catch your A: the laws won't do it for you.\\" This allows for \\"supernatural\\" causation, human or divine. In Chapter 10, Lewis addresses language as it relates to thought and points out that clear thinking is distinct from imagination in general and metaphor in particular which are used both in scripture and common discourse when discussing metaphysical things (like God and his activity). Chapter 11 addresses pantheism [a special type of idealistic naturalism distinct from the atheistic materialism which is Lewis's main focus] and points out some of its problems. Here Lewis states that God is concrete and individual; he is a particular Thing, not an abstract \\"universal being\\" [distinct from omnipresence] which would rule out the possibility of creation because \\"a generality can make nothing\\".Although Lewis discusses some relevant issues regarding miracles in general (and New Testament ones in particular) and their compatibility with Nature, he does strangely relegate at least some Old Testament miracles to the realm of myth which is partly due to his unique view that in Christ myth became history. For a critical analysis of Lewis' view, see Norman Geisler's chapter on Lewis titled \\"Christian Humanism\\" in his book \\"Is Man the Measure?\\" For a more recent systematic analysis of miracles that relies heavily on Lewis, see Geisler's \\"Miracles and the Modern Mind\\" (OP) and \\"In Defense of Miracles,\\" edited by Geivett and Habermas. Also, see Collins's \\"The God of Miracles\\" which notably points out that some Christians have negatively reviewed Lewis's book because they think Lewis was operating with a defective understanding of \\"nature\\" and divine action [note: pantheists and panentheists would also affirm this]. Collins addresses these other positions within Christianity which differ from the \\"supernaturalism\\" of Lewis, Geisler and Collins himself. Also, Lewis doesn't address whether miracles are applicable today and, if so, to what extent. Other books such as \\"Are Miraculous Gifts for Today?,\\" edited by Wayne Grudem address this issue."},{"Title":"Miracles, a preliminary study","review":"When evaluating MaPS, it is most important to keep in mind that Lewis was designing a connected argument, not a salad-bar argument. Each chapter builds upon positions taken in previous chapters, even the ones in which he works to clear up some potential misunderstandings. It is a mistake to treat the book as a set of disconnected positions, as I have often seen critics do (pro and con).So, for example, one prominent oppositional criticism I have seen, treats the chapters on morality and on probability (5 and 13) as being separate attacks by Lewis on philosophical naturalism. But they weren't designed by Lewis to be anything of the sort, and so (naturally |g|) they fail to withstand such misdirected criticism. By the time Lewis has finished chapter 3, he is no longer attempting to argue against naturalism (or atheism, to be more specific--see below), and so does not bother to continue any rigorous argument against it elsewhere.He makes this especially clear in chp 5: the goal of the chapter is to infer a further characteristic of God (although admittedly he incautiously names the chapter \\"A Further Difficulty of Naturalism\\"); the naturalistic position he presents is one he admits can be logically self-consistent (even if no naturalist ever follows it consistently); and he ends the chapter by saying that his discussion of morality offers no weight as to the question of whether miracles ever occur. In short, this is not a separate theistic Argument from Morality.Again, with the 13th chapter, the goal is _not_ to argue a weakness of naturalistic philosophy (nor to broadbase refute Hume, btw); but to consider the principles of probability estimation with an eye to discerning what _kind_ of probability estimate, based on what grounds, would be best for judging claims of the miraculous. Both chapters are attempting something very much more subtle and restricted than Lewis' key argument from chapter 3; and Lewis is doing this, because they are pieces of one developing position.Lewis ought to have distinguished more carefully between naturalism / supernaturalism and atheism / theism. The distinctions, to his credit, _are_ there in the book; but they require some careful criticism to discern: and critics of MaPS (pro and con) aren't often very careful. |g| Be that as it may, chapter 3 is actually directed toward the refutation of atheism (the Final Fact of reality is non-sentient) rather than, strictly speaking, naturalism (there is one and only one 'level' to reality.) Most atheists happen to also be philosophical naturalists, and at the time(s) of Lewis' writing most were in the habit of calling themselves Naturalists; so he politely accepted the use of the title. With the multi-form division of atheistic theories since then, this leaves a door open to spurious oppositional criticisms of various sorts. ('Lewis is only arguing against \\"naturalism\\", not this or that other type of atheism'; 'Lewis is misrepresenting \\"naturalism\\" as being too broad for what it actually proposes', etc.)Also, Lewis gets slightly ahead of himself near the end of chapter 3, when speaking about God in relation to human reason. He has already finished his line of argumentation, and has not yet argued that humans are not themselves the source of their own rationality (that's what he does in some future chapters); and this, combined with a clumsy unannounced shift back to the more qualified position of chapter 3, has provided ammunition for some terribly uncritical 'criticism' against him.On the other hand, Lewis has treated the questions of 'hard' and 'soft' determinism (not called such in his book, though) with more deftness than critics have tended to allow. Much weight is often laid, for instance, by critics (pro and con) on his use of Haldane's refutation of hard determinism--without noticing that Lewis, in the very next sentence and paragraph, explicitly disavows any gain he might have made by using the reference! In fact, the bulk of chapter 3 is devoted to an analysis of the knottier problems surrounding 'indeterminate' types of 'naturalism'.Often a critic (pro or con), to save time (or wordcount |g|), will skip straight from Lewis' (own disavowed!) use of Haldane, to the two examples of rebuttal which he anticipates near the end of the chapter. This is a critical mistake, although it isn't as much of one as I used to think. The final gist of Lewis' chapter 3 argument, is that it is equally nonsensical to justify the existence or the non-existence of human justification capability--to prove that proofs do exist, or to prove that proofs don't have to exist--and that atheism ultimately entails one of these two options. Lewis reaches this position through a careful (and difficult-to-follow) analysis of the relationship of cause/effect and ground/consequent categories in relation to human thought. This is not something a critic can afford to ignore, in order to see _why_ Lewis anticipates the two lines of rebuttal attempt. But the anticipated rebuttals do admirably summarize the principles of his argument, I think. At least, I have been amused by the fact that, to date, every oppositional attempt I have seen to refute MaPS chp 3, ends up applying either to one or the other of his anticipated rebuttals! (Without the opponent realizing that he is stepping right into the trap Lewis has set!)There are some shortcomings to the book: his argument against pantheism could stand to be much clearer (it's there, but diffused throughout several chapters--his main chapter vs. pantheism is really targeted against a variant popular in his youth); and he is a little sneaky about the actual topic of his book (an apology for Christianity).But overall, he presents the most comprehensive 20th century argument I have found for the metaphysical doctrines of Christianity. He isn't as technically rigorous as other authors have been; but MaPS easily serves as a springboard of principles upon which to base more complex arguments--once the reader has understood what Lewis is doing, and why."},{"Title":"Miracles, a preliminary study","review":"Sometimes it is amazing to think that the same C.S. Lewis who wrote the beloved \\"Chronicles of Narnia\\" series with their Christian messages for a young adult audience is the same C.S. Lewis of such a heavily philopshical work like \\"Miracles\\". Subtitled \\"How God Intervenes in Nature and Human Affairs\\" this work is a carefully crafted argument to demonstrate not only the existence of God but how miracles are truly part of nature and therefore rather easy to believe. It is not a work for the faint-hearted or a work that can be read lightly, for it is dense, thought-provoking material that will leave readers pondering and seeing faith through C.S. Lewis's eyes.Lewis begins by drawing clear distinctions between what naturalists and supernaturalists believe as a way to define exactly how miracles are naturally part of God's plan. Lewis argues that we cannot look for historical evidence to prove miracles are real if we don't first establish a philosophical basis for believing in the miraculous. Lewis examines miracles big and small - the changing of water into wine, the immaculate conception, the existence of the holy Trinity - providing evidence and explanations for each. His argument is all the more powerful knowing that it is coming from a former agnostic who did everything in his power to argue against the existence of God (which led to his conversion). Because he has been on the doubting side of the issue, Lewis can offer solid counterarguments to those who wuold question his beliefs.According to Lewis, miracles are consistent with nature and the nature of God - they are not inconsistencies which should be doubted but rather recognized as part of God's plan for creation. After all, God is the one writing the story, one with a very complicated plot that we might not always understand or even pay great attention to. \\"Miracles\\" is not an easy read. It is highly philosophical and readers must be patient, attentive, and perceptive to appreciate the argument the author puts forth. It is a work that will make one think and make one see anew the signs and wonders that seemed so familiar and explained."},{"Title":"Miracles, a preliminary study","review":"I was relieved when I finished reviewing this book. Lewis land gets foggy the further away you get from Narnia. My inept review of THE FOUR LOVES is ample proof of my fogginess. Let me describe what I think this book is saying and then I will add to it. This book requires a tome and not a review.Lewis tells us in MIRACLES that we are cursed with apriori reasoning in this secular age. The experts tell us that the prophecies of the Bible could not have been written before the event occurred because that would of course prove the \\"impossible.\\" Things can be known only after the fact.Naturalism, super naturalism and sub naturalism control events. The naturalist says that nature is the first reality and that everything springs. The super naturalist says that the sub natural controls the natural which is influenced by supernatural influences that the natural is made to accommodate. The supernatural is not alien to the natural but is adapted irruption. The sub natural is an event which is seemingly random at each event but produces long term predicable results. An example of sub natural phenomenon would be long term coin tossing leading to random results that would eventually produce a binomial probability curve.Naturalism is the villain that leads to secularism and egalitarianism since it posits predictability and uniformitarianism. Super naturalism implies authority since the source is outside the system and presumably from a greater force than naturalism. Nature is the primary cause for naturalism. Pantheism is the religion of nature since its gods are created from within naturalism. Miracles in naturalism would result from a force in nature that creates rarely seen but predicable phenomena. An example of a natural \\"miracle\\" would be Jung's sycronicity. A naturalist view of miracles would be analogous to looking at a square on the ground whereas the super naturalist view would be extending the square to a cube and not expecting as much.Naturalism faces the dual problem of will and morality. If thoughts are the sum total of atoms then how can we stand outside natural processes to observe them? If our own self view of nature is determined by nature itself then how can reason be objective? If will cannot exist as a part of what it is looking at then how can morality exist as autonomous from natural processes? How can a \\"rigid determinist\\" like Karl Marx talk about social justice.These phenomenology discussions get involved and suffer from some examples of forced facts and assumptions. We are told that the ancient world considered the earth insignificant, yet Copernicus ushered in the modern age by disproving that the earth was indeed the center of the solar system. The supernatural is ignored much the same way that a window is ignored when you look at a garden according to Lewis...but then again the window may not exist after all. The Hebrew creation story is unique to Lewis because of a preexisting God outside of naturalism creating nature, yet didn't I read in the Koran that God is an \\"original self- existing fact?\\"The two systems are interlinked by interruptibility-nature that can be made to be irrupted. Strict dualism between the supernatural and natural is possible but hard to imagine since at some point they would have to be linked \\"back locked.\\"Miracles in super naturalism become knowable only if God's laws are known and are and extension of them the irruption allowed or God modified aspect of nature. Supernatural events are back locked to God who is the source of all creation. Supernatural miracles point to a unity deeper reality based on God designed nature. Christianity creates an image of an antro-God verses the entity God or spirit everything that modern people so enjoy as progressive. The reality produced by true miracles is not spiritual but heavier than reality since it is an amplification of reality.The world loves the abstract and is offended by the physical imagery of the Bible. I remember Rick Warren in an interview with Leslie Stahl misquote Galatians 3:28 by substituting the word God for Jesus. This misquote served a purpose in that it created the abstract image rather than the gritty bloody image of suffering that would keep his interview from being mainstreamed by the decadent lazy society he is trying to pander to. Pleasant clouds,no martyrs needed here. Father keep us from the face of our sins.Unlike other faiths, Christianity is based on one miracle central to its existence...The Grand Miracle. Our faith in the sun is proved by not looking at the sun but at what it illuminates since \\"we cannot look at the sun.\\" What about dark glasses? Christianity is the symphony which is the central fact which orders phenomenon efficiently and science is the note. Other faiths are inadequate to do this.Supernatural miracles reflect the old and new creation. Christian miracles are an intrusion by a familiar power into a creation made for miracles. In Buddhism miracles would serve no purpose except to add to the horror of a nature that was an illusion to begin with...adding to a nightmare. The old creation miracles are the chosen miracles because they are of the chosen people. These chosen miracles are short cuts of processes that God created yet chose to speed up. The wedding miracle where water is turned into wine is a miracle of the God who made grapes that create wine. The pagan Bacchus is a copy of the true God who makes wine not just represents wine. The loaves are created by the God who made bread, not Ceres who honors bread. Ceres is copy of the Creator-a spin off product resembling the real thing. A fake ROLEX if you will. The Biblical flood is reflected in countless flood legends around the world because the event occurred as a central fact so the legends are reflections of the real event.The Grand Miracle is a paradox in that shameful death becomes the means to redemption...the horror that leads to the light. The new creation miracles are not short cuts but reversals of entropy. The new creation ends the dichotomy between matter and spirit to a new matter. Entropy itself means that the clock at one time was wound but by whom and who created it? What did entropy decline from? The resurrection is the remarriage of flesh with fact to fulfil myth. The purpose of testing is to see if we are responsible to have a spiritual body to be resurrected in flesh.The \\"mass produced conscripted age\\" which we belong to uses uniforitarianism from naturalism to condition us against miracles. Monism is the rule of the day with the belief that all is one is the hallmark of totalitarianism. Misery is the companion of miracles. Mystics and the oppressed witness miracles either as individuals or collectively at junctures of bad history. Miracles point to man's destiny which is to harmonize the soul with the rational element of creation-the spirit as defined by Lewis. Man is like a tower which cannot be approached from the floors from the outside but only through the top.The what specific purpose do miracles serve? Lewis leaves this out of the book and robs us of the existential purpose of miracles. The book is littered with forced facts and assumptions.Lewis tells us that the ancients were realistic about the insignificance of the earth, yet Copernicus is left out of this discussion. The supernatural is described as a window ignored as you look focused at a beautiful yard, yet the window may not in fact exist so it is therefore ignored. It is easier to see God creating than creation creating. The Hebrew creation story is unique because God preexisted before matter was created, yet what does the Koran teach? Lewis has opened a window with this book to a reality that challenges us in the form of...miracles. In an unusual section Lewis seems to uphold Calvin. Miracles occur to God as we look at a piece of paper with a line...we can see the begining and end at once and so our prayers to a given end are already computed from the begining...mind boggling thought.Miracles have met much in my own faith but I am not sure that this is good. I was driving to work shortly after being married and after a period of emotional unfaithfulness to by bride. I stopped behind a traffic jam about twenty feet behind the car in front against my own judgment. I rode the clutch in first gear against common sense yet I felt compelled to do it. I looked in the rear view mirror as an approaching car failed to stop...the driver was tuning the radio supposedly. The impact destroyed all three cars, yet all drivers emerged unhurt. While headed to the hospital I prayed for assistance- a helper. While in the hospital I found out that my wife was next door eating in a cafe. Bible word for wife is helper in a medical sense. My wife was at a luncheon seventy miles from where she lived and worked. The person I hit was my neighbor who offered me a ride back thirty five miles. The impact should have killed me according to the doctor who showed me the seat spring marks on my back. A flashlight lens detached and cut a hole in the roof of the car, missed my head by a foot and went out the front right window. A miracle with clear warning and instruction for a too confident man in a destroyed new car.When I was saved many years ago I prayed for God to reveal himself to me as I was running. I prayed out of John 1:6 under a sycamore tree and then ran the five miles I promised him for an answer. I was in a miserable time of my life. Right at the five mile mark a man came to me and handed me a small Gospel of John and told me that the Lord heard me. I stood transfixed and then looked up in the open field where I had stopped.No one was there for yards even though I had just received the book. Later that day I lost a bike so I went to a bike store to buy another to no avail. Something compelled me to go to another bike shop miles away. As I walked in my stolen bike was being sold to the owner who gave me my bike back. The thief was caught and a large gang was broken up that day. Interestingly C.S. Lewis was never said to have a Road to Damascus experience. A tract written by RBC ministries C.S.Lewis: The Story of a Converted Mind tells us of the mental process of Lewis' salvation and yet the one who wrote about miracles used his own will to find God. Must God reach us for salvation?In despair,I asked God why must men suffer? As I turned the corner,I saw written in large red letters the word JOB written on the side of a bank. Tribulations of Job?Some miracles seem to serve no higher purpose...perhaps they are demonic. A mentioned how I wanted a Felix the Cat t shirt, black with a white circle showing Felix to a fellow employee. An hour later the same t shirt came in on a customer. Jung, God or perhaps Satan mocking God?Lewis was right miracles love despair, but they are also relational to the type of despair. I have had creepy paranormal events and I wonder what they mean. My father's deathbed was not a peaceful place and yet he was not a person who died in peace...things happened. An image beckoned me to his death exactly twenty four hours before he died. Was God involved in his death or was someone waiting? If miracles are warnings do we even care? I could fill pages with my stories yet to what avail?I remember a letter George Orwell wrote when young. The letter described how Orwell saw a ghost in a churchyard. The cloaked figure walked by on a gravel path and made no noise as Orwell looked at a grave. Orwell gave chase only to find nothing outside closed gate at the end of the gravel path. Inquiry inside the church revealed that the pastor had been alone. The letter even comes with a diagram of the incident. Shortly after,Orwell went on to write the anticlerical CLERGYMAN'S DAUGHTER and wrote his last deathbed entry against Christianity. The hardcore secularist, Orwell never really considered the implications of his ghost.

Informative, insightful, and inspirational, the book offers a fascinating glimpse into the finest business minds in the region.The 32 articles in Asian Business Wisdom are organised into six parts covering Management Philosophies, Instilling Corporate Culture, The Entrepreneurial Spirit, Lessons from China, Sales and Marketing Strategies and Managing in Tough Times. Each article is accompanied by an introduction that highlights its author's life and business achievements and a list of online resources which points the reader to related articles or organisations.Sadly, except for a passing reference to Robert Kuok Hock Nien on page 169, Malaysians are conspicuous by their absence in this book. Despite this glaring omission, this is nevertheless a book from which managers worldwide will surely benefit. Economic and financial crisis notwithstanding, Asia remains in the sights of many global business leaders and decision-makers as a region of vast economic and business potential.A freelance writer and editor, Filipina Dinna Louise C.

These iconic images are often suspended in space, either appearing or disappearing through a veil or grid/cage (hidden, hiding or trapped?), which sometimes mutes their otherwise vivid colors. Slonem uses light, space and pattern masterfully to display the totemic spirituality of his subjects. And the resulting paintings celebrate that spirituality in works that are gloriously, wonderfully, joyfully beautiful.Almost all of this volume is devoted to reproductions of Slonem's work, with a few photographs of his studios (themselves works of art) mixed in. Color-reproduction is excellent and the works are beautifully displayed. The selection of paintings covers a broad period of time from the mid-1980s though 2001 and presents a representative sample of Slonem's subjects. The plates appear to be arranged thematically (with birds at both the beginning and the end), rather than chronologically. Donald Kuspit's essay is mostly helpful in putting the spiritual quality of Slonem's work into words, although he occasionally lapses into psychobabble. Minor criticisms -- a few pictures that appear to be out of focus (or enlarged beyond their capacity to render a sharp image), a table of contents that does not match up to the actual pages for the Bibliography and Collections, occasional confusion about which captions go with which pictures -- are annoying but not enough to outweigh the joys of this volume, which deserves to reach a wide public."},{"Title":"Hunt Slonem: An Art Rich and Strange","review":"For the last 20 or so years many of us have been in deep admiration for the lushly romantic paintings by the singular Hunt Slonem. Here is an artist who truly lives in his work and we are the richer for it. Slonem captures the magic in the exotic and makes even the mundane transporting. His best known paintings are of his ongoing preoccupation with birds of the tropical vein: he lives with them, nurtures them, is obcessed with their spiritual stance as a meeting point between heaven and earth. But his talents are not wholly absorbed by his aviary. Slonem paints ocelets, monkeys, tigers, saints, mythical beings and other subjects, along with his passion for portraiture of exotic people. Rudolph Valentino, go-go boys, princesses, et al find their way into elaborate baroque frames that adorn not only the artist's home, but in collections and museums throughout the world.Donald Kuspit does his usual fine writing in capturing the quintessence of Slonem's visual messages. The color reproductions are excellent and as lavish as the talent of the painter. A truly beautiful Monograph!"},{"Title":"Hunt Slonem: An Art Rich and Strange","review":"The artwork details in this book is stunning! The essence of this artist is very well depicted in this volume.

Somewhat simple and intuitive, many of these fundamental tents are discussed but not executed on a regular consistent basis. However, if these basic building blocks are followed through in actions and words on a daily basis, managers cannot help but build strong leadership abilities and strong teams around them."},{"Title":"Opportunities in Aerospace Careers","review":"The book has some general iinformation. It gives some basic insight into the aerospace industry but not the whole. It is like a fresh up or first time information for someone who does not know anything about that field. If you don't know anything, then Read! it otherwise look for something else."},{"Title":"Liquid Pleasures: A Social History of Drinks in Modern Britain","review":"This is really a fun read, covering British drinking habits, alchoholic and otherwise. It purports to cover several centuries but is really mostly about the late 18th century to the early 20th. My only major gripe is that it is based entirely on secondary sources -other people's work. So as a survey it is very useful, but really doesn't contribute anything new to the scholarship. It is also clearly written by a social scientist -lots of tables and figures, and even the text decribes trends quantitatively. For the qualitative-minded, we are rarely given more than anecdotes about why culturally shifts in national preferences occured. These tend to be obscured by heaps of evidence drawn from new laws, import duties, and marketing schemes. All in all, pleasant reading, but patience with numbers is required."},{"Title":"Shaping Web Usability: Interaction Design in Context","review":"This is a serious work on Web Usability that attempts to define in detail the user context and to construct a user-centred methodology based on that context.There are so many books on web usability these days and most of them are about web pages first and people second. Doctor Badre's approach, though, is firmly grounded on the human side of HCI and some of the material in this book is outstanding.The chapter on &quot;Older Adults&quot; is a great example. Badre is fastidious enough to consider the different cognitive needs of people in this group and to consider the implications of those needs for the designer. Elsewhere he considers personality variations, the role of affect (or emotion), and many other individual differences.In contrast, however, Badre has a strong leaning toward standards and predictability, which seems to contradict his comments elsewhere. Having identified the myriad reasons the web audience is uniquely diverse he nevertheless finds traditional HCI evaluation techniques attractive, and sometimes fails to bite the bullet.For example, Badre insists that &quot;Testing conditions ... should approximate the actual situation in which ...visitors are likely to find themselves.&quot; Yet he does not display any distrust of laboratory testing, questionnaires and all the artificialities of user testing that would suggest a more ethnographic approach.The material on the test methodology is therefore somewhat weaker, but does not detract in any way from the main part of the book, where Dr Badre's experience in Human Factors allows him to illustrate with considerable skill the way design features can be adjusted to meet the cognitive abilities of real human users. In this arena, Dr. Badre is a leading authority, and it is for this, the main body of the work, that I would strongly recommend this book to web and usability professionals alike."},{"Title":"Shaping Web Usability: Interaction Design in Context","review":"Clear and rigorous, Dr. Badre's book is an essential resource for the serious Web practitioner. Going beyond the usual lists of do's and don'ts, he gives the reader a strong grounding in the field of usability and how its principles apply to the Web. Web designers and implementors who read Shaping Web Usability will not only know what to do, but why -- so they can respond successfully to new and complex design challenges."},{"Title":"Shaping Web Usability: Interaction Design in Context","review":"This book is unlike many other web usability books. It goes well beyond the cookie-cutter guidelines for fast web usability, and gets the reader thinking deeply about contexts of web usability. It focuses on the real important issues and concepts. However, it is not an abstract or theoretical book. The author illustrates the concepts and explanations with numerous real examples from the web. This book is a must read for web designers, information architects, and web usability engineers."},{"Title":"Shaping Web Usability: Interaction Design in Context","review":"Dr. Badre has written an interesting work which thoughtfully examines two important concepts: genre and cultural context. In addition to plenty of solid HCI theory and empirical data, Dr. Badre provides clear examples of how close attention to the genre of one's site and the cultural context in which it is most likely to be viewed will provide a more useful and pleasurable experience for the user. With these simple and powerful concepts, Dr. Badre provides some excellent guidance to new and experienced website designers."},{"Title":"Shaping Web Usability: Interaction Design in Context","review":"What use is a Web site if no one uses it? Too many Web design books and development tools provide cut-and-paste solutions to design problems without providing the developer with an understanding of fundamental principles.This is where Dr. Badre's book enters the scene - in a big way. &quot;Shaping Web Usability&quot; does just what it promises, providing clear, cogent instruction in designing sites for people in all their needs and diversity. It promotes a robust methodology for Web design that can adapt to user requirements without sacrificing logic or cohesion. Badre's process also helps one communicate methodology and design issues to others. This book gave me the grounding I needed to explain to clients exactly why I had made a particular design decision and how it would benefit the site users.If you are concerned about your site being used once it is published (and who isn't?), take a look at this book. It can't make your Web site for you, but it can help you identify and satisfy an online audience better than any other book on the shelves."},{"Title":"Raffles: Further adventures of the amateur cracksman","review":"I think Raffles has a good heart, but clearly a criminal mind.

How else should it have happened that Fragrant Incense stood at the gate of the courtyard on that morning in early autumn? Or that the chair of the wealthy merchant Lo Yu-chan was carried through the street at that moment?But not the wisest man could forsee that from these two the fading strain of the great Lo clan would be renewed, later to be mingled with the wild and impetuous blood of a foreigner.So chance arranged it, and All the Tomorrows tells the story of the great events flowing from that fateful moment; the story of a modern, progressive Chinese family, swept from its mooring by a great social upheaval which has overwhelmed a nation.What a human, likable family it is! Apricot as a rebellious child cutting the painful bindings from her feet, and later flinging away the security of her home for fleeting adventure in the arms of a foreigner. Felix Lo, her headstrong illegitimate son, revolting against the ancient ways of his grandfather, embracing Western customs, and becoming a modern financier. The emotional conflict in his two daughters, Pearl and Jade, suspended between two worlds and belonging to neither until war casts them in dangerous service to their country.And behind this family and its problems the pulsing life of China itself beats like a restless sea. War lords, beggars, courtesans, merchants, coolies, foreigh devils, wise men and fools, gamblers, bandits, and patriots swarm through these turbulent pages, giving the whole a vital reality.With understanding and compassion worthy of its immense theme, All the Tomorrows evokes a great nation in its hour of destiny through these brimming lives of China's modern sons and daughters.--- from book's dustjacket"},{"Title":"The Nightmare Chronicles","review":"There's always been a special place in my heart for single-author horror collections. Perhaps this began with Stephen King's NIGHT SHIFT, one of the first books of &quot;modern&quot; horror stories I ever bought.However, the single-author horror collection is a somewhat illusive beast. Perhaps publishers are more comfortable publishing novels.That's why it's exciting when a new collection comes along. Especially one this good.It's been nearly a year since I first read this book, and still I am left with haunting images from some fo my favorite stories: Of the avenging angels from &quot;The Ripening Sweetness of Late Afternoon.&quot; Of a woman robed in wasps in &quot;The Chosen.&quot; Of the sheer depths of the jealousy of the Monkey God of &quot;White Chapel,&quot; or of horror glimpsed through the portal window of a kitchen door in &quot;Underworld.&quot;But the absolute prize of the collection is &quot;The Rendering Man,&quot; a brilliant story of one woman's awakening to the horrors both in the world around her and within herself. The final few paragraphs are as horrific and beautiful (for good terror tales are often both) as anything I can remember reading in recent horror fiction.The best single-author horror collection to come along since Thomas Ligotti's GRIMSCRIBE, this one deserves a wide readership, as do all of Clegg's works."},{"Title":"The Nightmare Chronicles","review":"C hocked full of amazingly different stories that don''t hold anything back, keeping the imagination running in overdrive, overfilling the senses, almost to the point of a nervous breakdown.R ich in atmosphere, eerie scenes, some suspenseful, dark and morbid.E asily read, written in a simple to understand style, with poetic-like prose used when it benefits.E xcellent themes and ideas, the majority of them original, many surprising.P owerful characters, most of them easily latched on to.Y ields when it needs to, speeds up when its better for the stories. Pace is tight and used for the maximum impact."},{"Title":"The Nightmare Chronicles","review":"This volume collects thirteen tales of horror from one of the modern masters. This is on of the better horror collections I have read in some time with most of the stories being strong.The stories run across a broad spectrum of topics from characters who lovingly kill their loved ones to hauntings to bizarre monsters that just might fit legends better than we would like. A fourteenth story is included as a tie to help blend the collection together.This is horror intended for adults and while not actually being erotic horror, Clegg does not hold back on the language or sex if it helps the story. If you have enjoyed Clegg's novels, you will not be disappointed by these tales."},{"Title":"The Nightmare Chronicles","review":"I am extremely impressed. Douglas Clegg begins his first short story collection with a clever idea and it just keeps getting better from there on. The Nightmare Chronicles is one of the most accomplished collections I've read in years. As a practitioner of psychological horror firmly rooted in a remarkable sense of place, he has no peer.I was instantly swept away by the wraparound story of a kidnapped child who inflicts nightmares on his captors (that they have no idea what they've gotten themselves into is made painfully clear), and it segues smoothly into the inaugural tale (or \\"nightmare\\"), \\"Underworld.\\" Not only is it a horrific tale of love lost, but Clegg's portrayal of conflicting emotions in his protagonist is also an extra layer that taps into the potential reality of the situation -- you know, what gets the reader personally involved in the story.Short stories don't always give me what I want out of an author, but they are an excellent way to experiment. Usually I just skip around, reading at random -- and sometimes I don't even finish the book -- but The Nightmare Chronicles is simply amazing. Episodic in its structure, each story, at first, leads into the wraparound, pulling the reader gently into the next. It really is a bit like a rollercoaster: the first few stories need the wraparound for connective tissue, but once the first peak is reached, each story just comes at you faster and faster until, before you know it, you've reached the suitably twisted ending and the only thing you want to do is get right back in line for another round.Clegg probes the horrors of everyday life: love, growth, death, sex, family, freedom, religion, obsession, obligation, the unfamiliar, and the inevitable all get the going-over in The Nightmare Chronicles, sometimes in the same story. And even though horror often requires a suspension of disbelief just to get past the first page, you'll find none of the usually preposterous situations that often occur in other authors' works (like Dean Koontz's, who submits a cover blurb that is as overwrought as his own novels). In short, there is none of the usual stupidity that we all hate at all in here. In fact, Clegg comes across as someone who is particularly intelligent and expects nothing less from his readers. I haven't read a short story collection that got me so excited about a new (to me) author since F. Paul Wilson's Soft and Others and I'm nothing but excited about the prospect of reading Clegg's novels."},{"Title":"The Nightmare Chronicles","review":"Clegg is a rarity; a master at the short story and the novel. That is very unusual. A writer is usually better at one or the other, but Clegg knows how to scare in either form.The collection are nightmares by a boy who has been kidnapped by some truly unsavory characters. The first is &quot;Underworld&quot; and starts off with a bang. This is one creepy and scary story; take my word for it. You will break out in goosebumps.Other stories of note: &quot;The Rendering Man&quot; and possibly the best stolry of the bunch, &quot;I am infinite:I contain multitudes.&quot; The third story will surprise and shock you.Quite simply, &quot;Clegg is a weaver of nightmares,&quot; as one reviewer said of him years ago about his debut, Goat Dance."},{"Title":"The Nightmare Chronicles","review":"Nightmare Chronicles by Douglas Clegg is one of the most page turning collections of stories I've read in many years. Some of the stories are quiet subtle horror tales, and others, like White Chapel, I Am Infinite I Contain Multitudes, and Underworld are big stories of love lost and terror found.These are some of the most original tales of horror I've read, and are right up there with Straub's (Magic Terror) and even some of Joyce Carol Oates. If you're looking for blood'n'guts, you'll find a couple of extremely brutal stories here, but in general, the stories have a brief shock illuminated by a psychological insight into a character's existence.The faint-hearted should be warned off the two best stories: White Chapel and I Am Infinite I Contain Multitudes. Clearly these are amazing tales, but also they are as brutal as can possibly be imagined. The stories that were funny to some extent include The Night Alec Got Married, which begins as a bachelor party and turns into a reason to avoid intimacy, also, the story called Only Connect was odd and funny in a way because of the secrets within secrets and the paranoid sense of life Clegg manages to create in it.Another favorite is Fruit of Her Womb, about an aging couple who discover that a mythos-tragedy has happened in the house they've bought. The husband in discovering an old murder mystery, finds some transcendant horror in it.Some of the stories seem sketchy but interesting, like The Little Mermaid and The Rendering Man. Both are about transformations of sorts.All in all, this is a satisfying grouping of stories, and leaves me hungry to try out one of two of Clegg's other books."},{"Title":"The Nightmare Chronicles","review":"THE NIGHTMARE CHRONICLES is a collection of thirteen tales told within the framework of a story of a botched kidnapping. A mother and her two sons have abducted a small boy for ransom, but what they actually got was something far worse.

I didn't think the framing story was necessary; it has no bearing on the individual stories and drops out of sight till the end after the first few anyway. I'm not sure why the author chose to use this particular device at all. In any case, this is an anthology worth picking up. There are several gems."},{"Title":"The Nightmare Chronicles","review":"Thirteen nightmares unfold after the kidnapping of a child that is later bound and kept in the basement of a large building. Everything appears to go smoothly till no one reports him missing, no one responds to the ransom demands. Later the \`nappers find that parents had been slain in their residence. Now what to do with the child?Alice, the mastermind of the kidnapping, is approached by her son stating that the child is crazy. Spooky things go on in the basement. He talks even though duct tape is placed over his mouth. Disbelieving, Alice, a much braver woman than I, goes down to the basement to see for herself.When down there nothing seems out of sorts. There is a horrible stench from the corner that is used as the bathroom, flies buzz around. The lights flicker a bit and then \`it' starts. Story telling in the dark. Something grabs Alice and throws her out of her wheel chair and she is forced to listen to nightmares told by the bound child.Every story is perfectly different and definitely unlike any other horror novel/film I've read or watched. Clegg's use of imagery works really well in this novel, and there are some nearly unforgettable images. Though I cannot say that these were the most scary stories I have ever heard, they are unique and if the world ever became one of these stories then I could say that it was truly a nightmare.Of the tales, the best are \\"White Chapel,\\" \\"I Am Infinite; I Contain Multitudes,\\" \\"Underworld,\\" and one of the most interesting short horror stories I've ever read, \\"The Rendering Man.\\" But don't just read those, all of them have their images that could come back to you in your dreams.The Nightmare Chronicles, is not one of my favorite novels by Douglas Clegg, but there were some very gripping parts that kept me moving through.If you have a lower tolerance for scary stories then this could be a book for you. I think I could call the book more disturbing than scary, and I think I may have referred to at least one of his other books in the same way. Disturbing is what Clegg is good at."},{"Title":"The Nightmare Chronicles","review":"Douglas Clegg is a leader in the post King/Koontz/Saul generation of horror authors, along with being one of the most prolific. In &quot;The Nightmare Chronicles&quot; he brings thirteen short stories to life in one of the most clever ways I've ever seen. The book begins with what you think is the first story, but it's actually a framework story that continues around each of the mini-thrillers contained here. It's a good story by itself and you find yourself waiting to see what happens next in the &quot;frame&quot; story as well. This is probably one of the best collections I've read in a long time. There's a lot of variety in style, setting, time periods, subjects and, of course, horror factor. The stories are graphic in ways you don't expect, which takes them out of the &quot;wallow in blood and guts&quot; type of horror, but the shock value is WAY up there.

Clegg is an original writer with a unique voice."},{"Title":"The Nightmare Chronicles","review":"Don't let the title of this review frighten you off. This collection of stories, strung together in a beautifully sickening manner by Clegg seems both a tribute AND a modern take on the tales of the Bradbury masterpiece. The handful of stories, which includes his well known &quot;I Am Infinite: I Contain Multitudes&quot;, as well as the amazing &quot;Rendering Man&quot; and &quot;White Chapel&quot; are wrapped within the tale of a strange boy who is kidnapped by a mother and her two sons. Of course, this boy is much more than he seems. Much more terrifying and nowhere near as meek and innocent as initially believed. With each vignette and subsequent tale, one descends deeper into Clegg's world - not a pleasant thought for those who wish to retain a cheery outlook on society. His writing is surprisingly vivid and literate for the genre (a talent not seen too much in the &quot;Bestsellers&quot; list these days other than for the big names). The visions he molds in the reader's helpless minds helps to firmly embroil each tale while not allowing the connection vehicle (the boy &amp; his kidnappers) to wallow as simply tasteless filler. If you enjoy this, please take the time to peruse Clegg's other works. With each effort, the man displays more talent, and a greater grasp of what horrifies the everyday person."},{"Title":"The Nightmare Chronicles","review":"The thing that makes this such great horror is the people are so real!

Mr. Clegg, I am a devoted fan now!"},{"Title":"The Nightmare Chronicles","review":"This is one of my favorite collections EVER, and it was my introduction to the work of Douglas Clegg. Nothing else has ever quite topped it for me. Really chilling and disturbing stuff."},{"Title":"The Nightmare Chronicles","review":"No wonder this book won both the International Horror Guild Award and the Bram Stoker Award. Clegg is one of those writers whose artistry is only matched by his sense of story. He builds mythologies within the smallest of stories, and deconstructs the essence of the horror tale (with echoes of Hawthorne and Machen and even Shirley Jackson and Joseph Conrad) in some of his longer tales.I never come at books as mere entertainment, although even the most literary novel had better involve me. Clegg, with The Nightmare Chronicles, has managed to create a body of entertaining fiction as well as some serious notions about horror and love, all exploding within these pages. Clegg doesn't shy from ambiguity either.In his first story here, &quot;Underworld,&quot; a man has recently lost his pregnant wife. She was murdered violently. When he goes to a small restaurant in an old alley in the city, he thinks he sees her through the portal window of the kitchen. When he eventually pursues this further, the story takes a twist into what feels inevitable but unexpected. The ending (don't worry I won't reveal it) is both emotionally moving and a stunningly quiet and perfect climax to the events leading up to it. In some ways, it's an illuminating thought about what it means to go through the human nightmare.The stunner of the collection, &quot;White Chapel,&quot; comes next. In &quot;White Chapel,&quot; nearly a novella within the collection, a journalist gets the scent of a fascinating but psychotic mystery: a man who has become a legendary torturer and killer, who lives now in the jungles of some Asian/Indian outpost. This is where the Joseph Conrad echo comes in. &quot;White Chapel&quot; is a distant cousin of _Heart of Darkness_. When Jane Boone and her photographer assistant take a boat down a &quot;brown river in intolerable heat,&quot; they are entering the outer reaches of human consciousness. Arriving in White Chapel, named, of course, by former British colonials, another reflection is thrown to us: Jack the Ripper and his murders in Whitechapel. But as Jane gets lured to the temple of the Monkey Goddess, the terror and wonder build.&quot;White Chapel&quot; is a masterwork, and Clegg has managed to intrigue and terrify without venturing too far into the realm of nastiness.Probably the gem of the collection is a little story called &quot;The Little Mermaid,&quot; which has very little to do with the Hans Christian Anderson tale. In this one, a middle-aged woman is at her beach house avoiding the life she has amassed, and finds a potential new love in an elderly man, a doctor, who she meets on the shore. He has a sparkle and passion, and his love literally transforms her with terror. A very short story that's over too soon (tantalizingly so), &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; is a brief shock of icy water.Other stories stand out as well, and the worst thing I can say about this collection is that the frame story around the collection could have been either eliminated or amplified. It's a metaphor for the storytelling process, a tale of turned tables, but is unnecessary given the strength of these remarkable tales.I would classify Clegg up there with the early stories of Clive Barker and a few Stephen King stand-outs. If you're a fan of short horror fiction, _The Nightmare Chronicles_ should not be missed."},{"Title":"The Nightmare Chronicles","review":"Another leader in the new generation of horror authors is Douglas Clegg, along with being one of the most prolific. In \\"The Nightmare Chronicles\\" he brings thirteen short stories to life in one of the most clever ways I've ever seen. The book begins with what you think is the first story, but it's actually a framework story that continues around each of the mini-thrillers contained here and brings the book to a close. It's a good story by itself and you find yourself waiting to see what happens next in the \\"frame\\" story. This is probably one of the best collections I've read in a long time. There's a lot of variety in style, setting, time periods, subjects and, of course, horror factor. The stories are graphic in ways you don't expect, which raises them above the blood and guts type of horror, but the shock value is WAY up there. A great way to get a fast introduction to an exciting new horror author."},{"Title":"The Nightmare Chronicles","review":"I just stumbled over the book at the store a WHILE ago and never got a chance to read it, now I can't put it down, every free minute I get (which isn't much) I have to read at least one story. I am really enjoying the book so far and hope that the rest of the stries are as good as the ones I've done, so far my favorite is White Chapel, it painted a very vivid picture in my mind of exactly what White Chapel was like. This book so far is great!"},{"Title":"The Nightmare Chronicles","review":"This is the first Clegg I've read. I'm a big fan of Stephen King's; he scares the bejeezus out of me, but rarely does he really &quot;gross me out.&quot; &quot;Nightmare&quot; definitely did the job. There are quite a few concepts new to me in (at least my personal experience reading) horror (The Ripening Sweetness of Late Afternoon and I am Infinite... for example). I can't wait to see what he can do with a full length novel."},{"Title":"The Nightmare Chronicles","review":"I am not sure whether Clegg is trying to be a horror writer or some sort of poet. Some of the short stories in his book can be considered &quot;in your face horror&quot;-&quot;Night before Alec got Married&quot; in which the horror is straight at you and you get a tingle down your backbone after having read it, while others are confusing, unexciting and do not have much to do with the element of horror such as &quot;O, rare and most exquisite&quot;. Clegg can write passages which will make you consider leaving a light on at night and then turn around and write something which would probably be more appropriate in an Oprah Book of the Month selection. As it is, the best that can be said is hit and miss."},{"Title":"The Nightmare Chronicles","review":"The Nightmare Chronicles by Douglas Clegg is the peak literary achievement of a novelist and short story writer who has truly developed his talent, disregarding the standard formulae of either paint-by-numbers fiction-writing or gross-out extremist writers. This collection is the point in which pulp meets literature head-on.In this collection of short fiction, Clegg has managed to conjure up some of the most disturbing tales in which the supernatural touches everyday life, where paranoia meets truth, and where dreams and nightmares cross over into day-light.For anyone looking for standard fare, The Nightmare Chronicles is not the book. If you want something scary that appeals to light and mindless reading, try Goosebumps or a Young Adult book, find an Anne Rice vampire novel or pick up the latest commercial mishmash. This is not a book for horror lovers alone, but for readers who really enjoy a superb experience with fiction.But, if you are a serious reader of the best that genre fiction has to offer, try this collection of short stories. Someone here mentioned this has no plot. Well, of course it does not have a plot; it's a collection of short fiction. This should be obvious to anyone who has actually gotten beyond the first page of this book. The characters are ordinary but thrust into the mouth of terror, disturbance, and shadow. The imagery within these tales is startling.Of the tales, the best are &quot;White Chapel,&quot; &quot;I Am Infinite; I Contain Multitudes,&quot; &quot;Underworld,&quot; and one of the most interesting short horror stories I've ever read, &quot;The Rendering Man.&quot;I have read two of Clegg's novels, both of which were good, but I have no doubt that it is in the short story, as exemplified in The Nightmare Chronicles, that he excels."},{"Title":"The Nightmare Chronicles","review":"I am new to Douglas Clegg's fiction, but I can guarantee that The Nightmare Chronicles will be just the first in a long line of books I'll read by this guy.What struck me about this collection of short stories was that it is like entering a room with someone who is going to tell you stories in the dark. The set up of the kidnapping story that wraps around the dozen or so short stories in this book is intriguing but doesn't overpower the main event.The main event are some of the most delicious short stories of terror I've read since I read early Stephen King, Robert Bloch, or Richard Matheson. Clegg is not as much of a structuralist as those other writers. One can almost feel him going with the imagery in some cases over the plot. I would go so far as to suggest that what this writer finds in the horror of his fiction is beauty and some kind of kinship.&quot;White Chapel&quot; is a standout, as is &quot;I Am Infinite; I Contain Multitudes.&quot; They're like bookends to the other stories, some brief &quot;The Little Mermaid,&quot; some a bit overly complicated like &quot;Chosen.&quot;One or two of the stories seemed ragged to me, but still inspired.The reason I'm writing this review is because I bought the book here and something in it definitely spoke to me. There is something very personal in this collection.I recommend it to readers who want horror fiction that goes beyond the page."},{"Title":"The Nightmare Chronicles","review":"I found out about Douglas Clegg from Amazon.com's &quot;customers who bought books by Peter Straub also bought books from the following authors&quot; list. Straub's Ghost Story is to this day one of my all time favorite books. Another one of my favorites is Boy's Life by Robert McCammon (I sure hope he reconsiders retirement). When I started to read some reviews of Clegg's works and saw that they were drawing comparison to McCammon as well as Straub, along with Dan Simmons and Stephen King (two of my other perennial favorites), I knew it was time to check this guy out. So I immediately placed an order for his new novel You Come When I Call You. But my anticipation got to me. Imagining how great it would be to be reading a new author on the par with these other greats, I decided I couldn't wait the three or four days for the book to arrive by UPS. So I went downtown to my local used bookstore and bought a copy of The Nightmare Chronicles.Right off the bat, the cover made me feel I was in McCammon country. A paperback original short story collection with a darkish blue graveyard in the foreground and a huge moon looming in the background. Just like McCammon's Blue World. Since that was the first book I read by McCammon, I thought this was probably a good place to start with Clegg.The first story, &quot;Underworld,&quot; did remind me of McCammon. The next one, &quot;White Chapel,&quot; was very Dan Simmons-esque. It takes place in India and features a woman reporter trying to track down a psychopath who has been transformed into a kind of cult religious figure. Very Jospeh Condrad, for that matter. By the time I was on page thirty or forty, I was already very impressed with Clegg's writing style. It's similar in ways to McCammon, but tends to have the more visceral bite of Clive Barker or Joe R. Lansdale's edgier stuff. Although his style is similar to these other authors, it is also very much his own. What I liked right away was the amount of small, perceptive, telling detail with which Clegg imbues his writing. Reading Clegg, you very quickly get the reassuring feeling that you're in the hands of someone who knows what he's doing.Clegg is great at pulling you into his stories by setting up a bizarre premise which leaves you hungering to find out exactly what is going on. More often than not, he never tells you exactly what's going on, but only nudges you in the general direction. The stories slowly get stranger and stranger as you make your way through this well-written book. A couple big themes soon emerge which tie the stories together rather impressively. First off, Clegg seems to be fascinated with the idea of religion and penance. Characters are often trying to atone for things they have done. The concept of brutality as an act of love is also present in several of the stories (as in &quot;Of Mice and Men,&quot; where George kills Lenny out of his love for him). Flowers, vaginas and various types of openings are a symbol which shows up repeatedly. Clegg's stories often deal with the origins and endings of things, with the physicality of life and death and the doorways that communicate between the two worlds.I thought The Nightmare Chronicles was a very well-written, truly scary collection of stories, and I would easily give it five stars for the writing alone. However, I felt the stories tended heavily toward the darker side of the spectrum. So if you're not into delving the pyschology of the insane and the ruthless, as I tend not to be, these stories may not be your exact cup of tea. But no matter what, you're bound to appreciate Clegg's well-honed story-telling skills. That's what got me in the end.Also worth noting, this book just recently won the Bram Stoker Award for best horror collection."},{"Title":"The Nightmare Chronicles","review":"I ran across Doug Clegg's novel haphazardly on the internet and decided to check it out.Not being one to normally go for &quot;Horror&quot; novels, I was surprised to find that The Nightmare Chronicles was a unique and well crafted book of short stories. Not so much what I would consider &quot;horror&quot;, but more Mystery, more Thiller, and more Fantasy than your usual fare.Each story reflected its own distinct flavour of &quot;hell&quot;. The characters are predominantly a cross section of humanity (and thats not to say they're all June and Ward Cleaver wannabe's, some of them are unnervingly evil). Each is then thrust into circumstances that are unsettling and disturbing.It took me awhile to figure out that Clegg's style isnt the normal Pop-horror schtick that you find with mainstreams novelists. His style is to take something normal and begin to skew and twist it until you find yourself wondering if you will ever look at that particular thing the same way again. A rose is definitely not a rose with Clegg.Take the time to settle down and read this Book!The only down side to any of this is that now that I have such high expectations of clegg, I don't want to be dissapointed by the next book of his that I read!"},{"Title":"The Nightmare Chronicles","review":"These 13 stories will make you retch, make you laugh, and make you cringe all within a few pages of each reaction. Mr. Clegg doesn't hold back on the violence or the disturbing image which makes for great Horror fare. Tied together through the dreams of a captive young boy who is more than he seems the stories vary in content from backwoods horror (The Rendering Man) to a bachelor party gone terribly wrong (The Night Before Alec Got Married) to a dark sense of obligation (Damned If You Do) to just plain weird (I Am Infinite; I Contain Multitudes). Bottom line: this collection is better read, any attempt at explanation would misconstrue the stories. So pick this book up and let Mr. Clegg take you into his strange little world. Winner of the Bram Stoker Award."},{"Title":"The Nightmare Chronicles","review":"I've seen this book of short stories compared to a Pandora's Box. Yes, it's that but it's also like that little chinese puzzle box in the Hellraiser movies by Clive Barker.Clegg, who has numerous novels, (Goat Dance, Children's Hour, Halloween Dance etc), under his literary belt, has crafted some superb short stories, thematically joined at the hip as it were, by the underlying story of a mysterious young &quot;boy&quot; kidnapped and held for ransom in the bowels of a New York tenament.He turns the tables on his captures, a homocidal mama and her two sons, and they soon become his victims. Not for the squeamish, these 13 stories are well above the usual horror and fantasy and will remain to haunt you, a long, long time!"},{"Title":"The Nightmare Chronicles","review":"A book for lovers of stories long or short. A book that is as unorthodox structurally as the plots of these stories. There are no boundaries to Douglas Clegg's horrific imagination, and as far as authors writing books that actually scare, Douglas Clegg is primo. Just wonderful. Buy it!"},{"Title":"The Nightmare Chronicles","review":"Nightmare Chronicles caught my eye because of the cover. Its a dark cemetery filled with gravestones, against a spooky moon with wild trees in front of it. Nightmare Chronicles was like discovering a whole new territory of horror. It reminded me of picking up the first Books of Blood by Barker or the stuff by younger Ray Bradbury. This is one hell of a ride through stories and terror. There's a boy in a cellar who gives these nightmareish visions to this older woman. What she sees are the dozen orso stories in Nightmare Chronicles. The best one was called Fruits of Her Womb, about a mystery cult in a very ordinary small town. Another good one is called White Chapel about a woman who goes looking for a demonic killer and a goddess in India.If you are a fan of the best that exists in horror fiction, you might try Nightmare Chronicles."},{"Title":"The Nightmare Chronicles","review":"If you've never tried horror short stories, THE NIGHTMARE CHRONICLES is the place to start. Clegg definitely made HALLOWEEN MAN scary as hell, but with NIGHTMARE CHRONICLES you get a different fright with every story -- and each and every one here packs a huge punch. The only way you could go wrong with Clegg would be to not read him at all."},{"Title":"The Nightmare Chronicles","review":"I loved Nightmare Chronicles! I grabbed this book as soon as I saw it and devoured all 13 stories in one sitting. This is the best horror collection I have read since King's Night Shift. Clegg is now my favorite horror novelist.If you like King and Koontz and Simmons and McCammon and Barker, you will love Douglas Clegg."},{"Title":"The Nightmare Chronicles","review":"The first thing to note is that whoever wrote the jacket copy obviously DID NOT read the book, so right off the back the reader is mislead. The stories stand alone, and the tie-in to the kidnapped child only serves to disappoint the reader because it is only used as a framework for the stories and is not a crucial plot device, as is hinted at on the back cover. The stories themselves are hit-or-miss, either capturing the reader and keeping them on the edge of their seats, or boring them to tears.Having read THE HALLOWEEN MAN, which I thouroughly enjoyed, I was disappointed with this work by Clegg, and I would not recommend this collection of stories if you are reading Clegg for the first time."},{"Title":"The Nightmare Chronicles","review":"I chose to read this book for a project in one of my classes. I normally like weird, bizarre books with unexpected things happening, but this one was horrible. My professor read parts of it and told me I did not have to finish the book or do a major presentation like everyone else was expected to do. I guess I am glad I chose it due to the fact I was exempt from the project. I admit, it had me wondering what was going to happen, but it was a sick, sick novel. I'll stick to Stephen King-type horror in the future."},{"Title":"The Nightmare Chronicles","review":"A series of short stories linked by over-story. Disappointing overall; this guy wants the depth of Clive Barker with the pop appeal of Koontz. However, it leaves the reader unstated. With a nod to the theories espoused by S King in Danse Macabre, Clegg attempts to build stories with sparse, slightly ambiguous climaxes that leave the reader's imagination to 'fill in the blanks.' In this collection, itdoesn't work. Some of Clegg's vignettes could end with the phrase &quot;...But it wasn't.&quot; From the first vignette, &quot;Underworld,&quot; with an ending that doesn't leave the reader in any personal certainty of what occurred, I found myself saying, &quot;that wasn't completely filled in, I hope they aren't all like that.&quot; In nearly every tale, this is a large ambiguity that should be better developed. The point of leaving such a skeletal phrase is that the story has caught up the reader in a fever of imagination such that the emptiness is filled without hesitation by the reader's worst fears. There's not enough substance to these tales to allow even the interested reader to fill in those blanks. I was left saying, &quot;Now what?&quot; I found myself re-reading for hints at what may have been an ultimate solution, and figuring this guy wanted to leave it up to me, but he just didn't give me enough to go on. The organization of the piece, consisting of an over- plot in which tales of horror are forcibly related to the characters, is an interesting concept, sort of a pop horror Arabian Nights. Unfortunately, it feels forced. The characters, in both the over-story and the anthology stories are unlikable. It's hard to sell readers on characters you don't care about. It's interesting to tear the reader between a morally repulsive but likeable character. Clegg doesn't achieve this; in a few stories, he tries to convince the reader to bond with a central character, but his own tone of dislike gives these trojan horses away, and the reader just won't buy into the forced and unseeming charisma of the attempted protagonists. Because there is such a thick underlying and repetitive theme of showhorse repulsion and gore, the reader will not trust the mysterious characters introduced, in &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; and &quot;the Chosen.&quot; After a couple stories, the ironies and twist endings are no surprise, if indeed, they were at any point. You expect the worst and will get it. Clive Barker is an excellent writer because the reader has a sense of mythology and development underlying his stories. Even if it's bull, the reader feels the underlying world, even if the storyteller chooses not to describe it in vivid detail. Barker describes his characters and scenes with such vivid familiarity that one feels the author's comfort with his subject matter, and trusts him on the journey. Clegg's worlds and scenes feel like a 'cheat' of that. It's like he's trying to convince you such a bond between author and story exists, but it's just not there. In a strong resemblance to Barker's Hellraiser concept, Clegg's &quot;White Chapel&quot; attempts to evolve a secret mythology of perversion, pleasure and pain, but again, the story just isn't 'fleshed out,' and believable to the degree that Barker's is. There is a lack of flavor, spice, that leaves the reader saying &quot;that could have been better, I'm just not sure how.&quot; There's just not enough development underlying the stories to give it that full richness of a well-told and remembered tale. Clegg comes up with some interesting concepts, can write complete sentences and occasionally drops a good metaphor. However, the meal overall lacks spice and substance, and it all pretty much tastes the same. Might be a good book to pick up from the library for a beach trip or an airplane ride, but don't pay full price for it."},{"Title":"The Nightmare Chronicles","review":"I purchased Nightmare Chronicles based on recommendations in Amazon. After reading all the positive responses, I expected so much more and this book did not deliver. I give Mr. Clegg two stars because of his writing style. Every story has a nice build-up, only to be ruined by confusing and poor conclusions. It's ironic because Mr. Clegg demonstrates a vivid writing style and many of his characters are very interesting. Because of his descriptive ability, I'm willing to give Douglas Clegg a second chance with Halloween Man. Let's hope this writer is better with a full-length novel."},{"Title":"The Nightmare Chronicles","review":"I read quite a number of reviews about this book before I bought it and I thought I was in for a good read but I have to say that this is one of the worst book I've ever read.I've read some pretty graphic stuff in my day but nothing of this calibur. While the writing style is not bad and I do think that the writer has talent the content of this book was just too gross, too bizarre and just plain too weird to be believed. Some of the scenes described in the book were so naseautingly graphic that I just could not continue.Not all of the stories within the story are sickening, a few of them were profound in a macabre sort of way and makes you think but I just think Douglas Clegg went overboard.Think-the feverish, shifting kaledeiscope of your most bizarre dreams. Do they ever make any sense?"},{"Title":"The Nightmare Chronicles","review":"Like others I bought this book based on the reviews and by the fact that it has won an award. So okay give it a try. Man was I ever dissappointed, I don't believe I have ever read such a boring book! I found the characters to be paper thin like the pages they were printed on. And the stories themselves never made much sense at all, what a total waste of time."},{"Title":"The Nightmare Chronicles","review":"Like others I bought this book based on the reviews and by the fact that it has won an award.

It's been said that Clegg is better then Stephen King...yeah? I also know of people who see Elvis. This book was vioent, but violent without a point. I found myself skimming the last few stories. One or two stories were okay, but over all I wasn't impressed with the book. I may get one of Clegg's novels to see if I like it. If you must read this book, go to the library and get it for free. Then again, this is just my opinion. IF you want to read a good horror book, may I suggest one? It's called &quot;It&quot; by Stephen King. King is still the modern master of horror."},{"Title":"The Nightmare Chronicles","review":"This is my first Douglas Clegg book and my last! I read a horror book to be scared and this book was not the least bit scary. I started it, read the first 50 pages and put it down. Two weeks later I picked it up and finished it but should have left it. No characters were worth worrying about and the plot was absent. Sorry, but this is a stinker in my eyes."},{"Title":"The Nightmare Chronicles","review":"For those that think depth is a heroin-filled needle hanging from your arm in some condemned, rat-infested apartment, you'll love Douglas Clegg.The characters are rarely multi-faceted and layered. The plots are mediocre, standard stuff, bordering on uncompelling. The tone is always hopeless. And the language is pseudo-literate that gets in the way of the story telling.There is a reason why he's written so many books and hasn't become popular. Read this book and you'll discover why."},{"Title":"The Nightmare Chronicles","review":"Clegg's THE NIGHTMARE CHRONICLES hits on so many different levels and styles but sacrifices none of the sheer effectiveness of delivering top flight chills! Clegg's short stories are realistic and moving. Some are a more quiet type of horror, while others hit you in the face. A very compelling collection!"},{"Title":"The Nightmare Chronicles","review":"I read this book based on some of the reviews posted here. What were these people thinking? I love nothing more than a book of horror filled short stories. I've read Clive Barker's &quot;Books of Blood&quot; at least three times each. I held out hope that I would enjoy this book as much as those - wrong! While there were a couple of good stories (my favorite was &quot;I Am Infinite; I Contain Multitudes&quot;) most of them left me shaking my head. The stories seemed incomplete. Little was explained and I had no idea what was going on. It infuriated me and made the usual joy of reading an absolute chore! Thanks for nothing Mr. Clegg!"},{"Title":"The Nightmare Chronicles","review":"This is the first Douglas Clegg novel I've picked up and, I have to say, after hearing so many wonderful things about him, I was disappointed.This book is poorly crafted at best. It is severely lacking in narrative structure, even within the individual stories, and the half-hearted attempt to tie them all together detracted more than it added. I found myself continuing to read mostly just for the sake of finishing the book, rather than because of any particular feeling for the characters, or even a desire to know how it ended.Clegg skirts around points that would seem to be essential to understanding the story, leaving the reader feeling, not pleasantly confused and hungry for more as I'm sure was his goal, but rather cheated, as if one had been listening to a long joke that at the last minute failed to deliver a punchline. At the same time, Clegg browbeats the reader with thinly veiled religious symbolism, and characters who experience moments of enlightenment, to which the only proper response can be a groan.If you're looking for the bizarre, something to keep you glued to your seat, I reccommend P.D. Cacek, Dean Koontz, or John Steakley, to name a few. I doubt I'll be checking out any more of Clegg's work."},{"Title":"The Nightmare Chronicles","review":"First book I have read by Douglas Clegg. After reading many good reviews, I was very disappointed. Only read 2 stories and could not force myself to continue. The stories were boring and confusing, with conclusions that left me scratching my head. If this is any indication of the content of his novels, I have no intention of wasting my time or money."},{"Title":"The Nightmare Chronicles","review":"I could not even finish this book. I felt like it was all over the place. I was confused with most of the charactors. It was to much stop and go. It felt like this:The cat jumped over the moon so I went into the house to take a nap. Yesterday a friend came over. But what did she say?So did you get anything out of that. Exactly: all over the place!"},{"Title":"The Nightmare Chronicles","review":"Clegg cuts to the chase. This collection of short stories is an emotional roller coaster which actually managed to frighten this long-time horror addict.From the very beginning Clegg introduces so many twists and eerie images that it is impossible to put the book down. Clegg introduces us to a kidnapped boy who turns out to be anything but as he shares his vision stories with his abductors. Each story weaves an incredible picture of disturbing images of human behavior (er..mostly human).If you read any horror anthologies, you've likely run across Clegg before, especially the story White Chapel. This collection then is sure to make you a fan."},{"Title":"The Nightmare Chronicles","review":"Douglas Clegg's collection of short stories rivals anything that Barker, King, or Koontz have put out. Most stories draw you in so deeply you can't put the book down until you finish them. There really isn't a clunker in the bunch.I roll my eyes when someone writes &quot;creepy&quot; and &quot;will give you chills&quot; in their reviews but some of the stories included here are quite scary, and you will feel the creeps and chills...which is why you buy a book like this anyway."},{"Title":"The Nightmare Chronicles","review":"I am so sorry that I wasted money on this book. I love Dean Koontz, Chandler McGrew, the earlier stories of Bentley Little, Steven King so when I heard Douglas Clegg was as great as them, I thought great a whole new author of books to enjoy. If the rest of his are like this one, I would never read another of his books. They aren't scary, they are nasty. I will not finish this book. I skipped the one about child molester when I found that out and thought I would give him another chance. Then you read about the \\"flower\\". This one is going in the trash. I am not a prude by any means. I loved Desperation by Steven King and that had sexual content but this one is gross. Unless that doesn't bother you, save your money."},{"Title":"The Nightmare Chronicles","review":"Clegg's short stories are a cut above (sorry) most because they rely on atmosphere and twisted psychology rather than blood and gore (though there is a fair share of that here). Having said that, there are a few here that still come off as a bit routine, and only a few are truly memorable. High marks, nevertheless, by someone who sees most modern horror fiction as future landfill."},{"Title":"The Nightmare Chronicles","review":"This is a loosely connected collection of short stories. It has a few gems in it; but it doesn't have much of a climactic ending to the overall story. Ignoring that, I was delighted by the surprising graphic detail. (This was my first Clegg book.) It's just that the surprises kinda worn off after the first 6 or 7 stories (most of my favorites are here). I would have given this book 4 stars if Clegg had not tried to tie the stories together and deleted some of the deadwood."},{"Title":"Origins: A Skeptic's Guide to the Creation of Life on Earth","review":"In the Origin of Life debates, most books take one side or the other and argue that point. eg, Behe says God did it. Dawkins says evolution did it. Shapiro doesn't really present a point of view as to &quot;This must be the way it started&quot;. Rather, he goes through all the evidence in a witty yet lucid style, and really gives you an appreciation of how complex life is. By the time you've finished reading this, you won't know how life started, but you'll want to read any book you can find and examine all the theories. At least I did. It's a shame this book is out of print, as its without doubt the best introduction to the subject around, even 15 years after it was written."},{"Title":"Origins: A Skeptic's Guide to the Creation of Life on Earth","review":"This is a well written introduction to the question of how to approch the issue of life's origination on Earth.Shapiro starts with some comments about the nature of science and of life. Next is a discussion of the age of the Earth. Yes, it is a \\"little indelicate\\" to ask the Earth for her age, but we do that anyway.After that, we get into some early speculations about the origin of life, including the Oparin-Haldane hypothesis. This involved a reducing atmosphere and a prebiotic \\"soup.\\" Some of its assumptions now appear invalid. Shapiro also attacks the fact that the step from abiotic to biotic forms is too quick, requiring a stroke of luck which is far more than astronomical, even worse than the numbers Hoyle and Wickramasinghe came up with. We can get better numbers just by producing a random replicator rather than an enitre organism, but that still can't be done spontaneously. Theories that simply produce nucleic acids by chance don't make sense. We need to find something that gets us there another way, with more plausible steps. Perhaps there is a substrate that can lock the ingredients in place, where they can evolve chemically. And the author mentions some ideas here. I think the most important point should be that it is always dangerous to say that a process can't happen because you haven't thought of a mechanism for it yet! A mechanism may well exist. You or someone else may think of such a mechanism in the future.Shapiro then gets to Hoyle and Wickramasinghe's ideas about life reaching Earth from outer space. And maybe the best part of the book is the way he shoots down some of their specific ideas and claims on the subject. This, of course, does not disprove the idea that life on Earth came from outer space (although at even odds, I'd bet against it). It just means that Hoyle went badly astray here.After that is a discussion of creationism, where the author points out that creationists are \\"not so much interested in advocating the practice of religion, which they can do in many other, less controversial ways, but rather are trying to subvert the practice of science in areas where the conclusions reached by scientists do not please them.\\" Shapiro also shows that the creationists really have no evidence to base their views on. Making snide comments about the evidence of others does not suffice to constitute evidence for their own views.Shapiro then returns to the question of which came first, nucleic acids or proteins. He feels the nucleic acids couldn't have been first, and I agree, although I feel far less sure about it than he does. He concludes that life appears to have originated on Earth, and that the complicated molecules and structures that we observe in life today are the result of a long process of evolution. That's a sensible conclusion. He adds some speculations about substrates which are plausible as well.I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Origins: A Skeptic's Guide to the Creation of Life on Earth","review":"It's amazing to me that a scientist has to write a book about getting back to the scientific method in the search for how life originated on earth, and it is all because of an eight-hundred pound gorilla called DNA.Robert Shapiro, a leading DNA scientist, says that our genetic coding is so complex that it is a major problem for the theory of evolution. That doesn't mean that science should give up, he says, but that real scientific method should be pursued, instead of religious or scientific mytholology, or unproven beliefs that are strongly held. It shouldn't matter to science how faithfully people believe in the Creation Story of the Bible, that God created everything in seven days, or in the theory of panspermia, that the seeds of life came from outer space. Science, instead, should be about science; it should be about looking at the evidence critically, obtaining proof, being able to repeat results, and standing up to skepticism, or negative questioning of the results. A lot of this is simply not being done, in his opinion. By the way, he sees no conflict between believing in a Creator and science at the same time, but that the two should be separated for purposes of scientific study. You can believe in God and evolution at the same time. I couldn't agree more.The first DNA molecule did not have enough time for 'spontaneous generation' given the overwhelming odds of 1 chance in 10 to the 40,000th power (1 followed by 40,000 zeros). Nobel Prize contender Dr. Fred Hoyle, who coined the term \`Big Bang' in the 1940's, came up with this number. In fact, Shapiro says the odds are much greater than that, 1 chance in 10 to the 100 billionth power. These odds have been calculated based on the complexity of the 2000 enzymes in the cell, each consisting of 100 to 1000 specific amino acids linked together in a specific sequence. Hoyle assumed already-assembled amino acids in the pre-biotic soup, and Shapiro assumed \`reduced' chemicals instead. Bottom line, either way, DNA just didn't happen spontaneously.Shapiro gives us a history lesson of where we have been scientifically and where we might go from here. He starts with the famous, but overrated Miller-Urey experiments where only a couple of amino acids were produced in an attempt to simulate the pre-biotic condition of early earth, a very long way from the completion of a DNA module. He goes through a lot of scenarios about the early earth and how the principal chemicals got together with the right energy sources to produce that first cell. He admits that it is all conjecture and that it would have to be proven in a laboratory. He goes over the theory that bubbles or mud in the soup could have combined and been exposed to the right chemicals and conditions for something to happen. He proposes looking into the Random Generator that could possibly be a sort of intermediate step in the creation of DNA. He considers the initial, start-up reversal of the Central Dogma of microbology: from DNA producing RNA producing protein, to protein producing RNA producing DNA. He finally hits the subject of panspermia, which says that life on earth originated from outer space. Bizarrely, the noted Dr. Chandra Wickramasinghe even proposes a hierarchy of creators, including a silicon chip. Do we start to see some desperation?A lot of what he writes is technical, and I had to look up words like caovercate, eukayotic, lipid, enzyme, ribosome, organelle, etc. I also had to dust off my college chemistry memories and do some searches on Google to make sense of what he was saying. I don't believe he was at all showing off or talking down, but was making a valiant effort to communicate a complex subject. Frankly, I would have liked a little higher-level explanation of the detailed subject matter, but I'm sure he is writing for an audience that varies in its knowledge of science and DNA workings. He comes across as a humble man who admits he doesn't have all the answers.He likens all this to \`unbaking a cake' to find out how DNA got here. I liken it to de-compiling a multi-billion line program, going backward from the machine code to the source, something I've never seen done.DNA and its first appearance is THE issue that won't go away for the origin of life on earth. It is still the eight-hundred pound gorilla."},{"Title":"Origins: A Skeptic's Guide to the Creation of Life on Earth","review":"Robert Shapiro is professor emeritus of chemistry at New York University, and is best known for his work on the origin of life.He states in the Preface to this 1986 book, \\"Why then am I adding yet another book to the collection? Because a need exists for a clear explanation, comprehensible to the general public, of what science does and does not understand about how life first began.... The guiding spirit on this entire quest is the scientific approach, and the way in which it views and explores the world. If the reader takes from this book not only a sense of wonder at the unsolved riddle of our existence, but also a preference for doubt in place of dogma and a keen appreciation for the proper practice of science, then I will have achieved my purpose.\\"He observes dryly, \\"On perhaps no other point in origin-of-life theory could we find such harmony between evolutionists and Creationists as in opposing the relevance of the experiments of Sidney Fox.\\" (SeeThe Emergence of Life: Darwinian Evolution from the Inside, for example.)He is strongly critical of the theories of Hoyle and Wickramasinghe (e.g.,Evolution from Space: A Theory of Cosmic Creationism), saying, \\"As their suggestions became more and more extravagant, however, so did the quantity of technical supporting data diminish. The most grandiose statements were put forward virtually on their own authority.\\"In the final chapter (\\"The way to the Answer\\") he ventures \\"A Guess\\" as to the origin of life, stating, \\"I hope that my ideas are not taken as dogma, as the field has no need of additional mythology.\\""},{"Title":"Origins: A Skeptic's Guide to the Creation of Life on Earth","review":"\`We may be closer to the answer than we think.' These are the concluding words of this really excellent enquiry into the origins of life on our planet, and they mark one of the book's main characteristics as being optimism. Its other two distinguishing features are patience and honesty. Professor Shapiro has been at great pains to make the arguments and the evidence intelligible to the lay reader. This is not some easy read, for all his efforts, nor could any serious treatment of such a topic be anything of the sort. It was published in the late 1980s, and I don't know where the arguments have gone since this book's time, but Shapiro comes down in favour of nucleic acids as being the best place to look for the full answer. Even so he records a conversation with Francis Crick in which they agree that proteins might, just might, have provided an earlier link in the chain before the evolutionary process switched to the nucleic acids. Other theories are given thorough examination prior to dismissal, the examination sometimes more courteous than the theories deserve in my own opinion. At the serious end there is the hypothesis of Cairns-Smith that silicon and clay might be at the root of it all, then there are various attempts to find our origins extraterrestrially, some fairly reputable but also including the later ravings of no less than Fred Hoyle, in which he seems to have lost his marbles altogether. And then of course there is the joker in the pack, creationism. Oh dear, creationism.However, back to honesty and intellectual respectability. Professor Shapiro brings on at intervals a Greek-chorus-like persona called the \`Skeptic', aka, on the dustcover of the British hardback edition, the \`Sceptic'. The Sceptic's job is to demand that the scientific method be unflinchingly applied at all times. The scientific method requires that all hypotheses be tested so far as this is possible, and that a high standard of proof be invoked. Ideas and theories in the realm of chemistry or biology or physics or astronomy may qualify as \`science' in ordinary discourse, but people are only human and the votaries of this or that pet idea are liable to slip off the strait and narrow of the scientific method, often without realising. However there have always been attempts by powerful and interested parties to prostitute the science outright in the name of non-scientific or pseudo-scientific doctrines. Stalin, through his toady Lysenko, bent evolutionary theories to support dialectical materialism. Then of course there is creationism, which has a longer history than I had appreciated, although the name may be fairly new. Oh dear, creationism.I am myself much too polite to call creationism nauseating drivel that dishonours the human intellect. Professor Shapiro is even politer than I am, but he states categorically enough that to proclaim any doctrine true simply on the basis of authority - i.e. just because someone said it - is the complete antithesis of the scientific approach, and the creationists are not entitled to misappropriate the term \`science' for their doctrines. \`Science' requires evidence that can be validated or falsified, and the biblical account of creation is a fable that does not operate in that sphere. Nor does it help matters to claim that \`God' said it. Who says God said it? Some very human scribes said it, at a rather early stage of culture and education, and to claim that sort of thing as some word of God strikes me as close to downright blasphemy. It may of course be Professor Shapiro's compelling courtesy that leads him to treat religion with kid gloves in the way he does. If there is any point at which he may be missing a trick, I think this is it. It would be worth outraging some regular believers by saying that there is no legitimate connection whatsoever between Genesis and any rational belief in a Creator of the cosmos, and none between Genesis and the moral teachings of the scripture, by which many atheists try to regulate their own conduct. We might as well believe Hesiod, except that the study of the ancient classics has declined these days.This book is, I would say, a volume that any serious enquirer into the matter of our ultimate progenitors ought to read. Professor Shapiro has been nothing if not thorough at least as far as the date of writing, and it is another sign of the accommodating thoughtfulness that marks his tone also that he has taken so much trouble to bring some distinctly arcane arguments within the comprehension of the lay public."},{"Title":"Origins: A Skeptic's Guide to the Creation of Life on Earth","review":"Origins by Professor Robert Shapiro.

The issues explored within the volume include the level of the problem in the United States; is this in fact a serious problem or one that is heighted by the media? Are gangs active outside major urban areas? The factors that influence gang membership are explored, including family issues, respect and self-esteem issues, and desire for money. The various palns for eliminating or reigning in gang activity are explored, including the idea that gangs themselves can be brought to end the violence by themselves.Overall, this is a very good beginners book to the issue.

He also wrote books such asA History of the Marranos 5th Edition,The Spanish Inquisition,Jews in the Renaissance, etc.He begins this revised 1970 edition by describing \\"numbers of Aramean immigrants from the crowded plains of Mesopotamia... Ibrim, or Hebrews, they were called... from the fact that they came 'Beyond the Great River,' the Euphrates.\\" (Pg. 3-4) He later observes, \\"At the beginning of the twelfth century B.C.E., some local upheaval... seems to have caused a wholesale migration ... The strangers, repulsed from Egypt in 1194, fell back upon the rich coastal plain to the north... Here they had little difficulty in establishing themselves... Such was the impression which they made upon the ancient world that ultimately their name was given to the whole of the country, which is still known after them, as Palestine...\\" (Pg. 15-16)He notes, \\"The modern critical school ascribes to Ezra... the redaction and even the authorship of a substantial portion of what subsequently became known as the Torah---the Law of Moses. Whether or not this is the case, it remains an indisputable fact that, with Ezra, the reign of the Torah over the Jewish people began.\\" (Pg. 67)Of Josephus, he records, \\"After a defense of two months, the city was captured and Josephus, saving his life by a strategem, went over brazenly to the Romans, an act of treachery to which the Jewish people is indebted for its one-sided though minute knowledge of this period.\\" (Pg. 107) Later, he adds, \\"The revolt of the Maccabees, essentially a reaction against Hellenism, actually resulted in bringing the Jews into touch, for the first time, with their ultimate enemy, Rome.\\" (Pg. 135)About the First Crusade, he said, \\"This was the direct occasion of the succession of Crusades which, throughout the next two centuries, attempted... to win back Palestine for the Cross, initiating incidentally an era of martyrdom for the Jewish people which is without precedent in history.\\" (Pg. 180) But he later notes, the Jewish people \\"might be massacred, exterminated, or expelled in one state; but there was always another in the immediate neighborhood which was momentarily prepared to receive them.\\" (Pg. 235)About the establishment of ghettos, he observes, \\"In most cases... they fought fiercely against its establishment. But it soon became apparent that the Ghetto walls, though originally intended to keep the victims in, were no less useful in keeping their enemies out... (it also) tended to act as a powerful preservative of ... solidarity and culture.\\" (Pg. 274) Of the Warsaw Ghetto revolt in WWII, he states, \\"The three thousand years of Jewish history know of no episode more heroic.\\" (Pg. 405)This is a balanced \\"popular\\" overview of the entire spectrum of Jewish history (it ends with the 1967 Six-Day War)."},{"Title":"History of the Jews Rev Edition","review":"Though Roth's book has been around for a number of years, I still come across it on the bookshelves of various bookstores.

However what concerns me is that for other time periods, specifically the Middle Ages, Roth writes little more than about Jewish persecutions.

I found this book to be extremely helpful with the basic things in life- such as how to use a knife and fork, how to die, how to swim (2nd best in the book!), or how to do extreme sports (Definitely the funniest). Each topic was written with an amazing eye to the readability. This is a must read for the light hearted and happy person.

It was quite a sensation when it came out, because it was so full of blatant incestuous sex. First, you have Ty Ty who has raised 3 boys and 2 girls on his own. All 3 boys and one sister have married, while the youngest girl, Darling Jill, is a sex-pot sleeping with everyone who she can. Griselda, one of the sisters-in-law, has a gorgeous body and everybody wants to sleep with her. Ty Ty makes sure that he tells everyone he can talk to that her body is really hot and makes a man want to lick her. As you might imagine, disaster results.So in one way the entire story (209 pages) is about guys lusting after girls, girls choosing to accept or reject a given lustful attempt, and the father either saying \\"I want everything to be peaceful\\" while goading every man he meets to sleep with Griselda.There are other layers here too. The entire region is destitute. But while Ty Ty has a large spread of fertile land, he has dedicated the last 15 years of his life to digging gigantic holes in search of gold. He is starving to death - and his two negro share-croppers are also starving. Only 2 of the kids have escaped this hole-digging escapade. One is the married sister, Rosamond. She's married Will, a mill-worker. Unfortunately, the mill has shut down and the entire mill-town is starving. They are holding out for better wages and have lasted a year and a half on the barest of rations. The second is the oldest son, who made a ton of money brokering cotton and now refuses to talk to the rest of the family because of their foolish hole-digging.So Will the mill-worker COULD work, but he and the town are holding out for principles. Ty Ty and his clan COULD farm and feed themselves - but they spend their energy digging holes for gold. There are only 2 non-family-members in the story, Pluto is an overweight man who lusts after Darling Jill. Even he refuses to work. He wants to campaign to be Sheriff, because then he'd be paid for sitting around. Dave is the albino the family grabbed to 'divine' the gold for them. He's married, but after one look at Darling Jill he stays to have sex with her.Even the greed and lust of the men is often only half-hearted. Pluto wants to be Sheriff - but it's usually too hot for him to go talking to voters. Ty Ty gets a desire to have an albino, but then dilly dallies for hours before setting out.The title of the book refers to Ty Ty's land, full of holes. Ty Ty feels he is generous by setting aside one acre to be \\"for God\\" - that all proceeds from the acre will be donated to the church. But in actuality, Ty Ty \\"moves\\" the acre around to make sure that he never digs on it - he doesn't want to risk his gold going to the church. It's the same with other aspects of Ty Ty's life. He feels he's scientific in his hole-digging - but he ropes and grabs an albino man to \\"divine\\" for him where to dig next. He wants his family to be peaceful and happy, while goading every male member to sleep with Griselda. None of the characters are very bright. They all are driven by instincts, usually either sex, or greed, or both. The men all go for what they want. With the exception of Darling Jill who has sex when she wants, the women all sit back and are acted on. Griselda in fact lets Will grab her because he is a \\"real man\\" - and Will's wife watches the entire thing happen, again because Will is a real man.Which brings us to the other disappointing parts of the book. The stereotypes in the book are pretty staggering. This entire family is completely unable to care for themselves. They are animals grabbing for gold and rutting with whoever is nearby. The negros are wide-eyed and simple. They're all starving to death and they don't care. I understand of course they are exaggerations in order to make a point - but when the over-characterizations go to the ludricrous stage, it begins to lose its impact.Also, while the book's sexual exploits are rather tame by today's standards, it is still rather sex-filled. There was a lot of interesting material here - the special acre, the way the people HAD the ability to feed themselves but chose not to do it. The way Ty Ty sought peace while undermining it. But the book instead focusses on the shocking things - of men standing and watching their naked female family members undressing, taking baths, having sex, whatever. You really do not get any sense of any character in the book having dimension. They are either horny men, or sex-object women.That all being said, I really did feel like there was an underlayer here that was interesting. The idea of this special acre of land really touched me. First, Ty Ty moves it around to keep it 'safe' from the gold. Then Ty Ty puts it under the house, where there's no risk of it being involved in a dig attempt. Ty Ty's home is resting on God's Acre. But soon Ty Ty's digging efforts cause his own house to begin to cave in. When Ty Ty realizes that one of his sons is in danger, he desperately tries to set the \\"acre\\" in motion - to always stay beneath his son, and keep him safe."},{"Title":"God's Little Acre","review":"Maybe this book was too contemporary for its 1930's audience. However, the theme and language are quite tame compared to some of the works of the 21st century writers. Although there are many people in Georgia who are extemely intelligent and have created the best literature to date (Margaret Mitchell & Alice Walker, for example). There are still people who are similar to the characters in God's Little Acre in Georgia and other colorful characters in the United States. This work compares to the writings of William Falkner, who is considered tied for the honor of the greatest writer of the 20th Century along beside Ernest Hemmingway. It also compares with Billy Bob Thortnon's brilliance of charater in his writings as well. The theme is spiritual as well as sensual. Don't take my word for it...Read it and compare it to Slingblade, The Sound and the Fury, and The Color Purple."},{"Title":"God's Little Acre","review":"I bought Tobacco Road and God's Little Acre because one of the gang, that I respected, said that this was one of his favorite books. And since I like expanding my horizons, especially on the literary front, I bought God's Little Acre. I was surprised. I expected to find Jed Clampett and his family instead I found a man who lived by his own sense of morality, social status, all told in a prose that at times switches from brutally honest to poetry of the highest order. Sure the frank sexuality is present. What isn't usually stated, when people are discussing God's Little Acre, is the basic principal of Ty Ty Walden behind it. With all foundations of social behavior, God's Little Acre, is an example that there are deadly consequences because not everyone that is subject to, or born and raised in that social theory will act accordingly to the theorist imaginings. The novel is about men living up to their own definition of manhood. It is about the clash of social mandates and personal morals. It is the telling of truths that dares to put a reason behind societal misdeeds. Caldwell wrote a splendid back."},{"Title":"God's Little Acre","review":"I think the notion that anyone would attempt to rate this book as anything less than a cornerstone of American literature and a glimpse into what was once a good portion of our country is a little silly. 80 million copies and 40 languages as an indication of success will probably hold up under the weight of a critical Internet Amazon review. In many ways God's Little Acre is a bit like Knut Hamsun's \\"Growth of the Soil\\" in the context of simple people and a story is not exclusively American. It is a part of every developing society, regardless language, race, ethnicity, etc., etc...Simple, uneducated people who comprised the characters in the book, did do not live a life with a perspective derived from college dorms, GameBoy or a value system indoctrination. They didn't know they were racist, they didn't know they were greedy and they didn't realize that being preoccupied with sex was a bad thing. I'm not so sure I did either. I kind of think that is the point, the author's presentation of something he knew and wanted to share with others, a life quite different from ours.Don't scream and put your head in a paper bag when you read this book. Don't hyperventilate over racism, sex, poverty and a fool's search for gold. The book is good insight, the book captures the reality of a type of person that lived mostly at another place in time. It is a part of American history, it was a part of American life. I was born in the south, but not that long ago. The characters don't frighten me, they don't speak for me, but I know who they are. I honestly don't think going back to 1933 would be necessary to find these types of folks.A great book, colorful and tantalizing story and it takes only a couple of hours to read. Don't let shrieking PC keep you from a learning experience."},{"Title":"God's Little Acre","review":"Like his two other classic novels, Tobacco Road (1931) and the less popular Journeyman (1935), Erskine Caldwell's masterpiece, God's Little Acre (1933) is a funny, sensual, raw, and powerful novel whose tragic story is loosely structured within a mythological framework.Uneducated protagonist and patriarch Ty Ty Walden is a Georgia farmer who is gleefully obsessed with the idea that there is a literal gold mine somewhere in his land's soil. Optimistic Ty Ty (whose two favorite expressions are \\"what in the pluperfect hell?\\" and \\"Well I'll be a suck - egg mule\\") has spent almost two decades fruitlessly digging fifteen - foot holes across his farm, like an archetypal searcher after fairy gold or buried treasure. Far from reflecting Thoreau's conservatorial ideas about nature at Walden Pond, the Walden farm is slowly falling to ruin; fewer and fewer crops are planted each year, and the huge craters in the earth are left gaping. To make the process more \\"scientific,\\" Ty Ty and his two antagonistic sons, Buck and Shaw, have violently kidnapped albino Dave Dawson, who they believe will be able to \\"divine\\" the location of the lode due to his freakish \\"betwixt and between\\" status. The starving black sharecroppers on the farm perceive the swamp - dwelling Dave as a daimonic \\"conjur\\" figure, and flee in terror.Hoping to pacify his creator and perhaps turn his luck, Ty Ty has continually designated one parcel of his land as \\"God's little acre.\\" Though he has promised himself he will always forward the proceeds of the acre to the church, Ty Ty, fearing that he may be accidentally promising away his as - yet undiscovered gold, moves God's little acre from one area to another whenever the whim strikes him. Thus, one of the book's subtle motifs is a semi - conscious denial of divine forces. Ty Ty half - heartedly appeases his god with one hand while reneging on the deal with the other. \\"Blood on my land,\\" a not uncommon motif in Western literature, is the result.Though the Walden family is far more socialized than the Lesters of Tobacco Road, they are nonetheless all blissfully ignorant and happily unconscious of themselves. Ty Ty, his sons, and his son - in - law think nothing of making aggressive, groping passes at one another's wives or any other woman they think attractive, whether alone or in one another's company. \\"It's all in the family, ain't it?\\" says visionary son - in - law Will. Ty Ty goes so far as to say to Buck's beautiful wife Griselda, \\"The first time I saw you...I felt like getting right down there and licking something.\\" Blushing Griselda, embarrassed but also touched by what she perceives as a compliment made in front of the gathered family, merely says, \\"Aw, now, Pa.\\" For all of the men and most of the women, just about anyone is fair sexual game, regardless of age, race, creed, or status within the family or society. Daughter Darling Jill, continually on the lookout for erotic novelty, seduces her sister's husband and escorts Dave into the darkness behind the house on his first night of capture. For all of the Waldens, ardent sexual desire is a sign of vigor, health, and stamina; for everyone except Buck and daughter Rosamund, almost all sexual activity is of little or no consequence, either before or after the fact.Contrarily, a drowsy spell also seems to hang over the farm: several of the characters, including Ty Ty, lose their impetus, momentum, and motivation from moment to moment, so that a thirty - second return to the house to retrieve a forgotten item delays a motor trip by several hours; simply rising from a chair in the late afternoon sun is an action that takes concentration, will, and decisive resolve. When election hopeful Pluto Swint (Pluto has eyes the size of \\"watermelon seeds\\" and is grossly overweight: appropriately, his surname a cross between 'squint' and 'swine'), the novel's loudly - dressed, sweating, bumbling court jester and patsy, arrives on the farm to canvas votes (upon encountering albino prisoner Dave, the first thing Pluto says is, \\"Who's that? Is he a voter?\\"), he immediately falls prey to the family's miasmic collective consciousness and the torpor in the air. Like the Lesters, the Walden clan, rutting animals all, are as much a tribe as a family. \\"Share and share alike\\" could be their motto; no high premium is set on individuality or personal development.The book's secondary plot revolves around Promethean son - in - law Will, the leader of a group of striking mill workers in a small South Carolina town. Unlike the rest of the Waldens, Will has visionary power in addition to a robust physique and 'willful' determination and inner confidence. Throughout the novel, Will has a series of dreamy reveries in which the mill is again fully operational, the hungry strikers are gainfully employed, and pretty, respectful young local girls, with their luscious \\"rising beauties,\\" are awaiting their bread - earning spouses and lovers outside the factory walls at dusk. Like his father - in - law Ty Ty, Will has more than a touch of the enchanted poet about him. As if momentarily captured by fairies, Will awakens from his visions to find that he has been taken \\"away\\" and then \\"returned\\" to the present. Despite his penchant for alcoholism, womanizing, and spousal abuse, the still Christ - like Will is the heart and soul of God's Little Acre, and the subject of some of Caldwell's most beautiful writing.Banned in Boston and attacked by the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice upon release, God's Little Acre, which has one of the most powerful climaxes in twentieth century American literature, went on to sell more than 10 million copies. Ultimately more hopeful, warm, and uplifting than the farcical, more hilarious Tobacco Road, God's Little Acre displays Caldwell's vision at its broadest and finds the author at the height of his fictional powers."},{"Title":"God's Little Acre","review":"Like Caldwell's other masterpiece, TOBACCO ROAD, GOD'S LITTLE ACRE is the intimate story of a southern family. Once again set in deep Georgia, this is the story of the Walden family...and what a family they are. Much like TOBACCO ROAD, the story revolves around a family patriarch. For as long as anyone can remember,Ty Walden has been digging up his entire property, searching for gold. The title is derived from a corner of the property designated as \\"God's little acre\\". If gold is discovered on that part of the property then it would be donated to god or the church. But when pressed about it, Ty always has a scheme to move god's acre to a place that's already been dug up or thought to be barren.The various cast of characters includes Ty's sons, one of whom is married to a great beauty, Grizelda. Every man who sees Grizelda for the first time can only gaze upon her beauty. Then there is Ty's daughter, Darling Jill, who has been stringing along a local politician, Pluto, promising to marry him. Ty will do just about anything to continue digging his land for gold. This includes acting as a pimp when a rich son who wants nothing to do with Ty's schemes, sets his eyes on Grizelda. He practically assures the son that he can make Grizelda sleep with him for a loan of a couple of hundred dollars. When Ty and his sons kidnap an albino from deep in the swamps, because local legend has it that an albino can divine gold under the ground, Ty doesn't stop Darling Jill from working her magic on the poor albino.What is fascinating about Caldwell's characters is their unabashed enthusiasm in pursuing their goals. Nothing will stop Ty from discovering gold on his property, just as nothing will stop the sons and a son-in-law from warring with each other over women.Another undiscovered classic from a great author. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"God's Little Acre","review":"Enter into the world of TyTy, patriarch of the Walden family, who is obsessed in finding gold. His obsession is so great until he digs holes throughout his farm and foregoes the necessity of doing his planting. TyTy isn't the only one with an obsession. His son-in-law Will is determined to re-open the closed mill in his South Carolina town. Will thinks TyTy is a fool and TyTy believes the same about Will. Once again, Erskine Caldwell, takes us behind the scenes of southern poverty in the depression through his use of outlandish characters with impossible dreams. TyTy is a man of the land who is unable to sow a crop while Will is a son of the industrial mills. The mill exploits its workers and the soil refuses to yield a crop. Both men and their families become victims in a system neither one can understand. Yet these men refuse to give up their dreams.Witness the foolishness of TyTy as he captures a white, white man to divine a gold lode. The sensuousness of Ty's daughter, Darling Jill, gets to be rediculous as well as his passion for Griselda, his daughter-in-law. Throughout the book you will be confronted with adultry, rape and ignorance. The female characters are clueless and use their sexuality to get what they want. Except for Rosamond (Ty's daughter) neither of the females exhibit any type of strong character and even Rosamond falls short.The positiveness of this book is that it shows the sociological and economic impact of the depression on the lives of poor people. You witness their exagerated behavior and begin to shake your head. The weakness of the work is its repetition, pointless scenes and weak plot. After awhile the story gets to become a bore as you're wondering where is it heading. It is a fair read and I would say by all means read this work and move beyond its stereotypes of exagerated southern culture."},{"Title":"God's Little Acre","review":"This is a great book -- better, even, than Tobacco Road.Caldwell is like Hemingway and Faulkner got together and had a baby, fed it lots of bad liquor, kicked it around and finally taught it to love this sorry, sordid world.It's a damned shame people don't read him much anymore."},{"Title":"God's Little Acre","review":"If Andy Griffith and Hugh Heffner were to co-author a Shakespearian tragedy it would be a lot like &quot;God's Little Acre.&quot; When there ain't no money in planting cotton and the mill's shut up there ain't but one thing for men and women to do to keep their minds off of their troubles: SEX!TyTy Walden is as obsessed with finding gold on his land as Captain Ahab was about finding the great white whale. Greselda Walden has to be one of the most desired and fought over women in all of American literature. And what red blooded American male would not have wanted a date with Darling Jill. This book alternates from being light-hearted and silly to being very serious and profound. There is great pathos in the description of the desperation of Will Thompson and the other starving mill workers to re-open the mill and go back to work. The death of Will Thompson is a great reminder of the struggle of working people to be treated fairly in this country. This book accurately recounts the hopes and fears of the thousands of working class people who were forced to live in &quot;company towns&quot; and who &quot;owed their soul to the company store.&quot;Although I found some of the more explicit sexual content of this novel to be silly and somewhat overdone (I don't think that most people in rural Georgia in the 1930's were this open about their sexualty!), this is a great American novel and Erskine Caldwell should be remembered as one of the great American writers of this century."},{"Title":"God's Little Acre","review":"One of the most popular American novels, God's Little Acre is the 1933 story of how capitalistic greed, which is unchecked and unregulated, destroys the soul,the family, morality and civility. It is sexually explicit in places but no more so than popular television in the USA in 2012. Those who read it with the focus of critical realism will learn that the misuse of land,resources and the minds and bodies of others tear the fabric of society apart and destroy culture."},{"Title":"God's Little Acre","review":"I liked this even more than Tobacco Road. One of my favorite books. Caldwell has such a refreshingly blunt style."},{"Title":"God's Little Acre","review":"For a book that begins so well, it all comes to nothing in the end.I could easily see this book being turned into an old PBS videotaped teleplay because that's what it reads like. The characters repeat the same lines over and over, the action, what little there is, is relegated to only a few \\"sets\\" and it strives to end on a very serious, thoughtful note. For me, it wasn't enough.\\"God's Little Acre\\" starts out strong but as the book proceeds, it seems as though Caldwell had very few tricks up his sleeve. Ty-Ty, somewhat charming in his eccentricity, becomes annoying and the rest of the family talk circles around one another. The passions and lusts of the family are funny for a while, but in the end Caldwell decides that the best way to resolve things is to begin to decimate the ranks. Motivations and actions become murkier, people don't act the way people act, (not even, I suspect, country folk), and Will, a man who has hardly proved himself as anything more than a letch, is somehow on his way to becoming a folk hero. I found that last part hard to accept. All in all, this book's reputation precedes it but the actual execution leaves something to be desired."},{"Title":"God's Little Acre","review":"Mr. Caldwell used words like an artist uses brushes. His use of humor, earthy characters, and raw descriptions titillated all five senses. I read this book for the first time when I was a 12 year old girl. It was my first glimpse of adult life and its struggles. As I look back, I can only think of one author similar to him...Ernest Hemmingway."},{"Title":"God's Little Acre","review":"This novel depicts reality from which we often escape or never admit to knowing.

No time or consideration is given to the farming of crops. The absurd tale unravels from here. A local politician, Pluto Swint, who also moons for Ty Ty's vivacious daughter, Darling Jill, pays a visit and suggests to Ty Ty that he enslave an albino to help in the digging, a suggestion that Ty Ty finds appealing. Ty Ty exclaims, &quot;If we can find that albino and rope him, I know good and well we're going to strike the load.&quot; And an albino is found and enslaved.Enthusiastic with Pluto's plan, Ty Ty decides he also needs more family for the enterprise and sends Pluto, Darling Jill and the beautiful Griselda, Ty Ty's son, Buck's wife, to the mill town of Scottsville to fetch Ty Ty's other daughter, Rosamond, and her husband, Will Thompson, a mill hand. Shortly upon arriving, Darling Jill is bedded down with Will. To their surprise, Rosamond interrupts their nighttime dalliance and whacks Darling Jill's naked buttocks with her hairbrush before the unlucky Darling Jill can scurry away. Rosamond pulls out a .32 revolver and chases her naked husband out of the house and into the street, firing her pistol. Blisters rise from Darling Jill's backside so, to ease Darling Jill's pain, Rosamond retrieves a jar of lard from the kitchen and instructs Pluto to rest Darling Jill's backside across his lap so that Rosamond can apply the lard. This unusual first aid is accomplished.Things are somehow patched up between Will and Rosamond. However, Will decides to remain at the mills, which are undergoing a labor dispute threatening to turn violent. On a return trip, Will, lusting for Griselda, rips her out of her clothes as Rosamond, Darling Jill and Pluto look on, and leads Griselda to a bedroom for a romp. Soon thereafter, Will Thompson is killed in a riot at the mills. The remainder of the novel is an anti-climax.My reciting the more lurid details of this novel has been done to color this novel as the childish, soft porn that it is. It sold a lot of copies when it came out in the early 30s but it has had no legs. It is not serious literature."},{"Title":"God's Little Acre","review":"Caldwell's most acclaimed work, this novel is idiotic soft-porn. The plot and events portrayed are absurd. Caldwell's novels sold so well in the 30s due to the book-buying public's preconceived notions and prejudices regarding Southern social life.

Other than that, I feel that it did not meet it's potential.The varied themes of race, poverty, social classes, ignorance, identity, and relationships were set for a magnificent statement. Yet, it seems like the author wanted to make a statement, but couldn't quite find it in the ending - making the plot disintegrate to a weak existential expression. This is also probably why I felt that the author was trying to mimic a mixture of Hemingway and Steinbeck styles.Read it to satisfy curiousity if you'd like, but if you're looking for treasures in this genre, I suggest Grapes of Wrath."},{"Title":"God's Little Acre","review":"Erskine Caldwell (1903-1987) was considered a major author in the 1930s; today, however, his name is most often mentioned in derision, for his great claim to fame consists of two novels that are bynames for potboiler trash: TOBACCO ROAD and GOD'S LITTLE ACRE.Read today, it is difficult to imagine how something like GOD'S LITTLE ACRE actually managed to sell over eight million copies. First published in 1933, it tells the story of what Caldwell's apologists describe as uneducated, impoverished, rural white Southerners during the Great Depression--but which any one else with a grain of sense would more specifically describe as no-count trash. And then as now, there are a great many Southern farmers who fly into a rage whenever Caldwell's name is mentioned, so thoroughly did he blacken their reputation.The reason the novel sold well is very simple: sex. And while the sex is tame by today's standards, in 1933 it was pretty hot stuff. Everybody in the novel is in a state of lust. Daddy TyTy lusts over his daughter-in-law and yes, even his own daughters. His sons lust over anything in skirts. His son-in-law lusts over his sisters-in-law. And daughter Darling Jill just lusts, plain and simple, and there ain't a-nothin' no one can do about it, honey, that's just the way she is.Most particularly, the family lusts over gold. TyTy has gotten it into his head that there is gold on his farm, and in consequence he has spent the last fifteen years digging holes in it. Trouble is, he never bothers to fill the holes back in, so now he doesn't have any land to actually farm. But not to worry. A wannabe sheriff (who is, of course, in lust--in this case with Darling Jill) has told him where he can find one of them-there albinos, and TyTy is convinced that albino mojo will lead them to the gold for sure.There is one thing that troubles every one, though, and it's the thought that when they find the gold it might just be on &quot;God's little acre&quot;--a tiny portion of the farm that TyTy has set aside to provide for the Lord's work. Everything that comes out of God's little acre goes to the church... not, of course, that any one bothers to farm it. But not to worry. Every time TyTy begins to suspect that the gold might be on God's little acre he just up and decides to put God's little acre somewhere else.Throw in gun shots, rattle-trap cars, racism, a mill strike, a rich son with his nose in the air (who is, of course, in lust--in this case with his sister-in-law) and every other distasteful and dehumanizing cliche you can imagine and you have GOD'S LITTLE ACRE. Now, there have been a number of writers who have turned their talents to such lurid tales with considerable success--William Faulkner, Tennessee Williams, and John Steinbeck to name but three. But don't kid yourself: Caldwell isn't among the great masters, not by a long shot, and you're not going to find him listed among the great authors of this or any other era. When all is said and done, the absolute best that can be said for GOD'S LITTLE ACRE is that it is fairly short. Two stars for historical significance as a publishing phenomena, but zero for intrinsic merit.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"God's Little Acre","review":"Without knowing anything about the book or author, I started listening to this book (talking book and braille library) and was shocked.

The book is an easy read, a glimpse into an arena unfamiliar to many readers, but with characters fleshed out enough so that one could recognize acquaintances in some of them.This edition contains several movie stills that help the mind recall the movie, which certainly wasn't great, but had a good cast and was entertaining in a potboiler sort of way."},{"Title":"Electromagnetic Theory with 225 Solved Problems","review":"This is a good book on classical electrodynamics. It is on about the same level as Jackson or the fine recent book by Schwinger et al. even if it perhaps attempts to be more elementary.In stark contrast to Schwinger (and Jackson) it takes a continuum mechanics point of view as fundamental. There are no atoms and no averageing is used to find macroscopic fields from microscopic. This has some advantages but, in my opinion, hides the fact that in vacuum there are only two fields while in media two polarization fields must be added.Many things are very pedagogical and clear in Kovetz book and it is probably a good book to learn from. The book uses SI-units and is unusual in that it discusses thermodynamics and continua more thourougly than its competitors."},{"Title":"The priest in union with Christ,","review":"This book goes through the roles and duties of the priest, from saying mass to hearing confessions and giving spiritual direction and all things in between. Father Garrigou-Lagrange discusses proper and improper dispositions of the priest when celebrating the mass, the proper form of a homily, how to be a good confessor, and how to give spiritual direction amongst many other things. Although I am married (so the priesthood is out for me), I learned a lot from this book and gained a new and deeper appreciation for not only the priest and what he does, but also the mass and the sacraments. Of course, this is a MUST READ for anyone discerning a call to the priesthood and probably anyone who is a priest. It seems there is a lot of bad training of priests these days, and the author makes solid cases and arguments for why certain things should be the way they are."},{"Title":"The priest in union with Christ,","review":"The Priest In Union With ChristThis book discusses the priesthood going back to the Old Testament and how the Levital priesthood was a precursor to the New Testament priest, so it is very Biblical in that way. However, there is also much of a culture point of view verses a scriptural point of view. For example, some pagan ideas about purgatory mold and shape a priesthood of works by the priest, including suffering, etc. instead of depending on the redemptive, substitutionary work of Christ. The culture overrides the gospel. There is a theoretical concept of the priest being Mary's son, because Jesus which is just a cultural idea. To maintain celibacy, priests identified themselves that way. Much of the perspective of the book is based on human reasoning, instead of Jesus Christ.If one studies the ministry gifts in 1 Cor. 12 and other places, one can discern the wonderful work of Christ through the priesthood.There are discussions of proper and improper dispositions of the priest when celebrating the mass, the proper form of a homily, how to be a good confessor, and how to give spiritual direction, it covers the gamut very well, but with the good, there is also the discomfort of the unscriptural teatment of purgatory and how that is applied to the priest. It contains the Dogmatic Teaching of the Church on the mass. The discussion of purgatory is unscriptural and has since the writing of the book been revised.Here is an excerpt from the book:\\"Confessor is not intended merely to rid the penitent of his vices but also to conduct him along the way of perfection and to help him grow in virtue. Such has been the constant teaching of the Saints: for instance, St. Alphonsus:\\"One perfect soul is more acceptable in God's sight than a thousand imperfect ones. So when a confessor finds a soul whose life is free from serious faults, he should take all possible care to lead such a soul into the way of perfection and of divine love. Let him bring home to that soul how deserving God is of all our love and the gratitude we owe to Jesus Christ, who has loved us to the extent of laying down His life on our behalf. He should also point out the danger to which a soul exposes itself by resisting a special call from God to a more perfect way of life.\\"Therefore, spiritual direction is one of the normal means of progress in virtue and of arriving at intimate union with God.\\"\\"St Francis de Sales says that a good director \\"must be full of charity, of knowledge and prudence; if one of these three qualities be wanting in him, there is danger. Knowledge is required of the spiritual life and of the means which lead to union with God: prudence is essential for the practice application of principles to the individual being directed: fervent charity is required so that the director inclines his will toward God and not toward himself, leading souls to God and not to himself. This spirit of sincere and fervent charity is opposed to sentimentality which is merely a pretence of love existing in the emotions and hardly at all in the will.\\""},{"Title":"The last immortal","review":"I read this book many many years ago and I loved it then.

I hope we'll see more of Ms. William's work."},{"Title":"Your Affectionate Daughter, Isabella","review":"What a wonderful book! A good read, a touching story, and accurate history. Isabella Torrance was a strong woman who suffered much, and accomplished much, growing up in North Carolina and Mississippi in the early part of the 19th Century.This story is set in the early 1800s in the American South and is totally based on existing letters from the period. The Torrance family of North Carolina must have kept every piece of paper they ever got. It follows Isabella from the age of 7 when she was sent off to boarding school (Salem College, North Carolina), to coming home at the age of nine to a new mother and growing up on a large farm which was turning into a plantation. She married early and pioneered with her husband and baby in Mississippi - the edge of the wilderness at that time. After much suffering on the frontier, and the death of her husband, she returned to North Carolina to more adventures and a full life.The story is told through family letters, using the actual letters and other family records, plus enough imagined dialog to keep the story moving along. Ms. Williams seems to have done her research well and all of the details, from the largest to the most minute, ring true. I really enjoyed reading the book as a story, plus the added value of finding out what life was really like in the American South and on the frontier in the period just before the Civil War."},{"Title":"Your Affectionate Daughter, Isabella","review":"&quot;Your Affectionate Daughter, Isabella&quot; is a very entertaining book - the kind of book I always slow down on reading, towards the end, because I don't want it to be over - but also a fascinating look into the world of the Antebellum South. Most of us have a picture of plantation owners as Clark Gables and Scarlett O'Haras in silks and brocades; the Torrances' plantation in North Carolina is a reasonably prosperous but serious working plantation, whose owners do care about their slaves - apparently the only information we now have about them comes from annual summaries James Torrance writes up - and who would probably free their slaves, except that &quot;Then, where would we get workers for the Plantation?&quot; A good summary of much of the prewar Southern situation.The basis of the book is an extensive collection of letters written by Isabella and various other family members, all interwoven with just enough history and background so that it all makes an absorbing story. The Torrance plantation - in western North Carolina - prospers and exemplifies the good life, sure enough; various sons and daughters, including Isabella, go off elsewhere to find their fortunes, mostly with indifferent success, and often as not drift back to the old homestead. This is life as it was lived by a group of attractive but fairly ordinary people, in a world in which the vagaries of the weather, the agonizingly high rate of infant and adult mortality and the price of cotton, year by year, were far more important than far-off Abolitionists and Fire-eaters.As a part-time Civil-War buff, I found this a fascinating insight into the people on the Other Side, who are of course now Us. It's part of the magic of Your Affectionate Daughter that you really want to know how they all came out - the book tells us all the letters know, but I found myself wanting more. And, if making you really care about the characters isn't a measure of a book's narrative power, what is?p.s. Well, yes, I am a brother-in-law of the Author. But it's still a really good book."},{"Title":"Egyptian art: In the days of the pharaohs, 3100-320 BC (World of art)","review":"This volume is actually a re-issed version of his earlier work. the illustration are fine, but the text is dated &amp; sometimes a little skewed by his own theories.

He inserts commas all sorts of places they should not be, altering the meaning I intuit he is trying to convey and forcing me to reread every other sentence. I think books should introduce concepts inspiring reflection, not writing demanding deciphering.

I read this book, and promptly re-read it; it was that good. The basic plot has been outlined by other reviewers. What made this work for me was1) seeing the characters grow up, fall in love, mature, and resolve their difficulties. I don't usually like childhood sweetheart stories, but this was fantastic.2) the remarkable hero and heroine. Yes, Jane is sometimes headstrong and almost always self-centered. But you can really feel her love for David, even as she herself realizes it. And the hero? Well, a gorgeous man is always fun to read about, especially when he is not conceited about it. Joan Wolf is also shrewd in that she portrays David having an affair with a married woman; he is not perfect, but he doesn't want Jane to know about it.3) the stunning authenticity. I am not a horse person, but I felt that I was there in the stables, on the training grounds, and at the races. The same thing with the London season. And Wolf's awareness of the tremendous obstacles between hero and heroine is realistic, as is the initial solution planned for the couple. [This book, I should warn, has some surprises about people].Find this book, if you can, and read it please. Actually, I would recommend nearly all of Wolf's earlier novels. She packs so much into a thin little Signet Regency, it is simply unbelievable. In terms of intensity of feeling, she reminds me of Carla Kelly, Mary Jo Putney (who writes longer books), and Mary Balogh. But her heroes are not usually angst-ridden, and the poignancy in Wolf's stories (if any) is well under control."},{"Title":"A London Season","review":"I just loved this book. I am completely amazed at what a captivating love story she could weave in a book length most authors could not do in a book twice it's size!If you like strong heroines, you will love Jane as much as everyone does including her David and me. I've read hundreds of books but never read of a heroine that is stronger than Jane.I also adore love stories about a H/H who are sure of themselves and Jane and David definitely fit that mold. There are no words to express how deeply this book affected me. I could easily put it at the top ten of all the books I've ever read. I could not put this book down once I started. If you can find a copy, get it. It took me months to find a very used copy.Here's the basic story but it's the way Ms. Wolf draws the love story that is more breathtaking than anything else: Jane's parents die when she is six. By this time, she's into ponies and riding since her parents ignore her to hide their disappointment because she was born a female. When her father's title goes to her Uncle in England, she has to go to him too. She doesn't cry for her parents but she does for her pony since she's told she'd have to leave her pony when she leaves her Ireland for England.Her Uncle gains her favor by giving her two ponies as a welcome gift. The ponies are cared for by a stablehand David who is a year older than Jane at seven.Jane and David become inseperable. She has finally found someone who loves ponies as much as she.The complications come once David reaches sexual maturity but Jane stays ignorant of everything but the few people she knows and of course, her horses. The class distinctions, Jane learning to ride astride and her being given a London Season are all woven just wonderfully by Ms. Wolf.It's a wonderful book to lose yourself in. I know I will. Again and again."},{"Title":"A London Season","review":"Jane and David were raised together at the best racing Stud in regency England. They share their love of horses, racing and each other. It would be a perfect match, except Jane is an heiress and David is a horse trainer. Joan Wolf's masterful prose and characterization is evident from the first page to the last. Although the plot is simple, the characters keep this from being a run-of-the-mill regency. Jane, in particular, stands out among regency heroines. Instead of telling her readers how strong-minded Jane is, Wolf lets us see for ourselves."},{"Title":"A London Season","review":"This book has everything I like in a story,long and enduring friendship and love. Jane and David meet when they are children and there is simply never anyone else for them. They are truly soul mates. Through everything, good and bad they are there for each other. Each willing to give up everything in order to be together. Ann who is Jane's guardian's wife gives the very best description of the depth their love for each other. I hope Ms. Wolf will write more stories like this one.PS. I was so happy to see the heroine with black hair for a change. I read TONS of romances and I get sick of reading about blonds, redheads, titians. There a lots of us with black hair and black eyes and we all like to see ourselves as the heroine. ;)"},{"Title":"A London Season","review":"Jane and David have loved each other 4-ever, but she is noble, and he is a groom. From the day they first meet at ages 7 and 8 they are inseparable, sharing a deep love for horses. Jane is strong willed and socially a bit clueless, even though she is sought after for her beauty, poise, and fortune. One reviewer thinks Jane may be slightly autistic. David is yummy! He's golden from head to foot, with coloring like a lion. Truly gorgeous. He's strong yet gentle, a leader despite his lowly station in life, diplomatic, and liked by all. In that sense, he is Jane's opposite, so he gently counsels when her lack of tact becomes problematic. And she listens, because she loves and trusts him above all others. It's a very tight, to the death kind of bond.But they can never be together, the aristocrat and the commoner.There is greed and murder here, and some mild love scenes. There be horses, too, and races (Newmarket, Ascot, etc).Warning-- the first 1/3 of the book is set in childhood and adolescence. Half-way into the book, we are dealing with the adult (ages 17 and 18) Jane and David. Somehow this long childhood section made the book seem longer than 224 pages, yet I would not recommend removing that section. It was very sweet, and it set the stage.In the e-book there are several typos. Sentence missing its cap -- that sort of thing.There is a single instance of religious profanity, coming from Jane, of all people. It intruded. I was not expecting it, given the tone of the entire book, and it felt gratuitous and out of character.Be sure to check outA Double Deception (Signet Regency Romance), where Jane and David appear in strong secondary roles. These two books go hand in hand."},{"Title":"A London Season","review":"This is a slim little romance in which childhood friends grow up to love each other, encounter difficulties, and everything turns out ok in the end. Its strong points were an excellent attention to horsey detail, a hero I actually wanted to lick (possibly due to him sounding like my high school crush), and a heroine, well...I think Jane was written as being on the (autism) spectrum. Possibly not deliberately -- it was 1981 and there was a lot less public knowledge, but if we are going to argue than Jane Eyre was on the spectrum (and I find it not improbable), then this Jane can be, too.My points:* She only bonds strongly to one person, and has a flat affect around people that she doesn't care about.* She is much more comfortable with animals than humans.* She is repeatedly and strikingly oblivious to social cues.* She is not motivated by social rewards or punishments. Having decided on a goal, everything she does is bent to that goal.* She has difficulty expressing herself verbally.* She finds social situations overwhelming, especially around people she doesn't know.* She is anxious and withdrawn around strangers, and it takes several times meeting someone to warm up to them.I might just attribute all that to shyness, but her utter lack of emotive expression toward anyone but her friend David is remarkable, especially in the context of an average romance novel, where even shy heroines have close female friends they talk to, or siblings they relate to.I think this is fascinating, but I could be constructing a house of cards. I wish someone else would read it and let me know what they think, especially someone who is themselves on the spectrum. It's an old old book, but my copy, at least, is not showing undue signs of poor printing, and Amazon has at least a few copies available used.Read if: You want to investigate my theory, you like heroines for whom love is \\"an ever-fixe'd mark\\", you are horse-crazy.Skip if: You are frustrated by a lack of pliability in characters, you hate childhood friends-romances, you really hate horses."},{"Title":"A London Season","review":"I love all of Joan Wolf's Regencies and early historicals like Edge of Light...This novel is unique for several reasons--the reversal of the &#34;lost heir&#34; theme a la Moses in the bullrushes which is initially at least the least important aspect of the plot...Jane is a compelling female lead--a little Asperger's to her makeup before it became so popular with modern writers...and good insight into what a straight jacket life would have been like for a titled miss w/o an interest in feminine things...Like other Wolf novels--unique enough to set itself apart while still adhering to most of the genre's key points...her writing reminds me of Laura Kinsale's -- great plots, individual characters, able to write in male and female pov's..."},{"Title":"A London Season","review":"I didn't like this story as much as Lord Richard's daughter, but still enjoyed it as a traditional regency.

WalliaArun Shourie is India's leading writer on politics and history. He has been an economist with the World Bank, a consultant in the planning commision and the editor of Indian Express. Among the many honors and awards for his writings, noted for rigorous analysis and meticulous research, he has received the International Editor of the Year Award, the Dadabhai Naoroji Award, the Magsaysay Award, and the Astor Award.In Missionaries in India: Continuities, Changes, Dilemmas, Arun Shourie focuses on the intentional misinterpretations of Hinduism by Christian missionaries. The book is based on an invited lecture, he gave at the 50th anniversary meeting of the Catholic Bishops Conference of India in January 1994. The bishops got quite an earful! Nonetheless, to their great credit, Shourie notes, \\"the bishops, the senior clergy, and scholars gathered at Pune heard him politely with unwavering attention.\\" He adds, \\"Had I urged the themes of this lecture to our 'secularists', they would have denounced them as 'communal', 'chauvinist-fascist' and, having labeled them, they would have exempted themselves from considering what was being said.\\"Shourie quotes from a recent issue of the Texas-based magazine Gospel for Asia: \\"The Indian sub-continent with one billion people, is a living example of what happens when Satan rules the entire culture... India is one vast purgatory in which millions of people .... are literally living a cosmic lie! Could Satan have devised a more perfect system for causing misery?\\"Swami Vivekananda during his historic visit to the U.S., a hundred years earlier, wrote: \\"Part of the Sunday School education for children here consists in teaching them to hate everybody who is not a Christian, and the Hindus especially, so that, from their very childhood they may subscribe their pennies to the missions .... What is meant by those pictures in the school-books for children where the Hindu mother is painted as throwing her children to the crocodiles in the Ganga? The mother is black, but the baby is painted white, to arouse more sympathy and get more money. What is meant by those pictures which paint a man burning hisown wife at a stake with his own hands, so that she may become a ghost and torment the husband's enemy? .... If all India stands up, and takes all the mud that is at the bottom of the Indian Ocean and throws it up against the Western countries, it will not be doing an infinitesmal part of that which you are doing to us.\\"Is this fair to the missionaries? one asks. What about the numerous schools, colleges, and hospitals the missionaries established in India? Did they have a hidden agenda? Yes, says Shourie quoting from Gandhiji's Collected Works. In Gandhiji's discussions with missionaries, they acknowledged that \\"the institutions and services are indeed incidental, that the aim is to gather a fuller harvest of converts for the Church.\\"Many of the missionaries who came to see Gandhiji had in his words \\"designs to convert\\" him to Christianity. \\"But what is your attitude to Jesus? the missionaries would always come around to asking Gandhiji. He was a great world teacher among others, Gandhiji would say But that he was the greatest, I cannot accept. He had not the compassion for instance of the Buddha, Gandhiji would recount.... The reverend gentlemen would retire with the imprecation, 'Mr. Gandhi... soon there will come a day when you will be judged, not in your righteousness, but in the righteousness of Jesus.\\"'In the central section of the book, \\"The Division of Labour\\"-- among the British administrators, missionaries, and European Indologists-- Shouire cites extensively from historical documents to establish that these three groups colluded in essential agreement that \\"India is a den of ignorance, inequity and falsehood; the principal cause of this state of affairs is Hinduism; Hinduism is kept going by the Brahmins; as the people are in such suffering, and also because Jesus in his parting words has bound us to do so, it is a duty to deliver them to Christianity; for this, it is Hinduism which has to be vanquished.\\"Macaulay's notorious minute instituting English as the medium of instruction in India, says Shourie, \\"was laced with utter contempt for India, in particular for Hinduism, for our languages and literature: of course, Macaulay did n6t know any of those languages... his ideas about Hinduism had been formed from the calumny of missionaries .... But the breezy, sweeping damnation-- even a century and a half later, the imperialist swagger takes one's breath away.\\"Shourie quotes, at considerable length, from the writings of two high-ranking nineteenth century British administrators, Richard Temple and Charles Treveylan. Richard Temple: \\"...the missions in India are doing a work which strengthens the imperial foundations of British power.. the results are fully commensurate with the expenditure.\\" Trevelyan: \\"A generation is growing up which repudiates idols. A young Hindu, who had received a liberal English education, was forced by his family to attend the shrine of Kali, upon which he took off his cap to'Madam Kali,'made her a low bow, and hoped her ladyship was well.\\"Most of the European Indologists were far from being the objective scholars they pretended to be. The two most prominent Indologists were Max Muller and Monier-Williams, both committed to uprooting and destroying Hinduism.Here's what Max Muller, the best-known European Indologist, wrote in a letter to his wife. \\"...I still have a lot of work to do... my translation of the Veda will hereafter tell to a great extent on the fate of India and on the growth of millions of souls in that country. It is the root of that religion and to show them what the root is, I feel sure, is the only way of uprooting all that has sprung from it during the last 3,000 years.\\"Monier-Williams, the second holder of the Boden chair of Sanskrit at Oxford University and whose Sanskrit-English dictionary is still used, wrote in its preface that \\"the Boden chair of Sanskrit was set up by Colonel Boden to promote the translation of Christian Scriptures into Sanskrit, so as to enable his countrymen to proceed in the conversion of the natives of India to the Christian religion.\\" He told the Missionary Congress held at Oxford on 2 May 1877, \\"The chief obstacle to the spread of Christianity in India is that these people are proud of their tradition and religion.\\" His dictionary, he hoped, would enable the translation of the Bible into Sanskrit and \\"when the walls, of the mighty fortress of Brahminism are encircled, undermined, and finally stormed by the soldiers of the Cross, the victory of Christianity must be signal and complete.\\"Looking at the cauldron of calumnies cooked up Christian missionaries, the imperialists, and the so-called objective scholars, makes the outrage expressed by Swami Vivekananda and Gandhiji entirely understandable. Gandhiji wrote: \\"If I had the power and could legislate, I should stop all proselytising.... it is the deadliest poison that ever sapped the fountain of truth.\\"To present the point of view of the Church, Shourie has included a 50-page report distributed by the Catholic Bishops at the Conference. This report describes the four churches which make up the Church in India--the Syrian Christian communities in Kerala; the Padroado Church originating in Goa, the Tribal Churches in Central India and in the North East; and the Dalit Churches.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the intellectual history and cultural make-up of contemporary India."},{"Title":"Missionaries in India: Continuities, Changes and Dilemmas","review":"Arun Shourie, as always, starts out with exhaustive and authoritative research, quoting extensively from the gospels, the Church, and other Biblilcal research published over the ages, and then proceeds to the conclusions. The conclusions drawn by the book are that even though the Church worldwide has long abandoned most of the falsehoods it has used throughout the ages to convert people, in India, missionaries are still using those to convert people. Example - missionaries in rural and tribal India employ this favourite ploy: a stone idol of a Hindu god is immersed in water, where it promptly sinks. Then a wooden cross is immersed in water where it floats. The missionary then proclaims, 'How can your God save you when He can't even save himself?!!'The other very informative chapter is on the history of the implementation of the Macaulay system of education by teh British in India, which was meant to educate and raise a class of Indians who would be English in thinking and Indian only only in color.Section by section, chapter by chapter, Arun Shourie strips away at preconceived notions held by many people regarding the Church, the Bible, the gospels, and the historicity of those books, people, and events. To call the book a 'neo-Hindu' view of Christianity is misleading, and suggests a narrow-mindedness to the book that is simply not present. I found it highly readable, and recommend it.Finally, to paint all of Christianity and missionaries with the same brush would be unfair. Arun Shourie points out in his book that there is a lot of good that has been done by missionaries in India and that we Indians could learn from. However, that should also not stop us from casting a critical eye where required."},{"Title":"Missionaries in India: Continuities, Changes and Dilemmas","review":"Arun Shourie gives the picture of the motive of missionaries in India. Christians should read this and understand that missionaries in the past were militants just as they always point out the Muslims countires as Islamic Fundamentalist.

Also lack of coverage of Hindu organizations like ISCON and other religion missionaries makes this a biased read to attack one religion. I believe all views have to be fair and both sides of the story need to be told. I liked the read and the authors points but the author seems very biased including two of the reviewers here. I do agree that there is fact that \\"Some\\" missionaries did use that to gain converts. It does not mean that all missionaries are doing that today. The ISCON movement in Hinduism too looks for converts does not mean all hindus organizations try to convert. Ram Krishna mission does some great work so does swami narayanan sect. There is more perception based stereotyping which I am against. Also the author has only spoken negative about missionaries and propaganda to prove them wrong without giving a fair chance that many missionaries were also spiritual and did it out of love or did not force or lure. Also christian missionaries is a broad term which encapsulates a whole lot of sects stereotyping is dangerous.Christianity came to India before it came to Europe via Saint Thomas Christ's disciple. He was was butchered by angry brahmins who felt threatened of losing power. I wonder why and who is violent here? Conviniently ignored by author. Arun Shorie is a right wing BJP supporter,I do see the political angle supporting extremist Hindu organizations like VHP. I do agree some missionaries convert by tricks but they belong to specific denominations and groups and was more rampant in the old century and sprodic incidents occur today. This has more to do with the kind of human beings some missionaries are than with christianity, are we saying there are no Hindus who committed atrocities or are hypocrites ? I believe exploiting for power is a human trait. Are we saying destroying churches or mosques by some hindus was fair to the right of worship of muslims and christians who were caught in crazy fundamentalist rage in an Indian Democracy? Some missionaries doing something does not mean all missionaries are crooks, just cause he produced some facts has he studied all missionaries ? Just as few hindu extremist's and organizations do not make up the views of all Hindus.The prime proponents of generalizing all christians,muslims and other minorities are power hungry Indian politician's and their sub colonial narcistic extremist hindu organization's who were even involved in killing Gandhi. Most of these political parties use extremist organisations to spread hatred so they can build a vote bank and gain power. There is also some truth that many do not want backward and other classes to get educated as they lose power and control, in short they use religion to get elected and like it that religious divisions prevail and some of their colonial educated Nationalist believe this view.Religious fundamentalism, Narcism and Egoist thinking is a human trait that comes from pride,lack of education,I am better than you attitude and strong identification with ones religion in traditional than spiritual ways. I am sure every spiritual person who really feels love and god be it Hindu, Muslim, Buddhist or Christian is compassionate. As a convert from a Hindu brahmin family of forefathers 300 years ago, I do know lot of people who converted from Brahminism and other indian caste as they saw some people using caste system to persecute people. Many people also liked the teaching's of Christ actually many brahmins followed Hindu life in mutts and Jesus Christ's teaching's.Jesus Christ was a compassionate person whether or not we disagree on other things, this lead Gandhi to say\\" If all Christians followed the teachings of Christ the world would be 100% Christian\\". I know many people try to use something negative about a religion and awfulize the whole religion which is narrow mindedness. The same people who critique Indian christians and missionaries are first to keep numb when thousands of muslims are butchered in their backyard by so called Hindu extremist. Many people liked Christ's teaching of love and compassion let us not forget that.In short a good book as long as we do not generalize the authors views and read other views. Also evolution of Christianity in India and abuse of the caste structure meant for organization by some Hindus needs to be given some fair thought. Please also consider political angles of this book to meet certain implicit motives. That said I hope I have given a fair review of this material.Please do read other books on evolution of Christianity in India to get a balanced view.Those interested in a balance view should also read \\"Christians and Missionaries in India: Cross-Cultural Communication Since 1500\\"Robert Eric Frykenberg and articles on \\"Christianity In India\\" for complete view on subject.Satya Meva Jayathe truth always prevails)Ajay"},{"Title":"Foundation Vibration Analysis: A Strength of Materials Approach","review":"This is the best book by these authors as it is the only one that has an accompanying software.

This book tries to divinate the truth and the origin of the 'curse of Ham' since over the generations many have perverted the bible to show that the descendants of Ham were African and were also meant to be slaves. The truth is a little different. Just as Atalantic slavers used the exuse that africans were not human to enslave them thus Muslims likewise used the excuse that africans could be enslaved as pagans. But the Bible was simply used as an easy way to not feel guilty about slavery. The reality was that slavery was practiced not just against Africans and that the race of Africans had little to do with slavery. Rather the slave trade seems to have been so long and prosperous in Africa due to the Africans being active participants, the lack of a unified empire in Africa to oppose slavery and the lack of other sources of humans to serve as slaves. After all we know that Rome enslaved the Gauls and other europeans. But when Europe developed a strong state the only europeans open to being enslaved where those colonized by the Ottomans. Likewise the depopulation that followed the Islamic conquest of the middle east meant that slaves could not come from thos eregions. Slaves certainyl couldnt be transported out of China. Thus Africa became the meat market for human cruelty, the sickness of slavery that eventually consumed and destroyed african soceity. But among the warrior tribes such as the Zulu we do not see enslavement, why? Because they dared to raise the sword against the Perverts who came to buy their daughters into slavery. The 'curse of Ham' had little to do with Africa rather it had more to do with Humans and the weakness of the state.Seth J.

Or was it more than money? That question is not exactly answered in this chilling expose of Nazi war criminals living quiet, peaceful lives in the United States, the corruption in the INS that allowed them entrance (and citizenship!), and the man who tried his best to hunt them down and expell them. Although the author concentrated on four of these monsters, he might have done the world a service in 1977 by naming all 59 names on the list Tony DeVito was supplied. Looking back through the Kosovo experience, would expelling those Ustashi leaders hiding here and openingly publishing their hate literature have somehow prevented the blood-shed in Serbia? And the disgrace to the Rumanian Orthodox Church! No wonder there were young people in the 1960s for whom \\"organized religion\\" was a joke!

Through its narrative and story-line, you are brought into the world of Simon Bar-Cochba. Many important questions are raised for the characters in the book which are still relevant for people today. They include the following: 1. What is meaningful to an individual and how much is he/she willing to fight for it? 2.What are one's priorities in life and how committed is one to them? Mr. Meisels does an exceptional job of bringing the reader into the ancient world and holding his interest captive throughout. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Son of a star","review":"I enjoyed this novel very much. I ordinarily do not read historical - fiction finding it often bordering on the preposterous. But Meisels knows his Jewish history, his general history. And he does things tastefully. Dialogue in historical - novels is often wooden and cliched. Meisels manages to present dialogue which is straightforward and sensible. He has a good feeling for character. And his great sympathy and understanding of Jewish history pervade this story of the Jewish revolt against Rome in which Rabbi Akiba is spiritual leader and Bar- Kochba the battlefield commander. Meisels opens the book with portraits of the Roman rulers and he shows an understanding of the conflict from all sides. His descriptions of the courage and sacrifice of the warriors of ancient Israel attempting to liberate their land from foreign oppression are moving and convincing.Reading the book made me realize something else. The effort by the enemies of Israel to deny a Jewish historical connection to the Holy Land is not just an abuse of the Jewish people and their historical experience. It is an abuse of historical truth.For instance anyone who studies Roman history, the history of the Empire would certainly know about this Jewish revolt, and its cruel suppression. So inadvertently in this fiction based on historical fact Meisels reminds of the Jewish connection with the land. He too tells the story in such a way as to make it clear that the struggle of the Jewish people against foreign oppression in the Holy Land did not begin and end with the Romans.In any case I greatly enjoyed this work and highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Son of a star","review":"This novel is exciting, scintillating, engaging and passionate. It is also a work of history based on the heroism of Simon Bar Kochba (son of a star)who led a rebellion against the yolk of Roman rule of the Land of Israel in 132 CE establishing an independent State of Israel of which he was the Nasi (Prince).The Jewish state lasted three years before it was crushed by the entire might of roman rule but not before a heroic and fierce resistance by the Jews, which nearly led to the sapping of the strength of theRoman Empire.Bar Kokhba took up refuge in the fortress of Betar. The Romans eventually captured it and killed all the defenders. According to Cassius Dio, 580,000 Jews were killed, 50 fortified towns and 985 villages razed.As the novel tells Hadrian renamed Judea, Palaestina (after the extinct ancient enemies of the Jews, the Philistines( in order to divorce the land from Jews entirely.

It is considered one of his classic works, setting and excellent basis -- the foundation and principles of the &quot;Infinite Way&quot;.Once you read one of Goldsmith's books, you will find yourself naturally looking at things in life in a different manner, your thoughts, attitudes and responses to life events will begin to change, you will be drawn to read other works by this incredible man. The more of his books that you read, the more the principles he lays out and the essence of the &quot;Christ Consciousness&quot; comes into clearer view and, slowly, more ingrained in your own consciousness. It is no wonder that other reknowned authors of our day, such as Wayne Dyer, refer to Joel Goldsmith's works in their own. This man was evidently a man of great spiritual fortitude, and discipline, insight, wisdom and grace. A Lover of God, a Seeker of the His Kingdom. If these are attributes you are in search off, or in the process of developing in your life -- you'll love this book and it will transport you to another level.Of an even greater spiritual impact (at least for me) is his: &quot;Man Was Not Born to Cry&quot;!!! (see my review if you are interested).And for those who may be interested in modern scientific thought(research based)that serves to explain much of what the mystics and spiritual masters have been telling us throughout the ages read: David R. Hawkins: &quot;Power versus Force&quot; - POWERFUL!!! After reading this one you will have to take less &quot;on faith&quot; or &quot;trust&quot;, and more &quot;on knowing&quot; -- quite helpful for that part of our brain (left) that tends to inject doubts, or conclude that &quot;Truths&quot; are too lofty, romantic, philosophical and idealistic, but not practical or part of the &quot;real world&quot;. See the paradigm shift that has been taking place within modern science. Quite soon the two -- science and spirituality -- may very well end up where they were always intended to be -- in bed with one another, in union and close affiliation, as complements, not adversaries.

Those coming from a more traditional religious background may find his uncluttered approach to God refreshing."},{"Title":"The Infinite Way","review":"The following is a review of THE INFINITE WAY for A COURSE IN MIRACLES students. If you are not then it may not be helpful.I consider A COURSE IN MIRACLES to be a continuation of Joel S Goldsmith's THEINFINITE WAY (I am using this as a term for his entire teaching, not just this book). Joel died just months before Helen Schucman began scribing ACIM. I like to think of Joel helping out in some way with A COURSE IN MIRACLES on the other side of the veil. In ACIM, the principles of the Infinite Way are further developed and given depth and sophistication. Of course, this is all my humble opinion.That said, I got this off of facim.org:\\"Q #783: I notice many similarities between A Course in Miracles and The Infinite Way teachings of Joel S. Goldsmith. Would you please comment on this?A: Because all authentic spiritual teachings are leading in the same direction -- towards an experience of oneness which transcends the false self, the finite ego -- it is very likely that similarities and parallels in content can often be identified between paths. Certainly that can be said for the teachings of Joel S. Goldsmith and A Course in Miracles . Both, for example speak of our real existence as spirit, that the material world is an illusion and the body is merely an idea that expresses what is in the mind, that error or sickness is in the mind and not in the body, and that healing is the result of correcting a false belief in the mind.And yet there are differences. For example, Joel Goldsmith speaks of God as Consciousness expressing itself. The Course, in contrast, speaks of consciousness as \\"the first split introduced into the mind after the separation\\" (T.3.IV.2:1) . The Holy Spirit, the Voice for God in the dream according to the Course, is more nearly equivalent to the concept of Consciousness that Goldsmith refers to in his teachings. In addition, Goldsmith speaks of God as the life, mind, body, and substance of individual being, and of the body as existing as the idea of God. And therefore, we will never be without conscious awareness of the body, nor without the body. The Course, in contrast, views the body as the embodiment of the ego's wish that the separation be real (W.pI.72.2:1,2,3) , and teaches that the body nevertheless can be give a different purpose, that of healing and forgiveness, under the Holy Spirit's guidance. The body then will simply disappear from the mind once its usefulness to the Holy Spirit for healing is complete. And the emphasis of the Course, therefore, on looking at the ego and its thoughts of hatred and attack and guilt, is simply not reflected in Goldsmith's approach.This is not to say that one is right and the other is wrong -- they are merely different. For as Jesus reminds us near the end of the Course, \\"A universal theology is impossible, but a universal experience is not only possible but necessary. It is this experience toward which the course is directed\\" (C.in.2:5,6) . To the extent that both teachings lead us to release all of our preconceptions about how things should be, what our physical and emotional lives should be like, and any effort to control the external to achieve our personal goals, they are both fostering a nonjudgmental acceptance, which is what the Course means by forgiveness. And so both would be leading us toward the same universal experience.Although addressed to the issue of different teachings on the Course itself, Question #48 provides a helpful perspective on thinking about the relationship of the Course to other spiritual paths, such as Goldsmith's.\\"The Infinite Way does not have the psychological component of ACIM, yet what it does have is the love of a man whose very presence was a blessing upon this planet.I came back to Joel's work after being diagnosed with a serious illness and cannot even begin to express in words the healing (that is a rising in consciouness) I am still experiencing, much less the deepening of my work with A Course in Miracles."},{"Title":"The Infinite Way","review":"The thing about Joel Goldsmith is that once you read one of his books you must read every one of his books. They're addictive in their wisdom. As former Editor of Science of Mind magazine and a spiritual counselor for many years, I've read every Goldsmith book (several times) and quoted them many times. I remember scouring the Bodhi Tree looking for his books years ago when some of them were out of print. Thankfully, all the books are available again. (There are also tapes of his early talks). I lean on the wisdom of The Infinite Way so often that I'd be lost without it. Joel Goldsmith was (and still is) a spiritual giant, always in integrity and prepared to teach us to live a thrilling spiritual life. You'll be so happy to discover this book.

I'm a great admirer of Goldsmith's other works, all the ones I've read so far, but I personally do not feel that this book has the same quality as his later works. I venture to say this though all the reviews of this book on the US Amazon site, at any rate, are rave reviews. I beg to differ.One of the reasons for my lack of total appreciation for this book is that I like to have things spelt out for me. I don't comprehend vague, abstract sentences. In his later books I found Goldsmith's teachings crystal clear or practically so, though he does tend to contradict himself.I particularly found the first chapters of the book IN PART unclear or difficult. This was frustrating, as I like to understand things clearly. If I hadn't previously read a few of his later works, I might not have appreciated this book at all.All this said, I did find his good, basic teachings to be contained in the book, of course: 1) \\"There is but one Consciousness, God.\\" \\"As a wave is one with the ocean, so you are one with God.\\" 2) \\"Meditation is the door to the realm of the soul.\\" 3) Meditation is prayer, and the true prayer is the \\"contemplation of God and God-activities.\\" 4) \\"'What is God?' ---- 'I AM'\\". 5) There is no evil, so we should cease our resistence to the inharmony of human existence. 6) When faced with a problem seek the solution within. 7) \\"The peace within becomes the harmony without.\\" - a lovely concept. 8) As regards \\"supply\\" - \\"the inner supply appears as the necessary outer things.\\"Chapter 10 summarizes the wisdom of the Infinite Way. This is a useful chapter, though it also contains unclear things. For example, he talks about \\"the dream\\" without defining what this is. I presume he means our earthly life that we regard as reality.One statement I particularly appreciated was to the effect that if we consciously maintain our relationship with God, this will take care of everything else. (This is identical to the message of Esther & Jerry Hicks' Abraham - that the important thing is to maintain our connection with Source, in which case our lives will automatically run smoothly.)If you already appreciate Goldsmith's works you'll want to read this one too, but if not, in direct opposition to all other reviewers,I would recommend that you begin with one of the later ones."},{"Title":"The Infinite Way","review":"i was very skeptical when i first picked up this book to read but i am very thankful that i did. this book has answered many of the questions i had concerning god and jesus the christ and religion. it puts spirituality in such a practical and easy to understand light that it now seems so simple to me. i really believe i was led to this book. i think any one who purchases it is divinely led to do so."},{"Title":"The Infinite Way","review":"My path led to the writings of Joel Goldsmith two years ago.

This is one of those many books, and a good introduction to Goldsmith's approach to healing, which was all based on maintining a pure consciousness, whose awareness of only one power \\"God\\", rather than two powers \\"God and the disease\\" was strong and clear enough to cause the disease to disappear from the physical world. For those of you new to the idea of spiritual healing, Goldsmith bears witness to how powerful it can be. To those of you wanting to learn spiritual healing, Goldsmith provides a template of consciousness, a clearly blazed trail, which if followed will lead to the goal.Goldsmith isn't for everyone. His way of healing requires a devotion to a pure spirituality and a daily meditative practice that not all are ready for. What he calls \\"the infinite way\\" is far deeper than a superficial repeating of affirmations, requiring daily practice over a period of time, and understanding scripture not only as \\"the letter of truth\\", but also at a deeper level, creating in one's being an awareness of God's healing power so deep that when someone calls upon you for healing that you have the spiritual depth to get the job done.Goldsmith is also very clear that \\"man is not a healer\\". It is not we who do the work, but the \\"Father within us\\". If you're ready for a journey into healing consciousness, led by someone who healed thousands over a period of many years, this book is a great introduction, well worth the price."},{"Title":"The Infinite Way","review":"I have read a couple of Golsmiths books,and it is my opinion that he has tapped into that which all of us seek, our True Identity.

The cultural consensus, if there ever was one, is more in disarray now than every before in history. In order to address the situation, the meaning-makers of our culture have posited a variety of approaches, from the liberal to the communitarian with the revisionist liberals and societal communitarians in between, in search of the one that will provide the return to order for which we all groan. In Covenant, Community, and the Common Good: An Interpretation of Christian Ethics, author and ethicist Eric Mount Jr. surveys and critiques the major positions espoused by various schools of ethics as represented by a wide range of individual thinkers and, picking and choosing judiciously among them, constructs the theological base for what might be called a hybrid model of ethics which he invites the culture to consider--that of community based on covenant and the common good. In the first two chapters Mount looks at the concepts of covenant from the Hebraic heritage and of the common good as put forth by Aristotle, pointing out strengths and shortcomings of each, particularly in their historical manifestations. In chapters three, four and five he seeks to discover a &quot;middle way&quot; which will help us claim and reclaim the positive values of covenant and the common good while correcting the abusive ways in which these organizing principles have been applied. Mount seeks &quot;starting points&quot;(51) in considering the very real issues of various levels and forms of community: the family, the venues of national commerce and politics, and the global community. As a case in point, he considers society's grappling with homosexuality in light of the work of Max Stackhouse and Paula M. Cooey. Each beginning with the same Reformed tradition, Genesis creation story, and covenant as their central norm, Stackhouse develops a thesis which supports the traditional view of homosexuality, while Cooey's thesis critiques the traditional view and elevates difference and relationship over law and order, an approach in which Mount finds greater promise for social consensus. (66-67) For Mount, community involves that which gives each member &quot;a sense of identity connected to a center of loyalty, the sense of responsibility, the respect for diversity, and the openness to participation in decisions.&quot;(31) He has done an excellent job in providing examples of ways in which this community can be realized in the workplace, the home, politics, schools, religious institutions, and the multiple other venues and associations. His fundamental approach is dialogical. &quot;(F)acilitating communication and modeling respect for difference, sensitivity to need, and commitment to the values of liberty and justice for all&quot;(154) must be central to the process. In the end, Mount calls for the development of the &quot;civic virtues&quot; of faith, hope, love and gratitude: &quot;faith as openness to the other, love as affirmation of the other and compassion toward the other, hope as the expectant patience to keep public discourse alive, and generous public-spiritedness as the manifestation of gratitude.&quot;(154) Promoting and enfleshing these virtues will help us &quot;approach and perhaps even accomplish that delicate balance between individual liberty and communal solidarity that revisionist liberals and societal communitarians seek.&quot;(156-157) Thus, covenantal commitments, community that affirms and respects difference, and the valuation of the table where all are welcome and all are valued as a common good might combine to provide a basis for ethics in this postmodern era to which all may subscribe. I have great sympathy for Mount's development of the ethical base of covenant and the common good in community. Heeding him could provide a much-needed corrective to the unhealthy tendencies evident in much of the church and society today."},{"Title":"Covenant, Community, and the Common Good: An Interpretation of Christian Ethics","review":"American society and the associations that constitute it are breaking down.

The text is little more than a workbook; it has little explanation to go along with the problems you will get assigned as homework. I attend a large university so compounding this problem is the level of math this text is for, freshmen. Freshman classes are taught by \\"lecturers\\", or graduate students who, while very knowledgeable of their field, have little or no teaching experience so prove to not be able to effectively fill in the numerous blanks this book leaves. Also, these size of these classes tend to be in the hundreds and with the lecturer himself/herself being a student as well, can not devote the time needed to teach this subject because of the strains their own course loads put on them. Also this book claims that it \\"aims to provide students with the quantitative skills needed for their chosen fields and to lay the foundation for more advanced courses in mathematics.\\"(qtd. by Amazon from Book News, Inc.) My college uses this text for Business Mathematics but having worked before attending college I can not recall some of the examples in the book as being used in my office...ever. As an example the book uses the old \\"bag full of different colored marbles, probability of pulling out a given color\\" exercise. There is also the \\"5 people on a row of 8 seats in a movie theater different combinations\\" exercise. That might have been just the example the lecturer picked but I saw no real exercises in accounting and such. The book also assumes that there is no software or calculators in existence to figure out compund interest and such other things so one has to painfully struggle through word problems with one example that is supposed to fit the dozens of different problems given in the book. So, if you are a weak math student like me, prepare to ask lots of questions and go to office hours regularly to beg for help when this book has no explanations. All in all this book leaves you scratching your head unless you already know the math concepts in the book(in which case you should not be taking a class that uses this text). Anyone who has a choice of what text to get should avoid this one. Also, if you can take a course with a different text then by all means do so.

Therefore, I would have no trouble using this book in my class.The coverage in college courses in finite mathematics is standard and this book adheres to those standards.

While the book is not uniquely good, I think that some of the complaints leveled against the text are a little off-base. First, the book does not assume that the student has no calculator. Many sections include an addendum showing how to perform the pertinent tasks on their calculator, and the book includes a calculator tutorial.Further, while it is true that the textbook doesn't dedicate much energy to theorems, that is somewhat irrelevant. This is an applied mathematics text; it exists to show a student how to use concepts. It does not exist to discuss the origin of these concepts. That is beyond the scope of the text, and presumably beyond the scope of any course utilizing the book.This is a perfectly usable textbook, but don't expect miracles. Many students will see matrices and mathematical game theory for the first time in this text. Doing Gauss-Jordan by hand is slow, tedious work. The book can't change these types of facts.

Williams"},{"Title":"Richmond Burning: The Last Days of the Confederate Capital","review":"Nelson Lankford does a credible job of recounting the final days of Confederate Richmond in RICHMOND BURNING. His writing is vivid, colorful, and detailed, an excellent reportage that nevertheless is short on theme.The book suffers from too needle-fine a focus. Unlike the classic history THE FALL OF RICHMOND, RICHMOND BURNING floats disconnectedly above the Civil War landscape, barely referencing the greater historical themes of the war or the other momentous events that crowded April 1865. Lankford's Richmond in April has become Camus' plague-ridden Oran, self-contained, and somehow sequestered from the world around it. After all, why burn Richmond? The book begs a strategic answer.Lankford, a native Richmonder, clearly loves his city. Clearly, he despises the waste of war, and has little regard for the men who chose to burn it rather than see it fall into Yankee hands. His outrage makes sense, particularly when the reader considers that the original target of the flames (the riverside tobacco warehouses near the commercial district) were of no use whatsoever militarily but that the Tredegar Iron Works (on the outskirts) were. Had the war continued, Tredegar would have added an important resource to the Union war machine. The tobacco had nil value. The burning seems so utterly capricious when seen in that light (mine, not Lankford's, who never theorizes) that Richmonders' contempt for their serpent-cold Confederate President seems well-placed. Seemingly, Richmond burned because the leadership knew the end had come, a symbolic pyre.The fire consumed the commercial district but left 90% of the city intact. Lankford focuses on the 10%. As the banking and administrative center of the South, downtown Richmond had an importance greater than most city centers. As destructive as the fire was, it lasted only about a day and was quickly contained (largely by Yankee efforts). The riot that preceded the Northern occupation seems to have done little harm though Lankford lavishes much descriptive prose upon it.Lankford is best at ferreting out the personal reactions of Richmonders to the loss of the Cause through prodigious use of documents and diaries. Many Richmonders had to admit, ruefully, that \\"The Yankees aren't so bad considering it is them\\" while others heaped scorn upon the \\"Things\\" that had occupied their city and controlled its economy and food supply. A surprising number of Richmonders greeted the return of the Stars and Stripes enthusiastically; many others spit and refused to swear allegiance. Still others bowed to the inevitable and became U.S. citizens again as a matter of course.Lankford tells us that Confederate rancor \\"lasted for years\\", though he gives us little documentary evidence that it did. Beyond this one bare sentence, Lankford fails to address the issue at all. It is clear that the era of Jim Crow was a Southern reaction to Northern domination, wherein African-Americans became surrogates for festering Southern resentments (with Northern social and legal acquiescence), but this is beyond Lankford's view.Lankford's finest moment comes when he describes Abraham Lincoln's modest but triumphal visit to the still smoking city, less than forty hours after Jefferson Davis had decamped for Danville. The unalloyed joy---there is no other word---of the freed people at seeing the Great Emancipator spills from the page. It brought tears to this reader's eyes and made this book memorable.A suggestion: RICHMOND BURNING is best read in tandem with Jay Winik's APRIL 1865 which addresses the end of the war in a broader perspective.A fine effort despite its shortcomings, RICHMOND BURNING definitely deserves a place on your Civil War shelf."},{"Title":"Richmond Burning: The Last Days of the Confederate Capital","review":"The author captured the subject well. I have written a book about the Civil War and the contents of Richmond Burning improved my understanding of the local environment of Richond during the War. The contents were documented by references secured from local newspapers and sources from the Virginia State Library."},{"Title":"Richmond Burning: The Last Days of the Confederate Capital","review":"A civil war is a terrible event, tearing apart families and friends, destroying cities and farms, killing thousands. As horrible an event that it was, the American civil war is made amazingly detailed and vivid in this most amazing tale of history, 'Richmond Burning: The Last Days of the Confederate Capital'. Anyone who is interested in our history would be totally enthralled with this reading of events in Richmond, Virgina, backed up with correspondence among real people, Confederate leaders as well as the average citizen. Richmond Burning is an excellent learning experience for Civil War buffs and students."},{"Title":"Richmond Burning: The Last Days of the Confederate Capital","review":"Lankford collected a vast array of historical documents, newspaper articles, and book excerpts to author \\"Richmond Burning.\\" Lankford's research goes well beyond what a typical civil war author has accomplished. He conveys the views and actions of military leaders, politicians, civilian bystanders, war profiteers, ex-slaves, spies, criminals, reporters, and soldiers of both sides. Unfortunately, the information Lankford has organized does not flow like a well written book should. He fits numerous pieces of research into an awkwardly fitting puzzle. Whether intentional or not, Lankford manipulates the research to convey a subtle disdain for \\"white southerners\\" who supported the Confederate cause. His love for the city of Richmond is vivid, however. The virtuous northern victory clearly outweighs social and economic decay that plagues much of the city today."},{"Title":"Richmond Burning: The Last Days of the Confederate Capital","review":"At the beginning of RICHMOND BURNING we see Robert E. Lee ride into town in the rain. This is pretty much the last time we get to see him. Lankford edits the Virginia Magazine of History and Biography and lives in Richmond so we can understand why he might be interested in the politics of running the city after the evacuation of the Confederate government, but a reader of popular history might be disappointed in his emphasis on minor characters, such as Major General Godfrey Weitzel, who administered the city for a time after Davis and his government left. Even the pictures leave something to be desired. There's one of Robert E. Lee standing on the porch of his rented home taken by Matthew Brady. Supposedly there's another one where Lee is shown with his nephew Fitzhugh I would've liked to've seen. No such luck.I was momentarily absorbed when Lankford showed Jefferson Davis leaving the city on a train carrying what was left of the Confederate treasury. It would have been interesting to see how Davis was captured, but Lankford has narrowed his focus to Richmond, so that wasn't possible. Even the fire isn't much to speak of. Davis orders what's left of the Confederate pickets to set fire to the tobacco warehouses and the wind spreads the fire; the Union Army puts it out in two days.The most intriguing part of the book is when Lincoln shows up. Lee's army has not been defeated and here he is without an escort. Lincoln further complicates matters by allowing former Supreme Court justice, John Archibald Campbell to summon the Virginia legislature to discuss seceding from the Confederacy. We get a glimpse of Edwin Stanton, Lincoln's powerful secretary of war, who puts the fritz to that notion in a hurry.Lankford also seems to have reinvented the wheel. In his acknowledgments, he mentions Rembert Patrick's THE FALL OF RICHMOND, written only forty years ago. Although Lankford has done extensive research, there doesn't seem to a reason for another version."},{"Title":"Richmond Burning: The Last Days of the Confederate Capital","review":"First let me state, this book should not be read by a novice, seeking to learn the history or cause of the Civil War, but if one is highly knowledgeable on this topic, this book, is a good 'PC' version.Mr. Lankford does a wonderful job of bringing that era of Richmond to life, but he seems to believe in the current 'political cause' of the Civil war.With all the research done, I am surprised he has not found other documents, or historical facts that dismiss his views.By page 5, I came very close to throwing the book away, when I read of General Lee, riding into Richmond in his \\"misbegotten attempt to set up a separate republic built on human chattel, slavery.\\"Historical facts actually record Lee's daughters teaching the slaves to read, and Lee stating, \\"There are few, I believe, in this enlightened age, who will not acknowledge that slavery as an institution is a moral and politicalevil.\\" - Col. Robert E. Lee, USA - December 27, 1856Or \\"If I thought this war was to abolish slavery, I would resign my commission, and offer my sword to the other side.\\" --- Ulysses S. GrantMr. Lankford then attempts to state that Lincoln wanted equal rights for the African Americans! Here again, the facts bear out Lincoln by his own speeches--\\"Negro equality, Fudge!! How long in the Government of a God great enough to make and maintain this Universe, shall there continue to be knaves to vend and fools to gulp, so low a piece of demagoguism as this?\\" -- Abraham Lincoln 1859 [Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, Vol III, PP 399, Basler, ed.]OrDuring the fourth Lincoln-versus-Stephen Douglas debate on Sept. 18, 1858, in Charleston, Ill., Lincoln emphatically stated his view of the role of black people in American society:\\"I will say that I am not nor ever have been in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races; that I am not nor ever have been in favor of making voters of the free Negroes, or jurors, or qualifying them to hold office, or having them marry with white people.\\"I will say in addition that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which, I suppose, will forever forbid the two races living together upon terms of social and political equality; and inasmuch as they cannot so live, that while they do remain together, there must be the position of the superiors and the inferiors; and that I, as much as any other man, am in favor of the superior position assigned to the white man.\\" .\\" The CollectedWorks of Abraham Lincoln edited by Roy P. Basler, Volume III, \\"Fourth Debatewith Stephen A. Douglas at Charleston, Illinois\\" (September 18, 1858), pp.145-146.\\")Rm. Lankford continually implies the Union army was the \\"army of freedom\\" PP. 118, line 14, through the entire novel. On page 244 Mr. Lankford again attacks Lees character, when Lee went to kneel beside the freed slave, at St. Pauls church, by stating the person that reported it, \\"could not have divined what was in Lee's mind\\" ( Do we suppose Mr. Lankford does?)For the aforementioned reasons, I can only give this book one star.I would give Mr. Lankford an A+ for his graphic description of the women crying in church, during the first Sunday, after Union occupation. Actually much of the description is very nicely done.I would like to see Mr. Lankford write more books on the civil war era, but hope he would be less biased, in his future books.Minnesota Senator Morton Wilkerson stated the only hope for the country was the \\"death of the President and a new administration\\" PP. 205I've read extensively about this, and would wish Mr. Lankford would write a book, on who actually pulled the strings behind the Lincoln assassination and cover-up. ( Booth escaped on THE ONLY BRIDGE THAT STANTON did not close, he was a suspect, other northern senators also openly expressed the desire for Lincoln to be shot)Mr. Lankford, you write a book on that topic, I'll be the first to buy a copy."},{"Title":"Richmond Burning: The Last Days of the Confederate Capital","review":"Nelson Lankford has constructed one of the finest books on the final stages of the war in Virginia/Richmond. This is not a historical account this is an adventure. I read this like a great mystery novel, not having any idea what comes next. His words are astonoshingly well crafted and he takes pain staking ease to sew in the relevent historical data to teach you a lesson.The best part of the book is the quotes. Most of them come from civilian actors in the Richmond drama. I've read many books on the war and I hold a Bachelors degree in history, soon to being graduate work on my Masters and I could care less what soldiers and officers and politicians have to say about the war. I get a good enough idea about battlefield situations from narratives by McPherson and Foote. This is a wonderful effort about the civilian consequences surrounding the overtaking of a city.Like I said, this is an adventure. Yes, the Union won the war. But this book keeps you on such pins and needles that you don't know how it's going to end. Every others sentence for the first few chapters is about the approaching Union army. It just made the hairs stand up on the back of my neck like watching a well constructed scene from Hitchcock.The historical data is pertinent and on point. There are no useless random facts in here like how many horses jumped the fence in front of the stone wall before the defending general had his crouching ranks stand up and fire. Everything in here is important, but not too much to handle. The blend of narrative and historical data is 100% balanced out to give you a satisfying read. Even if you can't stand history, you read this and forget it's about history because it isn't a battle retelling.This is one of the finest books about the history of the Civil War I have read since James McPherson's &quot;Battle Cry of Freedom.&quot; Is it worth the money? You bet. Is it worth a second and third read? You bet. Is it worth recommending to your freidns after you read it so they can know what really happened and how? You bet. Most importantly, is it essential for everyone's understanding about history, some of the most important history our nation has ever seen, the most pivotal of events in the most pivotal of times in our nations history? You better believe it.Mr. Lankford and &quot;Richmond Burning&quot; receive my highest recommendation."},{"Title":"Richmond Burning: The Last Days of the Confederate Capital","review":"It is hard to see how this book could be improved upon.

If a reader is looking for a general historical overview of the civil war, then I would say this book is not for you, but I don't think the author was trying to lead people to believe that this was was THAT book either. This was a refreshing read on a topic (the civil war) that I've read many times over. Unlike other books that focused on the major players and the various battles of the civil war, this book focused (exactly as the title suggests) on Richmond Va and about a months time right before during and right after the end of the civil war.I found it an easy read and anyone interested in the history of this city but not the civil war will likely enjoy this book.For those of us wanted more and more of Robt.

Not only are the feelings of the citizens recorded but those of the Confederate government and Robert E. Lee. It seems that in spite of the Confederacy eroding quickly across the national front with Sherman entering North Carolina, Jefferson Davis and the population of Richmond were in shock when the capitol actually fell. Robert E. Lee's miraculous victories of the past and some of his mixed communications continue to give the Confederate citizens of Richmond a forlorn hope that Lee would be victorious. Even after the evacuation and crushing loss of 1/10th of Richmond to fire including the loss of 90% of the business district, Richmond citizens still believed Lee was capable of a counter attack up to the point of the news of Appomattox. Exciting prologue to the epic moment of the final retreat of the Confederate military, the destruction of bridges and the ultimate controversial firing of the tobacco warehouses. The latter seemed so unnecessary and out of touch with reality. Ironically, the Tredegar Iron Works survive completely and they are a tour stop in Richmond today. Lankford discusses the effects on the population including those with Union sympathies and even those that were spies and underground supporters. Some of the Union supporters were imprisoned during the war and others such as Elizabeth Van Lew assisted in funneling escaped Union prisoners home including the body of Union Captain Eric Dahlgren who led a controversial raid on Richmond. Lankford covers the harsh economic effects the war had on the citizens of Richmond, the effects of union occupation, the generals responsible for order in Richmond (Weitzel, Ord and even Henry Halleck), Lincoln's fascinating trip up the dangerous James and arrival in Richmond, the attempt by former Confederate cabinet member John Campbell to reopen the Virginia legislature with Lincoln's blessing, the effect of the assassination on Union and Confederate relations and the new but strained relations between white southerners and the emancipated African Americans. Lankford touches the fascinating birth of the lost cause sentiments of the south and the issue of race relations at that time and it's portending for the future. Lankford's research is rich in discovery as he writes of some of the most famous stories that became legends but either were untruths or misinterpretations. LaSalle Pickett wrote of Lincoln coming to personally visit the home of George Pickett (totally false along with most of her recollections) and the perception that Robert E. Lee accepted black freedmen as equal by kneeling next to a black man in church. Was he showing the white public to accept the man as an equal or to show fellow white southerners to co-exist by ignoring his existence and carry on in spite of his presence? A very economically written book that is easy to read, integrating quotes and facts while moving the story along. Lots of information on Richmond that usually was not detailed after Appomattox covering the impact of its downfall on the citizens and the struggle of the Union to deal with the citizens fairly yet firmly."},{"Title":"Richmond Burning: The Last Days of the Confederate Capital","review":"I make it a practice to avoid most Civil War narratives like the plague; those that are half-way literate usually are so larded with...glosses that my gag reflex kicks in.Richmond Burning, on the other hand, should lift historian Nelson Lankrford into the top ranks of American narrative non-fiction writers. Lankford is such a great wordsmith that you can actually smell the clouds of smoke and despair rising over the Confederate capital in those final days. And unlike the top rank of popular history writers who always seem to be on public television, Lankford clearly does his own research and is in command of a trove of new information and insights.Lankford's book is the one I'm giving for Christmas presents to friends and relatives, all descendants---like me---from resolute Union soldiers for whom Richmond Burning marked an event that definies us as a nation even today.James SrodesWashington, DC"},{"Title":"Richmond Burning: The Last Days of the Confederate Capital","review":"Nelson Lankford knows that history is about storytelling. He does a superb job of bringing to life the men and women who lived through the tumult of Richmond's abandonment by the Confederate army and government and its fall to the Union army in the first few days of April, 1865. If you have not read anything about the demise of the Confederacy you must read this book. If you are an avid reader of books on the Civil War, you certainly must read this book. If you are not that interested in Civil War history, but are genuinely curious about Americans of the Victorian era, well, then, read this book. Mr. Lankford has presented us with a major contribution to our understanding of not only how the capital of the Confederacy crumbled, but why it happened the way it did."},{"Title":"Richmond Burning: The Last Days of the Confederate Capital","review":"A fast-paced read, that, excuse me for using it, fulfills that trite phrase of \\"reads like a novel\\" which many writers seek to achieve. That said, the author is a responsible writer in that the book includes both footnotes and an extensive bibliography.There are some drawbacks that I would like to piont out--Mr. Lankford breezes through the events of Five Forks, providing bare-bones detail, despite the fact that what happened there sealed the fate of Richmond. Now, I know Five Forks isn't IN Richmond, so he must limit his time to peripheral places but the drama that unfolded there needed to be expanded greatly since this book obviously strives for literarcy as well as historical merit. Including a detailed treatment of Five Forks would only add to the reader's appreciation of the direct cause of Richmond's fall. Conversely, he wastes far too much time on the failed Campbell iniative that amounted to nothing. Also, one must question his interpretation of certain sources. He quotes from a Southern officer who wrote over the loss of many of his men at Sayler's Creek, the officer states that his emotions mingled \\"pride with with grief\\" and cites such sentiments as the basis of future long-standing enmity towards Notherners. No such sentiments are expressed in the quote though, just something akin to fatherly pride mingled with great sadness over the loss of lives he held dear.Beyond that, I don't feel that he treats Robert E. Lee fairly, especially when he calls him \\"delusional\\" for a message he dispatched that harbored some optimism over being able to continue the fight after Richmond. Mr. Lankford is practicing hindsight bias here. By this criteria, the last months of the war were all \\"delusional\\" for Lee as we can clearly see, with our wonderful 21st century eyes, that the South had no hope of winning and could thus question why he simply didn't surrender following Lincoln's 1864 reelection. First and foremost, General Lee was always a soldier doing his duty and that duty included trying to struggle on as best he could, providing some optimism when possible, against mountains of adversity.Despite all this, this book is well-wroth reading and is a good companion to the various books on Appomattox."},{"Title":"Richmond Burning: The Last Days of the Confederate Capital","review":"This is a very niche book for the experienced civil war buff. A startling, and riveting account of the last days of Richmond as the confederacy collapsed around the citizens. Now we must remmemebr these poeple had been under siege but untill these last days many were living in a dzae, somehow hopeing to god that the war would not come to their city on the hill in their beloved Virginia. We must remmember that much fighting had been closer to Peterburg. This book gives a blow by blow account of the many people cought up in this great conflageration.As has been noted this book is slightly biased and portrays the North as the liberators coming to subdue the viscious south, which had to be crushed into repenting for the sins of slavery. Probably this is the only negative aspect of the book."},{"Title":"Richmond Burning: The Last Days of the Confederate Capital","review":"I did not read this book as a Civil War buff, but from an interest in the city of Richmond, Virginia. In the first 50 pages or so I struggled with Lankford's frustrating insistence on inserting seldom used words. Some were in my dictionary and I learned a new word or two....However, after that point none of the strange/unusual words showed up anymore, Lankford settling down to recounting a story of the end of the Civil War as it occured in Richmond, through the use of extemely well researched information that is laid out in timeline fashion, in a matter of fact manner. One gets the viewpoints from the Yankees and the Rebels alike. Was interesting and scholarly..."},{"Title":"Richmond Burning: The Last Days of the Confederate Capital","review":"Books that rely mostly upon miscellaneous snippets of conversations and diary entries while providing only minimal context and understanding to explain an historical event, are invariably inadequate and even frustrating. The author, apparently a modern day resident of Richmond, VA, seems compelled to describe the fall of Richmond, the capital of the Confederacy, and a subsequent day-long fire, occurring in about a two-week period from the end of March to April 15 of 1865, in such a manner.Because it is elites whose actions and thoughts were usually recorded in historical times, it is the movements and views of such individuals as Jefferson Davis, the Confederacy's president, various officials of the VA and Richmond governments, the military officers of both the North and South, and of some national figures such as Lincoln and Stanton that occupy most of the book. And then there are also the \\"man on the street\\" contributions. The evacuation of Richmond was only a matter of time as Union forces had it and nearby cities virtually surrounded and paralyzed by the Spring of 1865. The breakthrough of Grant at Petersburg, VA necessitated an order on Sunday, April 2, from Lee to evacuate Richmond and with it came the directive to burn the bridges crossing the James River below Richmond and all tobacco warehouses. At this point the story gets very disconnected and confusing.The scrambling of various parties in Richmond to evacuate or otherwise deal with the coming of Union forces is covered in a scattershot manner. Despite a few maps of the area being provided, it is virtually impossible to fully grasp who is moving in what direction, in what sequence, and to what final effect. The motivation for burning the tobacco warehouses remains mostly a mystery. Surely, the threat of fire in a wooden-built city would have raised huge alarms. The author never discusses the ramifications to the people of Richmond of the fire that burned the central business district and, as well, many residences. What were the actual mechanisms for coping short-term and long?The author provides some insight into future social divisions in the South in the contrasting reactions to the arrival of Union troops: Union sympathizers and now-freed blacks could not contain their joy while whites favoring secession looked on morosely. The visit of Lincoln, no more than a day-and-a-half after the evacuation, is interesting largely from the standpoint of how little concern he showed for his own safety, traveling up the mine-laden James River and immersing himself in crowds in Richmond. The half-baked scheme where a former US Supreme Ct justice, John Campbell, and now soon-to-be ex-Confederate official, prevailed upon Lincoln to permit the reassembling of the VA State legislature to bypass the unionist legislature was a short-lived initiative completely short-circuited by the surrender at Appomattox.The odds and ends of an historical event are of interest, but those alone are insufficient. One suspects there are far better books on the role of Richmond in the Confederacy that provide context for the fall of the Confederacy including what happened in Richmond."},{"Title":"Embracing the Stranger: Intermarriage and the Future of the American Jewish Community","review":"This book takes an honest look at the growing number of intermarriages between Jews and non-Jews in America today, and what the Jewish community should be doing about it. Neither judgemental nor preachy, it is a cross between personal journal and anthropology, with the author giving her own thoughts along with the statistics. Also included are numerous interviews with Jews, intermarried and not, about their personal experiences.I found the chapter &quot;That's Entertainment&quot; -- about images of Jews in the media -- to be useful as &quot;back up&quot; for what I've been saying for years: You rarely, if ever, see a happily married Jewish family portrayed on TV or in the movies. It's as if Hollywood thinks that nobody will be interested in a story about two Jews married to each other. (Imagine if they showed only black-white marriages on TV -- there's be an outcry from both sides!) The author traces the various portrayals of Jews in the movies and TV, and warns that these are the images which American Jewish youth are taking as models for themselves. With no positive portayals of Jewish family life, is it any wonder they marry non-Jews?In the end, however, I found the author's stance to be far too permissive and somewhat pandering to the dominant culture. She does not, for example, see any problem with mixed-marriage couples having a Christmas tree, which she calls &quot;just a decoration.&quot; And her conclusions in the last chapter are essentially Reform Movement, i.e., that intermarraige is here to stay anyway, so we might as well start blurring the lines between Jews and non-Jews in the synagogue rituals, etc. With this, I cannot agree. (And it may well be the reason this book went out of print so quickly.) Still, she did give me a lot to think about. She asks good questons, even if I don't agree with her answers."},{"Title":"Embracing the Stranger: Intermarriage and the Future of the American Jewish Community","review":"The author treats intermarriage as essentially no big deal, and interfaith issues as nearly trivial, though she describes them in great detail.But here's the truth: Only seven percent of Jewish-Jewish marriages end up in divorce (regrettable but true), while a whopping SIXTY PERCENT of Jewish-Christian ones do. Author Jaffe-Gill herself has now divorced two Christian husbands, one after the other -- does this sound like a recommendation?"},{"Title":"Natacha Merritt Digital Diaries","review":"Lots of supposedly spontaneous pictures of a naked woman and her sidekicks. Not really a digital diary, but a collection of self consciously off the wall comments and photos. Pretty much like you would see in any 'hip' contemporary magazine. And about as artificial. Totally lacking context. There is no substantive autobiographical sketch, no pictures of Natachas's neighborhood. Could have had something here. I wouldn't mind reading the authors memoir if she could be bothered to write something meaningful. On the plus side, she is pretty cute and you do get to see her naked."},{"Title":"Natacha Merritt Digital Diaries","review":"Digital Diaries is a collection of photographs of the author and her friends (and hired models) in erotic and sexual situations. I give the book five stars because the book also projects (at least to me and some of my friends) a great deal of beauty and heart centered love. This is the most beautiful erotic book I have ever seen. I'm sure some will consider this book disgusting and pornographic, but I frankly think those people are not very accepting of their own body and its sexuality."},{"Title":"Natacha Merritt Digital Diaries","review":"This book is like several that I've seen recently that are trying to portray real life in a new way. It seems this has been part of photography's goal all along. But there have been many stages. At first, just taking a photograph made it show reality. Now, Looking at those first photographs through a 21st century perspective, we would say that they don't depict reality very well. I mean, how often do you stand completely stiff and stare in one direction and make no facial expressions? So photography moved into a more expressionistic form, which has led to many movements, and led to air brushing, and symbolic representation of emotion. Now, we have Digital Diaries. I think this book embraces the &quot;low tech&quot; image because that is what we now see as real. I realize there is irony is that statement, since Natacha uses only the most advanced cameras. But the result is often pixelized, and a bit washed-out, and very raw looking. Her compositions are haphazard, and spontaneous. The average person is used to seeing themselves on low-tech video screens in the store, on their own cameras, etc. in this exact way. So Natacha's aesthetic touches real life. It shows her sexual exploits and adventures in the way we see ourselves. We don't wonder how she does it, because we could do it too. But she did it. I know this is a movement that had begun already, but I have to say it's the first time I've seen it such a stomach-turning erotic fashion. I also recommend &quot;My Wife&quot; by Petter Hegre, which is a different spin on seeing real life in a new way through photography."},{"Title":"Natacha Merritt Digital Diaries","review":"Benedikt Taschen, in all his wisdom, knew a book of a reasonably attractive 22 year old woman engaged in sexual acts with other women, herself, and men would sell. Why not package it a a grand treatise of sex in the age of the internet, bind it in a pretty cover, and charge 29 bucks and call it art? While the pictures are quite sexy, the book has the shelf life of this month's Penthouse. The content is equally as interesting. It's not art, just well packaged and well laid out porn. Save your cash, check out the web site."},{"Title":"Natacha Merritt Digital Diaries","review":"sorry natscha, it takes more than taking your clothes off and a few &quot;encounters&quot; for your book to be considered &quot;art&quot;...this book could be called &quot;sex&quot; for the y2k generation; but there was a reasoning behind madonna's erotic tome.' madonna wanted men and women to feel more confortable about their sexuality, she was thumbing her nose at the contradictions america had regarding sexual mores...preaching monogamy, yet secretly envying the swinger; women are taught to be pure and chaste, while men are supposed to be sexually agressive, racking up as many conquests as possible....ms. merritt does nothing new conceptually that any other photographer hasn't done...it would have been nice if we knew about her life outside sex(if she actually has one) but she reveals little...madonna's no looker, but it's her aura, personality and intelligence that makes her desirable...natascha is the kind of girl you'd want to fool around with, but if you wanted something meaningful, forget it. she doesn't have enought substance. this book will probably sell because it is about sex. but then again, if movies like showgirls and striptease can bomb at the box office,what makes anyone think this self indulgent paperweight is worth the money?...save yourself about 20 bucks and rent some pornos instead"},{"Title":"Natacha Merritt Digital Diaries","review":"I found Natacha Merritt's work to be wonderful. There is a care-free, natural aspect to her work that kept my attention throughout. Aside from being quite attractive, her work is daring and courageous. At only 21, I hope she publishes more of her work soon."},{"Title":"Natacha Merritt Digital Diaries","review":"This had all the ingredients of a brilliant showcase of something new and exciting: a 21 year old familiar with only the latest in photographic technology, not building on the base of knowledge that almost every other well known photographer has been exposed to. A rawness evident in edgy and pixelated photos primarily sexual in content. Unfortunately, five pages in one realizes that they've purchased a rather expensive copy of Penthouse. Save for one or two truly good pictures, these are uninteresting photos of a very pretty naked girl having sex. Total letdown. Kudos to the design of the book, though!"},{"Title":"Natacha Merritt Digital Diaries","review":"I am a huge fan of erotic and expressive photography. What made this book good is the personal expression of Natacha Merritt. She gives us all a look of how she truly views her world. Photos with psychology is the easiest way to describe her art. Her photos are \\"at a whim\\" shots, a way of saving a moment like we all have when we see or do something and say to ourselves \\"I wish there was a way to save what I am seeing right now forever.\\" The grainy and dated photos at the beginning of her book give you this \\"photo of my memory\\" feel. Digital Diaries is also an important and inspirational book for today and our digitally photographed world filled with blogs and profile websites."},{"Title":"Natacha Merritt Digital Diaries","review":"I think it's particularly impressive for a woman as young as she is that she seems to have embraced her own sexuality and used it for herself, to please herself, and to become well known and respected. Through her work comes a self-awareness and thoughtfulness I find very impressive. And I think it effectively challenges the frequently cited mantra about women inescapably being sexual victims and particularly refutes Dvorkin's claims that all sexually explicit imagery is inherently abusive to women. It's clear that, even at 21, Ms. Merritt is in charge and controls each situation and the men she photographs are props for her, rather than the other way around."},{"Title":"Natacha Merritt Digital Diaries","review":"Natacha Merritt unfortunately relied on two assumptions to carry this book: 1. That using a digital camera would make her pornography more relevant to the computer generation, and 2. That her self-absorbed preoccupation with her body would hold people's attention for 160 pages. She was wrong on both accounts. Digital pornography is no more appealing than analog pornography, and no one can look at Ms. Merritt's body for more than fifteen pages max without becoming bored speechless. The end result of Ms. Merritt's efforts is a lame and pretentious collection of photographs that only her mother would be interested in. After skimming the first few pages, the novelty of having someone's \\"digital diary\\" in your hands will have lost its appeal, and you'll have wished that you had spent your (...) elsewhere."},{"Title":"Natacha Merritt Digital Diaries","review":"As a photographic enthusiast, I'm not expert enough to expound on all the ramifications of Ms. Merritt's work. All I can offer is my opinion as a human being, as a man, and as someone who likes a wide variety of photography.The images in this book spoke to me. I found them startling and refreshing, much like when I hear a song that forces me to call the DJ and ask, \\"Who is that?\\". I like photo work that balances the posed and the spontaneous; the raw and the refined; the erotic and the intellectual. And because Ms. Merritt is not schooled in photography, because she is creating images that already exist in her head and express her individuality and sexuality, I found the photos in \\"Digital Diaries\\" pleasingly honest.Whether it's music, movies, or photography, I appreciate honesty the most. Contrived or calculated works of art may appeal to the brain, but Ms. Merrit's in-your-face photography hits the gut as well as the head. I would've liked to see more photos - with a little more of a range in style and content - but Natacha Merrit boldly pushed some boundaries in this attractive hardcover. I hope she continues to express herself however she sees fit."},{"Title":"Natacha Merritt Digital Diaries","review":"Scanning the other reviews it looks like one either loves or hates the book. And it looks like that is dependent on what the buyer thinks he's getting.Merritt's book is not like anything else. It's not good pornography, nor is it a slick coffee table book. It IS a record of the life and times of an artist done in a new medium. When photographers say that digital photography isn't good enough yet, it begs the question, &quot;Good enough for what?&quot; In this case it's the perfect medium for the purpose. Like the Brownie, then miniature format and Polaroid consumer cameras, hand-held digital cameras are convenient and can lend immediacy to the images. There is no end of immediacy in these pictures.Beyond the obviously digital quality of the photographs themselves, there is the artist's fearlessness, or maybe naivete, in using a medium sure to be scorned by traditional photographers and their followers. Merritt, for pushing the boundaries of photography beyond accepted practice, deserves merit."},{"Title":"Natacha Merritt Digital Diaries","review":"The written parts of this book are pure gibberish, and offer no insight at all into the photographsthe pictures themselves are often pointless, or one thumbnail sized picture on a full page, just weird things like that. There might be 10 good pictures in the whole book.I guess you're supposed to be so blown away at the idea that a girl would take a pic of herself giving a BJ that you're supposed to just say you love the whole book or something, I don't know. 10 seconds on google image search will find you sexier photos than are in this collection, although i admit the lighting and composition in some of them are quite goodOverall, i see it as a waste of time and money. The introduction especially is almost aggressively unhelpful, and seems more an exercise in name dropping than anything else"},{"Title":"Natacha Merritt Digital Diaries","review":"Her visual sensibility of what is erotic and what makes a good image is very on-target. She IS better than Eric Kroll and the like, because she's really shooting sex unpornographically. It's just her, extremely sexy and open-minded to all the possibilities of pleasure, recording simply just that. It is Not just like Penthouse, as some critics here grouse, because it's not picture-perfect. It's beatifully flawed, amateurishly successful, and HOT. She's a nasty young women letting us see her take on what is visually neat and sexy about her sex-life. Me and my wife both like Natacha and her fun she has with her digital sex-recorders, and we do the same sort of thing, we're just not as young and beautiful."},{"Title":"Natacha Merritt Digital Diaries","review":"This book is perhaps more a piece of performance art than anything else. Not only does it confront whoever opens and holds it and looks, but it goes to the tenderest, most volatile part of this culture - sexuality - and compels response. The entries here in Amazon.com are part of the performance art, exhibiting the range of the dominant culture (usually anchored for security in terms from \\"porn\\" to \\"narcissism\\") as well as some of the dissenters and discontents. It plays with the form of \\"photography book\\" just as Bataille's Story of the Eye played with the form of \\"novel\\", with similar effect."},{"Title":"Natacha Merritt Digital Diaries","review":"I am an artist. I was a photography major at first, and graduated with a change in major to printmaking. I have always enjoyed photography. I am somewhat new to erotic photography, so take that into account on my review of this book.I thought some of the images were very fetish. Overall, I very much enjoyed the book. The silver cover is gorgeous. Some of the photographs are really beautiful. I found the work most interesting in concept though. Natacha basically documents her sex life with her camera. But it is more than that to her, she doesn't have sex without her camera, so she has integrated art into her life to the point that they are the same. She stated in the book she won't have sex without the camera, and if the partner is not okay with that, she doesn't do it.I can't tell you in my personal opinion all of the images are beautiful. But I never have seen an artist where I love every single work they did anyway. I think without reading about why she did this and how it came about, I would find it much less interesting. For me this works on many levels. Personal exploration and documentation of her personal life, the act of making one's life \\"art\\", and the psychological aspect of it all. Some of the images are quite beautiful, by the way.If I were shown all the photographs with no text, no background story, I could still appreciate many of them, however, it would seem more like pornography to me. But reading about the artist, and what she is doing, it adds a lot to it, it adds meaning, that would be missed otherwise.If you are offended by erotic art bordering on the pornographic, you may want to skip this one. The images are aggressive. If your mind is more open, and you appreciate the psychology of personal sexual exploration, on a visual art level, I think you will appreciate this.The images themselves are mostly self portrait, taken by the artist with the camera at arm's length. All of the images are printed in color. There is a raw immediacy to many of them. I looked at her website after receiving the book. It is beautifully presented. Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase, and am excited to have found a new artist, to follow her work."},{"Title":"Natacha Merritt Digital Diaries","review":"Add this book to the growing list of \\"Reality\\" shows, books, blogs, and countless other flotsam and jetsam that have entered our lives over the past years.It was curiosity that drew me to this book; and after reading it I still can't quite decide what the point of it was. As a self-promotional tool it's effective, in a similar fashion to Madonna's \\"Sex\\" book, or the plethora of magazines vying for our attention.If I were to place it somewhere it would be between an unselfconscious narcissism and performance art.

It's hard to even judge this in 2006. Readers need to remember that in terms of technology, the world has changed dramatically since Merritt's book was published. Digital photography is not the 'coming thing' anymore; it defines modern photography. Risque, overtly sexual photography captured in the coarse, low-res digital formats of five years ago was intriguing at the time. Now, it just looks like a bad (or actually quite good) amateur porn site. One must credit Natacha Merritt for creating something that, at the time, was very provocative. However, the rest of the world caught up to her very quickly, and what was radical and provocative in 2000 now makes her look like the William Gibson of the art world."},{"Title":"Natacha Merritt Digital Diaries","review":"Yes it's art...and porn too (I think), but the photography really isn't all that great.

It benefits from a second or third run-through, in which, I think, one is more inclined to accept it on its own terms.True, a sense of the juvenile can enter the game at times--after a while, many photos do suggest adolescents playing naughty for a camera--but even with that there is real merit to the compositional quality of many of the shots...shots awry, perhaps, when compared to conventional expectations of photographic composition, but shots that seldom seem disheveled. This sense of unorthodox, off-kiltered composition is of course itself a calculation...meant to read as &quot;spontaneity,&quot; perhaps, or suggest verisimilitude to &quot;real life.&quot; But it's a calculation, one feels, that the photographer is aware of, is exploiting in service of a brand of eros...there's little naivete here. After a few readings (of the photos...the accompanying verbal diary/text can get a touch cumbersome), the book begins to obtain an organic quality. It grows on you.It would be interesting to compare/contrast the reactions or male/female readers to this text.Finally, as a postscript...I would concur with the reader who suggests that should Mr. Ed Asner, whilst a fine actor, ever consider similarly revelatory behavior/enterprise, he'd be best served by adopting a somewhat different artistic format for its expression."},{"Title":"Natacha Merritt Digital Diaries","review":"I have seen my share of erotic photography books, and this one did nothing for me for the most part.

She admits that the pictues are posed so they often don't represent any sort of reality. And about 30% of them aren't even of her, but a of look-a-like!Further, the photos are not of good quality. They were taken with a digital camera so what? That doesn't automatically make them salient to the present day or any more fitting than if they were taken with a film camera. In fact, a film camera using black and white would have probably yielded more emotionally raw pictures even when given the same content.The bottom line is that there is very little cohesiveness to this book. I can't help but wonder what the author learned if anything.

And nobody of those who did not unterstand or could not follow this line of argumentation had any reason to despair: they could well be sure that Sorbonnism had left them another realm - the dark empire of moralism where spoilsports of all kinds could congregate and chatter about the decline of values. You call it porn - and you remain silent, whatever you say. We talk on endlessly until what seems clear and lucid has become blurred. But name it and you have defined yourself back into darkness, where you find space enough to roam. Hell is just the place where those who once told you that hell was out of place will locate you - today, in our enlightened world. OK - it may be much easier. Baudrillard or Bataille or any one of those in the wake of Freud opened the loophole for us intelligent people who have as much fun as the majority &quot;down there&quot; watching people copulate or masturbate. But instead of admitting that there is basically not much to talk about, they increase their output of words in order not to lose the power to set up definitions and to re-instrumentalize moralism. There is a lot of traffic through Baudrillard's loophole - today. The book sells well. There are not many words in it, which might indicate that it points towards authenticity. But we have had a lot of philosophy recently. Now, who is still so unimaginative to call porn porn? And stupid enough not to see the loophole?"},{"Title":"Natacha Merritt Digital Diaries","review":"I read an article about this book. I thumbed through the book in a bookstore and I was fairly much disappointed. It's basically hardcore pornography. There isn't anything really innovative or thoughtful about this collection of photos.Alot of it seems fake. The author looked through porno and simply copied it. There's S&amp;M pictures. There's voyeuristic photos. It runs the gamut of porno/erotic type pictures.Ok, you see erect penises. Ok, you see the author or someone else fellating a big erect penis.Just exploitative masturbatory material. It's not art however. Makes you wonder why years ago, they attacked Robert Mapplethorpe and his &quot;erotic&quot; pictures and now you have books like Digital Diaries which is solely created to cash in on the &quot;Internet&quot; revolution by simply using digital camcorders to snap porn. Big deal.Get the book when it's in the 80% off bin. As porn goes, it's not bad. But then again, how does one know it's not fake? I read reviews regarding the &quot;Nude Pixs of my ex-girlfriend&quot; which also got some press and you realize it's all &quot;Blair Witch&quot; fakery.Kind of sad when you think about it. It's all a cynical scam."},{"Title":"Natacha Merritt Digital Diaries","review":"This review quote from Weekly Wire, really sums this book up:\\"Her book proposal to art house publisher Taschen must have read something like, \\"Okay, like, here's the thing: I take digital pictures of myself masturbating and having sex with a lot of really hot, emaciated model types. I'm so daring and out there. Hope you guys like my pictures a bunch!\\"\\" (full review here: [...]Lots of guys who like this book for the hard-on it gives them will strike faux-intellectual positions, insisting that the vapid self-absorption of a cute 21-year old taking pictures of her own perky breasts and shaved vagina is courageous and groundbreaking.This book poses as a contribution to discourse on female sexuality but it is the opposite, reinforcing the oppressively narrow \\"teen-sluts hot 4U\\" tedium of most current sexual representation.My advice: if you want sexy intelligence spend your money on a subscription to On Our Backs or Nan Goldin's work , and leave this junk in the recycling bin where it belongs."},{"Title":"Natacha Merritt Digital Diaries","review":"Essentially, it's just another Taschen photobook - lots of soft porn with a veneer of high art about it. It's not at all a 'diary', or particularly candid or real, as the author admits that the photographs are posed (with the encouragement of Eric Kroll), and that they do not portray actual situations. There's lots of dated-sounding text that breathlessly uses words such as 'downloading' and 'logging-in', as if they were extraordinarily cool, and although it's not quite as bad as anything by David Hamilton, it's essentially a glorified 'Penthouse' shoot, or an Eric Kroll book but with a digital camera. As for the digital nature of the photographs, so what? A camera's a camera."},{"Title":"Natacha Merritt Digital Diaries","review":"Okay... I don't know that the book deserves to be totallytrashed. I find that despite the amateur nature of the photography itis after-all digital, and to publish digital photos... that twistdeserves recognition.

She isattractive enough to sustain initial interest, but the total packageof looks, eye, props, scenarios and text are not enough to sustain myfascination.

All the photos were made with digital cameras, and were taked to real people having sex in all the forms. Some photos are really amazing, having an extraordinary impact in the eye of the reader. There are not moralism here, not reasons, the book is full of bodies in all the forms, all beauty, all exciting. This book have the power of a masterpiece of the real life."},{"Title":"Natacha Merritt Digital Diaries","review":"The images in this book are highly explicit. What's amazing though is that they are boring and unexciting. If you're considering this book because you think you'll be excited by the explicit photos, you'll be very disappointed. Even the lingerie section of the JC Penny catalog is much more exciting, and it's free. If you're considering this book because you're interested in cuting edge photography, you'll be even more disappointed, as the images show an almost complete lack of talent."},{"Title":"Natacha Merritt Digital Diaries","review":"Natacha Merritt's \\"Digital Diaries\\" is a one-dimensional tour de force, made possible by the following truism: Sex Sells. Where there is attention to detail and photographic aesthetics in the sexually driven works of other more competent photographers, such as Robert Mapplethorpe and Nan Goldin, Merritt's attention is only focused on naked people copulating and/or masturbating. \\"Digital Diaries\\" was published with the sole intent of selling sex, not photography. This is obvious. This is also (and only) why curious viewers will buy the book. The author and her acquaintances are interesting only because their clothes are off. Unlike Nan Goldin's book, \\"The Ballad of Sexual Dependency\\", we don't care or think about the people portrayed in \\"Digital Diaries\\"; we simply look at them. Therein lies Merritt's lack of depth as a photographer and visual storyteller. Not only obsessed with the need to get her point across visually, \\"Digital Diaries\\" also includes musings by the author about...what else, sex. By the end of \\"Digital Diaries\\" one can only hope twenty-two year old Merritt outgrows this teenage fascination with sex and self-absorption and finds another hobby."},{"Title":"Natacha Merritt Digital Diaries","review":"It's unfair and ridiculous to brand this book as a youth culture failure. I can think of quite a few older phtographers who get a lot more silly and self-indulgent than Merritt. On the other hand, it's not a success. Introduced to this book in the pages of &quot;Erotica&quot; magazine (which featured the Eric Kroll interview reprinted in this collection), I was very attracted to the intimacy of the photography and what seemed like a candid atmosphere. It isn't quite that. In fact, while it purports to be a journalistic account of her sex life, much of the photography is centered on her face. And while I admit she has a fine face, and it's everyone's right to take a lot of pictures of themselves, this gets old after a few dozen shots. When her male lovers do appear it is usually in the form of a strangely disembodied sex organ, often wrapped in rope. Unlike a lot of other erotic photography, this is neither a catalogue of fetishes nor a celebration of the human body. There's certainly some beauty within these pages, and some very erotic photographs, but there's a lot of &quot;filler&quot; as far as I'm concerned: not terribly arousing but not all that artistic, either. I certainly don't discount her work, I think the digital photography medium can exist without fighting for legitmacy, but she's got some work to do. The text in particular doesn't seem all that honest or revealing, and I figure if you're going to take it this far you might as well go all the way. There's an ugly growing trend of false self-disclosure in our society right now (&quot;reality&quot; TV, JennyCam, etc.) and while I wouldn't fault Merritt she is veering dangerously in that direction. The book doesn't live up to its name, but it has some bright points. I could've lived with the highlights in my magazine, though I'm looking forward to seeing some future work by Merritt."},{"Title":"Natacha Merritt Digital Diaries","review":"Though it'd be easy to lump Natacha Merritt with the rest of the webcam/internet exhibitionists, it took only one examination of this book to make me see otherwise in Merritt's digital photography.With a maverick's audacity and technical disregard (one interviewer made the humorous remark that Merritt &quot;can't tell an f-stop from a bus stop&quot;), Merritt has somehow managed to discover a visual style all her own that fuses strange angles, simple lighting, unusual placement of her subjects, and introspection into one. The more explicit photos oftimes threaten to de-humanize Merritt herself and her subjects, but those are counterbalanced by some very tasteful, evocative shots that convey the subjects' internal drama.Merritt makes a better subject than any other person in this book for her own camera. It doesn't hurt that she's gorgeous, but she has two things to her advantage: Expressive eyes, and the unique dynamic of photographer-as-subject. Is she simultaneously empowered and scrutinized by the camera? How often does she know what exactly the image looks like? And which photos are staged? Which ones are taken as a fly-on-the-wall snapshot? Merritt is always interesting as her own subject, and it is telling that the best set of pictures in this book, the &quot;self search&quot; series, focus much less on sexual acts than on self-discovery, examination, and Merritt's relationship to the camera and to her own body. Most of these are close-ups from wildly imaginative angles, shadowy, and intriguing -- the crowning picture is Merritt looking at her own hand in a mirror, contemplating. These pictures tell many stories about the young woman both in front of and behind the camera, and they're beautiful and revealing in a way far beyond the sexually explicit pictures. Most of those do manage to achieve a degree of honesty and spontaneity as well, making them erotically charged.Accusations of narcissism can't be avoided and Merritt can probably be said to be guilty of it sometimes. But what she produces from her unique work methods is so intriguing, and her revelation of herself as photographer (a rarity in photography) so far-reaching, that this book remains a great fascination. It'd be a shame if it were to be lumped with the usual erotic photography and exhibitionistic endeavours. Digital Diaries has much more to offer."},{"Title":"Natacha Merritt Digital Diaries","review":"Natacha Merritt's Digital Diaries is less an art book of nude photos than a raw and honest look --- some would say peek --- into a young woman's sexuality. It is not just a look, but a visual documentation of sexual experimentation including both a casual sexual situations and more fetishist imagery.Digital Diaries is also very sexy just like its author-photographer. Natacha doesn't convey a shy personality, but actually comes off as a very liberated and aggressive young woman. Her book is not for everyone and certainly not for someone who doesn't have an open mind. Those who are willing to explore the many faces of sexuality, they can't go wrong by acquiring Ms. Merritt's Digital Diaries."},{"Title":"Natacha Merritt Digital Diaries","review":"If you can prevent yourself from over-analysing this work, as so many critics do, you will hopefully see it, and accept it, for what it is. Obviously, you can take or leave the text; if you want a novel, you will buy one - not a book full of explicit photography. The photos themselves are wonderful. They are just SO REAL! I actually felt that I was present at these scenes; as though I was actually looking through the lens, or even just my own eyes. The flesh is so real and warm-looking. The pictures emanate sex and flesh and fun in the most exquisite proportions. They made me smile with understanding. This work is life, not art. Treat it as such."},{"Title":"Natacha Merritt Digital Diaries","review":"DIGITAL DIARIES suffers from the kind of directionless most people in their twenties feel (of any generation, not just the Boomers or Gen-Xers or whatever they're called these days) and as such seems to reflect the only world Ms. Merritt truly knows: the world she sees reflected in her mirror. To be sure, she has a few exhibitionistic friends along for the ride, but the images Ms. Merritt has captured rarely transcend the merely salacious, and seem, in the final result, just indulgent. Images such as those contained in DIGITAL DIARIES can be found in almost any trendy magazine (adult and otherwise)at any newsstand and, as such, they seem rather uninspired. (Consider how Madonna's book SEX still, in some ways, shocks, perhaps now that Madonna Louise is a mother.) Moreover, DIGITAL DIARIES makes one wonder just what is being &quot;communicated&quot; in this &quot;diary&quot;, what is actually revealed about the author. It has no narrative thread (perhaps one is not possible) and that may not even be a fault. But I think it all comes down to whether the reader has an interest in a very attractive young woman's adventures in photographing herself mostly in the bathroom. Truth must be said, though, that many photographs are quite artfully done. But in the final analysis, DIGITAL DIARIES is but another document stemming from the narcissism of the 1990s. (Then, too, I also wonder what kind of book DIGITAL DIARIES would be if Natacha Merritt looked, instead, like Ed Asner. I don't think many of us would want to spend $30 looking at photos of Ed Asner in the tub.)"},{"Title":"Natacha Merritt Digital Diaries","review":"Natacha Merritt has gained a fair amount of notice for this collection of photos. The attention is well deserved, as she is clearly one of the first truly &quot;native&quot; digital photographers to emerge. Her images care nothing, really, for the traditional light/focus/depth of field of film photography, but just exist to capture a moment in time and the quick feelings of the subject. That her photos are explicit sexual images is almost secondary to her emergence as a unique artist. However, the raw power of many of the potraits also provides a thrill to the viewer. The images are very strong, and this is a book for only those that appreciate the craft of digital photography tightly coupled with raw and unposed images of sexuality."},{"Title":"Natacha Merritt Digital Diaries","review":"Certainly not for everyone. This book WILL offend...and that's got to be part of what Natacha Merritt was going for. A better question is not &quot;why was she compelled to document her sex life in a book?&quot; but rather &quot;why are people upset about it?&quot; That's the question no one wants to really answer, the deeper, more challenging debate that's sure to crop up whenever a work like this is published. Any art that forces the audience to think about themselves has some kind of merit, and the raw handheld photographic style lends an intimacy--certainly no studio sheen here--that is altogether appropriate for the material. If you are to look at this book, be warned that not only will you be looking at Merritt; you'll be looking at yourself--your own attitudes towards sex. May you be fortunate enough to like, or at least accept, whatever it is that you see. If you hate books like this, I submit that you may be afraid of the possibilities in the mirror they present."},{"Title":"Natacha Merritt Digital Diaries","review":"This is a book created entirely of pictures of the author having sex with various men and women or posing nude for her camera. Many of the images remind me of pictures I have painted and photos I have taken. She says in her book that she lets her photographic projects dictate her sex life. According to my calculation of dates in the book she started this at 15 in San Francisco and is now about 22 and lives in New York. One of the oddest things she has done is find a model in NYC who looks so much like her that she says she can't tell the images of the two of them apart except when they are both in the shot. This made me realize how much this book is about the process of taking the images and the direct feedback of the digital process. If artistic exhibitionism is of interest to you, either as a viewer or as an image maker, this book is great. The &quot;look inside this book&quot; images give a good idea of the book's style."},{"Title":"Natacha Merritt Digital Diaries","review":"Newton, Mapplethorpe, Outterbridge, Man Ray, Brassai, Brandt, Weston, Stieglitz.....It was all porn, right?I am a big fan of the publisher (for putting out edgy and thought provoking material) and the general style/commentary.I have had an interest in this book ever since I read a story on how it was made. it was a creation of the publisher more than the artist. Girl meets digital camera, takes pictures, find mode of expression, artists admire, work evolves, publisher hears about it and prints it. Anyone who is any sort of photographer would agree that the images in the first portion of the book are essentially ...[fluff]. But the expression is honest and raw. What more could you ask for?If you have a problem with Porn, don't buy the book. If you want Porn, it would be a waste of money to buy the book. If you have a problem with genitalia, don't even look at it. If you want an honest, raw, and different view of human sexuality though someone else's eyes, this is the book for you.

Her medium is digital photography. Her subject matter - the most intimate details of her daily life, especially her erotic life. Natacha currently lives and works in New York City though she was raised in San Francisco. Though she grew up near Silicon Valley she did not show a career inclination for computer science, but instead migrated towards the study of law. She eventually moved to Paris to attend law school, but shockingly, abandoned her studies after only three months to devote herself to her newfound passion: digital photography. She started to shoot models and later, turned the camera on herself. More poignantly, she started to document her life diary-like with her camera. The deeper she probed the depths of her sexual psyche the more she revealed of herself ... and the more exciting it became. Her artistic vision is now so thoroughly intertwined with her identity that she claims her sexual needs and her artistic needs are one in the same.Digital Diaries and its accompanying website are the manifestation of her daily documentation. Little sexual dramas of Natacha and her lovers are captured from every conceivable angle. It is worth mentioning that this is not a book about great photography, though many images are mind-blowinly spectacular, but is more about a sexually adventurous and beautiful young woman who dares to share the \\"Kodak moments\\" of her erotic explorations."},{"Title":"Natacha Merritt Digital Diaries","review":"Poor photographic tecnics, but some naiveness in the pics create a beautiful book!!.

I was at a bookstore and was baffled and shocked at first site. However I'm working on an open-mind excercise so I returned to the book and went slowly page by page back to front. Again I was baffled reading her 'thanks for unconditional love' at the last pages. Is this love ?! no, it isn't - it is lust. Love is not lust. You may feel an intense 'love' in the course of sex because there is, indeed, an intense mental connection as somehow Natacha discribes as love in a passage. She is confusing the means and the goal.The pictures are amateur pictures but they are all different. I'm sure there's more talent out there but she happens to be lucky enough being 'discovered'. It's not porn at all except for a few maybe.A question could be if she has 'a problem'. What have the consequences been so far for her after the publicity of this book. What have the consequences been so far for the models who were involved in her photo projects. What about AIDS. Funny, but no word about AIDS in this book - bothers me.I did some internet research prior to buying the book and I advise you do too.Since she is the one taking the pictures and that it wasn't intended for anything commercial and that her goal was solely self exploration, as she calls it, I decided the book's ok since it is her account of her sex experience where the other person is also an important part of it. The physical sex connection and the continous thrills and mysterious wonders she finds/found in it.

It is their job and thus entirely reasonable to expect them to spend their personal time working the wedding (no - that's what a professional wedding coordinator does) and their personal funds to host parties (showers and bachelorettes are gifts, not entitlements). I was particularly appalled at the section on how to \\"remove\\" a wedding party member. There is in fact no way to do this unless a couple is prepared to end the frienship permanently, because it will.If you're looking for true wedding etiquette, and want to adhere to accepted rules of polite society, then I recommend the excellent works of Judith Martin, aka \\"Miss Manners\\" or Emily Post rather than this tome."},{"Title":"Tesla '84 Proceedings of the Tesla Centennial Symposium: In Light of Modern Physics","review":"With IEEE endorsement, this conference was a classic Tesla technology presentation.

This book is quite unique compared to other titles i was reading at the time inlcuidng To Kill a Mockingbird and The Catcher in the Rye. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is tired of reading about family or reading \\"oprah winfrey\\" books. They are horrible. Pick this one up if you want something different."},{"Title":"The apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz","review":"I like the book and the way it was layed out. The one thing I found most agrevating was that Duddy never learned his lesson. That aspect of the book provides the reader with something different and teaches us that people sometimes dont change and that's just the way things are."},{"Title":"The apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz","review":"Duddy Kravitz grew up on the wrong side of town to most Montrealers. His neighbourhood was poor, but not abject. It had a marvellous immigrant-village life that the writer transmits to us. &quot;The Apprenticeship...&quot; is hilarious and painfully honest as it portrays the 1940s Montreal Jewish community. You will meet them, warts and all. I first read this as a sensitive teen and I was appalled by what a flawed person Duddy finally grew into. The author is a master of dialect and lucid description. His subsequent books have also been funny, but formulaic. Duddy Kravitz is the apotheosis of Mordecai Richler's talent."},{"Title":"The apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz","review":"Sometimes quite hilarious. Good story that takes place in the Jewish sector of Montreal. You have to love Duddy, the kind-heartd rebel."},{"Title":"The apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz","review":"I fell upon this one through one of my English classes. Honestly it's a great book. The protagonist, Duddy, seems as vile as any other villainous character, but one must try to see why he is the way he is. By doing that, the reader can gain an understanding of the major themes within the book; greed & wealth, education, family connections, immigration, and the book particularly is centered around a Jewish community. It's a great piece to sit down and read from cover to cover."},{"Title":"The apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz","review":"Duddy Kravitz is a unique hero. He's an industrious young man searching for land, for wealth, really for his own identity. But in his quest he burns the people closest to him. Though he gains what he wants, he loses what is truly most dearest.The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz is quite simply a classic."},{"Title":"The apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz","review":"I love everything about this novel;it's hilarious,controversial and culturally accurate;I think both the novel and film are excellent-and I can't decide whether I prefer the book or the film.If you only see the movie,you miss out on terrific lines-and insight into Duddy's Uncle Benjy,who I gotta go with as my favorite cultural insight from any novel,\\"There used to be...some dignity in being against the synagogue.With a severe orthodox rabbi there were things to quarrel about.There was some pleasure.But this cream-puff of a synagogue,this religious drugstore,you might as well spend your life being against the Reader's Digest.They've taken all the mystery out of religion\\"(p.126).And gems like this give the character's(particularly in the Kravitz family) a real honest two dimensional character.Without it,the novel is reduced to Duddy's grandfather's motto:\\"A man without land is nothing\\".Obviously,this is not as easy-morally or otherwise-that simple;I wish Richler had writtten a sequel-and I like to think that Virgil,the epileptic he \\"uses\\" and Yvette,who tells Duddy she'sthrough speaking to him,would've come around.Richler-who was criticized as a self-hating Jew-doesn't deserve the label;I love his honesty,accuracy and sense of humor."},{"Title":"The apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz","review":"Duddy is a book about ambition. Each and every one of us wants more... Why else would we be on the internet looking for books to buy? This book is required reading as it serves to remind us that sometimes wanting more can be less. Duddy is driven by the advice of his grandfather that \\"a man without land is nothing.\\" Duddy is a poor child from the slums of Montreal, and misinterprets this advice in search of change. He tries hard to succeed but wants to do so at all costs. Now, Duddy is not evil in any way, but he does not have the ability of seeing the harm that he causes to his friends and loved ones inadvertently with his actions.This is a sad and beautiful book, and needs to be read by anyone who ever plans on having more than they have today...Thank You Mr. Richler.Relic113"},{"Title":"The apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz","review":"richler's work is, though spiced with ample dose of humour, is a painful portrayal of the ruthless nature of human ambitions. the young jewish,motherless urchin, duddy has only one goal before him, to emulate 'jerry dingleman'-the boywonder of st.urbain, montreal.duddy takes a materialist interpretation of his zeyda's profound words of wisdom, &quot;a man without land is nobody.' this fires duddy, to embark on scheme after scheme, to pursue his goal of possessing a lake and the land surrounding it. for that he is shameless enough to forge the signature of epileptic friend and to crush the love of yvette, the all-giving french-canadian girl friend. duddy doesn't believe in gew-gentile relationship either, after seeing how his doctor-brother was harrassed and hounded by the gentile circle. he is the jewish-avtar of nietzschen neo-man , one who is devoid of feelings like love and shame. duddy hardly bothers about the fate of ladders which he use to climb. unfortunately,for him, the end is important ; not human relationships, outside his family."},{"Title":"The apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz","review":"Duddy Kravitz is a story very very close to Budd Schulberg's earlier work, What Makes Sammy Run?

Not only is it difficult to read, but the language and actions which occur in this book are unreal. I understand that to some sex makes the world go 'round, but did Richler really need to portray a 19 year old sex starved boy in this novel? I only think it gives males ideas.. Many may have enjoyed this novel, but for me, I have read better!"},{"Title":"The apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz","review":"Yes, here we have the classic Bildungsroman, or coming-of-age-story, that constitutes a (ahem, normally) delightful genre of literature. The classic of all English language Bildungsromans (generally conceded) is Joyce's Portait of The Artist As A Young Man where Joyce tells with a passionate, lyrical intensity what it was like for him (under the guise of alter-ego Stephen Dedalus) growing up in Dublin and coming to realise his calling as an artist using, famously, \\"silence, exile and cunning\\" to further that end.There is also more than a bit of the picaresque to this novel, with the madcap rush of Duddy to grab his land by any means possible. But, alas, two things make this novel less than satisfactory or even, in the end, pleasing to read:1) The writing. In contrast to Joyce or Thomas Wolfe or any other number of novelists who sketched their youth in a poetic lyricism that redeems even the protagonist's worst character flaws, Kravitz writes in a terse, hard-bitten prose that is rather off-putting (understatement) and exaggerates rather than casts into relief Kravitz's many small-minded, unfeeling, avaricious flaws.2.) Duddy Kravits himself is IMPOSSIBLE TO LIKE. This might be an advantage for a character in a book like The Brothers Karamazov, where we have several characters interacting throughout the novel, some with rather bad character traits indeed, or in a novel like Donleavy'y The Ginger Man whose ptotagonist's faults are compensated by his humanity and the beautiful writing. But when the character is the raison d'etre for the book without many redeeming qualities at all (I mean, not even \\"bad\\" ones with which one finds one's self sympathising) and the writing, which reminded me of bricklaying, only exacerbates the situation, it's time to hang it up....Period.For any readers who didn't fancy this book but still admire bildungsroman, picaresque anti-hero type of things, I couldn't do better than recommend Irish-American author J.P. Donleavy's Darcy Dancer trilogy.-Now THAT is what good novels of this sort are all about."},{"Title":"The apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz","review":"I read this book twice.Once in high school,where we &quot;dissected&quot; the book as English teachers do with their students, and the second time as a personal read to get more of a feeling to it. True,it does paint a realistic portrayal of Jewish life in Montreal,and the language isn't that hard except for the occasional yiddish thrown in. Basically, we are rooting for an &quot;anti-hero&quot; throughout the novel, a clumsy suppressed 19 year old. Duddy's character had his flaws as we humans do but there was something about the book which I did not like. Was it the style of the prose or the odd setting..I am not sure which. The only thing which I got out of the book was my likeness for the hilarious character of Friar,the Film director. I have no idea why this book went on to get critical acclaim. Mr.Richler has written much much better books like &quot;The Acrobats&quot; or &quot;Barney's Vision&quot; which I am currently reading. I guess I would recommend the book, if you can't find something better or worthwhile to read...otherwise..leave it alone. It's not worth the effort."},{"Title":"The apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz","review":"Some people never learn, this is a story of one of them. Some may find this books a masterpiece, a child of a genious, but in my personal opinion its \\"rawness\\", its fake reality that is represented by the main character only gives you this grim feeling, this grayness of the life that he's living, which not all of us would appreciate. I do not recommend this book to those that like to relate to the main characters in the book because the protagonist of the story is in fact an anti-hero that is not only being sadistic and cruel to those that are close to him, but also does not realize it ad even ignores the facts.This book, though written in an original style and is easy to read, does not deserve anything but 3 stars for a the reason of being too depressing, this is the same reason why I would never give anything but 4 stars even to such hits as Brave New World. Authors could just put it in better colors...it's possible, you know."},{"Title":"The apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz","review":"The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz by Mordecai Richler is one of the worst books I've ever read. I feel the language in the book is unreal and some of the situations in the book are just plan undescribable and obscene. In my opinion I feel this book should be banned from being read in highschools. There are some students that I know who stated for a fact that they've never seen a piece of garbage as worse as this book and I fully agree with them. The use of language is uncontrolable and plan disgusting. There are people who don't use the kind of language that's use in this book and when they see it they immediately skip over the word because they don't feel right reading such language and they've grown up not using or thinking of using it. To conclude I would like to say taht The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz is nothing but trash and filth for students eager and learning minds."},{"Title":"The apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz","review":"Mordecai Richler is certainly one of Canada's best novelists. His caustic sense of humour, his self-deprecating look at life, and his sometimes thinly disguised autobiographical stories are always memorable. Imagine Joseph (Catch-22) Heller being from Montreal and you have Mordecai Richler.Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz is one of Richler's earlier and better known (..thanks to the 1970s film adaptation) works. The story centers around a young Jewish teenager (Duddy), a very abrasive and aggressive boy, striving to make money in order to buy land (thinking, like his grandpa, that if you don't own land you ain't nuttin'). So Duddy gets into a strange, and hilarious, film-making business. His pushy and obnoxious behaviour both appalls and endears everyone he meets; I too was appalled and endeared. By the end of the book I felt I knew (but didn't like) Duddy.While I did enjoy 'Duddy Kravitz' I have to say it certainly isn't Richler's best effort. I suggest Barney's Version, written some 30 years later, which demonstrates the author's abilities at his peak.Bottom line: an endearing story of a lost youth in Montreal circa 1950. Fondly memorable."},{"Title":"The apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz","review":"This book is fast paced, vulgar, funny, and human. The world of Duddy Kravitz--an extraordinary Jewish teenager in Montreal in the 1940's--may sound very far removed from our lives, but very few things I have read have struck me as being so irresistably recognisable as life. It would be to deny yourself an immense pleasure not to read this book. Certain chapters are as classic as things we remember from great 19th century literature."},{"Title":"The apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz","review":"I enjoyed this book.While the first two or three chapters are not really needed in the novel, I found the character of Duddy Kravitz repulsive but strangely satisfying as a character. Cliched my ass. Okay, Max, Jerry Dingleman and Lennie are cliched, but you also get Virgil the epileptic, John Friar the Americommunist filmmaker, Yvette the &quot;Girl Friday&quot; who holds Duddy's land for him, and of course, you have the anti-Semitic Scot Mr. Macpherson. Sure it may sound cliched, but this was written 40 years ago. Cliches have come from this line of writing.I may be a masochist but it's FUUUN to see Kravitz screw and be screwed. And Richler knows how to write a book. In my opinion, it may be nothing new, but at least it's nothing bad....."},{"Title":"The apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz","review":"I chose to read this book for several reasons: least importantly, I had to choose a topic for a school project; I learned to read with the aid of Mordecai Richlers &quot;Jacob Two-Two&quot; books, so I had a fondness for his style of writing; I lived in Montreal for eight of my eighteen years; perhaps most importantly, I read it because I had heard it was not a book to be missed. I was not disappointed.Duddy Kravitz is ambition personified, an almost unbelievably driven young man. As all the other reviews say, he casts aside decency, friendship, and something akin to love to achieve his stated goal. The thrust of the story, however, or at least my own understanding of it, is that Duddy never realizes what he has done. Small flashes of emotion show through sometimes, but they are almost ruthlessly surpressed. It's almost as if he thinks that to be human is to be weak.Duddy succeeds, because he can do nothing else. The price extolled by his own ambition is great, though, and it hurts intensely to realize that he doesn't even recognize what he has done.Rough, well-written, and well worth reading."},{"Title":"The apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz","review":"I was first introduced to Mr. Richler's writing when I read &quot;Duddy&quot; in the '70's. Since then, and partly because of Duddy, I have enjoyed many of Richler's books. The irreverent humour, fully realized characterization and exotic Montreal and Quebec settings make this book riveting. Duddy, a young, almost tragically (except it's too funny) ambitious man, embodies all the tensions and pitfalls of scheming to make a buck."},{"Title":"The apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz","review":"It was my New Years Resolution to read more &quot;literature&quot; especially by Canadian authors. I am ashamed to say that I have managed to get this far through life without reading anything by this someone who is widely regarded as one of Canada's greatest man of letters.This is Richler's cautionary tale about the evils of greed and unrestrained ambition. This topic has been explored by a countless other writers but seldom with as much skill as that displayed by Mr. Richler.The main character is both repugnant and fascinating to watch. I can't recommend this enough."},{"Title":"The apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz","review":"OK here's the deal. Duddy is not a good guy but the reader loves him because he is a human being and if he turns out sour and crazy it is only becasue those more fortunate than he have taken advantage of him. Duddy responds to the cards that society hands out by playing them as best he can. Richler is an incredible writer. His characters and dialogue have so much richness, so much reality. This is a book about Montreal and all the politics and culture-clash that occur between its upper-class Jews and Gentile and the lower class Jews and Gentiles. The old Jews and the young Jews, the college kids and the working kids. The French canadians and the anglo-phones, etc. There are very few women in this book, but Duddy has a very small field of vision when it comes to women, so the POV is true to the character. I love this book."},{"Title":"The apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz","review":"The story is about Duddy Kravitz and his determination to become a &quot;somebody&quot; by doing whatever it takes. This St. Urban Street boy follows blindly under one value, the only value, he receives from his childhood - a man without land is nobody. Duddy schemes and dreams to acheive his own property, not afraid to exploit others along the way for his own ends. This book portrays the evils of great ambition as Duddy's success is also his downfall in life. His lost of love and other means cost him greater than any money can buy."},{"Title":"The apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz","review":"This is a good book, whether you have seen the movie or not. As a point of reference, I have read all of Richler's major works and a few of his early novellas.Modecai Richler (1931 to 2001) grew up in Montreal and that city is the setting for many of his stories - but not all. Many of his novels are about Jews living in Canada and Britain post WWII.He is best known for his tales of life in and around St. Urbain Street. That is an area of three story buildings or walk up row houses located just east of the mountain in Montreal, and north of the commercial center of the city. At one time this was the center of Jewish immigrant life. Many Jews coming to Montreal started there but then moved on to Outrement, Hamstead, and other districts. His father was a scrap dealer and he graduated from a heavily Jewsih high school, Baron Byng High School, which has other famous alumni including William Shatner of Star Trek fame. Some of the local establishments such as Schwartz's Deli on St. Laurent are still in business. He uses much of those biographical experiences in the book.His break out novel is the present novel Duddy Kravitz which is still a great read whether you have seen the movie or not. Also, I like his last book, Barney's Vision, which is probably his most balanced and best written piece of work. That novel lacks the edge and drama of Duddy Kravitz. Along the way, he experimented with different themes and the use of sex in the plots, and usually he did that with a lot of humor.The present book has a very strong set of characters including Kravitz, his father Max, brother Lennie, the \\"boy wonder,\\" Duddy's girlfriend Yvette, and his assistant Virgil. The basic story is about the life and motivation of a young man left with no mother at an early age, and left with both a weak father and brother, and who both lack ambition. He has a lot of energy and drive and is considered to be a \\"Jew boy on the make\\" by most other characters in the book. We follow his quest to break out of his working class background. Richler uses the same Kravitz character in small parts in later novels.Many of his critics claim that he re-cycles his characters and deals only with one topic, but in general his books are far from the predictable.This is a great read."},{"Title":"The apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz","review":"Written by a two-time recipient of the Governor General's Award, The Apprenticeship Of Duddy Kravitz is a searing classic novel about the hidden costs of discounting the welfare of others in pursuit of one's dreams. Desperate to escape Montreal's Jewish ghetto, Young Duddy Kravitz lives by his grandfather's maxim that \\"a man without land is nobody\\", and he lies, cheats, and steals in his voracious pursuit of property. Even though his magnetic charisma sustains his business presence, he soon learns that the realization of his dream is not all he expected it to be. Originally written in 1959, The Apprenticeship Of Duddy Kravitz rings more strongly true than ever in today's materialistic and greed-fueled society.

It's a fantastic read."},{"Title":"Eyes in a Storm: How One Community Weathered Life After a Deadly Tornado","review":"At the time this event happened I was living in North Florida. It was three days after this storm that I found out what had happened. Not knowing if I had family to come back to, I raced back to Rock Creek. I drove past the street I had lived on for 19 years and did not even recognize it. I never really new the full extent of the damage since it was 3 days after clean up had begun that I arrived. This book has shown me a view, and a detail, in this story that few people in the community are willing to talk about. I am purchasing a copy for myself even though I have read the copy given to my parents, and will charish it for many years to come. This community is everything that she has described it to be, and I have found no exaggeration in any of the pages of this book. My dad was also involved in the search and resue efforts, and to this day he is still unable to sit through any conversation regarding the events of April 8, 1998. Jessica, my hat's off to you. You are an excellent writer and I look forward to seeing more of your work. Journalism could use a lot more people like you. Truth and integrity have been a long time gone in the media, and it is refreshing to see someone report the story the way it really happened.

As a mother, I sat by the tree in the rain with Christy Seals and shared her worry over her family and felt the helplessness she did. More than once I was brought to tears reading about the havoc and destruction this storm caused, both in terms of personal and property loss.

This is Renee' Seals, wife of Matthew (June '04). This book is absolutely WONDERFUL and accurate according to my husband and others I know from the area!It breaks my heart to see and know what all he, his family and all of the other residents of Rock Creek went through. Thankfully, I was not involved in it and didn't lose anyone/anything dear to me at the time, though it did strike again very close to my home in Moody. Tragedies are strange animals -- what you think would bring you closer to your family can often be the final straw that breaks the camel's back. I know that God gave my husband peace and that is the ONLY way he made it through this. I cannot begin to know what he and Christie went through, losing one son, laying out there for hours waiting for help, and not knowing where the other two are, but I still see the hurt and pain and results of what happened that night. Quite honestly, I don't know how anyone could make it through such without God.Only He can bring the peace and healing needed, and I am thanful I have seen some of that first hand.

This author made every effort to record each persons account of their experience and to verify her material before publication. I am as proud of Ms. McNew for this excellant reading, as I am my husband and all the men and women of the Concord Fire Department of which my husband was also a member of. The things he saw in the recovery effort to find missing people, the wailing and screaming of our neighbors pleading for help will forever be in his thoughts. Viet Nam couldn't have looked any worse, for our home-town litteraly looked like a bomb exploded. We thought it could never happen to us. Ms. McNew's book is a \\"can't quit reading\\" of the fear, heartache, destruction and sense of hopelessness that one feels in this situation. Any community that goes through this kind of tragedy will go for days without sleep, trying to dig your way out of all the destruction. Streets are covered with trees, crumpled cars, dead people, parts of homes, pets, washing machines and spewing gas and water lines from where the trees were ripped from their roots and splintered into pieces. People found themselves with only the clothes on their backs and possibly no shoes to wear to protect their feet from all the broken glass. The phone lines were gone, and within a short amount of time the cell phones didn't work because the repeater was jammed with too many calls. There was no way to even call your loved ones to let them know you are, or are not, alright.

Debs and other political prisoners during and after WWI. She also worked tirelessly for the AFL and was a close confidant of Samuel Gompers (who according to this memoir proposed marriage to her). This is her out-of-print autobiography, which is perhaps worthwhile for those interested in the labor movement, Samuel Gompers, Eugene Debs, Jewish-American history, or Lang's family history. There isn't as much material in it as you might expect on anarchism or radical left politics.For someone who is not now widely remembered, Lang led a rather fascinating, influential, and full life. As she explains, she wasn't concerned about broad or abstract ideas so much as she was with trying to help people she cared about deeply. Much of the book is a who's who of the early 20th Century labor movement (there's an index, and many of the people and unions she dealt with are now obscure), and the bulk of it is taken up with the amnesty campaign and her work with Gompers. She also recounts her origins in the Ukraine and time as a child worker in Chicago, experiences which served to radicalize her, but she doesn't delve extensively into her political philosophy or personal life. Certain compelling topics, such as living in a utopian commune as a young woman, and her visits later in life to the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany to investigate the condition of her fellow European Jews, are only treated briefly. She concludes with a very positive and hopeful view of the United States and the condition of its workers - bear in mind the book was published in 1948 when the working class here was approaching its most prosperous times (hence the title of the book). We would probably be better served by a well-put together biography (Lang was more a woman of action than of letters), but are fortunate to have this memoir nonetheless, from one of the unsung heroines of American freedom to whom we owe a bit of gratitude."},{"Title":"Tomorrow is Beautiful (American Autobiography)","review":"I like this book for several reasons. Firstly Lucy Lang was one of the founders of the American Labor Movement, and her stories of her life and founding the movement in the early part of the 20th century are well told. Secondly I found out in reading this book that she is my great aunt! Her first few chapters explaining her coming to America and early family history will be interesting to any European Jews but I found it fascinating as it was the first family information I had heard. All in all a great book."},{"Title":"The Wapshot Scandal","review":"If you have not yet read The Wapshot Chronicle, I strongly urge you to read that novel before this one. The Wapshot Scandal is written as a sequel to The Wapshot Chronicle, and the situations and character development in the first book are important background for the second one.Cousin Honora is back in The Wapshot Scandal, but in an unaccustomed role. She is one of the most original and interesting characters of 20th century literature, and my interest in her grew from reading this book. You will also follow Moses and Coverly through their developing careers, continuing marriages and family life. You will probably grow to be more interested in Coverly than before, because his character also receives much more development. The characters of Melissa, Moses's wife, and Betsy, Coverly's wife, are also nicely filled in from the simple sketches in The Wapshot Chronicle. A major new character is also introduced who serves as the exact opposite to Cousin Honora, Cameron, Coverly's brilliant scientist boss. The other significant new character is a young man whose life will remind you of the adolescent fantasies of teenage males.What each character has in common is an incompleteness, a weakness so profound that it causes each to be mightily humbled. These weaknesses are exposed as the comfortable facade of social position that has surrounded and protected the Wapshots is gradually stripped away. Some of the characters find new meaning from the changed circumstances, while others find the harshness of life without protection to be unbearable. You will find it rewarding to think about what it means to have \\"grace under pressure\\" after reading this book.Those who like lots of action in their books will find that this story gets off to a slow start, and only speeds up to a fast pace once or twice (depending on your idea of a fast pace). But this leisurely story constantly sets you up for unexpected events, that make you feel like Mr. Cheever has literally pulled the rug out from under your feet. Each time the unexpected blindsided me, I felt like I had been entertained by a master story teller of rare skill. Be especially patient in the beginning. The least amount of action occurs there.My favorite quality in the book is its unabashed challenge to the following tenets of American life: Work hard; get ahead; have a nice family life in the suburbs; enjoy your friends and neighbors; do the right thing; and find solace in acquiring material possessions. Mr. Cheever clearly makes the case that more is needed to be a good person and to survive within one's own limitations. Some of the comic scenes where consumerism is lampooned are absolutely priceless! The satire aimed at the hypocrites who look down at those who can't cope is so sharp that their heads roll almost without showing blood.This novel is a good one to savor . . . to read slowly . . . to discuss with others . . . and to reread.What do you assume you should do with your life? Where do you have evidence that those assumptions may not be right? What goals would better serve you, those you love, those you care about, and everyone you come into contact with? Where is fatal complacency stealing away your opportunities to choose better directions?If the events in this book happened to you, what would you do?"},{"Title":"The Wapshot Scandal","review":"In \\"The Wapshot Scandal,\\" published in January 1964, John Cheever continues the story of the Wapshot family that he began in 1957's The Wapshot Chronicle. Family history and reputation managed to retain a certain amount of prestige and respect for the Wapshots in tiny St. Botolphs for a decade or two beyond the time that the decline in Wapshot family prospects became evident to outsiders. Now \\"The Wapshot Scandal\\" focuses on the youngest members of the family, brothers Moses and Coverly, as they build new lives for themselves far from the little town in which they grew up. Thankfully, Cousin Honora is also a part of this second Wapshot book and, as it turns out, the contribution she makes to the overall sense of scandal that envelopes the family is a key one.Moses and Coverly, having successfully secured Honora's financial support, are now married, with families and careers of their own. But despite Honora's decision to share what is left of the family fortune with them, neither man is particularly happy with his lot in life because each is married to a troubled woman and tied to a job he secretly despises. Honora, in the meantime, still reigns in the big family home in St. Botolphs where she lives alone with her longtime housekeeper, the closest relationship she has in the world despite what either woman might say about it.Honora, as spirited and eccentric as ever (and described by Cheever as looking \\"a little like George Washington might have looked had he lived to be so old\\"), does not recognize the precarious decline the Wapshots are enduring until she is forced to match wits with an unhappy IRS employee who appears suddenly at her door. The resulting confrontation, and Honora's approach to solving the problem, will leave the reader smiling in admiration as the elderly woman proves to be more than a match for her young challenger.Despite its humor, however, \\"The Wapshot Scandal\\" is overall a much darker book than the one in which Cheever first introduced the family. Life in the suburbs, the lifestyle chosen by Moses and Coverly, is portrayed as bleak and despairing, a world often dominated by alcohol and adultery, a world in which hard work and doing the right thing for one's family are not always appreciated or rewarded. The \\"Wapshot Scandal\\" offers a much harsher brand of satire than the comic version of its predecessor and it leads nicely to Cheever's even grimmer look at the suburbs, his third novel: \\"Bullet Park.\\"Rated at: 5.0"},{"Title":"The Wapshot Scandal","review":"If you enjoyed the Wapshot chronicle, you will enjoy this,however he doesnt get into his stride until Chapter 6, or page 53. I have friends who claim they could never get into this book, and my advice to them is pick it up and start again at page 53 after which there is a great deal of the customary absurdity over which we lovers of Cheever drool. Thats all, enjoy!!"},{"Title":"The Wapshot Scandal","review":"As a follow-up to his \\"Wapshot Chronicle,\\" John Cheever has continued his well-chosen style, almost Dickensonian in mood and tone. And while the first book had its share of scandals, nothing surmounts what is contained herein. Chapter after chapter brings on marital cheating, tax evasion, suicide, abandonment, etc., cropping up in the most unexpected places and peopled by the most interesting characters. The Wapshots, once a rich and proud family, certainly have fallen upon hard times. I highly suggest you read \\"Chronicle\\" first. If you do, I firmly believe you will definitely want to continue with \\"Scandal.\\""},{"Title":"The Wapshot Scandal","review":"This is highly enjoyable and interesting for the way in which Cheever constructs this New England world. The plot is only so-so, but as a vehicle for understanding the characters it pays dividends. Cheever's best work remains his body of short stories."},{"Title":"The Wapshot Scandal","review":"Cheever has a great eye for character development, and he doesn't disappoint in this volume. The characters are definitely out of the ordinary, and the way he presents them is sympathetic, allowing their actions to tell the story.Pretty depressing stuff though -- make sure you take your meds before sitting down with it."},{"Title":"Cisco Security Bible","review":"This is a great value and thus a must-buy. It's unfortunate that Amazon doesn't have a TOC, so people can see all the numerous topics covered (and the topics do seem to be covered in good detail).

There are 2 chapters at the end (appendix?) which cover the basics of networking, which is either a plus if you can use this, or just ignore them if you're a \\"heavy\\".

The detail is nothing short of amazing and their ability to make the subject matter is also a plus for this book.One area that I am not all that familiar with is the CISCO AAA, but after reading the 70 pages, I was amazed at amount of information included and also how important AAA is to creating a high secure network.There also detailed coverage of VPN technologies, the only thing I found strange was that networking basics is at the end of book rather than the beginning. There are review questions at the end of each chapter and about a half dozen labs to work with.Not written o any specific exam, this book can and should help with all Cisco security exams as well as several industry exam like Security+.

Probing his own past as the son of immigrants from Guatemala as a baseline and investigating like families and individuals, TRANSLATION NATION is one of the more interesting, readable, and informative books about the current rise in the number of Latin Americans who in their immigration to a new country have made a solid impact on the cultural, artistic, gastronomic, and political face to the USA.Tobar interviews and follows histories of some fascinating and courageous people, documenting their diaspora-like web across the country. From the Cuban exiles in Florida and the massive Los Angeles and Southern California Hispanic population we all know to the enclaves and pockets of 'latinidad' communities sprinkled across the entire United States, Tobar gleans a feeling of identity, of success stories, of the numbers of Hispanics who have gained national importance and prominence to the beautifully persistent folk traditions that remain intact despite the surrounding environs. The importance of 'futbol' (soccer), the explosion of cuisines not only form the ubiquitous Mexican fast food chains but also the increasingly popular cuisines of Central and South America, the popularity of Chicano painting and crossover music, the on-going debates about border control - Tobar manages to define just what impact 'latinidad' has had and will continue to have as the Latino population grows faster than any other group in census studies.In a time when the government seems to be polarizing the nation about the Latino influx it is refreshing to read Tobar's eminently optimistic evaluation of this newest aspect of the Melting Pot concept of America. An informative and fine read.

Tobar, a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist, takes a look at the insurgence of Mexican and Central American immigrants across the border into the United States; he looks at their motivations for doing so and tells their stories. To do so, he interviewed a few illegal immigrants and their guides, listened to Cubans debate the Elian Gonzalez matter, travelled to Central America, and infiltrates the various markets in Nebraska and the South where many migrant workers go to find work.Tobar eloquently describes the process that many face in coming to the United States. You leave the book feeling like you have followed various people through their experiences and motivations. I put this book down feeling like I had a better grasp on the complexities of these sorts of issue. However, the book did have a weakness: towards the middle of the book, before Tobar gets into his experiences working in factories, the stories told get repetitive. I also have to wonder how \\"authentic\\" of an experience that Tobar had while working in these factories being that he was an educated man that could draw on a safety net if he had to, whereas the people that he was writing about and working with don't necessarily have that safety net.All in all, an important and highly recommended read."},{"Title":"Translation Nation","review":"I was excited by the title and the groovy cover... and the reputation of the author.

He cleverly uses romantic hyperbole and disingenuous analogies to blur the reader's recollection of the last time they needed an emergency room - now transformed to the illegals' HMO - or had to move to a distant suburb to obtain a quality education for their children. Yes, this is a nation of immigrants. It is one, however, which has historically achieved hegemony of fundamental values creating the greatest and most free nation on the planet. Subverting those values rather than embracing them will ensure the ruination of why the illegals try so hard to come here in the first place.

Second, she tells you how to obtain the best medical care.The medical profession is organized around teams. The teams are hospitals or medical centers. There are three leagues. At the top are hospitals providing tertiary care. These represent the best city hospitals. They deliver the widest array of specialized medicine services. Their specialists are often among the leading authorities. If you have a complex medical condition that is where you should go. Next are hospitals providing secondary care. They have very good resources but for the rare diseases mentioned above. Finally, you get hospitals providing primary care. These are good for mundane conditions only. For others, they will refer you to the nearest hospital that delivers secondary or tertiary care.The medical profession has a military like hierarchy. At the bottom are several ranks of nurses. Above them are many ranks of doctors with different level of experience and specialization. There are also hospital administrators who are doctors who got promoted upstairs into managerial roles.There is a key defense line among doctors that consist of the radiologist, anesthiologist, and pathologist. The author calls them the invisible doctors because they have no patient contact. But, their work is key. The radiologist gives others the broad road map of a disease by interpreting X-Rays. After reading the chapter about the anesthiologists you appreciate their importance. If a surgeon makes a mistake, you are typically ok. If an anesthiologist does, your dead! The pathologist is the true scientist who analyze the disease at the cellular level. He is the one that advise the surgeon if he has cut enough cancerous tissue. These three \\"invisible\\" doctors, together are more important than the surgeon.The main advice the author gives regarding how to get the best care is original. The most important issue is to select the best hospital or medical center. The best hospital will have the best team of doctors, including the key invisible ones mentioned above. Only then, should you focus on choosing a primary doctor. And, she gives good advice on how to select both a hospital and a doctor.My only issue with the book is that we often can't choose a hospital as she suggests. Employer sponsored health insurance (HMO/PPO) restricts you to a given hospital. Yet, her advice kicks in when you are referred to a hospital outside of the HMO/PPO network. Overall, this is still an excellent insider's view on a hermetic profession."},{"Title":"How to Survive Your Doctor's Care: Get the Right Diagnosis, the Right Treatment, and the Right Experts for You.","review":"Dr. Gallin has created a tool for everyone to be able to navigate the medical system. I wish that I had read this book before my recent foot injury as I would have known how to better handle my medical care. In fact at the time of injury, I didn't know what to do when I injured myself. Since I didn't know that I was allowed to make choices on my behalf or choose specific doctors I wound up getting inferior care.The best part about this book is the simplicity whith which complicated matters are explained. The infusion of real world examples not only exemplifies the topic that is being described, but also allows you to grasp how situations that are not properly monitered can go wrong. You know that if this can happen to a doctor or someone in their family, it can happen to anyone.

Most people in the street would be shocked to know that we aren't Americans anymore but - liberals and conservatives locked in a culture war, and that one can be a liberal by default, by failing to kowtow to the author's views.This, and every other country needs uniters, not dividers. September 11 doesn't seem to have given conservatives any reason to reconsider their divisiveness."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"D'Souza publishes the best of his works to date with this book, a flattering statement since his other works are some of the most significant contributions to the conservative cause during this generation. If you need additional ammunition for political debate (and we all do), then pick up this book!..."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"This is a truly entertaining book! I have always enjoyed D'Souza's writings, feeling as I do that this enterprising author seems to articulate my feelings succinctly yet completely but this, his &quot;smallest&quot; book to date, packs everything in: humor, common sense, and a thorough coverage of American conservative thought. Fair-minded Liberals, if such a beast still exists, should even *love* this book because, I tell you, here are all the assertions conservatives have, lined up like the proverbial ducks, ready for a good drubbing that will guarantee Liberal victory in the on-going ideological war. Although, I do have to say, it isn't looking very likely."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"This book which is more of a compilation of the author's correspondence with one of his fan-readers is a superb collection of letters and is WORTH BUYING.I heard about this book on Hannity&Colmes; when the duo interviewed Dinesh D'Souza.This is a great book.At no point will you feel that the author is trying to indoctrinate you or trying to push you with his ideas.We all know who liberals and conservatives are ? But it is very difficult to define each one of them. I particularly enjoyed his discussion of who conservatives are? And who are Liberals? What are the value systems of both? In this part the author has chosen words so effectively that you feel \\"Aha , that's what I mean when I say I am a conservative !\\"The concept of Government being a problem rather than solution is well developed.Chapters 4 thru 9 are the most interesting ones."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"This book is so wonderful. It is written at a fairly easy level, which is good for the kind of book it is. Some political books get a little too in depth and end off in tangents that lose your interest or make you forget what the point was. This book is so well written and easy to understand. D'Souza really knows what's going on and simply states the facts while revealing liberal lies. This book is a must read for any young person interested in politics, or knowing the truth. Especially if you go to a crappy liberal state university like I do and are sick of liberal professors. Hehe. Enjoy! You won't regret it! And if you do, you've been brainwashed by MTV."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"Dinesh D'Souza has elevated himself to the forefront of the movement of a return to traditional and smart moral values - and away from liberal moral relativism and its inherent decadence. D'Souza, while using a fictional college student named Chris as his addressee, intelligently articulates a fresh and exciting philosophy of passionate conservatism. This conservatism, as he points out, is not the nonsensical hypocritical Old European kind. Rather, conservatism is the only logical and moral choice for all Americans who genuinely aspire to greatness by means of their own ingenuity, and with the freedom and liberty that is available only in America.D'Souza easily debunks liberalism and libertarianism as inferior to conservatism. First off, liberalism, in all its supposed pro-choice dogma, doesn't give employers a choice to chooose its own employees thanks to affirmative action. Affirmative action not only perpetuates the insinuation that African-Americans are inferior by aiding in their selection by employers and colleges, it demonstrably achieves the reverse of what it purports to eliminate - discrimination of candidates based solely on their skin color.Secondly, libertarianism, in its manifest wisdom, strongly disdains government involvement as well as drug regulation. While less government is intertwined in Republicanism as well, D'Souza points out that government must be a supplier of a strong national defense and illicit drugs must be regulated. Without some government intervention and a national defense we would no doubt witness total chaos. D'Souza brings unbridled passion to his writing which makes for a quick, fun, and informative read. A great book to refute the bed-wetting liberal demagogue."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"Dinesh D'Souza has produced earlier incisive, groundbreaking books. Illiberal Education and The End of Racism are both thought-provoking reads for conservatives and liberals alike, but this is one has an additional purpose: a comprehensive outline of conservative doctrine and a blanket condemnation of the opposing points of view. D'Souza revisits some previously published opinions, and if he doesn't always support them with fact, he does bring heartfelt argument to the fore. He also refers back to his other two books when illumination is needed. The book, as the title suggests, is formatted as a series of letters to a college student, complete with fond recollections of the author's days as a conservative firebrand at Dartmouth. Even constrained by this gimmick, D'Souza is an entertaining writer who delights in, \\"harpooning liberals,\\" eloquently if with slight regard for fairness. We recommend this book as an ideological dessert for potential conservatives, more than as a soup-to-nuts guide to conservatism - and its no-shades-of-gray approach may even help liberals prepare their counterarguments."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"Dinesh reinforces Ronal Reagan's assertion that \\"Liberals out of power are funny.\\"As an outsider to the American political milieu, Dinesh shares his unique, incisive perspective through a series of short letters to an imaginary college freshman.

I've used many of it's witty arguments to help sway people over to the Right side. It's also good to frustrate your liberal proffesors with."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"I don't hand out five stars lightly, but this book is great!I picked it up on a whim from a used bookseller at an airport when I was looking for something to keep me entertained on my six hour flight. I had no idea what a great choice this would be. I couldn't put it down, and at several times during the flight I had to fight back a laugh-attack with tears in my eyes! Although don't get me wrong---the humor here is so dry and subtle that I think some reviewers are missing it. The key is to realize that the \\"letters\\" format is probably tongue-in-cheek. Although the autobiographical content and opinions of the \\"letters\\" are real, the format itself is just a \\"rhetorical vehicle\\" for some of the wittiest skewering of the liberal mindset that you've ever read.As for the question about the target audience: I'm convinced that Dinesh's goal here is to entertain convinced conservatives---not to actually mentor or convert new ones. Frankly, the subtle undercurrent of satire here would probably sail right \\"over the head\\" of most acolytes. And as other reviewers have pointed out, the arguments are not fully fleshed-out, as they would otherwise be in a true apologetic. But this is consistent with the rhetorical vehicle (i.e., if these chapters were actual \\"letters\\" to a real person).This was my first exposure to this author, but I was firmly wom over. Upon returning home from my business trip, I bought several copies to give away to friends! I regard it as a classic of the \\"revolution.\\" Since then, I've hunted down and read most of Dinesh's other books. D'Souza is truly a conservative mind to be reckoned with. His razor-sharp reasoning and articulate style are a treasure to the conservative movement."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"Finally the lifeboat for conservative college students has arrived. D'Souza's witty, brief, and diverse comments make this book a must have for any young conservative heading off to the liberal brainwashing academies known as college. This book gives you enough ammo to see through the muck and mire of liberalism and it will help you to celebrate America for what it truly is...THE GREATEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD!!!"},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"D'Souza is a polarizing figure, like most conservatives: One either likes what he has to say and feels attuned to his sentiment or one totally disagrees with his stances and beliefs. There seems to be no in-between with D'Souza. That aside, he does offer some important advice to his fictional young muse, Chris. It is no surprise that Basic Books chose this collection of letters for the &quot;Art of Mentoring&quot; series. Like most mentors, D'Souza provides his young prot&eacute;g&eacute;, really the young persons of tomorrow who might come upon this book, with information, some of it polarized and obviously related to an agenda and yet some of it fair and balanced. This book is a good pick if you're so inclined toward the conservative side, it's an even better pick if you're not. D'Souza explains most conservative reasoning on relevant issues in the cultural and moral fields. Perhaps a more apropos title would have been &quot;Introduction to Conservatism.&quot;"},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"This easy read by Dinesh D'Souza covers the gamut of issues: abortion, feminism, post-modernism, affirmative action, immigration, environmentalism, great books, multiculturalism, the war on terror, Ronald Reagan, among others. Conservatism is not an easily definable philosophy, since so many different groups of people call themselves conservative (just look at Pat Buchanan versus, say, the good folks at National Review), but D'Souza does an admirable job offering a general definition, rooting it in the recognition of moral standards and of the \\"warped timber of humanity.\\" Conservatism, he says, is a framework through which we can view the world. There's much, much more to conservatism, but that is a solid foundation.If you follow D'Souza at all, or any conservative speaker for that matter, you're probably quite familiar with what he has to say, and to that extent, you might find the book a bit repetetive. But D'Souza argues cogently, clearly, and with common sense. By far the most enjoyable part for me was D'Souza's stories from his Dartmouth years. The tales of the Dartmouth Review were humorous and, some of them, inspiring. But his recollections about Prof. Jeffrey Hart were quite hilarious, indeed. Admittedly, I am something of a fan of Hart's, but the stories about him were priceless--how he wore raccoon coats and buttons saying \\"Soak the Poor,\\" how he had a contraption he claimed was for pinching certain individuals.I do have one quibble with D'Souza--namely, his advice that a conservative on campus should be philosophically conservative but temperamentally radical. Ignoring the fact that he later advises Republicans to be philosophically conservative but temperamentally genial (can one be radical and genial?), I can't bring myself to accept that a conservative--any time or any place--should be radical in temperament, even in the face of liberal onslaught.And he concludes with an excellent reading list--just a starting point, but still quite good--for conservatives, even though it leaves off William F. Buckley, Robert Nisbet, and T.S. Eliot. All things considered, this is a wonderful little book that should provide ample ammunition for any conservative, especially those engaged in debates with campus liberals."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"Mr. D'Souza has rendered an invaluable service to all thoughtful Americans, no matter their political persuasion. In direct, simple, warm, and often funny language, Mr. D'Souza has imposed a fluid yet orderly structure on the landscape of ideological discussion in contemporary democracy. He does this without a single personal attack or character assassination, and also notably by constructing careful arguments, rather than by appeal to authority. This book will inspire conservatives, persuade border-dwellers, haunt decent liberals and infuriate those whose liberalism stems from self-righteous indignation. Mr. D'Souza is also virtually unique in the world of popular political writing in weaving a feasible compromise between common-sense or realism-oriented conservative impulses and a healthy respect for the intellectual and literary tradition of conservatism. An honest reader, approaching from a position of good faith, will find this book hard to put down."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"This is the type of material that young conservatives should be reading. It is full of substance and original thought, unlike other conservatives whose intellect I question (like Hannity, Coulter, etc.).Dinesh breaks his work into many sections, and I find the chapters on \\"Who Are The Post-Modernists?\\" and \\"How To Harpoon A Liberal\\" to be so correct on their asssessments it is actually is quite amusing. When I meet a 'PoMo' I mentally check off all the points which Dinesh lists as their characteristics, and what do you know...they almost always perfectly fit their stereotype! Sure this book is brief and I would have appreciated more depth, but the examples Dinesh gives are helpful. Consider \\"Letters To A Young Conservative\\" almost as a crash course for preparation for dealling with what awaits non-liberals, non-radicals, and non-Marxists on college campuses and the like."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"Wow look at the broad range of responses this book produced. Clearly it has struck a nerve, and it is easy to see why. D'Souza is a master at taking common sense intertwined with funny anecdotes to create a book that is both highly readable and informative. The book is a survival guide for conservatives and libertarians who are entering the one bastion of liberalism left in America its universities. As a college student myself I cannot tell you how valuable his arguments have been in my day to day battles with the Marxist English department at my school. One point he makes in the book is that the left in academia use overly complex, verbose language to intimidated and bully young minds into accepting an argument. If you need proof of how this tactic is employed scroll up and take a look at the review titled \\"Political romanticism\\" Even if you are left leaning politically I think you will find this book worth reading as it basically summarizes the arguments for modern American conservatism."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"There are 3 main reasons liberals hate this book. First, one of &quot;their own&quot; (I.E. a minority) has turned on them. Dinesh has seen firsthand that liberals abuse minorities in America and he isn't afraid to point it out. Secondly, Dinesh dispells the myth that conservatives are &quot;stuffy&quot; and &quot;humorless&quot;. Read some of the pranks that Dinesh's Republican college group pulled on the Elitist liberal student group in college and you'll see that it's the Democrats who are &quot;stuffy&quot; and &quot;humorless&quot;. And finally, probably most importantly, Dinesh is right. His straight talking and politically incorrect views hit the spot for this reader."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"Some of the reviews I've seen for this book appear to be looking at it from the wrong perspective. D'Souza writes to a fictional college student, Chris, and councils him on how to cope in a atmosphere of political intolerance. Along the way D'Souza perfectly manages to capture, eloquently and succinctly, the philosopy of modern day conservatism. This book is not meant to be some all encompasing study of gun control or abortion, but rather a foundation for a young conservative. This would make a perfect gift to a curious young teen or someone who just wanted to know the difference between republicans and democrats. A very important read that'll likely be admired by those who want to raise awareness of politics for out future."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"i found this book to be a quick read. the format, or style of delivery was somewhat unique. although the lessons are intended for a youthful audience, anyone with a desire to view the &quot;dark side&quot; of American liberalism can learn something here. as somewhat a middle of the roader, i enjoy the near neutral vantage point when reading work such as this. more than likely, i absorb more since &quot;my shields aren't up&quot;. before purchasing this book, i read all of the reviews here (as i often do) and must admit, the sheer amount of negativity expressed by a substantial portion of reviewers intrigued me. i figured this must be good to generate such passion, albeit acidic. this is not my first venture into &quot;anti-left&quot; literature and, as mentioned above, i found the book entertaining and educational, if for no other reason due to the author's gift for story telling. after all, if new, accurate and impactful content were the litmus test for the attractiveness for a piece of non-fiction, Michael Moore couldn't get published. my advice......buy it and examine it with an open mind. don't be dissuaded by the critics' repetitive complaint that the material is not new. this complaint, in itself, should not remove a book from consideration."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"July 2, 2004. Saw Farenheit 911 this week and needed an antidote. (...) I had received Letters to a Young Conservative as a gift two years ago and had it in my \\"to read\\" pile. I came of political age under Reagan. He was the first president I could vote for. He was the first politician I ever volunteered for. He provided a very positive and affirming vision of what it means to be an American and how to participate in our democracy and the world. Up until the 60's it was pretty clear what it meant to be an American. Most people agreed on a large number of core values. Somehow in that drug/sex haze that begat me (born 1964), our parents decided to try and throw everything before out and start over. D'Souza does a very good job of reminding us why that was a silly idea and how the legacy of free everything still haunts us today.This is the kind of book you can pick up anytime and open to any chapter and find thought provoking prose. Each chapter has a specific topic or theme. If you want to understand the falacy of the Anti-Globalists argument, turn to chapter 26 (particularly relevant given current events). Want to understand why the Catholics, once the party of Kennedy, are now up for grabs? Want to know how and why the heartland of America, once working class Democrats, are now all Republicans? Turn to chapter 29. My favorite is probably chapter 18, \\"How to Harpoon a Liberal\\". Full of juicy tidbits from his many campus visits and the direct confontations with tenured liberal professors and brainwashed freshmen students. When you are young and still rebelling against your parents, it is fashionable to take up any cause identified on the \\"fringe\\". When you are older and hopefully have your own family, you usually come to realize the value of law, society, family, values, and why \\"traditions\\" work. When I was young, I was also incredibly fearless, egotistical and selfish. I thought nothing could hurt me, I knew most of the answers and whatever I liked was right. In the end, much of the liberal agenda is selfish kids not growing up, not accepting responsibility and learning to trust others.The young liberal would say \\"whatever feels good, do it\\". The young conservative has an uncomfortable feeling with that. Something about imposing his minute by minute egotistical desires on the world doesn't seem right. If you feel this discomfort and want to know why and how to explain it, read this book."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"I am not all that young of a conservative (31 years old), so when I saw this book on the bookshelf at Borders, the title threw me off a little bit. I thought, this is probably all basic/remedial stuff I've already heard before since it seems to be directed at young college-aged kids, based on the title. But I wasn't familiar with Dinesh D'Souza, and with an Indian name, I thought it would be good to see what a person of Indian descent had to say about conservatism. I picked up the book, and before I'd realized it, I'd already read three chapters.Of course, I purchased the book. I started reading it before bed, and I simply could not put the book down. I stopped at page 190, because it was 3:00 a.m., and I had to be up in 4 and a half hours. When I got home the next day, I picked it up and finished it. I'm not much for reading, and I'll often find myself daydreaming when trying to read most books. I'll realize I've gone through 3 pages, and can't tell you a word I've just read. But it was different with this book; it is one of the few books I simply could not put down and I absorbed every single word of it.The book seemed pricey at $22.00 for being a relatively small book. I also bought a copy of Col. David Hunt's \\"They Just Don't Get It\\", which was the book that caused me to go to Borders in the first place. Col. Hunt's book was only $25.95, and appears to be more than twice the size of this book. But after I finished reading it, I felt as though I should go back to Borders to make sure they didn't undercharge me. Proving once again, you can't judge a book by it's cover, or it's apparent size.This book is even less expensive if you buy it online through Amazon.com, so I can tell you, don't click to the next page. Add this to your shopping cart. You will not regret it.I am going to purchase every Dinesh D'Souza book that's been published and read them all. If they're half as good as this book, they'll be some of the best books I've ever read in my 31 years.Now that I've completed this book, I can't believe this man was born and raised in India. You'd never know it after reading this book, because he is more well-versed on American politics and history than almost anyone I've ever encountered. That includes Abraham Lincoln, Ronald Reagan, Frederick Douglass, W. E. B. DuBois, and others. His grasp on conservatism, is second to none. He explains in great detail why conservatism makes sense for this country, and why liberalism does not!I dare say that anyone, regardless of age or education will learn something after reading this. I'll say it again: I'm blown away. I can find almost nothing in this book that I disagree with. This book should be required reading for any conservative, and if it's possible to find a liberal with an open mind, they'd do themselves a huge favor by reading it too. If it were in my power, I'd make it part of the curriculum for every high school freshman in the United States, as it will lead them to reading other important books in American History, such as the Federalist Papers by Alexander Hamilton, and other works by Shakespeare, Plato, etc."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"I call it a great investment when you buy a book and keep re-reading it. It's also a good investment when the book is so quotable that you highlight almost the entire text. There is no better discussion of liberalism and conservatism than this. D'Souza's anecdote of the sandwich and the homeless guy is a parable that sticks in the mind. So is his grasp of what motivates liberals: the desire for power over others, which they mistakenly think is nobler than the conservative's desire for money. His knowledge of history provides the reader with some fascinating tidbits, e.g., Lincoln understood that the abolitionists were not motivated by any love for blacks but by their self-righteous moral display. And his mind is like a knife designed to cut through crap, as when he suggests that when some liberal tells us that he is pro-choice but \\"personally opposed to abortion,\\" ask him \\"WHY are you opposed to it?\\"What a mind. No wonder liberals hate this guy. They just have to despise someone who thinks so clearly and who pulls the mask off their self-righteous, feeling-based cliches."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"Dinesh is an excellent writer. There is no arguing that. In a lucid fashion, Dinesh gives the conservative side of just about every issue in social and fiscal politics with a spear in his hand. Not only does he explain the conservative position he also tells you why it's a better position with much wit to accompany the explanation. Jonah Goldberg labeled this book the swiss-army knife for conservatives and he is correct in saying that.Even if you're not a conservative I would read this book so you can at least know what you're arguing against because Dinesh does not hold back. You'll see how a true conservative thinks about the issues and why. Dinesh goes into some detail about his conversion to conservative politics while he was in college, which makes for very interesting reading. You'll read about his time spent writing for the college newspaper and all of the trials and fun that went with that job.This is a good book. I can't recommend it enough. Give it a read."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"Mr. D'Souza writes in a clear, enjoyable style. I gave this book to each of my sons - one who has conservative values (as I do), and the other who is ambivalent about politics. If he does take the time to read this book, I'm hoping it will at least kindle an interest in politics, and possibly lean him towards conservative ideas."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"I love this book. Dinesh writes many useful things in this book. Some things are even funny. Like his pamphlet ideas. Dinesh says if you want to cause a controversy on campus, make some pamphlets. One of the pamphlets he suggests making says \\"Feminist Thought\\" on the outside and to leav the inside blank. tee hee hee. :)All conservatives should read this book. A+"},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"This is easily the best book when it comes to young Conservative writing. (By young, D'Souza means high-school/ college)Basically, it is a shorter and more interesting version of most of D'Souza's other books combined.Some of the better chapters are D'Souza recouting his years at Dartmouth University, and fighting the liberals there."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"...--these are letters, composed as letters! They weren't meant to be in-depth essays, but rather responses to letters written Dinesh by a college student. I'm sure he didn't make them 15-page compositions for that reason. But he still gets to the point, makes good arguments, and keeps it entertaining. ... and reading some of his actual articles on these topics to get a more in-depth treatment of the subject matter."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"In 30 short chapters (the book is 220 pages) D'Souza takes us on a whirlwind tour of the worldview of the conservative. Because of the brief treatment each subject receives, he cannot approach a thorough defense of any of them. Nevertheless, by the end a coherent picture emerges and he concludes by offering a reading list that should more fully satisfy the appetite he was only able to whet.In an historical overview we learn that both conservatism and modern liberalism have their roots in classical liberalism with its emphasis on freedom for the individual. But with the changes brought about in the 1930's under FDR and in the 1960's \\"liberation\\" movement, the two have diverged to the point that they really stand opposed to one another. They have a fundamental difference in their understanding of human nature.Liberals, following Rousseau, believe we are basically good, that human nature is malleable if only we apply the right social engineering. Conflicts in the world are not seen in terms of good versus evil, but as misunderstandings. Society at large, and not individuals themselves, are to blame for bad situations such as crime and poverty. Absolute autonomy and personal subjective relativism are the twin dogmas of modern liberalism.Conservatives, on the other hand, believe in an external, objective moral order. Terms such as good and evil refer to this moral order and thus are not inventions of the human mind. A less sunny diagnosis of human nature leads to a greater emphasis on individual responsibility since conservatives are more realistic about what we are capable of and therefore cannot deflect the blame like liberals do. It also allows for a recognition that some regimes in the world are actually evil, so force, not dialogue, may be necessary in dealing with them. While personal autonomy is important to some degree for the conservative, he finds he must balance this autonomy with duty and virtue which he recognizes from the objective moral order.D'Souza's discussion of multiculturalism was a particularly interesting example of the clash of worldviews. He distinguishes between authentic and \\"bogus\\" multiculturalism, the former referring to a proper recognition of living in a multiracial society, but the latter referring to a leftist political ideology. A case can be made for attempting to balance university curricula to include more great books from the non-Western world. However, \\"it is impossible to understand multiculturalism in America without realizing that it arises from the powerful conviction that bigotry and oppression define Western civilization in general and American in particular.\\" Consequently representative literary works from other cultures are rejected because they reflect the same bigotry and discrimination that the West is accused of. Instead marginal works are selected, ones which do not reflect their culture but do speak of victimization and oppression. So it is called bogus multiculturalism because \\"it views non-Western cultures through the ideological lens of Western leftist politics.\\" True multiculturalism, in contrast, would teach the greatest works of Western and non-Western cultures. Its goal would be to study, in the words of Matthew Arnold, \\"the best that has been thought and said.\\"Liberal judicial activism also comes under fire for undermining the democratic process by imposing the left wing ideology of the judiciary on the American people. Conservatives, on the other hand, insist that in a democratic society, the people make the laws and the judges apply them. Liberals generally feel that \\"judges should have the power to make a ruling that specifically contravenes the Constitution and also goes against the wishes of the American people.\\" One egregious example of liberal judicial activism is the so-called \\"right to privacy\\" that the Supreme Court found in the Constitution on which to base the legalization of abortion: this right was not found but fabricated.Conservatives are generally pro-life while liberals are almost certainly pro-choice. In fact, being pro-choice is a litmus test for liberals hoping to have any success in politics, because it is here that personal autonomy, one of the two dogmas of liberalism, is most put to the test. Conservatives are pro-life because their less radical insistence on personal autonomy can be tempered by the overriding concern for another human being's right to life. Initially I disagreed with D'Souza's pro-life strategy. He calls hard line pro-lifers \\"fools\\" because their insistence on preventing all abortions will, in his opinion, have the result of preventing none. The reason is that the prolife movement does not enjoy the support of the American people that it would need to achieve this. Instead, he says we should focus on reducing the number of abortions as a step toward the ultimate goal of ending it. He reminds us of the strategy employed by Abraham Lincoln with the slavery issue. Although antislavery, Lincoln was not an abolitionist but instead worked toward curtailing the spread of slavery to the territories. During the Civil War, the outcome of the war was very much in question and Lincoln did not want the border states, which did have slaves, to also secede from the Union. So he carefully framed his case against the Confederacy not as one of slavery but as one of saving the Union. In this way his coalition was maintained, \\"a coalition whose victory was essential to the cause of antislavery.\\" I find D'Souza's reasoning intriguing, and wonder if the pro-life movement might have more success by thinking along those lines.Of all the chapters in the book, the one I am wary of is the one dealing with the environment. The title of the chapter, \\"Who cares about the snail darter?\\" raised a red flag from the start. His cavalier playing down of global warming concerns me. I am also not convinced by his dismissal of organic farming as inefficient, in favour of high-yield farming, assisted by bio-engineering and pesticides. He does claim that conservatives are concerned with the environment, admitting that \\"the stewardship of nature is now a human responsibility.\\" He would, however, distinguish this reasonable concern with the liberal environmentalists, who \\"tend to operate in perpetual alarmist mode.\\" He believes that they are opposing the solutions that have the greatest chance to work, solutions arising from growth, affluence, and technology.D'Souza has given us an easy to read, informative overview of the terrain on which the conservative/liberal ideological battles are fought. Even a conservative doesn't have to agree with all his points to gain much from this valuable contribution."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"This is a excelent book for consevatives. It is written in a simpe sense for the beginner but deals with issues interesting to any well versed poltical reader. I simply loved reading this book, it was hard to put down."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"I highly recommend this book, especially for young adult conservatives such as myself. D'Souza goes to extraordinary lengths to explain the heart of political debate between America's political parties. Most ingeniously, he examines the psychology (both the basic belief system and resultant public objectives) of Democrats, and how they wish to manipulate public naivety to apply their beliefs to larger,lofty goals. D'Souza outlines fundamental crimes against the American constitution and the virtues is represents, creating an educational, enlightening read for any young conservative oppressed in his/her political arena. As an undergraduate student, I highly recommend this book: It further validated my beliefs as a young conservative woman and better educated me on the fundamental debates of our time. Most importantly, D'Souza's \\"Letters to a Young Conservative\\" inspired me to courageously speak my mind. We have the right to free speech as granted to us by the Constitution - and those rights cannot be infringed based on differences in ideals. Free speech and rational arguments are the essential vectors by which young conservatives can gain critical political footholds, and turn the tables. Five Stars."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"This book is a smart, witty and brilliantly simple explanation and detailing of politics in America. The letters are filled with clear, concise and thoughtful retorts to common liberal arguments and positions. This is a great tool for a young conservative to begin formulating opinions and arguments based on facts and well thought out logic. Wonderful and an easy read!"},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"I've had the pleasure of reading two other books by Mr. D'Souza (End of Racism and What's so Great About America), so I was quick to order this one. When I first looked at the format of the book, I wasn't sure I was going to be happy with it. Each chapter is a response to a letter that he received. Then I was concerned that it would simply be a re-hash of the other two books. As I started to read it, I became as transfixed as I did with his other writings.Mr. D'Souza doesn't claim to be the original thinker of this philosophy (Conservatism), but he certainly explains it better than anyone I have ever read.He is absolutely right about the liberal argument against conservatism. There is no solid liberal argument that will stand up to it, simply because the liberal idea will not support itself. The only true way to achieve the liberal goals is through conservative practice. Except for the argument (review - Political romanticism) about Money vs. Power, I have not read one argument against this book that even came close to making an argument that made sense.Mr. D'Souza has done it again, and I highly recommend this book for reading. Then you should pass it along to a friend."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"Dinesh D'Souza continues to impress with this offering - a collection of letters written to a fictional student named Chris delineating D'Souza's passionate message of an exciting new conservativism. D'Souza slams and debunks the blame America first leftist crowd's weak argument of liberalism by exposing it for what it truly is - blatant hypocrisy. They claim to be for human rights, but are willing to stand by and watch a dictatorial despot indiscriminately rape and murder his own people and commit genocide.While liberals vigorously fight for animal rights through organizations such as PETA, they, in turn, deem it justifiable to kill human babies because they're \\"not alive yet.\\" And, just as Affirmative Action eliminates the freedom of choice by employers and colleges; so, too, does it not only devalue black achievement and intensify doubts about black capacity, it, in and of itself, advocates the very thing it espouses to prevent - selection via racial preference. D'Souza makes for well-articulated and intelligent read. I could not put it down."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"Obviously the individual that ripped Mr. D'Souza is unrealistically biased. D'Souza is not a racist or relying on a privileged upbringing, he's only pointing out what our Founding Fathers envisioned when they debated and crafted the Bill of Rights and Constitution. D'souza is right on the mark. I strongly recommend this book for all young Americans."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"This is an especially good book for the interested high school student and every college student. As a 53 year old, I found it an entertaining, informative, and stimulating read. At times I laughed out-loud. At times I went deep into thought. Mr. D'Souza's book will fascinate any socially or politically curious reader - conservative, moderate, liberal or libertarian.Mr. D'Souza writes clearly and sometimes humorously about the hot-button issues facing Americans today. Using fact, reason, experience and his awareness of literature and history, he brilliantly describes liberal and conservative thinking in our country and examines their intellectual and historical underpinnings.A native of India and a man 'of color', he offers an enlightening and informed perspective on multiculturalism, immigration, capitalism, feminism, affirmative action and other currents affecting contemporary American life. With practicality and common sense, he offers a view of the challenges all Americans face in order to survive as a viable nation in the global context."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"D'Souza's writing is refreshing and enlightening - any student who feels adrift in the liberal tide at his or her university will read this book and find a soulmate. This is where it all begins, after all. D'Souza makes being a conservative just as strong a conviction as being a Christian or card-carrying Republican, and reminds us that we need be neither to understand and corroborate conservatism. He's inspiring and I hope this book touches you like it did me."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"Dinesh D'Souza has produced earlier incisive, groundbreaking books. Illiberal Education and The End of Racism are both thought-provoking reads for conservatives and liberals alike, but this is one has an additional purpose: a comprehensive outline of conservative doctrine and a blanket condemnation of the opposing points of view. D'Souza revisits some previously published opinions, and if he doesn't always support them with fact, he does bring heartfelt argument to the fore. He also refers back to his other two books when illumination is needed. The book, as the title suggests, is formatted as a series of letters to a college student, complete with fond recollections of the author's days as a conservative firebrand at Dartmouth. Even constrained by this gimmick, D'Souza is an entertaining writer who delights in, \\"harpooning liberals,\\" eloquently if with slight regard for fairness. We recommend this book as an ideological dessert for potential conservatives, more than as a soup-to-nuts guide to conservatism - and its no-shades-of-gray approach may even help liberals prepare their counterarguments."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"Dinesh D'Souza writes, yet again, another great work. Its casual medium (in this case letters to a young conservative) makes it easy to comprehend for anyone, of any age, wanting to understand reasoning behind a conservative mindset. The series of short chapters, or letters, cover every pertinent topic affecting the operation of not only our government but the societies we live in today. I have read D'Souza's \\"What's So Great About America\\" and \\"Illiberal Education\\" and have walked away with a better understanding of a handful of controversial issues and their logical solutions. With \\"Letters to a Young Conservative\\", every politically debatable topic you can think of is covered in a concise, efficient manner, which only Mr. D'Souza can do best. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand conservative reasoning, whether they are a liberal, conservative, or (especially) politically undecided."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"I am impressed with this book.It is basically a written \\"dialogue\\" between Dinesh and a Student named Chris.Dinesh responds to Chris' questions and manages to tie in background information and detail that support his positions.He also tries to keep it light hearted--which helps. Some who read this in a dour state most certainly don't get it.On page 102 he nails down the absurd and implausible efforts to populate university education with \\"proportional\\" feminist writing.He makes a very good case that color blindness and merit are the only way to ensure a heathly multicultural society.On page 216 he talks about how in the short-term Repbulican's need to let the Democrats be the party of the blacks and black demands. For the long term his advice is to continue efforts to grow the economy, increase national unity, merit and color-blindness.A phenomena for me personally is that Mr. D'Souza takes issues which I have historically \\"felt\\" more than understood and articulates them with erudition I envy.It is an excellent work."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"In its stated purpose of &quot;mentoring&quot; college-aged, or younger, conservatives, this book does a fine job in introducing its target audience to many of the distinctive elements of traditional conservative thought. It's not a perfect book, and maybe someday I'll write a column somewhere about how D'Souza fundamentally mis-states the libertarian philosophy, and libertarian beliefs on some key issues. In that section, at least, he does his young friend &quot;Chris&quot; a real disservice. It's only because that's such a relatively small part of the book that I'm not downgrading my ranking more.But apart from that (and the author's annoying idolatry -- it's not too strong a word -- of Lincoln), there is much here to learn from and enjoy. If campus conservatives can arm themselves with the information -- and also the techniques -- D'Souza passes along here, the political atmosphere of our colleges will be much improved, and much more entertaining."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"No, these are not full-length essays...but in a series of 30 concise letters, Dinesh D'Souza does an excellent job of summarizing the core beliefs held by conservatives and liberals, and explaining several of the fallacies in current left-wing ideology. Why did D'Souza's book appeal to me so much? Because like the addressee of his letters, I am a young conservative on an ultra-left campus (and a &quot;person of color&quot; attending a women's college, no less!).I did not entirely agree with everything D'Souza wrote, possibly because my leanings tend to be more libertarian (the author addresses this topic in his second letter, &quot;The Libertarian Temptation&quot;). Still, he provides compelling food for thought, and Letters to a Young Conservative is a quick, refreshing read that I will be sure to reference many times in the future."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"Among the many rather peculiar claims made by Dinesh D'Souza in his \\"Letters to a Young Conservative,\\" there is one that I find particular striking. D'Souza asserts that whereas people go into business because they desire money, they go into Academia because they desire power. This implies, first of all, that a desire for power doesn't play a role in the desire for money, and, secondly, that the desire for power plays a more essential role in academia than in other professions. Both the first and second claim are, at the very least, rather odd. Money is clearly not an end in itself; it exists principally as an abstract representation for the labor of other people. If you have money, you can purchase other people's labor - either directly, by paying wages to an employee or a servant - or by buying a commodity, which itself contains an accumulation of social labor. Now even if we assume that this labor is entirely uncoerced and free, it is still clear that the right to claim other people's labor to one's own ends is a form of power. Unless businessmen have no other desire than to wallow day and night in a vault filled with gold, we must assume that their desire for money is also a desire for power.If we are not to suppose that D'Souza is a complete fool, there is only one way we can interpret what he means by this. Of all the manifold forms of human power (over desires, over wills, over bodies, over nature, over machines), he must regard only one of these to be power in the emphatic sense; namely, the form of power that is particular to the Academic profession. What is this then? Since the political power of an academic is slight, since they do not have the power over emotions and desires claimed by the mass media, since lawyers and advertisers (not to speak of politicians) are far better at befuddling the minds of the masses with sophisms, and since elementary and high school teachers have more influence over forming the basic prejudices and presuppositions of citizens, there is only one possibility left: the power to persuade and convince through argument and discourse, the power to teach people to think. The power, in other words, that people have over other people qua rational beings - and thus not as a means to an end, but as an end in itself. While other, less honorable forms of power play a role in Academic life, only this is specific and essential to it. This exemplary form of power, moreover, must stand in the strongest opposition to that which money grants to its possessors. We might understand this as follows: the labor that we purchase involves, implicitly and necessarily, a temporary suspension of will on the part of the seller. If I hire a servant to do my bidding for eight hours a day, then, during this period, he becomes a means to my ends. He ceases to exist qua rational, as an end in himself, and becomes an instrument. If I hire an employee to work in my business, it is no different. He may use his intelligence and creativity to the highest degree, he may enjoy what he is doing, he may want to work even if he did not have to: none of this matters. He is still serving my ends for the duration of his labor. And likewise when I buy some produce or manufactured good, although now I have an indirect rather than direct relation to the labor. What the worker gets in return, in each case, is the same --- money, which confers a like power to purchase the labor of others.Thus it becomes clear: for D'Souza, power in the true sense consists only in rational persuasion. Contractual relations, and above all, those in which someone freely agrees to temporally suspend his freedom in exchange the means to purchase the labor of others, are not relations of power, but something else. (A real Marxist, and not just a \\"liberal\\", would, of course challenge the very freedom and symmetry of this contractual relation, observing that, in relation of capitalists and workers, and very different power is exchanged, and it is not nearly as reciprocal as it may at first seem.) And power, for D'Souza, is a bad thing.It is easy to see, however, that this conception is deeply flawed - not merely because it disregards the tremendous variety in forms of power, but because it entirely conflates the means and the end, the accidental and the essential. Rational persuasion is superficially and instrumentally asymmetrical: one party persuades and the other is persuaded. Likewise, the University is an extraordinarily hierarchical institution. Yet the end of rational persuasion is a free community of rational beings, who, in good Kantian fashion, regard each other not as means but as ends. The market exchange, mediated by money, is instrumentally equal and reciprocal. Yet its end is the subjection of one person's will to another. And when all relations are mediated by money, the subjugation becomes universal.I have submitted this remark of D'Souza's to an extended analysis not because I consider his book a worthy target of such critique, --- it is obviously extremely vapid and opportunistic, especially with its kitsch conceit of \\"mentoring,\\" --- but because I believe it to reveal an extremely characteristic presupposition of the contemporary Conservative Weltanschauung. All human relations are understood as instrumental, - abandoned is the very hope of a society in which people regard each other as ends - and yet the sober analysis of the modes of power and domination is replaced with the ideological conviction that the contractual relations of a \\"free market economy\\" are intrinsically non-repressive; that they are, as it were, the immanent realization of utopia. This is political romanticism at its worst."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"Dinesh D'Souza is a typical example of the glib and conceited mongers of hardcore political ideas who have experienced little of their own but are merely recycling old ideas with a spin. Its clear that Dinesh has not experienced any kind of hardship faced by many people in America, he appears to be a member of an ethnic minority brought up in a privileged environment and lacks the appreciation of knowing what its like to fail at something or the struggle to achieve success. Fact is, none of the various theories he sells in his book are his own, this is not an original piece of writing. I found the book disappointing and tiresome and outright irritating. He is slick with his tongue and has brainwashed himself to such an extent that his views on political theories have become warped and lack any semblance of due dilligence and balance. He is not a scientist and at most would make a good car salesman. I wonder if Dinesh D'Souza has ever done anything at any point of his life that has been for the great benefit for any one person let alone the American people he speaks for. He's obviously written this book (with a large photograph of himself on the cover!) to aggrandize himself and make money in the process. This book will not solve anyones problems. A shallow book written by a myopic ego-maniac author, only another intellectually bankrupt person like Sean Hannity (who is hardly a person to aspire to) would endorse cheap and forgetable pulp non-fiction like this. As a moderate conservative I'm ashamed to be associated with his theories."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"Have you read either of Rush Limbaugh's books? How about Bill Bennett's Why We Fight, Ann Coulter's Slander, Dan Flynn's Why the Left Hates America, or Sean Hannity's Let Freedom Ring? If so, save your money and skip this one. While recycling is supposed to be a liberal obsession, it's conservatives who keep rehashing the same old book. Each comprises a few essays on haggard \\"hot-button\\" topics like feminism, media bias, and affirmative action in which the most outrageous things said by any leftist are quoted and then generalized to all liberals.In fact Letters, which reads like it was knocked out over a three-day weekend (Kirkus Reviews observed it looked like it was written \\"in a hurry for money\\"), mostly retreads D'Souza's own previous books.Yes, all of these issues are important and the general liberal position is wrong on every one. But none of these breezy books tells you anything you can't get from listening to a few hours of Rush or Ollie North. Like talk radio, they don't even make a pretense of informing; they just preach to the converted.D'Souza's gimmick here is that he's appealing to youth; but all of the vast right-wing clone-spiracy creeds are written for the proverbial fifth-grade reading level. His general gimmick is that his books are special because he's a \\"person of color,\\" as he puts it. In fact, he's just a dark-skinned Caucasian exploiting the same race card he so splendidly ripped in The End of Racism. And that's the real shame here, that this poor little pamphlet comes from a former true scholar who once displayed so much promise. How sad that he's become just another \\"knock-em out for quick bucks\\" hack."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"My only conclusion about the popularity of D'Souza is that he writes what his audience loves to hear. His opinions, and that is all they are, opinions with little concern for research, analysis, and refutation because they are so general, must strike a nerve in many 'young conservatives' who feel they are unappreciated. However, that doesn't make his ideas right regardless of how much one wants them to be. That any author would presume to be able to make a comprehensive analysis of current political ideology in so short a book is rather insulting to people who spend their entire lives seeking the truth. That this forum is in the form of a 'letter' is condescending to individuals who want to arrive at truth. If one is inquisitive about how the world works, why read the pre-digested views of someone who immediately places himself in a one-up position with the reader? Why not go out and learn about the world yourself? Are people so afraid that their biases just might be unfounded? If so, it does not say much for one's self confidence.That said, here is a brief deconstruction of the sadly poorly reasoned perspective of the author, chapter by chapter.1 Conservatives vs. Liberals: Phony dichotomy, as if the country were divided into two mutually exclusive political camps.Enough said.2 The Libertarian Temptation: If you're considering what political agenda suits you, you use reason to arrive at conservativism. Any other choice is emotional indulgence. Not that Bush promulgates emotion (bring 'em on, for or against us, ad nauseum; or Cheney (yelled out. F__ Y___ at a Democratic senator during a photo shoot; Cheney the only Congressperson who voted against banning armor piercing bullets during a house vote proposing to ban said ordnance that went through police officers' bullet proof vests-Well, I guess one libertarian temptation doesn't count)3 The Education of a Conservative--This sounds like you were born conservative and needed educating. Is this a new variation of trait theory?4 Pig Wrestling at Dartmouth--I guess every serious book needs a comic chapter title, but you're no Shakespeare.5 Fighting Political Correctness--You mean political correctness to which you are opposed. Business suit, white shirt, red power tie, well-groomed: it's the photo of you on the cover! Suggested title \\"Fighting political correctness by being the correct form of political correctness.\\"6 Authentic vs. Bogus Multiculturalism--There's authentic and bogus everything: politicians, agendas, $20 bills, televangelists, etc. If you need someone to tell you what is the real thing and what is junk, you will always look to others for advice.7 What's So Great About Great Books: Logic 101: define \\"tautology.\\" Besides that, if you have to explain this to your readers, it doesn't say much about their own discernment. No one should have to explain what is 'great.' Learn through experience.8 How Reagan Outsmarted the Liberals: Drug dealers outsmart the police all the time. Advertisers outsmart consumers. So??? Is 'outsmart' a positive word? Not to me.9 Why Government Is the Problem: You're not talking about the morass of Iraq, sponsored by the Republican party, or the abysmal failure of the Bush FEMA program, or the indictments of top-level conservative politicians, are you? Are fire departments the problem? Is government--the entity that created the protection of free speech so people like D'souza could write books the enemy?10 When the Rich Get Richer: Another lame trickle-down economic theory; the trouble is two-fold: the rich don't buy things; they already have everything; they can invest their profits, but the big money is in investing overseas.11 How Affirmative Action Hurts Blacks: THe old argument about class vs. race. How about a new problem: \\"How outsourcing high tech jobs to India hurts Whites\\" Won't win too many conservatives with that one.12 The Feminist Mistake: You mean there is only one??? I made at least three mistakes today alone! I bet if you ask him, D'Zousa would say he doesn't make any. Everyone and every ideology makes mistakes. We're all human.13 Who Are the Postmodernists? Corporations that rip-off 1920's car designs and haute couture and make a fortune are the only ones of import; the rest just sit around bee-esing.14 Why Professors Are So Left-Wing: Since Business is the number one college major and the M.B.A. is the most sought after college degree, this argument is very old and lame. Not too many Finance, Marketing, and Management professors are so called \\"Left Wing\\": whatever that means. The 60's are over, dude.15 All the News That Fits: Are you really going to rip-off a old joke that appeared in \\"Mad Magazine\\"?16 A Living Constitution? If the Constitution sat in a vault and no one knew it, would it be a constitution? I suppose it's all how you interpret it; of course, those who are alive and who interpret it make it a living constitution. If such people agree with your version, it's valid; otherwise, it's a chimera, I suppose.17 More Guns, Less Crime: Households with guns have double the rate of suicide than those without guns. Suicide is a crime. I guess you weren't referring to THAT crime. Yes guns don't kill people, Americans with guns kill people, at least in terms of so-called 'civilized societies.'18 How to Harpoon a Liberal: Very revealing metaphor. I guess when the whales are all extinct, you have to get out your aggression somewhere.19 Lies My Teacher Taught Me: Like the one that stated Teddy Roosevelt charged up San Juan Hill? Why didn't you mention that one?20 Was Lincoln a Bad Guy?: John Wilkes Booth thought he was.21 The Self-Esteem Hoax: You gain self-esteem by hard work and accomplishment, like the ambitious young men who make fortunes dealing drugs.22 Who Cares About the Snail Darter? This is the tired argument about the expendability of endangered species for the sake of economics. The U.S. has--I mean had--a long history of conserving nature. It was part of our culture. In the Philippines you can eat dog for a main course. If you objected, some nice Filipino might ask \\"Who cares about dogs?\\" You do, because it's part of your culture. Who's right? Did you see the episode of Twilight Zone where beings came from another planet with a book \\"How to Serve Man,\\" and it turned out to be a cookbook? Be careful for what you wish for.23 Against Gay Marriage: Look at Canada and the evil consequences it has caused there like low divorce rates, low levels of child molestation, low incidents of juvenile deliquency, etc. Now check with the Moral U.S.A.24 Family Values Since Oedipus: You left out your hero R. Reagan in this chapter: the only American president to have been divorced.25 Speaking As a Former Fetus: I'd love to read Hitler's or Stalin's version of this.26 The Hypocrisy of Anti-Globalists: If you can tell me where I can buy a DVD player made in the U.S.A., I'll run right out and buy one.27 Are Immigrants to Blame?: Sure they are to blame. Just blame them. They won't talk back. They could get deported.28 Why Liberals Hate America: Name three... Come on...You can do it. I'm waiting....OK, get back to me later on that one.29 A Republican Realignment? You mean like the way they are lining up to protest stem cell research and praising the war in Iraq? Or maybe the way they're lining up to get fingerprinted with Delay in the lead and Libby right behind.30Why Conservatives Should Be Cheerful: At least one conservative should be. You. If enough suckers buy your book, why wouldn't you be?"},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"D'Souza reprises his role as the Gunga Din of the far right-wing. His knowledge of American history, politics, literature and culture is so slim as to be laughable. Those very conservatives who feather his nest are the very same people who fought tooth-and-nail against the Immigration Reform Act of 1965, which eliminated racial and ethnic discrimination in U.S. immigration policies - and without which, D'Souza himself probably would have been denied the right to be here."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"What amazes me most, as I read these reviews, is how many readers praise D'Souza's mastery of \\"common sense\\" - and have no doubt that even \\"liberals\\" will either be won over straight-out to the forces of good, or at the very least suffer the pain of having their \\"most cherished beliefs\\" trammeled underfoot by a cavalcade of plain-spoken persuasiveness.It no doubt seems like a good strategy to dress up the wolf of radical (the man says it himself) Conservative ideology up in the drapings of home-spun common sense. Yet common sense is a rather fickle ally. That which appeals only to the immediate prejudices, perceptions, moral feelings of the majority of people - or to certain general \\"laws\\" (such those of economics) that are presented as obvious without giving any sense for the limitations of their application - can always be opposed by an equally common-sensical counter-argument.This is because our immediate notions are often quite contradictory. We amass countless opinions and habits of thought in the course of lives, depending on these as we go about our daily business, yet we seldom test these against each other, see how they fit together, or ask what assumptions they rest upon.If I had no other interest than the advancement of a left-wing agenda, I would rejoice in the knowledge that Dinesh D'Souza has gone to such pains to arm the foot-soldiers of the Revolution with such meager weapons. If the University is really such a terrifying fortress of Marxism, filled with predatory ideologues who spare no effort in battering and bullying students into submission through their \\"complex and verbose arguments\\", \\"common sense\\" won't count for much, and they'll soon be wishing they had wolfs' teeth instead of a sheep's fleece."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"What a disappointment. I picked this book up because I remember seeing this young man on CSPAN once and thinking he sounded articulate. I was obviously flipping channels at great speed, because I did not have a clue about any of his views. Hence my feeling of revulsion when I picked this book up at a store and perused it. This obviously gifted young man is either completely soulless or else seriously deluded. Apparently there are others like him too. I guess I am naive, as this was something of a revelation to me.I mean I know about the Ku Klux Klan and Dr. Laura but did not realize that such extreme ideology also exists in academia.Last but not the least, my disappointment stems from the fact that I am of Indian origin myself and am ashamed that a young man of foreign descent, who clearly had a privileged upbringing, is so lacking in empathy toward other minority groups who are not so lucky."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"Same old sausage, new casing. If you go in for this kind ofwriting, then read any of Ann Coulter's books. At least she's more entertaining in her wrong-headed way. As it is, this book should never have been written, let alone published - at a great waste of trees. Nearly 400 years of American history had transpired before D'Souza stepped off the boat in 1979. Unfortunately, his ignorance of that history and its significance literally leaps off every page. One previous reviewer absolutely nailed it: But for the liberals and civil rights groups who forced an end to racist US immigration policies by the passage of the Immigration Reform Act of 1965, D'Souza probably wouldn't be in this country. And let the record clearly show that those conservatives he so slavishly serves fought this law to the bitter end. This is but one example of his ignorance; this book puts it on full display."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"the screwtape letters...another collection of epistles between two demons."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"This book transformed me into a \\"former admirer\\" of D'Souza.

His choice to address the letters to \\"Chris,\\" make a stronger point than the letters themselved do. This undermines the book, the author and the cause itself and has certainly turned me off. I am sympathetic to the cause he is promoting, but much less so after this book."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"This is a great book for those seeking an intellectual way and good reasons to be conservative in today's culture."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"I am a conservative.Dinesh D'Souza's fine book is indeed another one that is &quot;preaching to the choir&quot;. Any conservative is likely to enjoy this book. And while the views submitted by the author are legitimate, they are unlikely to convince anyone to change his/her mind about political leanings.First of all, liberals have their own views about things. They are not likely to be persuaded, regardless of how well-written and clear the conservative's views are.Secondly, those most likely to benefit form this book - the people without political leanings - are not likely to read political books, anyway. Those of us who think deeply about politics have already reached an opinion one way or another.But for those who are just beginning their search for truth, this is a fine book. I would recommend reading this book, and then reading something liberal, and asking yourself which appeals to you the most.I have read dozens of political books during the last year and this one ranks as one of my favorites.Dinesh D'Souza clearly loves the USA, but laments the society forced upon us by the liberal elite."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"I'm disappointed in the reviewers who claim that this book is a K-Mart Coffee Book without depth. The style of writing and audience caters to conservative youth. This isn't meant to be a thesis, but more of a light-hearted handbook for conservatives that may not be completely versed in some controversial and key issues in American politics today. This book is wonderful.It keeps the reader entertained with anecdotes and gives basic but revealing examples of why modern liberalism in America is contrary to common sense. This book isn't for a philosopher. Yes, it is unlike D'Souza's previous works. However, as a high schooler, this book was the perfect tutorial to conservatism that jump-started my interest in politics.I'd recommend it to anyone.Of course the horrid reviews of this book come from those who oppose conservatism. If you don't agree with a political philosophy, you shouldn't condemn the author's background and motives."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"A liberal friend turning more conservative bought this for me since we were constantly arguing. It is difficult to be a young conservative on the east coast (there is an absurd notion that all conservatives are bible belt folk). Absolutely insightful and dense reading."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"I just received D'Souza's book, so I haven't had the chance to read every chapter. The few I have read were very informative, entertaining, and on target concerning the main differences between liberals and conservatives. D'Souza's wry sense of humor is definitely a plus. It's interesting, but hardly startling, that those who gave the book one star are the sort of liberal who resorts to \\"postmodernist gibberish\\" and ad hominem attacks when confronted with facts and common sense. The very things Mr. D'Souza says liberals resort to when they want to avoid hearing the truth about themselves. Referring to Mr. D'Souza as \\"The Gunga Din of Conservatism\\" was supposed to be insulting, I guess. I gather the person who wrote that mistakenly believes that Gunga Din was a member of an oppressed minority in need of protection from evil, conservative white men. If so, then he is sadly ignorant of both Kipling AND D'Souza. I feel this is an excellent book that should, but won't, be required reading for all college freshmen BEFORE they are assaulted with liberal hogwash by their left-wing professors. This book deserves SIX stars!"},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"First off, I am a young conservative, and as such I should like this book. A lot of my friends have recommended it to me, and I loved \\"What's So Great About America\\" and got a lot out of \\"The End of Racism.\\" However, I have three problems with \\"Letters\\": Its arguments are too superficial, it has no logical target audience and its arguments are sometimes faulty.For the record, I know that the book is designed to offer brief arguments for a wide variety of conservative positions. But four pages or so apiece? The ideas barely scratch the surface of conservative thought. If D'Souza increased the length of the book by about 50 percent, and cut out some of the lesser essays (the one on gun control might as well have been two words long: \\"John Lott\\"), he could get more into each issue.Second, it's hard to tell who the book is aimed at. Its title would imply that young conservatives should read it, but if you don't know almost everything that's in this book, you aren't knowledgeable enough to call yourself a conservative.Maybe young liberals can learn something about the right-wing perspective. But if they know enough about their own positions, they probably also know everything contained in this little \\"gem.\\" There's an argument to be made that high schools and colleges don't teach conservative thought, so some of the ideas here might be new to a young liberal - but in that case, lefties are sure to be put off by the tasteless jokes about homosexuality and the often-sarcastic wording.Ditto for people who know almost nothing about politics. They're likely to end the book thinking that conservatives simply delight in making others uncomfortable.Finally, as basic as most of the essays are, some of them have flawed logic. For instance, D'Souza states that liberals think human nature is good, while conservatives think it's bad. This can't explain why liberals think people need to be forced to give to the poor. Nor why conservatives think humans are capable of making their own economic decisions. Both liberals and conservatives think human nature is good and bad, only in different ways.Another ridiculous argument is when he responds to allegations that quotes in his previous books are taken out of context. He says that all quotes are out of context; otherwise, he'd have to quote the whole speech or book in question.I'm sorry, but this has no merit. If I'm talking about Monopoly and say, \\"I always beat my girlfriend,\\" and then someone puts that in an article about domestic violence, that's what we commonly refer to as \\"out of context.\\" It's ridiculous to deny that \\"out of context\\" can ever be a meaningful concept.Essentially, this is far from the end-all-be-all of starter books for conservatives. I wish I had something else to recommend in its place, but every time I've read a book like this I've ended up disappointed. I'd advise getting into each issue separately. For this, D'Souza's recommended reading list at the end is actually useful."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"This book has really opened my eyes to the world.

As one volume in the interesting series, The Art of Mentoring (from Basic Books), D'Souza addresses his conception of conservative politics to a young college student thru a series of brief, witty, and well-informed epistles. As a man who has had an impact on campus conservatism, first as a contributor to the nearly legendary Dartmouth Review and later thru his own books (ILLIBERAL EDUCATION and THE END OF RACISM among others), D'Souza is well-placed to polemicize conservatism for a college audience.

This book is a must-buy for liberals and conservatives. I would encourage liberals to pick it up not to be 'enlightened', but rather, at the very least, to understand where conservatives are coming from. Conservatives will enjoy reading D'Souza's candid analysis of affirmative action, feminism, and multiculturalism.

If you are looking for \\"spin\\" or BS, you won't find it here. Mr. D'Souza has written a book that is packed with liberal vs. conservative arguments and laid out the conservative viewpoint with clear, thoughtful, and straight-forward writing. Although the book is short, it does its job by clearly discussing a variety of topics in which liberals and conservative tend to disagree on. You may not agree with some of his thoughts, but it is hard to argue with him on the same \\"playing field\\" without resorting to some kind of political- read childish- ploy to overcome or end the debate. Although some of the issues covered have more gray areas in them than just the black-white arguments he lays out, it does level the playing field due to the extreme ideas and thoughts many liberals have i.e. on welfare, affirmative action, etc. I agree with 95% of what is writing about, but I do know there is another side and would love for someone to write and educated and well thought out counter to this book. If there is one, please let me know. He also adds in a list of books that have influenced this book and his thoughts (something he did not do in \\"What So Great...\\"). Overall a great book that will give any conservative, young or old, the ammunition needed to counter liberal arguments, ploys and policies."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"I have recently become a big fan of Dinesh D'Souzas writings. After reading his book, &quot;What's So Great About America&quot;, I needed to read more. So I bought this book. I am only on Chaper 3, and am thoroughly impressed again. He is such an intelligent author. He is very educated in what he is writing, and you find yourself agreeing out loud with every sentence written. His thinking is so logical, ethical and impressive - and if we could just make liberals read his work, they would turn Conservative so fast, your head would spin."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"Occasionally a book comes along that validates the old clich&eacute; about being so good that you can't put it down. Dinesh D'Souza's Letters to a Young Conservative is absolutely one such book. In it he writes a series of letters, thirty-one in all, to a fictional young undergraduate conservative named Chris. The premise is that Chris has written D'Souza after seeing him speak at his university. Chris is overwhelmed by the leftist politically correct atmosphere at his college and D'Souza comforts him by giving counsel on every imaginable topic in the realm of ideas. His arguments draw on nearly twenty-five years of street fighting within the conservative movement. This work is part of a series by Basic Books of established older masters offering advice to the young, and includes Christopher Hitchens' outstanding Letters to a Young Contrarian.D'Souza's book is a moving, exquisite pep-talk for all right-minded thinkers regardless of age. It is not an explosive tirade and instead is a series of quiet, rational arguments designed to illustrate that anything is possible if one is reflective and patient. The work is truly deceiving due to its accessibility and style. D'Souza is not verbose and writes highly comprehensible sentences. The clarity of the text is problematic as you may plow through a few pages before realizing that D'Souza has just written something quite profound. As a warning, you should not begin reading this hardback if you have vocational or personal interests that cannot be immediately neglected because the enlightenment the book issues is highly addictive.The material is serious for the most part but there are a few occasions where the reader may find his or her self laughing out loud after ingesting the exploits of D'Souza and his college peers who worked at the samizdat, The Dartmouth Review. They were one of the first, if not the very first, alternative conservative college publications in the country and the militancy of the left at Dartmouth propelled D'Souza to their ranks even though he initially entered college as a liberal.He and his friends bait the existing power hierarchy repeatedly but on no occasion so humorously as when they protest the university's expenditures on the Gay Students' Association. The Dartmouth Review viewed this as being inappropriate and discriminatory as it was awarding funds to individuals based on sexual orientation only. Their way of dealing with the quandary was quite novel to say the least.D'Souza and peers, to illustrate the ridiculousness of such organizations, formed The Dartmouth Bestiality Society and even appointed a president and zookeeper. They then went to the dean to ask for support but the dean responded that no support was necessary as there was no interest in such activities at Dartmouth. The President of the Bestiality Society responded with, \\"That may be true, Dean Hanson, but it is because of centuries of discrimination! Those of us who are inclined toward animals have been systematically excluded and ostracized. Our organization will provide a supportive atmosphere in which people of our particular sexual orientation are treated with respect. At Dartmouth...let us put an end to beast phobia.\\" [p.28] Their method may be extreme but it teaches the moral that ridicule is a potent force when dealing with the absurdity that is multi-cultural theory and diversity in America. They may not have won the battle but nearly everyone held the Gay Students' Association in a different light after their proposal.D'Souza has some very original arguments in the book that should help the reader in dealing with the ever present emotional tirades thrown by liberals. This reviewer's favorite chapter was the one on the temperament of conservatives versus that of liberals. The most important point in the book, and certainly the argument that the author most needed to make, is that conservatives are a far happier lot than liberals. This is due to the fact that we have already embraced the realities of our world and the inherent flaws within human nature. As we view ourselves as being part of a historical continuum, we do not attempt to wrestle with forces that cannot change so we accept our limited place in the scheme of things and never experience emotional meltdown when we discover that legislation cannot alter the flaws of humanity.This book is a recording of quintessential songs to be learned and sung by any who are a David beneath the boot of the leftist Goliath. This Goliath has the media as a sword and the universities and the public schools as his spear, but with the help of D'Souza, independent media outlets, and patriotic fervor, we may be able to stone this unruly Goliath back into the bronze age."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"The mere fact that it has received some 1 star reviews and some 5 star reviews shows that it is a controversial book.

The reader benefits from the author's political experience from his days as founder of the Dartmouth Review, to his work as domestic policy analyst under Ronald Reagan.D'Souza covers a wide array of topics that a student will likely hear on campus from the true nature of political correctness to the causes it champions such as affirmative action, abortion, gun control, anti-globalization, etc. D'Souza can be amusing and irreverant in his descriptions and stories, but is always successful in exposing the liberal agenda truthfully and accurately.Although D'Souza could have expanded his discussion on certain areas, &quot;Letters to a Young Conservative&quot; is a great start for anyone who seeks a broader understanding of politics and the rationale behind various political issues."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"Being a high school student, I get liberalism shoved down my throat every day that I go to school.

Every high school student should read this book because it is an easy, fast reading book that will dispel many of the myths that high school teachers have embedded into our thought process."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"This guy is a right wing zealot who would have been sitting at the back of the bus in 1950's Mississippi for all his embracing of conservative values. I have not read his book and would not give this crackpot hypocrite one dime of my hard earned money. Funny how conservatives who are always yelling about the lack of morality are usually brought down by illicit sex.Note to Mr. D'Souza please divorce your wife before you start introducing your mistress as your fiancee!!!"},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"I read Dinesh D'Souza's \\"What's so great about America?\\" and it is one of my favorite books. So, I decided to try another, and I have to say that there is much to like about this one - even though, in reading conservative books, I have found that I agree 99% of the time with the social and moral positions, but only about 1% of the time with the economic positions.Unfortunately, there is one major social and moral issue with which I must disagree. Mr. D'Souza feels that gays should be allowed to adopt children rather than leave them to foster care. If one believes that such people are psychologically well balanced this would be reasonable. But, after working in health and human services and discussing this issue at length with investigators in adoption and foster care, I am convinced that these people are dangerously dysfunctional. Specifically, I feel that gay men hate themselves and lesbians hate men because of overpopulation and that they pass along their hatred to children, if left in their care.Other than this one very important issue and the economic positions, it was an enjoyable read. It is well written with an interesting format and many excellent arguments. If you are a young conservative - read it!"},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"Dinesh D'Souza did as much as anyone to get the racial debate in this country moving again, with his massive _The End of Racism_. Liberals howled, but they can no longer shout down criticism of affirmative action with accusations of &quot;racism.&quot;D'Souza also gave higher education the sunray treatment, with _Illiberal Education_, which in its turn drew as many squawks as a firecracker in a chicken coop. With that book he proved that the question &quot;When is a racial quota not a racial quota?&quot; has no non-nonsensical answer.So he's entitled to sit back and preen a little, and take a curtain call. But this book feels like it was composed on cocktail napkins during slow moments on airline flights. It's little more than a sheaf of his talking points, &quot;war&quot; stories from his lectures, and assorted zingers, done up as letters to a young conservative.Even that would be okay, if he didn't make lazy errors of fact. For example, in one bit on the Soviet Union, he poo-poos the idea that any empire could dismantle itself solely for economical reasons-apparently forgetting that the British Empire did exactly that.The book is a throwaway, and D'Souza probably knows it. It could have been a small gem, with a little more work."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"I found the arguments to be extremely simple talking points without any intellectual weight to them - the book makes assumptions and then works from them without doing anything to ballast them. For example, a cheap shot at left-wingers - conservatives tend to work in business or sciences which can be backed up with hard data, he says, like economists, while liberals tend to work in less verifiable fields such as sociology where they will have \\"power\\" as professors. Really? Economics may have certain common formulas and a common glossary, though approaches differ and economics (like D'Souza, incidentally, as a commentator) can spout off on ramifications without check or balance as much as they'd like.Left-wingers, he says, think that a \\"fair\\" society is one where they would be rich and successful for their intelligence, while conservatives are rewarded for hard work and business sense. This goes completely against the progressive analysis of inequality in society - either he doesn't know it or prefers not to give this context. Either way the \\"letters\\" format gives D'Souza an excuse not to follow-up on his half-baked neocon ideas and the book serves only as drivel for the Hannitized."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"Dinesh D'Souza is a typical example of the glib and conceited mongers of hardcore political ideas who have experienced little of their own but are merely recycling old ideas with a spin. Its clear that Dinesh has not experienced any kind of hardship faced by many people in America, he appears to be a member of an ethnic minority brought up in a privileged environment and lacks the appreciation of knowing what its like to fail at something or the struggle to achieve success. Fact is, none of the various theories he sells in his book are his own, this is not an original piece of writing. I found the book disappointing and tiresome and outright irritating. He is slick with his tongue and has brainwashed himself to such an extent that his views on political theories have become warped and lack any semblance of due dilligence and balance. He is not a scientist and at most would make a good car salesman. I wonder if Dinesh D'Souza has ever done anything at any point of his life that has been for the great benefit for any one person let alone the American people he speaks for. He's obviously written this book (with a large photograph of himself on the cover!) to aggrandize himself and make money in the process. This book will not solve anyones problems. A shallow book written by a myopic ego-maniac author, only another intellectually bankrupt person like Sean Hannity (who is hardly a person to aspire to) would endorse cheap and forgetable pulp non-fiction like this. As a moderate conservative I'm ashamed to be associated with his theories."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"This book, while mostly fluent and often entertaining, is fundamentally flawed.(In the interest of full disclosure, I come to this judgment as a fan of both G. W. Bush and Ronald Reagan, as a Catholic-raised and Jesuit-minded atheist, as an open 'bisexual' who rejects the notion of 'gay' identity, as a well-read fan of the likes of G.K. Chesterton, Christopher Hitchens, Ann Coulter, Ayn Rand, Camille Paglia and William F. Buckley, and as a reader who wanted to like this book.)The work has three main flaws. It is too ambitious for the skill and effort demonstrated. It preaches to the choir. And it is gratuitously snide and self-contradictorily condescending.The book gets off to a rough start on page three where D'Souza begins:\\"The term \\"liberal,\\" in its [!] Greek meaning....\\"This is a sloppy mistake from a Stanford scholar and former senior White House analyst. \\"Liber-\\" is a Latin root, the Greek for free(man) is \\"eleutheros.\\" The author and editor both deserve a ruler across the knuckles from Fr. Grammaticus, S.J., for that mistake.Saying he has matured from his sophomoric days, D'Souza tries to hard to be serious yet funny. At best, he comes across as less witty than Buckley, less biting than Coulter, less self-aware than Paglia, and totally out of Rand's league, whom he damns with faint praise in his suggested reading list. (Perhaps this last comparison is unfair.)And, of course, as D\\"Souza says, making \\"lefties\\" turn apoplectic is loads of fun. A politically correct, tweed-and-goateed college professor once told my (all white) literature class that we were all \\"ignorant racists\\" who \\"couldn't even prove [we] exist[ed.]\\" In response, the editor of my college paper threw a penknife at the prof's head which stuck in the wall behind him with a thud, six inches from his left ear. When asked whether the knife \\"existed?\\" the professor responded, \\"Class dismissed.\\" D'Souza's reported college exploits pale in comparison.Second, the book never puts forth any original solutions or formulations. It merely reassures an admittedly \\"young conservative\\" that liberals are often worth laughing at. This may be quite true, but Republican Ann Coulter and (?post-)Marxist Christopher Hitchens do so, write so, and say so much better. Their works are quite highly recommended.D'Souza offers no arguments other than the implied equation Christian=moral=Republican=JustifiedFinally, D'Souza's repeated jabs at homosexuals are inappropriate, and his suggestion that conservatives \\"forget about\\" the 'black' vote is abominable.His homophobic (a word I hate, but which here has no substitute,) references are embarrassing.At one point, D'Souza nervously jokes that a man says:\\"I approve of homosexuality he said, half in Ernest.\\" [Sic.]During college orientation, the fetching D'Souza is told to \\"look the person on either side of him\\" and realize that at least \\"one of the three\\" would have a homosexual experience before leaving college. Rather than ask, as I did at mine, \\"How do you know, and what gives you the right to lecture me on the topic?\\" he makes a mental note to \\"avoid\\" the two men for his stay at Dartmouth. Fearing what? This is more like a bad frat joke than the work of a serious scholar.He describes the homosexuality as a \\"lifestyle\\" choice, yet also seems to believe that homosexuality is involuntary. He conflates the \\"gay\\" movement (which he sometimes seems to realize is a silly modern leftist aberration) with _homosexuality_ which is universal in all cultures.[The curious and unafraid \\"young conservative\\" should research the words _shaman_ and _berdache_ and the stories of Achilles, Hadrian, and Alexander the Great, and their loves.]And while I agree entirely with D'Souza's critique of \`gay' marriage, (for which he puts forth no serious arguments) I don't see him reaching out here to young homosexual conservatives. We do exist.His comments on homosexuality in the military were ignorant, and frankly incoherent. (Again, see the Greeks)He also nominally distinguishes between individuals of \`African-American' (i.e., former-slave) heritage and the existence of a so-called \`black community.' Yet he advocates that Republicans \\"give up\\" on blacks and work on attracting Latinos and Asians as a more expedient political tactic. This is rank Us-versus-Them tribalism. Partisanship - not principle.[And, by Asians, does he mean Anatolians?]To be brief, after reading Christopher Hitchens' work \\"Letters to a Young Contrarian\\" in the same series, I fully hoped to enjoy this book. But I cannot say it was worth the purchase price.I rated it with one star to weight the bias of reviews that praise it, the book is worth perhaps two or two-and-a-half, if one is charitable.I have not read D'Souza's other works, yet am willing to give him a second chance - from a lending library.Pick up a copy of Ann Coulter's paperback edition of \\"How to Talk to a Liberal\\" Instead."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"In her book Slander, Ann Coulter tries to demonstrate the liberal bias in the publishing industry by complaining that Dinesh D'Souza received a mere 150,000-dollar advance on his latest book, Letters to a Young Conservative. Regardless of whether or not Coulter is right about the bias, she could not have chosen a worse book to demonstrate her point.Letters to a Young Conservative is a collection of 31 letters to an imaginary conservative student named Chris. D'Souza enlightens Chris on what conservatives should think about public policy, philosophy, and history. Although he takes a genuinely conservative stand on some issues, he usually defends them with clich&eacute;s like &quot;more guns mean less crime&quot; or on leftist terms. For example, while he complains about the &quot;self-esteem hoax,&quot; his principle complaint about affirmative action is that it &quot;increases doubts of black capacity.&quot; On many other issues he simply takes liberal or irrational positions.One letter implores Chris to avoid the &quot;libertarian temptation.&quot; He explains that libertarians believe that freedom is the greatest end, if not the only end, and that for the libertarian philosophy to work, one must believe that &quot;human nature is so good that it is virtually flawless.&quot; D'Souza claims that a pure libertarian would have no problem if everyone in America would become a pornographer. Given that the libertarians seem to be totally amoral and on the side of the Left in what is the &quot;root&quot; difference between liberals and conservatives (their view of human nature), one wonders why a &quot;vast programmatic agreement&quot; would exist between libertarians and conservatives.The reason is because D'Souza greatly misinterprets libertarianism. As Lord Acton said, liberty is the highest political end, not the meaning of life. As D'Souza acknowledges, libertarianism is only a political philosophy, not a way to view the world. Therefore, there is nothing inherent in libertarian philosophy to suggest that libertarians should be culturally libertine.In another letter, D'Souza accuses Gore Vidal of being anti-American because he questions the benevolence of American foreign policy. One of Vidal's latest books is called Perpetual War for Perpetual Peace, but in D'Souza's case, it could be called Perpetual War for the Perpetual Lesser Evil. According to the lesser evil doctrine, which is our &quot;central principle of foreign policy,&quot; America &quot;is always justified in supporting a bad regime to overthrow a regime that is even worse,&quot; regardless of whether the worse regime was installed by America in the first place.D'Souza tells us we must &quot;give bayonets a chance&quot; and impose democracy across the world. He celebrates the dropping of the atomic bomb on Japan and the firebombing of German civilians, because it gave them democracy. And he has the gall to accuse liberals of lacking the &quot;practical moral reasoning that foreign policy requires.&quot;D'Souza isn't much better when it comes to immigration. He makes a few tired claims that immigrants are good for the economy because they do the jobs Americans won't. However, he refuses to address the burden they disproportionately add to the welfare state. He simply says to get rid of the welfare. Similarly, he rejects the cultural argument against immigration, by claiming that most of the problems with assimilation are due to white liberals. This may be partially true, but given that we are not likely to get rid of multiculturalism or the welfare state anytime soon, why would D'Souza want more immigration in the meantime?Perhaps the worst letter is the one where Chris asks &quot;Was Lincoln a Bad Guy?&quot; Chris was shocked to see conservatives criticize Lincoln. &quot;Wasn't he a Republican?&quot; he naively asks. D'Souza takes this as an opportunity to address the attacks made upon Lincoln by those on the Right and Left. D'Souza creates a straw man who says that the war wasn't over slavery, and so Lincoln was wrong to stop secession. To prove these people wrong, he simply gives a few quotes by Alexander Stephens and John C. Calhoun that defended slavery. This is beside the point. Even if slavery was the reason why the South seceded, it clearly was not the reason why the North tried to stop them. Lincoln said time after time that the war was to preserve the union and not to end slavery. So the issue is whether or not the South had a right to secede. D'Souza's only arguments against secession is that it is impossible for a constitutional democracy to function if states could secede, and that no party can unilaterally withdraw out of a contract. If this were true, a battered wife would not be allowed to leave her abusive husband unless he gave his consent.D'Souza refuses to look at Lincoln with any sort of historic perspective. His straw man accuses Lincoln of creating the modern welfare state, something that no prominent Lincoln critic has argued. However, many have argued the political centralization that took place under Lincoln's presidency made the New Deal and Great Society possible. Similarly, rather than admit that Lincoln's politically incorrect views on race &quot;were a product of his time,&quot; he tries to pretend that clearly racist statements by Lincoln were somehow anti-racist.D'Souza outdoes himself in a number of other ways. He praises Bill Clinton for his commitment to NAFTA and the WTO. He tells the Republicans to play down social issues to appeal to rich white yuppies, and he celebrates the ouster of Augusto Pinochet.Perhaps I am being too harsh on D'Souza. I assumed that as a young conservative, I was part of the book's target audience, but if this is what passes for conservatism these days, I am definitely no conservative.my review from Lewrockwell.com"},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"A short list of things you would be better serviced spending your time doing:1) Picking the lint out of your belly button2) Eating paint chips3) Playing \\"find that smell\\"4) Looking for half-eaten food in a local dumpster5) Eating that food"},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"This book is nothing new! It is just the same garbage in a different package. Is this truly what America is about: Conservative vs. Liberal? Anyone who is truly in the mainstream of America knows that the majority of Americans share both conservative and liberal ideas, they are not mutally exclusive. We need less of this either or garbage, and more reality."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"In his \\"Letters,\\" D'Souza contrasts the authentic liberalism of the Greeks and the Founding Fathers with the principles of New Deal: he seems to think that Franklin Roosevelt is to blame for the belief that true political freedom is only possible if one possesses the necessities of life. This is at best a flagrant distortion. For the Greeks &#65533; or at least for Plato (in the Laws) and Aristotle &#65533; the good state requires that its citizens have ample means to provide for themselves without having to resort to illiberal occupations (such as business, trade). When Plato (or, more precisely, the Athenian stranger) sets out the laws for a well governed, though not ideal, state, he is insistent on the need to prevent the formation of great disparities in wealth. In Classical Greek thought, \\"freedom\\" was never understood in terms of abstract rights or as an inherent quality of a human being, but principally as the condition of somewhat who, not having to direct all his energies to the bare necessities of life and not consumed by the inherently slavish desire for possessions and pleasures, is able to devote himself to the political life of the state and to the cultivation of his body and mind.No less troubling is D'Souza's interpretation of Rousseau: faith in the intrinsic goodness of human nature is practically a common-place of the Enlightenment and hardly Rousseau's invention. It is opposed not to the Greek, but to the Christian tradition, with its doctrine of original sin. It is, indeed, implicit in Aristotle's ethical theory: humans are by nature rational animals, and virtuous actions are those that accord with reason. Those who are not merely intemperate but bestial are not bad human beings, but scarcely human beings at all &#65533; aberrations of human nature. Rousseau's theory of \\"society\\" and its relation to \\"nature\\", his emphasis on pedagogy, his criticism of the corrupting effect of the arts and sciences, in fact all represent a return to an extremely Greek conception of politics. Good laws make good human beings, and one of the greatest responsibilities of the city-state is the proper formation of the character of youths, and the education of the passions (which is Rousseau's basic concern) stands at its very heart.Conservatives like D'Souza like to don the mantel of the Western Tradition. Perhaps they should try reading it for a change."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"I bought this book when it first came out. I must say that I enjoyed every part of it. I have since loaned it out to students of mine who say they are conservative, but feel embattled by the current culture in America. I think this book does a great job of steeling the nerves of those young conservatives with good fact-based opinions.Any young person will get a good primer for their beliefs, and then they will be armed intellectually for the fight against the left. The page on suggested further reading is well supplied as well. There are a plethora of good resources out there, but D'Souza tries his best to give a good accounting of the major books on conservatism.The other book that is left off, and I think it came out after this one, is William F. Buckley's Miles Gone By, which is his literary autobiography.Above all else, this book will help the young person who has conservative predilections defend themselves against unwarranted attacks by the left. That in and of itself is an important thing to consider.

It is very interesting and very educational, no matter what side of the political isle your views lie on.

I actually sent him an email asking for a clarification on one of the chapters of the book (regarding same-sex marriage), and though I will leave you in suspense by not telling you what he told me (it would take too long here), I will tell you that he and I actually had a bit of an email conversation ... something I never would have expected from a best-selling author and former White House staffer like himself. Who knew he would actually take time out of his busy day to answer random emails from a nobody like myself?Totally impressed."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"This is a funny book, it actually make me laugh out loud a few times.

I should not be criticize because I do not like Al Gore anymore, which is exactly what happened. I got spit on by some mentally deranged liberal in college because I question Al Gore's argument over the Global Warming, and I do not even know who this person is, he just happen to overheard what me and my teammates were debating about.

I was not dissapointed. Unlike a lot of political books out there, this one is easy to read, entertaining, and to the point. If you have any questions about what conservatives believe and why, or just want to better aquaint yourself with hot political issues from a conservative perspective, you need to read this book. In fact, whether you are young or old, conservative or liberal, you need this book to round out your library."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"Dinesh D'Souza is smart, and I would not want to engage him in a debate without considerable preparation, because he is an accomplished rhetorician, who solidly grasps historical facts and conservative tradition.This book provides pithy descriptions of modern liberalism (not classical liberalism, which overlaps quite considerably with modern conservatism), conservatism and libertarianism. Within conservatism, distinctions are drawn between the European \\"throne and alter\\" strand, and the American strand that developed in the colonies, culminating in the Revolution.As other reviewers have pointed out, the chapters in this book can be used to construct a series of cheat sheets of conservative talking points and their support. The construction and mechanics of D'Souza's arguments are solid; once one accepts their premises, it is very difficult to not accept their conclusions, even if one approaches the book from a quite different position than the author's.D'Souza's premises, therefore, are where one can aim an initial response. One such premise is the addition of \\"virtue\\" to the classical liberal belief in religious, expressive, economic and political freedom. Other freedoms are not part of traditional liberalism, such as the New Deal's freedom from want, or the 1960's \\"liberation\\" philosophy (attributed by D'Souza to Rousseau) in which moral freedom challenged the previous moral order. Virtue in this context has a specific set of meanings including \\"merit, patriotism, prosperity, national unity, social order, morality, responsibility,\\" and NOT \\"equality, compassion, pluralism, diversity, social justice, peace, autonomy, tolerance.\\" (pp 7-8)Second, there is a fundamental belief in \\"warped timber of humanity\\": \\"Conservatives recognized that there are two principles in human nature--good and evil--and they are in constant conflict.\\" By contrast, liberals are seen as nave because they claim \\"conflicts in the world are not the result of good versus evil; rather they arise out of terrible misunderstandings.\\" (p9)Third, when freedom and virtue themselves are in conflict, then \\"the best argument for freedom in is not that it is an end in itself but that it is the necessary prerequisite for choosing what is right.\\" (p14) There we have it, virtue (in its specific meaning) is more important than freedom. And if there is prevailing liberal culture, then \\"one must seek to undermine it, to thwart it, to destroy it at the root level. This means that the conservative must stop being conservative.\\" (p25)Fourth, \\"religion is primary source of morality.\\" (p111).Fifth, actions taken out of self-interest, even when they impinge on the freedoms of other people are justified: \\"To ask a nation to ignore its own self-interest is tantamount to asking it to put aside the welfare of its people.\\" (p207). This point may be used to justify the dictatorships of people such as Somoza, Pinochet and Marcos (p206).Sixth, Violence in the course of legitimate aims is necessary and appropriate. \\"The problem with liberals is that they never give bayonets a chance.\\" (p209). I'll digress slightly and point out this often used technique in the book, which is oversimplifying or misstating liberal positions. Most modern liberals support the use of force in the appropriate circumstances. But this is a minor quibble, because every essayist does this to some extent.Seventh, \\"Even hypocrisy--professing one thing but doing another--is in the conservative view preferable to a denial of standards.\\" (p6).Readers can form their opinions about D'Souza's premises, and then judge his arguments, which are forceful and support modern conservative positions on affirmative action, taxes, multiculturalism, use of military, gay marriage, left-wing judges, the 3/5 clause in the constitution, guns, postmodernists and many other topics. In pointing out these premises, some may accuse me of quoting out of context, but here D'Souza himself comes to my defense: \\"All quotations are out of context\\" (p139).A final note about the background on how D'Souza became a conservative at Dartmouth: He was very impressed by Jeffrey Hart, a professor of English there and a senior editor at the National Review magazine. Dr. Hart, who wore buttons saying things like \\"soak the poor.\\" Dr. Hart, who liked to interrupt colleagues in faculty meetings by churning a noisy wooden rotary device. To victim of aids, Dr. Hart suggested a tattoo on their buttocks stating \\"abandon all hope, ye who enter here.\\" Nice mentor.D'Souza also became involved with the Dartmouth review and liked its tactics and humor: \\"We were not above ad hominem attacks\\". Members of the review satirized the gay students society by finding the Dartmouth Bestiality Society\\" and appointed \\"a president, a vice president, a treasurer and a zookeeper\\". Such wit. One of the columnists of the review quipped \\"The question is not whether women should be educated at Dartmouth. The question is whether women should be educated at all.\\" Compelling and funny stuff."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"I was expecting a bit more from Dinesh D'Souza, while the book touches several themes at the core of American Conservatism it was dissapointing in that it somewhat pandered to a style of writing similar to Sean Hannity and Ann Coulter. Basically, it could have had more depth."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"If you want to get introduced to the radical conservative concept in plain english you can probably read the book. The book, quite disappointingly, doesn't present logical arguments which is quite putting off for a rational reader. I'll quote an example from Chapter 9 (Why Government Is The Problem):\\"It is one thing for the government to provide the basic necessities of life to the \\"truly needy,\\" people, a group that would include the poor, the sick and the disabled. It is another thing for government to take resources from one middle-class family and give them to another middle-class family. This happens when, for example, the government builds a mass transit system. People who prefer to drive cars must prefer to pay for the transportation preferences of the people who prefer to take the subway.\\"Now from above argument it seems that people driving cars are doing some kind of charitable favour to people taking the subway. But how about people riding in subways paying for the freeways/highways other people drive their vehicles on.And similarily all over the book the arguments are pretty loose and unappealing. Another example in chapter 14 (Why Professors Are So Left-Wing):\\"Conservatives tend to go to business because they care more about money; liberals tend to into the academy because they care more about power\\".I am not sure if I understand the above argument but it seems illogical for people to join academia if they are hungry for power - don't know if there is a \\"How to become a US Senator for Dummies\\" but I don't think it would recommend becoming a faculty member in an Ivy League school if one is looking for a seat in Congress."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"Although I am a young, progressive, Minnesota liberal I found this book to be intensely entertaining. It answered many of my questions about conservatism...all those times I've knotted my brow and exclaimed with absolute fury and frustration, &quot;how could anybody actually think that!?!&quot; D'Souza lays out quite nicely how all this garbage gets shoveled in the brains of mindless youth like &quot;Chris&quot; who are more interested in rebelling against their feminist professors than anything else. While I've also felt rage towards some of my professors who refuse, absolutely refuse, to be pragmatic, this has not caused me to run out an become a facist.

This is bestseller material, and I mean this in all of the derogatory senses of the word. If you are a person who wants to be challenged, you will find this condescending and stultifying - unless it only poorly reformulates what you already believe. Very oversimplified thinking and ridiculing slander of the other camp - good for reconvincing the shallow among the convinced."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"Well, Well, Dinesh, is my new favourite story-teller.He keeps you interested in his story, never letting you off for a moment. I would definitely like to read more of his books, his style is very captivating. If you need to know the difference between a Liberal, a Conservative and a Libertarian, well, you have it here.You don't have to agree with everything that he says, but he does say it in a style of his own. I for one did not like some points, e.g. His grandmother seems to be more aware of Nixon than Reagan!(what is the point? an uneducated grandmother OR a unrecognized president?) Well, it may be a joke for him, but there is that air of condecension which is found more in a native born American, or a rebel immigrant, carried away by the love for his new found land and it big roads and flashing lights, where he could make it big. The kind of people who tell you how to pronounce a word, when no intelligible conversation can be carried out. But that is besides the point.His sucking up to Reagan is very evident, he was pampered with a job of course. Giving credit to Reagan for Gorbachev's work is pathetic. OK, he says that Gorbachev's earlier speeches indicate his leaning. I ask you, perceptive reader...can you take a moderate stance and become a leader in a communist country. And then, can you dismantle the organisation from the outside. NO, Gorbachev did what a good leader should do, bide for his time, make the system moderate and then use it to his advantage. Reagan, just happened to be president at that time. If Nixon was OR Clinton was...he would have got the credit, just the same. I am not saying Reagan was not a good president, actually he is in my opinion one of the best presidents that the US has seen. His attitude(even with his supposed shortcomings was great because he believed in himself. He had an aura around him, that was befitting the title of a president.Another issue with which I have an issue is his apparent 'dumb it down' argument with Gun control. I completely agree with him about the issue that owning guns act as a deterrent. But his example of kids dying more from accidents and in bath-tubs than by using guns which are not well hidden from children.(The argument being, that what is the use of something, if you don't find it when you really need it!). OK, you have it here, so my argument is, what is the probability of your house being mugged? Is it higher than that of your child using the unappropriately placed gun?). Let us get the fact straight, a deterrent is a deterrent and not a toy. Adults should be held responsible for the use of guns by their children and others. You cannot have the right to carry a gun and whine of its misuse. Only responsible people need to own a gun.Another issue with which I did not agree was the use of Standardized tests. For one thing, most of them are based on speed. If everyone competing at the olympics had to run the 100m dash before qualifying, then we would have very few who ran the marathon. I still feel, from personal experience, that the tests are not designed for everybody(and I am not at all talking about race or under-privileged status here!). To give you one more example. How does a person who scores a 550 on a GMAT, but shown exemplary skill by climbing mount everest, demonstrate his/her ability to get through the &quot;tough&quot; academics at Stanford. One more reason for the &quot;Diversity&quot; bs. OK, atleast admit the PC. There are ways to get into a coveted school...and then there are ways to convince the admission boards, and then there are other ways too...My take is 99% if those admitted make it throught the course, above a score which is challenging enough, whether you write an application essay or not. These &quot;FIT&quot; things are meant to straighten the mess created by these standardized tests, thats all and maybe create some jobs! How do you know what fits me better? you don't even know my size!!!It will be unfair to Dinesh if I just mentioned only incidents which give a negative impression of him, but rest assured, you can trust me, since I read his book very objectively, that it will be more than worth your time. There is some truth in everything he says. He makes valid reasonings and does not play the 'Alterman' card(your point is invalid since your stats deviated by 1-2%). He addresses issues that are diverse and controversial, issues like post-modern and multi-cultural and affirmation without trying to woo you to his camp.I will highly recommend this book. This book is for everybody, despite its conservative slant. I bet you will enjoy it, and have a good laugh every now and then.(Just, don't get carried away, while you are laughing!)."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"While reading this I have to admit that I wish D'Souza had written it ten years ago when I was just starting university. It would have saved me reinventing the wheel as a campus activist and learning the hard way some of the lessons he teaches in Letters to a Young Conservative. It's almost a given that the higher the amount of vitriol leveled at a conservative the more spot on they are about the issues and D'Souza takes a lot of flack over what he writes. This book shows you why. His essential points: use the truth, be fearless and never stop fighting. A worthy guide for campus conservatives."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"Attending a college university, I needed this book as a sort of chickens soup if you will due to the hard left constantly shoving it's messages down your throats. Being a young conservative, it became very easy to feel persecuted in my beliefs. Yes, liberals, I felt persecuted in many of my classes where we were asked to openly speak our beliefs and opinions. I shared some of my own beliefs regarding free enterprise, support for the 2nd amendment, low taxes, and small government. I never imposed my beliefs on anyone or told anyone that they need to feel the way I do, but somehow multiple leftist professors felt justified in criticizing, singling me out, and ridiculing me in the middle of class. Great, academia hard at work. Anyway, it's not my intention to make this review a complaining session but this book was given to me by my father who knew that today's liberal elite college campuses make sure that there is plenty of room for diversity (that is diversity minus one).Dinesh covers almost every topic that might come up in a typical college debate, and does so with wit and humor. I highly recommend it for any conservative student, or simply a new college student who is in danger of being told to \\"leave behind everything your parents taught you\\"."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"Dinesh D'Souza is an Indian immigrant who served as an author of the Dartmouth Review during his days at the college, and subsequently became a policy analyst for President Ronald Reagan. He is one of the leaders of modern intellectual conservatism, much to the ire of old Dartmouth alumni.When I picked up \\"Letters to a Young Conservative\\", I described myself as a \\"skeptical conservative\\". I supported private industry, but also liked minimum wage; I supported tax cuts, but also wanted more welfare spending; I opposed affirmative action, but only because it was being mismanaged. In short, I liked both liberal ideals and conservative ideals, and wanted to take both sides.D'Souza destroyed my addiction to fence-hopping. He's an excellent, witty writer; even the sections of the book which themes I took no interest in prior, such as feminism, held my attention the whole time. I agreed with every sentence, and only put the book down to get a drink.Let me give you an example. Before, I was skeptical about President Abraham Lincoln. I admired that he freed the slaves, but did not fancy the fact that he was racist himself; or that his war efforts were so destructive; or that he imprisoned so many people during wartime. In but maybe 20 pages, D'Souza turned me into an adamant fan of Lincoln.Many conservatives are afraid to make the jump to the right-wing, because they still have doubts in the back of their mind that maybe welfare is better for society; that maybe affirmative action is necessary to end racial disparity; that maybe gun control protects our freedoms. If you are one of those, I strongly recommend you read this book to cross the chasm."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"When I first picked up this book I was not sure as to whether or not I would enjoy the book. But I must say I was quite surprised, and excited after reading the first few pages. This book is a good read for anyone who is interested in politics, but more importantly this book is entertaining. Mr. D'Souza is a talented and spirited writer who leads the reader through this book with many point proving, and sometimes funny stories."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"I read this book to learn about conservative thought. Although not a conservative myself I was interested in learning what the other half thinks. I believe I have made a start in this but only a start. The chapters in this book are short introductions to facets of conservative thought such as opposition to big government and opposition to affirmative action except for the authors support of socio economic affirmative action. Throughout, the philosophy of conservative thinking such as the belief that traditional values should be upheld is espoused. I believe I got a good introduction to conservative thinking from this book. As an added bonus the author lists books for further reading at the end of the book. Although this book has not changed my underlying moderate philosophy it has made me think. It is interesting how people can take the same set of data and come to different conclusions about it. D'Souza thinks that the increasing gap between the rich and the poor is a sign of progress in that there are more rich people while liberals are worried about it's consequences. I recommend this book for anyone wanting to learn about conservative thinking."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"... It is something like a Shorter Catechism; topics are introduced, the Conservative stance clearly and succinctly presented, but there is little depth.I presume this is intentional, and am gratified to see the short list of essential readings in the back of the book.Conservatives have opportunities on every side in this new century to achieve great things and perhaps undo some of the damage leftists have perpetrated on world culture.As Mr. D'Souza points out, left to their own, socialists argue against their own point of view most effectively. This is seldom covered in the popular press. Gee, fancy that.One can hope that work like this will pique the interest of young people, who will then, one continues to hope, investigate Conservative thinkers in more depth.I wish something like this had been around in 1969, when I was, ahem, waving my freak flag high.Closer to 4.5 stars -- buy several and hand them out to young and old. Donate copies to your library if they don't have this - particularly your college or university libraries."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"A wonderfully readable summary of many of the key elements of conservatism. Dinesh's only shortfall here is an underappreciation of the importance of our Christian legacy on our American republic. Not just for the young!"},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"I am a student at a secular university. Every single day in the classroom, I receive the liberal argument for the acceptability of abortion, the evils of prosperity and capitalism and more often than not, I return discouraged and slightly confused. This book actually travels with me wherever I go. It is accessible, riotously funny at points, and so concise. I feel like I receive an injection of solid conservatism every time I read it. Mr. D'Souza is unafraid and politely agressive. His arguments are well-thought out, appealing, and solid. I recommend this book to all of my peers."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"Being only 21 and stalwartly conservative, I bought this book to see what D'Souza has to say to people like me. Having read and enjoyed \\"Illiberal Education\\" and read and respectfully disagreed with \\"The Enemy at Home,\\" I knew I was in for a treat whether I agreed with the book's content wholeheartedly or not.Needless to say, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Not only is this book an excellent handbook for young conservatives, but it is also a primer on conservative ideas. I would recommend this book to not only every young conservative, but also to adults who are new conservatives and want to immerse themselves in conservative ideas.The book can be dry in some portions but, by and large, it is a witty, well-written and fantastically readable book. While some may totally disagree with his, or aspects of his, ideology, I think it is a general consensus that Mr. D'Souza can actually write. As I have said before in other book reviews, it is supremely disconcerting to read books that are churned out by semi-literates--especially when they sell hundreds of thousands of copies and people fulsomely praise these authors as literary geniuses.Nevertheless, this book has some very strong chapters. I found the chapter entitled \\"The Libertarian Temptation\\" to be exceptional. The main difference between conservatism and libertarianism is that the latter is a philosophy that is entirely devoid of morality and godliness. That is not to say that libertarians are licentious societal deviants, but their philosophy is at odds with the sentiment that morality ought to be enforced or legislated; they, rather jejunely, only focus on freedom from government. Conservatism, on the other hand, argues that there is a moral standard that ought to be enforced by the government in order to protect the freedom of the masses. Dinesh D'Souza does a magnificent job explaining this.The other chapter I thoroughly enjoyed was \\"How to Harpoon a Liberal.\\" I am from the school of thought that if you are going to effectively cut through the hegemonic dominance of liberalism and its ideas in the minds of people who have been heavily indoctrinated into it, you've got to cause some kind of intellectual trauma. Conservatives are fighting a losing battle if they think they can simply get their ideas across to the young liberals by simply writing tepidly erudite pieces. Liberalism is so pervasive that conservatives have to do some \\"shock the jock\\" writing in order to put out our ideas. Writers like Dinesh D'Souza and Ann Coulter manage to be erudite, yet simultaneously witty. It's for this reason that they are so dangerous to the left and are massively successful at gaining converts.Although I enjoyed the book, there were a few portions where D'Souza's arguments left a little to be desired. For example, I found his chapter on gays/gay marriage to be particularly weak, inasmuch as it was based on a woman being able to tame a man and not on the more germane biological inconsistencies of homosexuality. That being said, I agreed with D'Souza's assessments.The other area of contention that I had with D'Souza was his argument--in \\"A Republican Realignment?\\"--that the Republican Party should forget about blacks and focus on other ethnic groups, since blacks are more likely to assiduously vote Democratic. I found this argument to be dangerous as it encourages Republican laziness vis-&agrave;-vis the recruitment of blacks into the party, and reaching black neighborhoods--which is the precise reason for their aversion to the Republicans in the first place.The reason the Republicans have had a difficult time capturing black votes is because they have capitulated to Democrats in the fight for black votes, which D'Souza further encourages them to do.To the contrary, what Republicans need to do is get the message out to underclass black people that Democrats are causing their social ills and not remedying them. They need to find articulate orators who can go into black neighborhoods and inform them of the liberal conspiracy to keep them poor by addicting them to governmental crumbs, while blinding their eyes to the entrepreneurial and educational possibilities that America is replete with that would inevitably lift them out of the cycle of poverty.Democrats have been using blacks as livestock, who in return for graze, unthinkingly go to pull the lever for everything with a (D) after its name in the voting booth.D'Souza's argument is particularly dangerous because it presents as though blacks are hermetically concealed to understanding facts, when the truth of the matter is that there has been no Republican voice that has articulately presented any.Overall, this is an excellent book from D'Souza."},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Conservative","review":"The title is misleading on this book.Letters to a Young Conservative is a book for all those who would like a primer on American conservatism, regardless of age or political party. In the milieu of political labels and name-calling, I wonder if the average American knows what it means to be a conservative. Dinesh D'Souza's book will help you understand what it means and what its implications are.Since it is a collection of personal letters to a college student named Chris, the main focus is what it means to be a conservative in the university setting today. One can see the difficulties in how such students are harassed and belittled and silenced in the academic realm. D'Souza offers insight in why this occurs, along with reasons to fight against the liberal machine as \\"conservative radicals.\\"Letters to a Young Conservative is more than a book of advice; it is a treatise on how conservatism is a better answer to political issues and problems facing America, whether racism, immigration, or \\"family values.\\" He offers two powerful chapters on polarizing issues of abortion and gay marriage that clearly define an alternative viewpoint than The New York Times offers.Being a minority and immigrant himself, Dinesh D'Souza's discussions of race and affirmative action were especially interesting and helpful. Those chapters alone make this book a worthy read.You may disagree with his conclusions, but at least this book explains American conservatism more accurately than Keith Olbermann does. Unfortunately, liberals allow Olbermann's and other clownish TV commentator's antics to define what the other side believes. This book clarifies conservatism beyond mere mockery.This is an excellent resource for high school seniors to read as they prepare for not only college but also for their first voting opportunity. As a teacher, I envision using chapters to help define the political philosophy to foster healthy, productive discussions of American politics.I hope that I did not make this sound like a stuff textbook. Dinesh D'Souza often has a humorous style of writing that will engage and equip the reader."},{"Title":"Worried All the Time: Rediscovering the Joy in Parenthood in an Age of Anxiety","review":"David Anderegg offers down to earth advice for parents of infants to teenagers that encourages both a joyful parenting and childhood experience. At the same time the book is entertaining and humorous. And I especially love the Try This at Home ideas he provides at the end of each chapter. I also really benefited from his discussion of TV and media.I am the mother of an infant (and hope to have more children someday), so I have many years ahead of me as a parent and I'm glad to have read this book now. Even if I didn't have children I would still have enjoyed this book because it is an interesting look at our culture through the generations. And I also would have loved this book before my daughter's birth when I worked in baby/childcare.I really agree with David Anderegg when he explains how a parent's worries stems from his or her own life being reflected onto the child. Before I had my daughter I had many worries rooting back to my own experiences growing up that I had to work on before having children. Now as a mother I understand that my daughter is her own person with her own life. I see my daughter's unique personality already in her calm, joyful, curious ways. I'm having too much fun watching her grow and explore to worry. I see her security and contentment.This book will ease unnecessary worries, help you examine yourself, help you relax and enjoy parenthood, and give you information to help you direct your worries to where they really belong. As a new parent it never hurts to get a little wisdom and guidance."},{"Title":"The History of the Mongol Conquests","review":"How could I have lived for so long without the knowledge that's in this book? It's essential for understanding our (and \\"their\\") history. I had no idea of the permanent impact the Mongol infiltration of western Asia & eastern Europe had on the development of societies not only there but in Europe (and probably China, but most of the book is spent in Asia). They were only in control for about 100 years, but they weren't just mean tourists or hit-and-run snipers. And I had no idea that Turks (who, as a people, did a dry run of the Mongol invasion 5 or 600 years earlier) were originally from north of the Gobi desert. I had no idea of the degree of commercial and intellectual communication between China and the west that far back. And if you want to understand the rise of Islam, you must read this book. If you want to understand the nature of Russia, you must read this book. There's so much more. The book seems well researched, and the author seems to let us know when he's hypothesizing. This is a book to buy & keep."},{"Title":"The History of the Mongol Conquests","review":"This is not for the lighthearted reader, but it is a fairly thorough review of the subject, and the author seems to have done rigorous analysis before asserting anything that may not be true. In that sense, you can accept this book with confidence. One annoyance is that the amount of notes is considerable, and they are all at the end of the book instead of the bottom of pages. So you find yourself flipping to the notes to get background information that probably could and should have been included in the text to allow for more fluid reading. It reads a little more slowly than your typical nonfiction book."},{"Title":"The History of the Mongol Conquests","review":"This book written by J.J. Saunders was originally published in 1971 and its continued production speaks volumes for the interest in the subject matter that he is writing about. The Mongol conquests were a fascinating period of history, although for the people of the times looking out from their villages as the Mongol warriors charged in on their steppe ponies, terror was probably more apt. Saunders covers a significant amount of time and territory across his pages in a roughly chronological approach. He starts with a very thorough coverage of Chingis Khan (Ghengis Khan as it is often spelt) from his birth, through the ostracism of his family, then on to his bloody climb to power in not just Mongolia but across a lot of the Eurasian land mass. This coverage is excellent with much detail. There are family trees at the start of the book to assist the reader in understanding the linkages. Saunders analyses the military side of the Mongols and also discusses the religious aspect, especially as they change from their paganism to Islam.His discussion about the Mongols being confused with the legend of the Kingdom of Prester John is an interesting aside. The Crusade era of the West coincided with the time of the Mongol conquests. Travellers brought back confusing tails of what religion the Mongols were and some Christians in the West believed that the Mongols were the lost Christian Kingdom under Prester John. They hoped that the Christian West and the Mongols could squeeze the Muslims that were between their two spheres of influence. While they were encouraged by the Mongolian attacks of the Muslim lands they were disabused of their theory of co-coreligionists when the Mongols proved equally happy to sack Christian lands.Saunders has brought a complex subject into an enjoyable book but it seemed that the further that he moved from Chingis the less information there was about the Mongols. This despite the observations of Marco Polo in the court of Kubilai Khan. Timur or Tamerlane also gets scant treatment. Saunders in a way does obliquely justify this by asking how Mongol was Timur when he was more Turkic then Mongol on the surface. In addition, by that time Timur was just one of the Mongol leaders in the area of the formally united Mongol Empire. Significantly, while other leaders used Khan, Timur did not.That said this is a worthwhile volume to have in your library if you are interested in the Mongols. I believe that it will appeal to both those with a knowledge already of the Mongols and those with a passing interest."},{"Title":"The History of the Mongol Conquests","review":"The eruption of nomadic warriors across Asia into Europe and the Middle East in the 1200s was only the greatest of many previous waves. Under Genghis Khan (Chingis, Jengiz, etc) and his immediate successors, the Mongols reached Germany and Croatia, Korea, Japan, Java, Burma, and Egypt. They built the greatest contiguous empire the world has ever known. It all collapsed within a century. The Mongols had some military geniuses as leaders in the beginning and were known for religious tolerance once things settled down, but for administration, they had to rely on others---Chinese, Persians, Turks, and even Europeans. The problems of succession did them in, as they have done so many other empires in history.In this very informative work, Saunders acknowledges that he is trying the impossible. How to summarize and explain the vast panorama of events occuring over half the globe during 150 years or more ? He starts with Turkish precursors to the Mongols, then takes readers through the standard history of the Great Khans, Genghis, Ogedei, Mongke, and Kubilai. The Mongol Empire having broken up into four sections, we then get a history of each of the four, as far as is known---the separate khanates of Persia, Central Asia, Russia, and China. The older, more sophisticated societies of Persia and China soon shook off the Mongol yoke, absorbing their conquerors, while in Central Asia, the regime gave rise to Tamerlane, another bloody conqueror who left towers of heads in his wake. His death brought his sudden empire to a speedy end. Only in Russia, where disunity and confusion reigned, did the Mongol rule last 250 years.While memorizing the various rulers, viziers, generals, and rebellious relatives (not to mention names of now-vanished cities) may prove a tough nut for any reader, Saunders' discussion of the ups and downs of three major religions---Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam in the context of the conquests---is extremely interesting and informative. Christianity had a major role in the Mongol realms, but without easy access to a source of finance or priests, and because Nestorian fought with Roman Catholic, Islam won over the rulers and people in time. The earliest Mongol defeats came from Islamic armies as well. Buddhism remained strong in China and of course, in the Mongolian heartland itself.Not being an expert on Mongolian history, I can't say if this book is now outdated; if new information or analytic trends have replaced it. It seems to me, though, that it offers a solid introduction to the history of that people who burst out of inner Asia and changed the course of history. You certainly cannot understand the history of Russia and Europe, never mind Iran and the Middle East, without its subject matter."},{"Title":"The History of the Mongol Conquests","review":"I must suggest this book to anyone interested in history, especially that of Asia. The tales of the Mongols are wonderfully told in this book. It could perhaps be the definitive book over the history of the Mongols.

Just be careful because you may become addicted to learning of these people and their world..."},{"Title":"The History of the Mongol Conquests","review":"&#65533;The History of the Mongol Conquests&#65533; is a respectable book &#65533; solid scholarship, persuasive analysis, and interesting read. I actually have learned enormous amount not just about the Mongols, but also about the Chinese from this book. I have only couple critical remarks. The author seems confused about origins of the ethos, which become associated (at least in the Russian mind) forever with the Mongols. This question is simple - who are the Tatars, where they came from? Saunders writes on page 158 &#65533;&#65533;new race of &#65533;Tartars&#65533; emerged out of a fusion of Mongols, Turks, Slavs, and Finns.&#65533; OK, I agree with that. But he goes further distinguishing &#65533;Tatars&#65533; from &#65533;Tartars&#65533;, speaking about &#65533;Tatars&#65533; as one Mongol-speaking tribe. Actually on the map on page 30 &#65533;Tatars&#65533; are placed in the Northern China. This doesn&#65533;t make any sense for me. &#65533;Tartars&#65533; and &#65533;Tatars&#65533; are the same, except &#65533;Tartars&#65533; is Western European and &#65533;Tatars&#65533; is Russian name. And yet he confuses the things further by sometimes using the word &#65533;Tatars&#65533; as interchangeable with &#65533;Turks&#65533;.Another passage I have a suspicious feeling about is on page 170. He goes -&#65533;Defeat of Christianity in the area where its prospects seemed favorable is perhaps attributable to&#65533;inferiority of the Russians to the Persians and Chinese in the scale of civilization&#65533;. I disagree with this approach. First of all, what is this &#65533;scale&#65533;? I think while the Persians had to accept Islam - the religion of nomadic Arab tribes invading Persia in 7th century from the Arabian peninsular, Russia had avoided Shamanism - religion of the invading Mongols. Later Moscovy held up as a Christian state and avoided Islam &#65533; a semi-official religion of the &#65533;The Golden Horde&#65533;. To my view Russian civilization was not inferior, but purhaps less glamorous than Persian/Iranic. This turned out to be ultimately a blessing in disguise for the Russians. The Mongols didn&#65533;t want to go deeper to these forests and swamps; they preferred much more the open steppe. And while Kiev was destroyed, this &#65533;inferior&#65533; civilization did survived 265 years of Mongol domination. The Russian civilization was preserved in monasteries among those marshes and forests of the North, hidden away from the Mongols and other foreigners. Anyway, despite several slippery passages, I would recommend this one to anyone interested in the subject &#65533; the book is well written and fascinating (it least it was for me)."},{"Title":"The History of the Mongol Conquests","review":"Another edition with a better editor and decent maps to illustrate the text would make this a much more interesting and useful book. Lay people will have difficulty following the paragraph-long lists of ancient cities and tribes."},{"Title":"The History of the Mongol Conquests","review":"On balance it is a solid and readable compilation of primary and secondary sources on the subject. I liked the book and the author did a good deal of work to produce it. Unfortunately, there is a gross error right in the second paragraph of the book. Though, it is peripheral to the core material. Details of such a remote period of history are scarce, understandably so, and author stretches the book with dynamics of Islam, Christianity etc in Asia during the period. In itself a fasinating topic but NOT related to Mongol Conquests."},{"Title":"Composition-Rhetoric: Backgrounds Theory, and Pedagogy (Pittsburgh Series in Composition, Literacy and Culture)","review":"For several weeks now, I have been considering how to defend the utility of Robert Connors's book - Composition-Rhetoric: Backgrounds, Theory, and Pedagogy - without sounding like a die-hard partisan, a rabid fan, or a closet sexist-racist-capitalist-non-radical pig-dog. To be blunt, Robert Connors is such an easy target that, at times, it seems like everyone wants to take a shot at him. In May of 1999, for example, I first noticed the nasty review on this web-site. And even for those scholars like Sharon Crowley who believe that the involvement of approximately four million first-year college students each year makes composition-rhetoric worth caring about, Connors routinely and invariably finds a pressure point. At conferences, he asks gadfly-ish questions in which he implies that radical pedagogical approaches and, indeed, most theoretical approaches of the last thirty or so years may well be \\"fads.\\" In College English, he asserts that \\"the world of pure epistemological theory is not the world we live in,&quot; argues that there is a need for men's studies, too, and expresses sympathy for the men's movement (Pagan!). He seems to want all teachers in the academy to be, and be seen as, learned scholars (Idolatry!). And finally, he has the audacity to doubt the academic commonplace that \\"we live in a postmodern world\\" (Heresy! Blasphemy!). Not surprisingly, as of November 10, 1999, no composition studies peer has felt motivated enough to add a positive review to the Amazon site. However, the book is useful to practitioners of composition-rhetoric because each chapter presents enough evidence (what he calls \\"shareable data\\") to encourage practitioners to articulate and strengthen the rationale for their current practices.Early in the book, Connors justifies his work with a plea for contextualization: \\"We can, I hope, come to understand in a richer way the reasons rhetoric has been what it has, how it has changed, and how it is changing today.&quot; That last concern over contemporary changes in rhetoric stands out as a useful reminder to those of us trying to rest our practices on a disciplinary foundation, while at the same time trying to preserve our ability to improve those practices. Connors' contribution here is to establish how the discipline of composition-rhetoric evolved inseparably from its \\"host\\" society, and his book is a worthy attempt to tell the history of composition-rhetoric from a moderate-to-conservative intellectual stance."},{"Title":"Composition-Rhetoric: Backgrounds Theory, and Pedagogy (Pittsburgh Series in Composition, Literacy and Culture)","review":"Having been a student of Professor Connors as both an undergrad and grad student in the 90's, I can only sing his praises. Reviewers who dislike and/or disregard Connors' esoteric essays simply do not understand the tongue in cheek man that he was (i.e. the 'men's movement'.) In the fields of historical linguistics, teaching writing, the art of composition, writing process theory, and transcedental literary review, Connors was an absolutely brilliant scholar -- and yet as down to earth as anyone. He wore his hair long and patches on his courderoy jacket elbows and was a devoted Beatles fan. He rode a motorcycle to classes during the period of time he was restoring a Victorian era home. [Unfortunately he died in a motorcycle accident] The most important thing he taught me was that thinking was good, speaking effectively was better, but writing was an art accessible to every human being. I am a middle school English teacher, and I rely on the pedagogy of the \\"NH Greats\\" for my philosophy of reading, writing, and literacy. His work is the 'how come?' of all the writing theories we apply, just as Elbow and Murray and Graves are the 'how to' of writing. Connors was a great man, a great scholar, and a great influence, and he is sadly missed in his world of academia. (By the way - he would have laughed his head off at these reviews.

Nothing could be further from the truth.)"},{"Title":"Composition-Rhetoric: Backgrounds Theory, and Pedagogy (Pittsburgh Series in Composition, Literacy and Culture)","review":"What a great, comprehensive book this is.

The attitude is: \\"I can understand all this arcane junk, and you can't.\\" As a professional newspaper photographer for many years, knowing your f-stops and your film are far more apt to lead to your photo ending up on page one than is knowing that a Nikon camera has 1,000 plus parts.Yes, it's a beginner's book, but one I find myself going back to for reference time and again.

The, supposedly, tragicomic story of the decline of the Wapshot family--father Leander, a ferry boat captain, &amp; his sons Coverly and Moses--left me totally unmoved and uninterested.N.B.--I'm writing this two years later (May 2000) and I've figured it out. Cheever was a master of the short story (see Orrin's review of The Stories of John Cheever) and the Modern Library panel simply rewarded a bad novel in an attempt to acknowledge him as a writer. The book's still dreck, but it makes a little more sense that it made the list.GRADE: D"},{"Title":"The Wapshot Chronicle","review":"Cheever has to be one of America's most overrated writers. Like everything he's done, The Wapshot Chronicle is painfully contrived, rather ineptly written (despite a few clever turns of phrase), not to mention dreadfully boring. To be honest, I couldn't get past page one hundred. Only of interest for future anthropologists who, many years hence, might --God knows why-- wish to understand something about bland and provincial New Englanders . Yawn."},{"Title":"The Wapshot Chronicle","review":"I'm sorry to say but I just couldn't get through this book. Read about half of it, but I'm not into long meandering descriptions. If you want a plot that will carry you along, this is not the book."},{"Title":"The Wapshot Chronicle","review":"The fictitious Wapshot family of Cheever's \\"The Wapshot Chronicle\\" are old-line New Englanders, prominent but modest citizens of St. Botolphs, Massachusetts. The central characters are Leander, the aging father, who is the captain of a boat that transports passengers between a leisure island and the mainland; his loving wife Sarah; his carefree, irresponsible sons Moses and Coverly; and his elderly, senile cousin Honora, who owns the boat and is in fact the family's financial anchor.The novel's chain of events is set into motion one night when a car crashes into a tree near the Wapshots' house. The driver is killed, but the passenger, a girl named Rosalie, is taken inside the Wapshots' house for convalescence. It's not long before Moses and Rosalie take advantage of the intimacy of their living arrangement and engage in intercourse, unaware that Honora is eavesdropping. Shocked by this display of debauchery, Honora vows to cut the family's financial ties loose unless Moses learns some responsibility and goes out into the world to make his own way. And so he leaves St. Botolphs to go to Washington to get a job, and Coverly sneaks away from his parents to accompany him.The two boys go their separate ways and each ends up married but in very different milieus with different sets of values. Coverly marries a poor Southern girl, becomes a technician on a rocket-launching site, and takes up residence in a homogenized modern suburb. His new life represents the modern (as of the 1950's), technical, practical, utilitarian world. It is taken even further into classic Cheeveresque territory when Coverly considers a ... relationship after his wife abandons him.Cheever's proclivity for ironic romanticism is represented in Moses's new life, which is quite a contrast to his brother's. After his prospects in Washington go sour, a chance encounter gives him a new opportunity as an aspiring banker. With his new connections, like Jack climbing up the freshly-sprouted beanstalk of society, somehow he ends up in a sort of fairy-tale world. He marries a beautiful princess named Melissa who is the ward of a wicked witch (the imperious harridan Justina Scaddon, heiress to a five-and-dime store fortune). He and Melissa are imprisoned in the wicked witch's castle (Justina's ancient expansive mansion), staffed by a legion of harried servants and cohabited by Justina's companion, the foppishly ... Count D'Alba.Leander keeps a journal, a sort of combination autobiography/family history, in which his entries are written in a choppy style of sentence fragments, as though he doesn't have enough time to put subjects in his sentences, and he writes letters to his sons in the same style. A problem of his own rears its ugly head in the form of a woman who claims to be his daughter from a previous marriage. This is an interesting plot line that unfortunately is not developed as fully as it could have been.I don't feel this novel is quite as great as Cheever's best short stories, but unlike his short stories, which generally tend to be depressing or somber, this novel has quite a bit of humor in it. I found many symbols in the novel, the most important being that the father or head of a family is, in a way, like the captain of a ship, and no matter how hard he tries, sometimes he can't keep the ship from breaking up and sinking. It is this sharp use of symbolism, the rhapsodic prose, the juxtaposition of the bizarre and the familiar that lends Cheever's work its considerable charm."},{"Title":"The Wapshot Chronicle","review":"I've got a thing for John Cheever. Surely one of the best American authors of the 20th century, Cheever has written several books that I've never stopped raving about (see the following for confimation . . .)The Wapshot Chronicle is essentially more of the same, more of the short story magic that established Cheever as what he was (and at least to me shall always remain): a magnificent story-teller and stylist who weaved brutal honesty into his poetic tales of tragedy and disillusion. There were passages--pages--of this book that I turned back to and reread not out of confusion or misunderstanding of identity, but simply for their beauty, for the firm, strong images that glimmered in the splitting of the waves crashing in my brain. I couldn't get it out of my mind for a while after reading which caused the next thing I read to suffer in comparison.Absolutely one of the best books I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Wapshot Chronicle","review":"The two Wapshot novels (\\"Chronicle\\" followed by \\"Scandal\\") are John Cheever's first two novels. \\"The Wapshot Chronicle\\" follows Leander Wapshot's attempts to keep his dignity intact in spite of encroaching old age and his loss of career as a seaman. Leander's two sons, Moses and Coverly, have to make their own way in Cold War America armed with the airs and attitudes of 19th century New England WASPS; their encounters are both funny and poignant. In fact, \\"funny and poignant\\" characterizes much of Cheever's writing: he can have you chuckling at situational comedy in one instant and then ping your heart with human frailty in the next.\\"The Wapshot Chronicle\\" is a great introduction to Cheever, but if you think it's too much of a stretch, go for the stories or the more accessible novel \\"Falconer.\\""},{"Title":"The Wapshot Chronicle","review":"One previous reviewer rightly noted that Cheever is a much stronger short story writer than novelist. I have to agree. I did enjoy this book, but had a number of problems with it. The novel chronicles three generations of the Wapshot family, an eccentric group of people living in St. Bolophs. The story primarily follows the three men - father Leander and sons Moses and Coverly, and we watch as tragedy and an essential \\"settling\\" for what life has handed to them takes place. The novel starts off slowly, but picks up when Moses and Coverly leave their small town to make their fortunes. The end is tragic, similar to many of his short stories, but it is in the sadness and despair that you see the power of Cheever's writing.As much as I enjoyed the story, there were two major issues. The first was the level of intricate detail that at first was interesting as he painted a picture of the small town, but then became too much. It was as if he was trying to create the same level of detail you find in a short story, but without realizing that a novel has a different kind of pacing, a different kind of arc. My second main problem was the number of loose ends and events that never are resolved or revisited. I understand the \\"realness\\" of the story Cheever has created, but so many little characters who are built up as being important dart in and out of the story at such a rate that you wonder when something substantial is going to happen. Artistically, it places more emphasis on the Wapshots, but it takes away from the vibrancy of the prose.Overall, it's a decent novel from someone who is a master of a different literary form."},{"Title":"The Wapshot Chronicle","review":"Cheever is a goldsmith of words, and, if you love language, the sheer pleasure of how he puts them together is enough to carry you though this picaresque family novel. The eccentric Wapshots are as unpredictable and plotless as life, and if they have dull days the author never lets us see them. In this loose, richly inventive account of Leander and Sarah and their sons, Moses and Coverly, Cheever ambles through marriage, lust, loyalty, death, and the eternal pleasures of place. Even the house has a personality: &quot;The heart of the Wapshot house had been built before the War of Independence, but many additions had been made since then, giving the house the height and breadth of that recurrent dream in which you open a closet door and find that in your absence a corridor and a staircase have bloomed there.&quot; Reading the novel is like constantly discovering such surprises in the lives of seemingly ordinary people."},{"Title":"The Wapshot Chronicle","review":"Caution: The Wapshot Chronicle makes many coarse references to sex for hire. This language and the scenes described would probably earn this book an R rating if it were a motion picture.The Wapshot Chronicle is one of those big family stories that details parts of the lives of three generations, while providing a sense of those who came before. This is a family of sea-faring New Englanders who explored the far reaches of the Pacific and also produced missionaries who served in Hawaii. If you have read James Michener's Hawaii, you will have a picture in mind that will be accurate about the Wapshot forebearers. In the current generation, there's plenty of money in the hands of eccentric, elderly Cousin Honora. She provides for her cousin Leander, his wife Sarah, and their sons, Moses and Coverly. Cousin Honora does this in the spirit of honoring the family heritage, and she is quite interested in seeing the family continue on. The book focuses in on her efforts to encourage this continuity, and what resulted.John Cheever's greatest strength is his ability to conceive of highly original and interesting characters. In The Wapshot Chronicle, you will find two of the 20th century's most original fictional females, Cousin Honora and Justina Wapshot Molesworth Scadden. The men, by comparison, are pretty bland. They are so obsessed with their sexual desires and wanting to have a superior, independent position that they become predictably limited.His second greatest strength is that he is able to weave a novel out of a series of short-story-like episodes that have unexpected twists and cliff-hangers near their ends. Each is a gem, and glitters shiniest with understatement. A few words, a few concepts sketch out the beginnings of a pregnant circumstance. Then, he moves on . . . leaving you as the reader with plenty of room to imagine the actual circumstances. No two readers will describe what happens in this book the same way, because each will perceive the action to be quite different from everyone else. It is sort of like having The Lady or The Tiger continue on to a further story, but without resolving clearly which one lay behind the chosen door. Ambiguities pile atop ambiguities.The book's third greatest strength is an ability to use imagery to turn the same object into expressing its opposite meaning. This Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde quality imbues the book with a very deep irony seldom found in modern novels. Mr. Cheever uses names to good effect to reinforce this nuance. Clear Haven becomes anything but. The Wapshot name is traced to its Norman French roots as Vaincre-Chaud (loosely, defeating others in hot blood). The latest generation of Wapshot males is anything but that, so the name has had to change to reflect their humbler role.While the writing shines with rare beauty, the themes will often feel too trivial to be worthy of the attention lavished on them. What does it mean to be a man in a society in which women are strong, capable, and independent? Cheever seems to suggest a drone-like role like that in the beehive. Are we nothing more than our genes, our parents' child-rearing methods, and our environments? The characters seem to suggest that we are precisely and merely the sum of these influences. Can we accept help? The very generosity of the sharing seems to create shackles, rather than bonds of love and caring. In short, Mr. Cheever has a very jaundiced eye concerning modern humanity, and that leaves the book with a very downbeat feel. Unlike the existentialists who left us with nobility of spirit in facing meaningless events, Mr. Cheever sees nothing at all uplifting going on. You could think of this book as describing the emergence of the bland, disconnected, dependent modern city dweller. I wasn't persuaded by this view, and if you are like me, neither will you. I graded the book down accordingly, despite its stylistic genius.Be open to the potential of what supportive cooperation can accomplish!"},{"Title":"The Wapshot Chronicle","review":"In this comic novel, John Cheever revels in the power of the written word. Leander Wapshot, hero of the book, is endlessly browbeaten by his sister Honora and his wife Sarah, but through the journal he keeps, despite his writing in choppy, incomplete sentences, he's able to rise above his humiliations and is even able to give some good advice to his son Coverly at the very end of the novel in a scrap of paper Coverly finds in a volume of Shakespeare belonging to Leander. The novel is also concerned with Leander's two sons, Coverly and Moses, as they leave home to seek their fortunes. Moses' story is fairly complicated, with many different adventures and twists and turns, and both he and Coverly end up in not very promising marriages. Cheever is at his strongest in character development and at his weakest in plot construction; in fact, there's hardly a plot at all. The dialogue is superb, however, and therein lies much of the humor of the book. I regard Cheever a better short story writer than a novelist, but there's still much to admire in this National Book Award-winning novel, his first."},{"Title":"The Wapshot Chronicle","review":"Looking over the previous customer reviews of this masterful, moving and tragicomic novel by one of this country's greatest and most melodic writers ever, I was struck by the small clique of people who claimed that the novel was &quot;boring&quot; or otherwise somehow unworthy of the National Book Award it had received upon publication almost half a century ago now.

Her reason was the lyrical descriptive language, which is justified praise. However, I found the novel otherwise almost comically terrible: the characters are wooden cutouts with no depth, the plot, such as it is, is moved along mechanically, the dialogue is cringe-inspiring, a parody of itself. \\" \`If you could get a taxi and take my suitcases out, Moses dear,' \\" she said. \\" \`I'm too weak.' \\" Cheever does not show, he tells: \\"Betsey loved her neighbor,\\" \\"Betsey felt wonderful,\\" etc. Here's a classic dismissive passage: \\"It was the kind of relationship that was useful and peaceable enough until Moses began to lose interest and then Beatrice got ardent and demanding.\\" Oh? We don't get to see; we just take note.In between the lyrical descriptions of seaside and woods, Cheever just mechanically summarizes the action, skipping from one character's saga to the next, and sometimes merely referring to whole episodes in a few dismissive sentences, as in the above passage.There are a few nearly-unreadable chapters purporting to be the diary of the family patriarch, Leander, written entirely in sentence fragments: \\"Writer went to work day after confab about poor father...Got morning papers for delivery and looked at help wanted ads...\\"We do not know what any characters look like other than from worn-out adjectives; old women have gray hair, tired looks, and pot-shaped hats with flowers or cherries on them; young women may have \\"golden skin\\" or \\"golden hair,\\" but beyond that, they're invisible. Every character is a clich&eacute;: the stingy, eccentric old female relative who holds the purse strings (there are TWO of these!); the prissy, upright mother who wants to run a gift shop; the \\"types\\" living in one of the rich old women's decaying mansion: yes, an aging count named deAlba, a \\"Mrs. Enderby,\\" an Italian handyman named Giacomo all of whose dialogue ends in \\"a\\": \\"I'ma Giacomo. You comea with me.\\" \\"She'sa no good for night driving. She'sa nearly dead.\\"I realize this novel won a National Book Award, but it's beyond me how that could have happened. It was painful to read one cartoon-like encounter after another and one tired stereotype after another: the virginal, prissy, but yielding \\"golden-haired\\" woman; the eccentric, rich, capricious elderly women (Cheever must have it in for eccentric rich old ladies), the (also) old-maidish, unhappy long-lost daughter of Leander (who shows up suddenly, then disappears just as suddenly from the plot); the two grown sons who go out into the world, get married, and then at the end we abruptly learn: \\"In the early summer both Betsey and Melissa [their wives] had sons and Honora was as good as or better than her word,\\" presumably, granting the family fortunes to her heirs. It was impossible to care about (or even picture) any of the characters, or to see anything remotely realistic or interesting about the chronicle itself.Much of the criticism of this novel claims that Cheever was a great short-story writer whose writing couldn't extend itself into a novel. I do remember liking his short stories; so maybe that's the whole problem. He just can't do a novel.

About 2/3 of the way through, I realized that all the character and place descriptions were there for their own sake. Up to that point, it led me to falsely think we needed to know the information for future reference. This book is not &quot;about&quot; anything. It follows the lives of a few fairly ordinary people and generally covers ground many other works have covered, but does so with Cheever's style. But when a book is about little other than the writing style of the author, it smacks of self-indulgence.

However, i did find that some of the men very willing to be manipulated (the case of Leander and his first marriage, and Coverly and his cover-girl bride).Leander's account of his first marriage is sad and touching, and the contrast with the disgruntled woman who comes to ask for explanations makes her look even more ugly.

Among the leading providers of the supply is John Cheever, led in main part by this novel which reviews fictional St. Boltophs, Massachusetts.Born in Quincy, Massachusetts on the southern shores of Boston, Cheever knows the region. The once prosperous boating village described herein, is now a lackluster society in which two sons, Moses and Coverly, foresee no future and thereby leap into the modern 20th century for travails and accomplishments not provided by the lonely dank of St. Boltophs,We follow the family from the teenage years of the boys through their early parenthood. Good and bad happens, making the pages deliver laughter and tears for the reader. The boys are young and we truly do not seem to witness the nadir of their respective lives, but for the short period of their respective lives, we are sure that each encounters a low not previously seen - especially when contrasted to the ups and downs experienced in the less turbulent society of small town St. Boltophs.Some of the greater deliveries include the descriptions of matriarchal Honora and Justina and their heavy handed manipulation of the people around them. The most affected is Moses who must endure their puritanical concepts of marriage and fidelity - concepts which he truly does not closely share.When reading Cheever, I think he has been sandwiched between two other writers of modern America - each of which is female. I believe he is influenced by Edith Wharton and has influenced great story teller Alice Hoffman.But, he shows more of a man's perspective in this tale that Wharton or Hoffman may share. His great quotation of \\"advice to my sons\\" must be repeated here as the stilted and short meter of the boys' father (Leander) mixed with the great topic's delivery are unique and ever worthwhile: \\"Advice to my sons. Never put whisky into hot water bottle crossing borders of dry states or countries. Rubber will spoil taste. Never make love with pants on. Beer on whisky, very risky. Whisky on beer, never fear. Never eat apples, peaches, pears, etc. while drinking whisky except long French-style dinners, terminating with fruit. Other viands have mollifying effect. Never sleep in moonlight. Known by scientists to induce madness. Should bed stand beside window on clear night, draw shades before retiring. Never hold cigar at right-angles to fingers. Hayseed. Hold cigar at diagonal. Remove band or not as you prefer. Never wear red necktie. Provide light snorts for ladies if entertaining. Effects of harder stuff on frail sex sometimes disastrous. Bathe in cold water every morning. Painful but exhilarating. Also reduces horniness. Have haircut once a week. Wear dark clothes after 6 p.m. Eat fresh fish for breakfast when available.

He's a short-story writer, plain and simple. Yes, he put a lot of effort into this novel, and yes, he won the National Book Award. But it's not a great novel, and the flaws in it are the ones that are typical of someone who is great at telling a story in 15 pages but not in 300 pages.First off, most of the characters don't fully develop. They stagnate, leaving us with the awkward feeling that we've invested a whole lot of time in them without really knowing them. And second, there's a whole lot of plot here that is simply unnecessary. Why exactly did Coverly unexpectedly get assigned to an island in the Pacific? It didn't have any relevance to the progress of the novel or add anything to our understanding of the character. And there are several similar examples. Lastly, the book just doesn't ring true. Everything that happens seems to take place in these odd little microcosms ever-so-slightly separated from the real world. Cheever does his best to create a memorable setting in St. Botolph's, MA, but throughout the book there seems to be little sense of time and place.For a far more satisfying book, pick up Cheever's collected short stories."},{"Title":"The Wapshot Chronicle","review":"\\"The Wapshot Chronicle,\\" the first of John Cheever's five novels, may have taken him more than a decade-and-a-half to complete, but it was well worth the wait.

The family may still be one of the most prominent ones in little St. Botolphs, Massachusetts, but its remaining wealth is controlled entirely by the elderly and very eccentric Honora Wapshot who lives alone with her longtime housekeeper. The rest of the St. Botolphs Wapshots, Leander, Sarah, and their two sons, Moses and Coverly, live in a big rambling house not far from Honora and depend on her for the financial support needed to maintain their rather leisurely lifestyle.\\"The Wapshot Chronicle\\" is very much the coming-of-age story of Moses and Coverly, brothers who, as they grow into young men, are suddenly handed responsibility for ensuring Cousin Honora's continuing financial support of themselves and their parents. The always slightly out of touch Honora, via some logic all her own, sets a goal for the boys that will earn each of them a fortune if accomplished. None of the Wapshots could know, though, how deeply Honora's deal would mark the rest of their lives.Cheever fills \\"The Wapshot Chronicle\\" with dominating, sometimes cruel and thoughtless, women whom his male characters have little chance of influencing. What happens to Leander and his two sons might seem truly tragic in a different book, but Cheever tells their story with such boisterous good humor, and with such understanding of even his most vicious female characters, that \\"The Wapshot Chronicle\\" reads as very much the satirical comedy he intended it to be.And then there is Honora - life would be much more fun if every family had its own Cousin Honora."},{"Title":"The Wapshot Chronicle","review":"The further I got into the book,the less interested I became in the characters themselves. Cheever has molded them into people who are also archetypes, and this seems to reverberate more deeply as the novel advances. I don't particularly follow Jung's archetypal images, don't care much about them, but as the characters unfold they become--as in an old medieval manuscript--emblems of such as Sleeping Beauty and the Prince, Miss Havisham and Estella. The rich prose adds gilt to this weaving of life, nature, death, striving, and possession. Near the end,when Cheever interpolates the closing lines of The Tempest (\\"...We are such stuff as dreams are made of...\\") I was as affected as if I had just read one of the bard's own plays."},{"Title":"The Wapshot Chronicle","review":"John Cheever ranks as one of the leading American writers of the later half of the 20th Century--but while his short stories are still recognized and read, his novels remain less popular. \\"The Wapshot Chronicle,\\" Cheever's first novel, offers some clues as to why the author remains more known for his stories than his novels. Offering a look at a New England family that declines in prominence and stature as the 20th Century unfolds, \\"The Wapshot Chronicle\\" contains some funny scenes, memorable characters and solid and often lyrical writing. But the parts of this book are more memorable than sum of its plot. Cheever is, as always, a graceful writer. Still, \\"The Wapshot Chronicle\\" shows that Cheever was a better short story writer than novelist though this is still a solid--if not great--work."},{"Title":"The Wapshot Chronicle","review":"The style of this 1958 book, winner of the National Book Award, reads like it was written back at the turn of the century, or between the World Wars. But the style perfectly fits the subjects as the Wapshot family is certainly living outside the current time frame. They are a prideful family with a historic background. Their family came over on the Arbella, the ship that followed the Mayflower to the new world. And as the Wapshot's point out, the Arbella was a ship populated with a higher class of passengers. They settled outside of Boston in the fictitious community of St. Botolphs. The lived in mansions they still occupy, but like their own lives, the homes are crumbling around them. Principal characters are Cousin Honora, the current matriarch and holder of the family fortune. She provides for her brother Leander through the use of a tourist excursion boat, then pulls the rug out from under him. To inherit her fortune, she rules that Leander' two sons, Moses and Coverly, must set out to attempt to make their own fortune, a task they are ill-prepared to handle. Then they must get married and have sons. Cheever never varies from the tone and mood he has set for this book and he continually infiltrates his tale with unexpected happenings and eccentric characters. A terrific book."},{"Title":"The Wapshot Chronicle","review":"Very entertaining prose by a writer that is already largely forgotten. Quirky New Englanders provide poignant emotions and hilarious pieces -- I didn't expect to like this, but it's one of the better books I've read recently."},{"Title":"The Wapshot Chronicle","review":"John Cheever's fine, woven prose is the perfect fit for this novel about an eccentric family living in along the coast of Massachusetts. St. Boltophs is a fictional town, where the Wapshots, a declining though still respected east-coast family reside. At its heart, this novel is about a contrasting pair of brothers, Moses and Coverly as they live under the fading light of their father Leander. Moses is the ambitious brother who marries into money, and Coverly is the sensitive, if a bit timid brother who also falls into a tragic marriage. There are fine moments of writing in this novel-Cheever's attention to voice and detail is among the strongest of American writers. Though this is far from a great book, it is clearly a fine achievement and well worth reading."},{"Title":"The Wapshot Chronicle","review":"Check this book out! It is easy to follow and the characters are interesting. It was fun to get caught up with the male Wapshots and their relationship with each other."},{"Title":"The Wapshot Chronicle","review":"The central characters are the Wapshot males - Leander and his two sons Coverly and Moses.Leander is an old New England salt in the winter of life, while his sons are just coming into their own as young men.The older female charcters exhibit an exterme form of bitchiness and excentricity. While the younger females all seem to be rather flighty and promiscious. I am suprised that female readers were not put off by Cheever's chauvinism.Cheever achieves a unique yet powerful style with the contrite journal of life that Leander pens. Especially poiignant is Leander's letter to Coverly after the son reveals to his Father the homosexual advances that he had encountered and his accompanying fellings of guilt.All in all it was a worthwhile read at least from a male point of view. Female readers may disgree."},{"Title":"The Supreme Doctrine: Psychological Studies in Zen Thought","review":"This is one of the great books of all time. The author was a psychiatrist who was bed ridden and took the opportunity to investigate the human mind and body. He used scientific observation as his tool. As many eastern Zen masters have said. Just watch as a good shepherd watches his flock. The sheep will be contented and well cared for. He will know each one by their sound. These are not different techniques.Benoit created with this book a western scientific basis of Zen. Carlotte Joko Beck and her students have created a new Zen called \\"Ordinary Mind Zen\\" from a synthesis of Benoit's work and Japanese formal Zen practice.This is a very difficult book to read. The book was translated from the French. Long paragraphs are one sentence. The book is also written in a dry academic style. The translator was must not have been able to understand what Hubert Benoit wrote, except in a literal sense. I was only able to read it by reading a couple of pages at a time each morning as I took a tub bath. I have read it several times that way. It does get easier the third or fourth time. Unfortunately, formal mediation practice over years would be necessary for a practical usage of this material. The book does have great academic value for people who are interested in the real thing."},{"Title":"The Supreme Doctrine: Psychological Studies in Zen Thought","review":"Enhanced for the reader with an informative Foreward by Aldous Huxley, Hubert Benoit's The Supreme Doctrine is a masterful survey and exploration of Zen Buddhism. A spectrum of issues and subjects are addressed including the existential, mechanistic, and metaphysical aspects of Zen. Exceptionally well reasoned, written, and presented, this major treatise is a highly recommended and very welcome contribution to the growing library of Buddhist literature for the Western reader."},{"Title":"The Supreme Doctrine: Psychological Studies in Zen Thought","review":"This book is not an easy read, not so much due to its translation as to its depth and subtly. Like the mark of great Teachers words remembered in hindsight; with each re-reading of this book deeper and deeper lessons can be learned. Though this is not for the novice, nor would I call Beniot a Zen master as such, this book sits side by side on my shelf of important works along with Philip Kapleau's Three Pillers, and Shunryu Suzuki's Beginners Mind."},{"Title":"The Supreme Doctrine: Psychological Studies in Zen Thought","review":"\\"The Supreme Doctrine\\" is a phenomonal work. If you can find Graham Rooth's translation, it's well worth it .. though I also own this one, and find both to be valuable. Benoit's is one of the great Western efforts to \\"describe that which is beyond description\\". It is an excellent attempt. Still, one gets the feeling that in the end, Benoit was still left wanting. Perhaps it's because he (as so many of us do) thought, hope against hope, that he could capture, would capture the essense of Zen. But untimately Benoit's words, like all words, are just fingers pointing at the moon. It's an excellent roadmap. But the last step is all yours."},{"Title":"The Supreme Doctrine: Psychological Studies in Zen Thought","review":"...Refer to Charlotte Joko Beck's book &quot;Nothing Special.&quot; She writes that it is the best book on Zen that she's ever read. Apparently, it is very difficult to read because it was translated from the original French version. Author was in a serious accident and pondered the human mind for years as he rehabilitated."},{"Title":"Cherry Blossoms","review":"Being an amateur shutterbug who has taken many photographs of the cherry blossoms at the Tidal Basin in Washington, I bought this book with a lot of eager anticipation but found myself disappointed. Certainly, there are several photos in the book that are extraordinarily good, but there are also a number of very ordinary images that seem to have been added in as fillers to fatten up the book. Rajis is very good with classical combinations of blossoms and water / blossoms and sky, and the book has some stunning wide-angle shots. Ultimately however, I was left with the kind of anticlimactic feeling you get when you sit down to a fine meal but rise from the table still hungry. The format of the book is partly to blame as well; using a \`mini\\" format for this book means one is essentially looking at an album of 5x7 photos, certainly not a coffee table format that would do justice to the blooms or the panoramic shots. Not much thought seems to have been given either to the poetry verses that dot the book. Most of the photos are from the Tidal Basin in Washington and the Brooklyn Botanical Gardens in New York."},{"Title":"Cherry Blossoms","review":"this book contains some of the most beautiful photography i have ever seen. breathtaking. it has over 200 pages of cherry blossoms and cherry trees. background scenary also so beautiful. one of my favorites is near the back of the book. it shows some cherry blossoms with golden sunshine upon them which made their color just stunning.i bought this for a friend and she also loved it. you can't not love it. the book also has a few illustrations of cherry blossoms and some quotes, but i would say 90% of the book is gorgeous photograghy. i highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Cherry Blossoms","review":"Love all the pictures! I purchased this book after visiting DC and fell in love with Cherry Blossoms. Very nice decorative book."},{"Title":"Cherry Blossoms","review":"My daughter (she's 11) is really into cherry blossoms.I was worried about buying the wrong book for her.But, thankfully I made the right choice.She loved the photos and the poems in this book. She looks through it repeatedly."},{"Title":"Cherry Blossoms","review":"My boyfriend brought this book back from Washington DC.The images are stunning, and the quality of the book is exquisite. It's a beautiful gift to anyone who appreciates the transient blossoming of cherries and sakuras. Jake Rajs tracks the blossoming period along the East Coast and someone who is familiar with these stunning beauties in the Brooklyn Botanical Garden, in DC and elsewhere can spot tiny hints in the details of the photographs about their provenance."},{"Title":"The Edge of Human (Blade Runner, Book 2)","review":"I'm sorry, but this sequel to the movie (not Philip K. Dicks' classic novel) misses the mark by a large margin. The ludicrous way in which two characters who quite obviously died previously (J. F. Sebastian and Pris) are suddenly brought back to life in this installment is laughable. The characterisations of Dave Holden and Deckard are as wooden as Keanu Reeves and the whole thing moves along as though its feet are stuck in concrete. There are some nice ideas at work here (Holdens rescue for example) but overall it just seems like a tired excuse for cashing in on the Blade Runner phenomenon. Avoid."},{"Title":"The Edge of Human (Blade Runner, Book 2)","review":"Let me begin with the admission that I was unable to finish this book. I made it to about page 90 and just had to put it down. So, my review will be based on that fact. Also, there are probably what would be considered to be some plot spoilers here, so please skip this review if you don't want to know information that might reveal some plot twists too soon.I am a Bladerunner fan. I love the original, and I love the director's cut. I own them both. I have watched them so many times, I have lost count. I thought it was awesome that somebody wrote a sequel. I was reluctant to buy it, because I am not a fan of Mr. Jeter's other works. However, I finally picked it up one day.I was determined to finish this book. Even when I saw that J. F. Sebastian, to me a person who was irrefutably killed in the movie, was still alive. And then, Pris is still alive. I thought at first Mr. Jeter did a fair job with the characterization of Deckard, and then that began to disappoint me, too. Then finally, the thing that made me put the book down. Mr. Jeter would have us believe that Pris was not truly a replicant.I ask any fan of the movie if this is even conceivable? To me it was not, and was the final nail in the coffin for the book for me. I just couldn't go on any further. The book became an insult to it's source material in my opinion. I honestly don't see how any one who is a true fan of the movie could enjoy this novel.Like many sequels, this one would have been best left unmade. Most sequels are more stillborns than vibrant offsprings. The best sequels are the ones we create in our own minds. I applaud Mr. Jeter for his effort to create a sequel to such a bastion of sci-fi history, but I question his outcome. Like any author, he deserves praise for his talent, and his creation, but it is not for me, and I would imagine, not for many Blade Runner fans as well.Based on the merit of reading the first 90 pages or so of this book, I do not reccomend it. I'll stick to the movie, but this book is not Blade Runner canon to me."},{"Title":"The Edge of Human (Blade Runner, Book 2)","review":"Jeter does a so-so job in this book at picking up where the movie left off. However, this book is in no way related to DADoES? (which the book claims to &quot;tie-in&quot; with the movie) except for the character J.R. Isidore. My biggest grudge (which is even MORE apparent in the 3rd book!) is the fact that Jeter basically &quot;re-runs&quot; the movie so many times. IE) Many events in this book already happened in the movie, and are just re-written a little differently. However, the plot is okay and you are left with an unexpected twist at the end, which is good."},{"Title":"The Edge of Human (Blade Runner, Book 2)","review":"Sadly this is a book I abandoned reading. A sequel to Blade Runner that didn't need to happen, and not very fun to read."},{"Title":"The Edge of Human (Blade Runner, Book 2)","review":"I just got through reading this, and I must say that I was happy with the job Jeter's take on the Blade Runner world.First off, I am a huge Blade Runner/Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep fan. I know there are many of us, and some take their passion to a higher degree than others. That being said, if you read this book with an open mind, and don't hang on the original book's/movie's every word, you will enjoy this read.Jeter follows the storyline of the movie rather than Dick's novel, but I was able to pick up the story right away. The story is innovative, and fresh. Of course a sequel would be silly now, but I wouldn't mind seeing this book turned into a graphic novel or animation movie.Overall Blade Runner 2 is a fun romp through the Blade Runner world with creative twists and turns. As I said, unless you walk around dressed like Roy Batty or Deckard all day, you should enjoy most of this novel."},{"Title":"The Edge of Human (Blade Runner, Book 2)","review":"So people have wanted a sequel to Blade Runner the movie for some time. Ever since the director's cut (which was the better version IMHO), people have wondered if there was ever supposed to be a sequel since the happy ending in the theatrical version wasn't supposed to happen. Now, Jeter has given people what some thought they wanted: a sequel to Blade Runner that combines elements of both the movie and the book, and takes advantages of some of the mistakes that were made (the missing sixth replicant-actually scripted, but was cut out of the final filming because of budget constraints). Not a bad read, but Blade Runner fans (particularly those of the book) will most likely be disappointed. If you're a fan of the film, you might like it. Like Dick's writing style, it is moody, depressing, and uneven, but when Dick did it, it worked. When Jeter does it, it's only average."},{"Title":"The Edge of Human (Blade Runner, Book 2)","review":"I found this book very disappointing on many levels. Mr. Jeter's writing at times is very good, addictive and energetic, but at other times it seems like he's just going through the motions. This uneven writing makes this book seem like he was given a loose outline of what is supposed to happen with a checklist of character to include and that he is going through line by line stitching it together. Some of it is good, but in general, it just doesn't work.I went into this expecting to see a continuation of the thought process Deckard was going through in DADES, this blurring of the human and replicant/android and how this reflects to the gift and beauty of life. I wanted to see what it was that made Deckard give it up and go with Rachel... and if it was worth it. I wanted to know it there was a chance Deckard was a replicant and how he would have worked through that. Was there a way to escape the 4 year life or could life be just as good within it?Instead, we get a rambling story about convincing Deckard to hunt a \\"6th replicant\\" and go back through everything he already has, including the return of Holden and Bryant, Batty and Pris, Sebastion and his toys and that old 'chickenhead' Isidore (who has become very smart). There's a bunch of action stuck in there, much of it gratuitous and a lot of out of character with Deckard. By the end, nothing has really progressed and nothing much really changed.Overall, this book isn't very good. The writing is uneven and the plot is silly. It just doesn't feel like the same characters or ideas that the book (DADES) and movie set up. That's a shame because there was some really good ground this could have covered - instead we get the equivalent of a straight to DVD sequel with different actors, different director, and no money for a writer. Stay away from this one."},{"Title":"The Edge of Human (Blade Runner, Book 2)","review":"I tend to be open about all forms of literature and most writers, even if there books are simple or immature you usually can get some interesting insights or at least superficial visceral entertainment from most stories. Sadly this writer gave me the first experience with the word HACK that I have ever truly encountered. Never before have I slammed face first into a pile of words that would actually be better described as excrement.I did not find anything wrong with P.K. Dick's book, loved Ridley Scott's interpretation of the film, Blade Runner. But this was so bad I wondered if it was originally written on toilet paper, lost in the woods, and then found by some Hollywood type who hoped to sell it as a \\"property\\" to a B-Movie studio.I have my own interpretation of the nuances in the original novel and the movie, as most do, but this clown seems to not understand any of the basic story premises as well as having the blackest mental cesspool for a view of the world I have seen since Mein Kampf. Early in the book we find that the basic premise is that, we (All humans) want our slaves to be as human as possible so we can \\"enjoy\\" there suffering. If your basic outlook of humanity is this low, I don't understand how he had time to write this book. I would expect Jeter would be in a cave somewhere and living off roots or shackled to a wall with a 200lbs Dom leaving red marks across his ass.I kept reading this book thinking that all the stupid mistakes and idiotic premises thrown like feces from a monkey cage, would be exposed in the end, and we would return to somewhere near the original Dick/Scott galaxy. He has no additional insight in to any of the caricatures he reused from better writers, and I suspects, he needs to spend more time in the real world getting to know humans that are not drawn on his hand, to gain some wisdom about how real people operate and why.Do not give this guy even the 1% royalty by purchasing this book anywhere(Sorry Amazon), except to support your local used book store to clear shelf space for ANYTHING else."},{"Title":"The Edge of Human (Blade Runner, Book 2)","review":"Being a huge fan of the movie (director's cut version) I was extremely eager to see what Jeter had done with it. Jeter's style is complicated and depressing; which is probably what he intended. The story line swerves all over the place like a snake being held by the neck and Jeter does an above average job for a sequel. Some cronic fans of the movie will be let down, however, since the original is much better due to a less complicated but deeper storyline. Blade runner is a ten out of ten classic, but Blade Runner 2 is only above average. It was a bit of a dissapointment for me. It amuses me that the sixth replicant was actually just a mixup during the making of the movie and if they had done it correctly then this book would have been a completely different story. One thing that bugged me was some of the climaxes. Most of them were over the top; for instance when Deckard escapes from the police station and the very last climax. But generally speaking, it was still a good book that was intruiging reading. I wouldn't reccomend it to anyone and definetely not to people who havent seen the movie or read the book 'Do androids dream of electric sheep?'"},{"Title":"The Edge of Human (Blade Runner, Book 2)","review":"I am so happy that somebody actually wrote a sequal to one of the greatest SF films ever made (considering that there will be no movie sequal...). And this book does justice to the blade runner world by adding more for us to follow with Rick Deckard and his life. Mr. Jeter did a fine job with the legacy that PK Dick left and I'd just like to say how glad I am that the freaky-near-future, apocolyptic, world-in-chaos science-fiction genre lives on...especially with a detective like Rick Deckard."},{"Title":"The Edge of Human (Blade Runner, Book 2)","review":"In seeking to emulate the film, while borrowing from Dick's novel whenever convenient, Jeter has done well in a venture that could be much worse than it is. His action sequences are hacked together, not to mention bland, as is his characterization of Deckard, who I felt played second banana to another character from the film who figures into the plot here. Occasionally, however, Jeter supplies his characters with musings about the distinction between human and replicant (or lack thereof) and we get just a taste of what it was like the first time we actually GOT Blade Runner (which probably wasn't the first time we saw it). I applaud most Jeter's bold denouement, which isn't afraid to shake things up and actually move the story forward. It came close to sending chills down my spine, as the ending of the film's director's cut. I also appreciate its consideration of Rachael's characterization in Dick's original novel, and how the two seemingly polar opposite personalities gel."},{"Title":"The Edge of Human (Blade Runner, Book 2)","review":"A movie-nerds' ... dream, what they'd all wished had been done with Highlander.

It is for people who get more of a thrill out of walking out of a grocery store having saved $30 on their food bill than they do when the spend $100 on a new pair of expensive shoes. If you prefer the smell of retiring early from a job you dislike to new car smell, you have found your book. While this book is a little extreme with homemade Halloween costumes for kids and going through piles of your neighbors curb side throw outs to repair and use. It has excellent ideas on cooking at home to save money, and a great philosophy on how to stop relying on convenient foods, convenient stores, and conveniently spending all your money on things that add no value to your life. Whether it is buying 10 pairs of the exact same color and type of sock so when one wears out or is lost you lose one and not a pair, or putting a gallon jug of water in your toilet to save a gallon of water on every flush, this book is packed with ideas that will save you the cost of the book itself very quickly. Stock up on items you use frequently when they are on sale, take your time when buying a car or house so you get the best deal possible, negotiate big ticket items. The bottom line is spend money on what is most important to you, a nice house, quality time with your children, or early retirement and stay away from single serve pudding cups, lunch-ables, restaurants, fast food, and grocery items not on sale.

You'll laugh at some of her ideas andthen employ them right away"},{"Title":"The Tightwad Gazette II: Promoting Thrift as a Viable Alternative Lifestyle","review":"I have read dozens of books on living a frugal lifestyle, and I have to say that The Tighwad Gazette is the best one of them all.A well written book containing excellent suggestions for saving money and cutting your expenses. It is very well written and goes into depth with regard to the tips it offers.The Tightwad Gazette is more than just a list of tips to save money. Amy doesn't just tell you what to do, she tells you how to do it, so that you can then figure out new things for yourself. In this sense, you become self-sufficient in the area of frugality"},{"Title":"The Tightwad Gazette II: Promoting Thrift as a Viable Alternative Lifestyle","review":"I read the good reviews of this book on this site, but decided to begin my tightwad ways, so I took it out of the library. After reading about 5 pages, the book languished on my bedstand, costing me 5 cents in overdue fees because I forgot it was even there. I am so glad I didn't waste my money on this book. I have several issues with this book:1. Organization: Amy Dacyczyn's book is horribly organized!! On the cover are enticements such as \\"Tightwad crafts and hobbies.\\" I was interested in this topic, so imagine my surprise that neither craft nor hobby was listed in the index!! I couldn't find it, so I gave up looking after about 10 minutes. Same for some of the other cover topics. And since the book is based on newsletters, there is no rhyme or reason for the listing of the topics.2. Tone: much of what Ms. Dacyczyn suggests seems to be because of mean-spiritedness and lack of experience. She goes on and on, using anecdotal evidence, about how today's kids are so jaded they don't enjoy a walk in the woods or making cookies. So untrue!! Most kids love to do these things - their parents don't have a lot of time, so they don't do it often, but as a teacher I can tell you that children talk about these times in school with their classmates showing great excitement. She uses what she calls \\"Creative deprivation\\" so that her kids enjoy the one JUNIOR ice cream cone they get a year! I was by no means spoiled, but you don't have to make a huge deal of out ice cream! It is an innocent pleasure, and part of childhood, to love and eat ice cream! Most of her ideas seem like she is depriving her kids so that she can write about it and make tons of money! I would hate to be her kid - especially if I was the one who had XXX in all my clothes to show I am the third girl! Yikes!! And if I want philosophies on effective child rearing, I certainly wouldn't listen to someone so cheap that she deprives her kids to make a point. I'll listen to someone who has a clue about child-rearing.3. Ideas - many of her ideas are impractical and useless. I am sorry, Amy, I don't want to donate my body to science to save on my funeral costs. And the ideas readers send in - there must be a contest to see who can come up with the most ridiculous way to save a penny! Lots of winners here!!So between the lousy organization, the meanness of how the author treats her poor kids and the useless ideas - be a tightwad and do NOT buy this book!!"},{"Title":"The Tightwad Gazette II: Promoting Thrift as a Viable Alternative Lifestyle","review":"of course there's some good suggestions in these books, even if they do border on fanatical. However, in keeping with the theme of their contents, the original tightwad would not buy any of them, just sponge the contents from the web, libraries, friends, etc."},{"Title":"The Tightwad Gazette II: Promoting Thrift as a Viable Alternative Lifestyle","review":"I'm all about finding a new frugal tip but I also like to maintain a certain standard of lifestyle and cleanliness. This book did not help me along those lines. Some of the things in here were just plain disgusting (a reusable tampon???) and some were just plain ridiculous (saving a half eaten apple for streusel later???) Nope. That isn't frugal, it is fanaticism. I also had a real problem with the writer. In at least half of the comments from people who had written in with tips, she put a blurb beneath them either contradicting their tip or \\"trumping\\" them with a tip of her own. I found her to be obnoxious and self-glorified. The ONLY section with any merit was the Christmas section where there were a few cute homemade gift ideas. Other than that, save the trouble and time of reading this book."},{"Title":"The Tightwad Gazette II: Promoting Thrift as a Viable Alternative Lifestyle","review":"I read this book aloud to my family in the car during a summer vacation. They loved it--my husband and kids alike. As I read, I came to realize that this book has enormous value beyond the kooky money-saving tips it is famous for. Please, in evaluating the Tightwad Gazette, consider these additional points most reviewers seem to have missed:1. The book fosters critical thinking skills. So very many of Ms. Dacyczyn's articles present both the pros and cons of the issue, and her recommendations are based on sound and extensive research sprinkled with a healthy dose of skepticism. After being exposed to her thinking style, my kids will think twice before being sucked in by advertising.2. The book fosters creative thinking skills. There is no better life skill than to be able to stretch your one remaining dollar to meet your five outstanding needs. At some time in their lives, your kids are going to need this skill.3. The book will show you how to make informed decisions. Ms. Dacyczyn's basic strategy is to calculate, by whatever means available, the true cost of any given expense. And while you may really need to save a penny by making your own tomato soup, you're just as free to conclude that, at a penny a pop, it's well worth your hard-earned money to buy the canned soup. Knowledge is power, and by applying Ms. Dacyczyn's strategies, you'll be fully informed, forewarned and forearmed.I highly recommend this book to parents."},{"Title":"The Tightwad Gazette II: Promoting Thrift as a Viable Alternative Lifestyle","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I would buy it for the same reason I would buy a dictionary: I keep referring back to it so much that if I had to go to the library I would use extra money for gasoline. If I had to go to the web for the same information, I would end up raising my electricity bill. It's more than the recipes and resources. It's more than the tips and techniques. The reason I love this book is because it's a source of encouragement. I don't feel powerless anymore over my money. I feel like I can choose what is important to me and what I should be spending money on. Not the other way around. That's really all tightwaddery is about and that is the whole point of this book.If you really want to understand the philosophy side of tightwaddery, I recommend you search for the first volume of the Tightwad Gazette (which is out of print) or go ahead and buy the Complete Tightwad Gazette. It's a very good investment."},{"Title":"The Tightwad Gazette II: Promoting Thrift as a Viable Alternative Lifestyle","review":"This is much more than a book on tips to save money. Along with Tightwad I and III, this is a bible for managing a household on less. Her philosophies on material goods and spending really resonate with me. These books are the most used and well-worn books in my library. I bought it in hardcover long ago, and thought it was worth every cent. Now that it's in paperback, I don't see any reason why one shouldn't own this book."},{"Title":"The Tightwad Gazette II: Promoting Thrift as a Viable Alternative Lifestyle","review":"As with _The Tightwad Gazette_, _The Tightwad Gazette II_ is a pleasure to read. Dacyzyn's folksy writing style and attractive graphics work together to create a book that readers will dip into again and again for pleasure and inspiration, as well as for practical advice and recipes. This book is a good buy for people who are new to thrift, for long-time tightwads looking for some new ideas, for environmentalists who want to reduce their use of resources, and for anyone who wants a simpler, more satisfying life, working toward their own dreams rather than merely keeping up with the Joneses. _The Tightwad Gazette II_ celebrates the frugal lifestyle, and its many ideas for creative use of one's resources will save the reader the book's purchase price many times over"},{"Title":"The Tightwad Gazette II: Promoting Thrift as a Viable Alternative Lifestyle","review":"I first read this book when it was first published, and I really needed the money saving tips, I just recently dusted it off and re-read it to see if Lo-All these years later, it still has tips to offer my family- that now has teenagers, in stead of elementary school children.Some of the tips seemed a bit extreme, some seem dangerous if not undertaken very carefully (re-wiring a slow-cooker) and some seemed clever enough to write down into a diary and pass along to my near-college aged daughter to remember as she goes off into the world... although I guess I can't claim these pithy bits of wisdom as my own. It seems that this would be a cute gift for anyone setting out on their own, especially knowing that for most-there are lean times.I was going to list my copy on Amazon, but I'm going to keep it... I guess that's a good review!"},{"Title":"The Tightwad Gazette II: Promoting Thrift as a Viable Alternative Lifestyle","review":"I never knew how much money we were wasting on take out, processed foods and plactics that were being wasted in our home. I like Amy also have twins, boys, and needed a way to conserve that extra time and money by being frugal."},{"Title":"The Tightwad Gazette II: Promoting Thrift as a Viable Alternative Lifestyle","review":"Of the three volumes I have, this is my favorite. The author gets both deeper into the topics and provides even more useful information. Over fifteen years later, I'm still referring to her pizza dough recipe. Possibly my favorite piece in the entire book was \\"Space: The Frugal Frontier\\", which I liked even more than her \\"decorating\\" article from her first volume. A sign of frugality is defining luxury as space, not stuff, and any strategies you can employ to combat the encroachment of \\"stuff\\" into your sacred space are welcome.Another gem is the article on investing or, rather, not investing. I think it took two stock market crashes in the last fifteen years for people to realize that maybe it was better to get our mundane finances in order before we tried to \\"diversify\\" into a stock portfolio that, frankly, most of us didn't understand that well.Pretty much everything in here gave valuable advice, whether it was about laundry detergent pricing, moving strategies or \\"selective squeamishness\\". However, she shines when the subject is food. As she notes here or elsewhere, the cheap and easy solution would have been to publish a bunch of recipes- that's not what she does, for the most part. Instead, she talks about breakfast food comparions (why not eat the rice pudding if it's cheaper than the boxed cereal?), the pantry principle (making sure you always have a well-stocked pantry so you can make a variety of meals as opposed to buying ingredients here and there to make certain meals), shopping strategies, garden surplus tracking, the value of a freezer and muffin strategies (a recipe, technically, but one that invites you to manipulate it based on what you have on hand).I have spent happy hours poring over this book, and each time I've come away with a deeper understanding of how to make myself happier with less stuff. Recommended for anyone who wants to do the same."},{"Title":"The Tightwad Gazette II: Promoting Thrift as a Viable Alternative Lifestyle","review":"This book has so much information available, that the price definently is justified even for the tightest tightwad! Some tightwads may feel that buying this book would be not keeping in context with their frugal beliefs, however lighten up and just buy the book. It's a worthy investment. You'll incur more debt by trying to xerox the information or printing every page off the net, or your friends won't let you keep their book for too long! I'm glad my sister gave me this book, because though I'm only 21 and in college with hardly any responsiblities, I've learned many valuable and durable lessons for my financial future!"},{"Title":"The Tightwad Gazette II: Promoting Thrift as a Viable Alternative Lifestyle","review":"The book was poorly organized and a great deal was outdated information or just not really new. I would not recommend this book and was glad that I bought it used and not new."},{"Title":"The Tightwad Gazette II: Promoting Thrift as a Viable Alternative Lifestyle","review":"Its a bit old and I am not impressed with the info. Too narrow a scope of info. Needs reworking."},{"Title":"Linguistics (Teach Yourself)","review":"I'm about halfway through this book and have really enjoyed it so far. It gives a good overview of what linguistics is all about and describes the different branches of the science pretty well. It does this without digging into a bunch of jargon and unnecessary complication that one might get in a more specific text.I especially like the description of the various \\"lenses\\" that linguists view language through. I'm very interested in linguistics (at least certain branches of it) and this book has given me a good idea of where my interests fit into the broader field. It also gives some good historic facts, goes through the development of linguistics, and talks about how all of the various subfields fit together into a comprehensive science.If you are at all interested in languages and/or you're into learning (or analyzing) them, you should read this book to get a broader appreciation of the science that studies languages not only from the \\"micro\\" level (as language learners do), but from a broad scientific level. As a language learner myself, I found this to be an interesting general overview with more than enough specifics to satisfy my curiosity about linguistics."},{"Title":"Linguistics (Teach Yourself)","review":"Aitchison has written a superb book that is both highly informative and easily read. I would highly recommend this for those who are new to the field of linguistics or who are studying it in a second language.This book is laid out in relation to a pattern of moving from the inner core of linguistics (phonetics and phonology) outwards through syntax, semantics, and pragmatics to the various fields of linguistics research. Chapters on sociolinguistics, psycholinguistics, and the idea of a universal grammar are included but with simple titles such as \\"Language and Society.\\" The strength of this book lies in its uncomplicated explanations of these fields.Each chapter includes questions for review that are useful in teaching yourself or for assigning to a class. The end of the book includes a selection of further readings arranged by category which many will find useful."},{"Title":"Linguistics (Teach Yourself)","review":"Only 250 small pages, yet it gives you a very good overview of linguistics, and is written in an easy to digest style, with lots of diagrammatic illustrations to boost your understanding. It could also be used as a quick look up reference book.In Part 5 of the book, you will find simple but quality explanations on Universal Grammer, Deep Structure, Transformations, etc. And it gives an excellent overview of how one theory has led to another, such as, how Noam Chomsky arrived at the Minimalist approach used today, its very instructive, without being swamped in details!Highly recommended and cost less than $12.00!"},{"Title":"Linguistics (Teach Yourself)","review":"I have to admit: when I first ordered Teach Yourself Linguistics, I was highly skeptical. I had never been a fan of those series that claim they have a subject on everything, and hire \\"experts\\" in the field. I was greatly surprised by the clear and easy to understand organization, and was also impressed that the book did not attempt to appeal as a \\"bedside table\\" book. Instead, it is written almost like the notes of a textbook, with the fat and excess trimmed out.The book starts with an introduction to the field of linguistics, answering questions such as \\"What is linguistics?\\", \\"How does it differ from grammar?\\" and \\"Why study linguistics?\\" It then goes on to explain language in a brief, succint chapter, after introducing readers to the various fields of linguistics.Part ll of the book introduces the reader to the three core areas of linguistics: phonology, syntax, and semantics.Part lll goes onto describe the up and coming fields of linguistics: sociolinguistics, pyscholinguistics, and stylistics.The book goes on to describe language change, and ends with a chapter concerning generative grammar and language universals. (Noam Chomsky)All and all, I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in anything concerning linguistics, as it provides a take-off point for those who want to explore other specific fields. Happy reading!!!"},{"Title":"Linguistics (Teach Yourself)","review":"This book is very well written in a way that is easy to grasp. For me at least, this is a book I can sit down and just read. It is very thorough, and provides a lot of information on how linguistics works, what it is, and explains the technical terms providing exampels mostly in english, but also uses some latin and compares English with German some at one point. It goes through some of the major theories and schools of thought and also different applications for linguistics. For example, it talks about psycholinguistics and sociolinguistics, which are fields of psychology and sociology concerning language. It also talks about the anthropological, literary, and other applications and fields of linguistic science. I recommend this book highly to anyone interested in language."},{"Title":"Linguistics (Teach Yourself)","review":"It's challenging to write a textbook that accurately and clearly explains a technical subject to technical readers. It's much more difficult to write a book that accurately and clearly explains a technical subject to a lay audience. In this book Aitchison has done a fantastic job of the latter, giving a breezy, well-written, and technically accurate survey of the field of linguistics. (He lost me a little bit only at the end, when he got into the details of Chomsky's theories.)I have read other popular books on linguistics (which I have also enjoyed) but was looking for the more academic treatment provided here. Besides giving a brief survey of several aspects of linguistics, Aitchison also provides an extensive bibliography with pointers of further reading.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning more about this field!"},{"Title":"Linguistics (Teach Yourself)","review":"This compact DIY book goes through a broad introduction of the field of linguistics including basic terminology, concepts, and different branches such as sociolinguistics, psycholinguistics, and the one I found most interesting (for obvious reasons): stylistics, which is the linguistic analysis of literary language.Chomsky's various linguistic theories over the years are outlined and it's clear we haven't found a unifying grammar to describe English, let alone all languages. This last is Chomsky's goal, and he's lately put forth the vaguely disturbing theory that children are born with an 'innate' framework of linguistics and then switch on/off different parametres as culture and experience dictate.I found it about half of the book to be extremely readable and accessible, and the other half suddenly dense and technical. Something in between might have been better, but as a first look for a lay person, it was quite good."},{"Title":"The Best of Martha Stewart Living : Weddings","review":"Martha Stewart's \\"The Best of Martha Stewart Living Weddings\\" provides information such as decorations, cakes, flowers, as well as reception ideas that are useful for couples who are planning for their weddings. Stewart also provides information for those who are interested to make things (cakes, favors, etc) rather than just buying them from the stores. The book is filled with colorful pictures that help to illustrate her ideas.Before reading this book, I thought that it would be too fancy and way too expensive for middle-class folks (like some of the wedding books out there). However, I am pleasantly surprised that some of her ideas are quite practical and doable and they were not as expensive as I thought. A useful book to have.

This book does a decent job of bringing little-girl fairy-tale wedding dreams to reality. The photographs are clear enough to really see how those painstaking special touches might be made, and there are plenty of those special touches throughout the book. A bride who is actually planning the wedding of her dreams will probably not benefit from this high-priced purchase. As eye-pleasing as the book is with the details, it is lacking in explaining the overall planning and organization that is crucial in planning even a small wedding. Don't buy this book if you are tight on cash (as most are who are getting married) and need to actually plan your wedding.

I've looked at a number of bridal books, and so far, my favorite is NOT ON LOVE ALONE by Jessie Carry Saunders. If you like Martha, you will love this book -- it's simple and restrained and elegant. It's a cookbook for newlyweds, and has a friendlier, more intimate tone than any other newlywed cookbook I've found -- it feels like something written by a bride for other brides.It has a friendly, appealing feel, like the author is in the kitchen with you, telling you stories about the recipes as she teaches you how to make them. Also, it's just a higher quality book -- it's a hard cover, the pages are nice and thick, and the watercolor illustrations on every page make the book seem like something you could display on your coffee table as easily as you could use it in the kitchen.If you want a good cookbook, any of the various newlywed cookbooks will work fine. If you want an excellent present for a wedding or a bridal shower, my recommendation is NOT ON LOVE ALONE."},{"Title":"The Best of Martha Stewart Living : Weddings","review":"If you really care about having a tasteful wedding with color, originality, beauty, and love; this book is just what you need.

I used the free one from State Farm, which they give to their insured, and that was okay. I splurged for her because she was completely unorganized.

She had a planner form Barns and Noble and it was completely useless. The only complaint she had was the same as everyone else...having to photocopy the guest list. I can see if you are having 300 people, but there is only one page. I think for the money you should get enough for your average sized wedding. Other than that, it's great.

This one, however, has wonderful photos that brides can look through and use as examples of what they like when beginning the floral consultation process.Normally I find that Martha's books and magazines show only styles that are popular with wealthy brides on the East Coast and few, if any, of the styles appeal to my Midwest clientele.

Mads, Lina, and Holly are back, and so is the Dating Game. Mads uses an art project to try and get closer to Sean, Lina creates a fake identity in order to talk to Dan on a dating web-site, and Holly decides to break up with Rob, wondering if it's the right decision. This series truly illustrates the hardships of high school."},{"Title":"Dating Game #2: Breaking Up Is Really, Really Hard to Do (No. 2)","review":"I am an adult who loves reading \\"teen fiction\\". I picked up the first book in this series by fluke but I have found myself running after the second and third books.This series is fun to read. While it does not really tackle many of the daily problems encountered by teens today - or should I say the book does tackle them, but never in any type of serious way, the storylines are cute and witty.If I had a teen, I would have no problem suggesting these titles. I look forward to more in this series."},{"Title":"Dating Game #2: Breaking Up Is Really, Really Hard to Do (No. 2)","review":"Natalie Standiford's second installment in her Dating Game series, BREAKING UP IS REALLY, REALLY HARD TO DO, is another example of fine realistic fiction, with a lot of humor thrown in for good measure.Holly, Lina and Madison are enjoying the popularity that the success of their matchmaking project has brought them --- Holly is still dating Rob; Lina is still in love with her young teacher, Dan; and Madison is still madly in love with the swim star, Sean. As the novel progress, teenage angst at its best occurs. Holly becomes increasingly annoyed with Rob, most notably because of the cheesy sayings on his T-shirts and the way he asks for Holly's permission before kissing her. Lina discovers a personal ad that Dan has written. She answers, but not as herself --- rather, she responds as a college student who's studying film. Madison decides to use a portrait of Sean as the centerpiece for her art project, showing how her life revolves around her infatuation of him.Returning are some minor characters, including Audrey, Madison's kid sister; Ramona, the leader of the We Love Dan cult; and Sebastiano, Holly's locker buddy. A new character is Stephen Costello, a fellow artist who becomes pals with Madison.Like the first installment in the series, this book deals with relationships, friendships, self-esteem, confidence, and a host of other issues that teen readers will be able to relate to. Standiford's strength is her characterization and the realistic voice she creates for her characters. The three main protagonists are likable, believable, and just flawed enough to make them real. There is a lot of humor here as well --- the sayings on Rob's shirts are cheesy but funny, the rapport between the girls is full of zingers, and Ramona's saving of Dan's used napkins is creepy but at the same time humorous.Standiford already has written the third installment of The Dating Game, entitled CAN TRUE LOVE SURVIVE HIGH SCHOOL? I believe that Standiford's series will survive much more than that.[...]"},{"Title":"Dating Game #2: Breaking Up Is Really, Really Hard to Do (No. 2)","review":"The dating game continues in the sequel, Breaking Up is REally, Really Hard To Do. All in All I'd rate this book a three, the whole series is a three as well, i mean i've read better books but if you're bored and looking for a quick read about teenagers and relationships it'll serve it's purpose fairly well.Okay so the story basically continues about three best friends Holly, Lina, and Madision, and their lives. Lina is still madly obsessed with her teacher even though it is blatantly obvious Walker is interested in her, and that she actually has a chance with him. Personally the whole Lina thing really bores me and pisses me off, I think her crush on her teacher is extremely unhealthy and annoying. Especially when she creates a character Larissa and becomes e-pals/lovers with Dan. Madison is obviously stuck on Sean but also has this huge crush on Stephen, this was really funny to read about especially because Mads is extremely ignorant and shall we say clueless when it comes to really reading into things. Holly and Rob are still dating but she starts getting very critical of him and isn't sure if he is her \\"IT\\" guy or not.This book is very predictable, but it ends on a nice happy note. It's cute, not amazing or anything, but if you're looking for a cute mindless teenage book I'd definitely give this one a look over."},{"Title":"Japanese Buddhism (Kegan Paul Japan Library)","review":"To come to the point right at the beginning of my review, let it be said that &quot;Japanese Buddhism&quot; is an exciting and immensely rewarding book. The author, Sir Charles Eliot, served as British ambassador to Japan from 1920 to 1925 and both his knowledge of Japanese thought and culture as well as the fact that as a scholar he had dedicated his life to the study of Asian religions may have made him the one non-Japanese expert of his time best qualified to write on the subject. Sadly, Sir Charles did not live to see his work published as he died - shortly before its completion - in 1931, but thanks to the efforts of his publishers and of George B. Sansom, an eminent Japanologist who wrote the last chapter, the book was finally printed in 1935.Apparently, &quot;Japanese Buddhism&quot; is complementary to an earlier work by Sir Charles on Hinduism and Buddhism. Nevertheless, he does well to again describe Buddhism as it originated in India and how it made its way to China and finally reached Japan during the sixth century, as the evolution of Buddhism in Japan cannot be completely grasped without knowing Buddhism's history in India and China. The book thus is divided into three parts: As mentioned above, the first part deals with the characteristics of Buddhism as it was (and still is) practised in India and China, the second part is dedicated to a general history of Japanese Buddhism from the sixth century till the end of the Tokugawa period (mid-19th century) whereas the third part explains in considerable detail those &quot;sects&quot; - or &quot;schools&quot;, as they are most often called today - that arguably played a decisive role in shaping the particularly Japanese interpretation of the original Buddhist tenets, namely the schools of Tendai, Shingon and Zen Buddhism as well as the schools of Amidism and the one founded by the charismatic Nichiren.What is remarkable about Sir Charles' book is that it has withstood expert criticism and continues to be an excellent portrayal of Japanese Buddhism in spite of the 65 years that have elapsed since it was first published. True, the book offers no information whatsoever on the development after 1868 and thus no mention is made of the disestablishing of countless Buddhist temples after the Meiji Restauration - let alone the so-called &quot;new religions&quot; (shinshukyo) that were organized as lay Buddhist movements and which appeared only after Sir Charles' death - but anyone interested in the pristine forms of Japanese Buddhism may confidently turn to Sir Charles' book. The only reason why I do not rate &quot;Japanese Buddhism&quot; a 5-star-book is that in my opinion the Jodo school - which evolved side by side with Zen Buddhism and the Nichiren school - is not given the attention it deserves. Apart from this minor weakness, however, this is a rather comprehensive book on the origins of Japanese Buddhism and offers fascinating reading for everybody interested in the subject."},{"Title":"Wake up and live!","review":"I like &quot;Wake Up and Live&quot; because it has a solid base for living life the way you want WITHOUT stress and undue tribulations caused by everyday strains. I think that this book is the best self-help book I have ever read. It is written in easy to understand language and it REALLY WORKS!!I ran across &quot;Wake-up and Live&quot; about 30 years ago. I keep my copy close by. When I am having a difficult time with an issue I can always find a solid answer in it.This book gives you simple, down to earth answers to why you react the way you do to everyday situations. If you want to change how you are reacting to a situation, then this is the book to get to do just that. It will give you new insights into yourself and make you accountable for every step of your life. It is a life changing, sensable book you can keep with you all the time. It helps you wether your are just getting started on improving your life or already have already started with whatever program you are doing. It will enhance your life and make it very ENJOYABLE.

Worth every penny."},{"Title":"Wake up and live!","review":"I used to say to people that I would never lend this book, even to my Mother! But then I lent it to a 'friend' years ago - who I have forgotten and the book is gone. This is the best self-help book I have ever read. It is profoundly simple. I have been quite successful in my life and even speak to others about success but this book always pushed me back on track when I needed a quick fix. So now I am without it and only have the memory of it and can't bring myself to purchase it for 60 plus dollars. So if you feel sorry for me and want to sell a copy for much less than that - let me know!"},{"Title":"Wake up and live!","review":"When I read \\"Think and Grow Rich\\" this book \\"Wake Up and Live\\" was mentioned in it. Is it therefore a book which predates \\"Think and Grow Rich\\". What is interesting in it that it is written along the same lines. It is a little book which you can read on one sitting. It is so interesting that it is a high probability that you will finish it on this one sitting. Remember, this book had been written long before an avalanche of so called self-help books. It doesn't make any difference. You probably will get from this book more than Dorothea Brande's generation, because there is more known information on the subject. Definitely worth reading more than once."},{"Title":"Wake up and live!","review":"i liked this book because it was exactly what Brian Tracy said it would be.

This book is good for advanced Law of Attraction practitioners, in my opinion, or those people that need \\"strict\\" and \\"lots\\" of work visualizing."},{"Title":"Wake up and live!","review":"I cannot say enough about the transformational content of this book. Simply written, it calls us as individuals to face profoundly the reality we have chosen to espouse in our lives. Dorothea Brande inspires you to question who you are and where you are truly going, and why you were put on this earth to begin with. This book, a classic for good reason, and hard to come by, is a must read for anyone who wishes to glimpse and eventually reach their true and full potential. This is not rocket science but the material presented is just the kick in the butt most of us can benefit from in facing those things which are keeping us from our goals and dreams. It greatly helps that this book was written in a time when people still understood and appreciated tradition, protocol, and standards of behavior - expecting such behavior from themselves and others. It serves today as a \\"wake up\\" call to return to the basics of just LIVING! - instead of trying to please everyone around us (to be seen as \\"cool\\") or finding excuses for why we are the way we are and simply settling. This is a short easy read with the maximum amount of impact; a book that can be consulted over and over again in years to come. Thank you to the author for writing this book (she wrote it out of frustration in her own life in her late 30's! so there is time for all of us who wish to change and \\"Wake Up and Live\\")."},{"Title":"Prime Number","review":"I keep this book at work to read during lunch breaks.

Except that everybody, gives up searching for the answers to these questions and accepts the meaningless explanation: what we see happenning in human society, happens in this way because this is how it should happen. Or because of .. the raise of the prices on the market, for example. (Obviously prices are something like a natural natural phenomena - raise of the tempratures in the northern hemisphere , humidity in the air,...) After several \\"explanations\\" of this kind , one gives up - it is immpossible to find out what is going on in society because this is the purpose. The less people know, the better for ... for everyone who can take advantage out of this.For 90% (well this is my evaluation) of the people what is going on with money and prices is a mystery. At the same time they are forced to participate in this \\"game\\" and participate in some stupid manner. Then a game that is played in a stupid manner and played by players, unwilling to play it (at least for 90% of them this is just a burden) will come to a crush eventually. It seems it is inevitable that there will always be crises every 30-40 years.I do not know whether Adam Smith is correct in his explanations but I think he is absolutely correct that one must search the reason for the processes that take place in society."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Adam Smith lived in Europe in the days of sailing ships before trains and airplanes.

Socialist, Capitalist or Communist, you still have to understand how individuals function and develop. Adam Smith puts into words what we all intuitively know; the value of everything can be determined by the amount of skill and labor is contained within it, and the aggregate of many will produce more than the sum of individual effort.What Mr. Smith missed is that the 'invisible hand' of the market is also a blind hand. It does not, and cannot care for the result or timing of its actions. Eventually a market will seek equilibrium, but that can be a few months, a few years, or generations. The Dark Ages were as much a result of the slowness of the market as the lack of insitutions.An amazing work given the times it was written in and the tools Mr. Smith had at his disposal.cg"},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"This abridged version doe a great job in my opinion of shortening a long text and making what can be overwhelming material easier to digest."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"What are the essential relationships among work, money, property, services?

When I have studied economy in the University, I was taught that almost the entire book is devoted to the \\"invisible hand\\" which means \\"self-corrective markets\\", \\"liberalism\\", \\"Laissez-faire\\" and \\"state non-intervention\\". After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith did use the term \\"invisible hand\\" only once in the entire book, in the discussion of domestic versus foreign trade.To illustrate the point, let me quote the text where term \\"invisible hand\\" is used: \\"First, every individual endeavours to employ his capital as near home as he can, and consequently as much as he can in the support of domestic industry, provided always that he can thereby obtain the ordinary, or not a great deal less than the ordinary profits of stock. Thus, upon equal, or nearly equal profits, every wholesale merchant naturally prefers the home trade to the foreign trade of consumption, and the foreign trade of consumption to the carrying trade. In the home trade, his capital is never so long out of his sight as it frequently is in the foreign trade of consumption. [...]Secondly, every individual who employs his capital in the support of domestic industry, necessarily endeavours so to direct that industry, that its produce may be of the greatest possible value. [...]As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can, both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce maybe of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain; and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention.

The Physiocrats saw the true wealth of a nation as determined by the surplus of agricultural production over and above that needed to support agriculture (by feeding farm labourers and so forth).

With a little discipline, I think that the erudite reader will take away many enriching (yes, pun intended) lessons from Smith's ground breaking treatise. For me, as a business professional and business student (I have an MBA), the Wealth of Nations was a Damascus Road experience.I think there are several myths about economics that are exploded by a first hand reading of Wealth of Nations. Many supply side economists eagerly tout Smith's \\"invisible hand\\" metaphor in advocating deregulated markets, but in my view, Smith took a balanced and integrated approach in analyzing the supply and demand sides of national economy. In the first chapter Smith notes that national wealth is the production of labor. This has dual implications in that production is the creation of supply, but the labor force consumes that supply by trading the resulting wealth. These are two sides to the same coin, &amp; therefore indivisible. Also in the first chapter, Smith notes that increasingly sophisticated economies will employ a division of labor to increase production efficiency, which is another concept that necessarily integrates supply and demand, production and consumption.Smith devotes quite a bit of time lamenting governmental intrusion into economics by way of regulation. However, he does not condemn government regulation per se, but make very specific criticisms against those state regulatory polices that tend to create monopolies. None of his comments are strictly political in nature. Smith's analysis is purely based on economics &amp; the efficient allocation of capital. He views the enemy not as the King's ministers, but rather the monopolies that were so prevalent during the 18th century mercantile system.On a related note, I think it is clear that Smith would be horrified by the military centric nature of many post-industrial economies today. He notes that a standing army is a drain on national wealth. Essentially the state is paying workers not to work, but rather to stand ready to fight. I suspect that Smith would view large state defense budgets as being most closely akin to a transfer payment made by a welfare state. For those who will scream invective at me for saying this, please remember that the largest item on any defense budget by far, is payroll.Finally, as an amateur historian, I enjoyed the brief glimpse into what life was like in the 18th century Empire from an economist's perspective. Various parts of his book review social welfare systems of his day, as well as international banking, political economy, agrarian systems, and life in general."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Its a bit difficult to make a comment on the writtings for validity of Adam Smith.

This is a review of the Modern Library hardcover edition, which I ordered here at Amazon.com.Let it be said right off the bat that the big thing Marx gets trashed for has roots right here in the 'W of N:' namely, the Labor Theory of Value. Both Volume One of 'Capital' and 'W of N' spend the first 100 pages or so going over it. Both refer back to it constantly in later pasages. And both must be taken off the table without it. The LTV boils down to this: all value is created by people working and producing goods and services that other people need and/or want. Furthermore, they must produce these goods and services at at least the average level of productivity and at the appropriate level of demand. Otherwise you're working either harder or more easily for your cut of the national pie than you otherwise would. The LTV is so straightforward and intuitive you'd think there wouldn't be much of an argument.The one thing Smith stresses throughout the book is the need for what he calls 'perfect liberty,' where everyone is allowed to buy and sell what they want from where ever they'd like. With this, resources would be diverted to where they needed to be as quickly as possible so people would stop wasting their time WORKING (see how the LTV operates here?) on things that should be made elsewhere.It's important to understand that neither the words 'capital' nor 'capitalist' ever occur in this work. This is very important because both words carry baggage Smith would break no bread with. In fact, the main bad guys in this work are the very people we would call 'capitalist' today. They subvert Parliament through bribery and intimidation, protect their own interests at the expense of everybody else in society, and raise unholy hell when workers try to form unions. All the while, of course, they form unions amongst themselves with the express purpose of stabbing the rest of us in the back.Sound familiar?Let me give you a modern example of how desperately we need American economists to actually pick up and read this book, as opposed to just talking about what a good boy Adam Smith was. Contrary to the propaganda we're getting out of our media, alternative sources of energy are now ready for prime time. There's nothing the internal combustion engine can do that hydrogen fuel cells can't do better. The price of solar cells has been dropping like a rock for years. And wind power is now the second cheapest source of energy after dirty coal. All we need to do is divert all that money we use to protect our oil resources into building up the economy of scale for these products (i.e. reducing the amount of WORK necessary to build each unit; this is the LTV lurking around again), and turn all these into cheap bulk commodities. We'll also need to use this money to build up the infrastructure necessary to safely deliver and store hydrogen. Then, after these (admittedly) high entry costs (i.e. expenditures of LABOR), we'll have access to unlimited, clean, and cheap sources of energy. The nonsense we have instead, which came to serious crises in 2001 in California with the impeachable collusion of the Bush administration, has nothing to do with Adam Smith's great work. I don't know about you, but I'm pretty tired of socializing the risk while privatizing the profits for this industry. Our current urge to go to war with Iraq precisely reflects the urge of 18th century statesmen to protect the interest of the mercantilist (capitalist!!) masters. This was a tragedy Smith covers quite extensively.As an added bonus he's a great read. After working so hard on Marx I was very happily surprised.Karl Marx brought the LTV to a fine polish, going beyond Adam Smith and showing how it translates into the average rate of profit, interest rates, standard of living, etc. He picked up where Smith left off. Also, using the weapon of dialectical materialism (i.e. the logic of motion and change -- the true heart of Marxism), Marx was able to show how capitalism, in fact, negates private property. It would have turned us all into slaves decades ago if not for the better angels or our nature."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Look at the bottom of the Wikipedia page, there are links to the unabridged ebook for free in both kindle and the standard format (as the copyright is long expired)."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"This turned out to be exactly what I wanted, another thick book I'll never read all the way through, but a good book to have on hand for research.

Truly, &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot; is to economics what Newton's Principia is to physics. It is not perfect, but considering the time in which it was written it was an amazing accomplishment.The reader will find discussions on a great many topics, but what is especially fascinating is the insight into 1700's Britain that is provided. Remember, this book was published in 1776. Smith even discusses the &quot;recent troubles with the colonies&quot;--America.It is emminently readable, though it becomes less so in certain sections--the digression on silver, for example. However, if one takes it slowly, then one can easily digest this feast of intellectual achievement in a relatively short time. Afterwards, the works of Ricardo, Marx, Keynes--to name a few--should be tackled.Again, highly recommended."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"If you have any interest at all in Economics, you'll want to go to the source. This is the source. Adam Smith lays the groundwork for the study of Economics in this very readable treatise.Though he is discussing 18th century Britain, the topics he discusses have direct analogs in the modern American economy. Taxes, trade, money, monopoly, tarrifs, and international trade balance are all tackled with aplomb.He really lays into Mercantilism and blasts the protectionism it engenders. Never anything less than a champion of the common man, Smith decrys monopolies and other taxes on those most unable to afford them. Though he seems to be a total free marketeer, he takes great pains to examine the types of taxes which would be useful and prudent for a government to levy.Once or twice may be fine, but Smith uses this construction for almost every sentence in the book. It is just a stylistic gripe, but the length and complexity of each sentence make digesting the information quite a bit more difficult than it otherwise could have been. I would not be at all disappointed to see this book translated to a more modern style.Again, if you're interested in Economics at all, this book is the place to start. There is so much good information here to be absorbed and pondered. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Nobody seriously involved in economics can do without this exhaustive work, originally published in five volumes as An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations. This classic is a pragmatic and accessible milestone in the history of economics. Its author, Adam Smith, is woven into every economics textbook. However, Smith's theories, which today often are recounted mostly in fragments, frequently incorrectly, reveal their entire social and economic innovative power only in context. Smith burst onto the scene at a time when absolutist national states monopolized the world's precious metal reserves and tried to increase their own wealth through stringent export policies. These states were motivated by an entirely new concept about national wealth: that it stemmed from the work of the country's people, not from gold. Based on that idea, economic markets should balance themselves as if guided by an \\"invisible hand,\\" impelled by each individual's self-interest. The state has to provide only an orderly framework and specific public goods and services. Even though Smith's image of idealized economic and social harmony may have developed a few cracks over the course of time, his ideas have inspired many well-known economists during the past 250 years, including David Ricardo, Vilfredo Pareto, Friedrich August von Hayek and Milton Friedman. We highly recommend this seminal work."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Note that the complete edition of Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations is usually published in two volumes. The only exception I'm aware of is the University of Chicago Press' edition, which specifically states that it is \\"two volumes in one;\\" note that this means double-numbering, as the page numbers restart for the second \\"volume\\". The reason that it usually comes in two volumes is that it is a very, very long work, totaling over 1000 pages, and abridgement is apparently so common that it isn't stated directly by publishers. So, if the edition you're considering buying has less than 1000 pages, it is either only one of the two volumes, or it is abridged. It doesn't help that Amazon often provides the \\"inside pages\\" of a different edition from the one you're viewing, so if you want to check the table of contents to see just what's in a particular edition, you may be misled. If what you want is the complete work look for something that indicates that it is \\"unabridged\\"."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"After hearing about socialism from too many people who do not know and admit to not knowing what the word means, it makes sense to return to the sources and read. Start with Adam Smith. To be clear, Adam Smith is writing about capitalism, but how many of us know what that word means? Adam Smith is a good place to start learning before you start opining.This is not a simple read. The style is not as dense as was typical in 1776 but it can be just as elliptical.Interesting, although tangential is that the book mentions the American Revolution but only as an incidental backdrop to the more import issue of how and why money is created and moves. How well Mr Smith understood the then nascent industrial revolution is a hypotheses for a more learned reviewer than myself.Over all there is a great deal of repetition, and repetition with slight variation , punctuated by a scattering of tables, none of which printed as readable in my e version. This being said, Mr. Smith writes with a power granted to those who first encode a new world view. His is the more powerful because most of this work consists of a logical argument laid out in simple words.While many of us were exposed to the basics, capital, land labor, lowest cost, investment seeking the highest return, taxes bad (although not always) and so forth, I was struck by some of the lessor taught observations.Written in a time when there was no functioning concept of labor union, Mr. Smith warns that labor will loose against owners. The law (then) tended prevent labor from organizing and owners frequently socialized together, had common interests and therefor could be expected to overpower the labor virtually at will.Perhaps the single most telling comment, and the one most significant to today is his comment that when business interests attempt to make or influence public policy it is best to assume that they are lying or seeking action at the expense of public interest. Mr. Smith gives no third possibility.This is a great classic in western thought. I am tempted to say it should be mandatory. E editions certainly make it affordable. But For all you Wall Street occupiers and big wigs, Greek protesters, and Tea Party literalists, Obama haters, and anyone with a loud opinion on economics, this is a good place to start educating yourself. It might be nice to hear the shouting from some one who has done some homework."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"For anyone coming to Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations the first surprise is how readable it is. Famous classic of economic theory though it may be, this is no dry academic tome to be read only by people with a scholarly interest in economic history. There are no detailed tables of statistics of the sort one might expect to find in a modern book on the subject, and no mathematical analysis, indeed not very much quantitative information at all. Instead there is a long series of examples to explain such ideas as why it is more efficient to divide work among several specialists rather than have a complete task fulfilled by one person, or why slave labour is ultimately more expensive than paying free workers, even workers in cities like Boston or New York, where wages were far higher in Smith's time than those in his native Scotland.To illustrate the principle of the division of labour Smith discusses the manufacture of nails. Even a blacksmith -- skilled in working with a hammer but with no special training in nail making -- could not make more than a few hundred nails in a day, and those of poor quality. A specialist nail maker could make more than two thousand, but much greater improvements, both in quality and quantity, come from recognizing that even a task as apparently simple as manufacturing a nail can be broken up into smaller tasks: maintaining the fire at the right temperature, hammering the nail into the right shape, using a different tool to form the head, and so on.A popular edition of Wealth of Nations is inevitably abridged, as one can hardly expect to buy a complete scholarly edition for a price not much more than that of a novel. Complete editions are available as well, but they are much more expensive. With sensible editing, however, an abridged version can include as much of Smith's writing as the ordinary reader is likely to want, together with notes to explain points that will be obscure to the modern reader. In the Oxford World's Classics edition Kathryn Sutherland has made an excellent job of this, with notes that fill around a fifth of the length of the book."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"This is one of the truly great books produced by the Western world. Although much has been written on economics since, it considerably broadened my perspective to read it in the original.I can't help feeling that those who pan Wealth of Nations as an apology for exploitation simply haven't read it. That&#65533;s simply not what the book is about. For if you really do care about the underpriveleged masses -- and it's imminently clear that he really does -- then you better consciously organize your state in such a manner that money will flow naturally where it's most needed.I'd been told before I read it by several people that AS was, for example, apologizing for the East India Trading Company? Does his apology for EIT include the lengthy chapter which discuss in full detail how and why the East India Trading Company was responsible for an wide array of abuses in the Far East, and why no similar company would be legal if a society were fully moral and knew its own best interest?Nor is it a blind apology for laissez faire economics, though it does recommend non-intervention by the government insofar as that is possible. Still he fully recognizes the need for social services, rightly understood and rightly executed.In fact, I can't see how anyone who reads it could view it as an apology at all -- it's simply a statement of fact. Adam Smith is not the one carrying an ideology around on his shoulder. You may not like it that the world works this way -- that's another matter. But that IS the way it works... you are made to see that for yourself. It is not imposed on you as dogma.And after reading AS, I'm left feeling very happy that that's the way the world works.I think the most fundamental idea I am left with after reading all those pages, is that wealth is a verb, not a noun. Land and labor (i.e. food and farming) are the bottom line of economics. Treat your farmers well. Unjust practices in trading will ultimately backfire.The dynamo which runs the machine that creates wealth lies within each individual - it is the individual&#65533;s will to better his or her condition.

It is worth reading, but for those with less time, I recommend \\"The Essential Adam Smith\\"The Essential Adam SmithContent Summary: The \\"Wealth of Nations\\" contains Adam Smith's classic defense of free trade, and his simultaneous attack on the mercantilist system of his day. Mercantilism was a policy favoring exports and discouraging imports, while trying to maximize the silver and gold coins brought into the nation. Smith points out that this policy was self-defeating, that trade barriers invite retaliatory trade barriers. Mercantilism actually discouraged greater economic growth. Smith further argues that free trade, with a focus upon producing commodities and commanding more productive labor, is actually the more prosperous alternative. Besides many other things he says, he was in favor of an inheritance tax for the wealthy, opposed to taxes on wages, for generally minimizing all taxes as much as feasible, and repeats the idea that the wealthy have some greater responsibility to give back to their country in proportion to their wealth. In fact, it is in their self-interest to do so, to assure a prosperous and secure nation that protects their own wealth. The \\"invisible hand\\", which people are so fond of quoting - appears only once in this book (and thrice in all Smith's writings). It does suggest that it is through pursuing their own free, self-interest, that men render a greater prosperity to society.Analytical Review: Smith's argument, that free trade renders a more prosperous economy, is probably a good one. Capitalism has been a vehicle for generating greater wealth, but not always generating greater equality. It must be pointed out of course, that there rarely if ever has been a completely free market. I believe Marx's Communist radical alternative has not and will not supplant capitalism. What Marx understood, however, was a greater sense of social justice. Marx's writing is loaded with justified sentiment for the oppression of the working poor, and his labor theory of value in \\"Capital\\" goes a long way to augment and correct (but not entirely substitute) Smith's omissions. Smith had absorbed the very hierarchical, class-based values of his time. In several passages on slavery, for example, Smith's strongest condemnation is to call it an \\"unfortunate\\" institution. What Smith understood better was that humans are self-interested and will prosper more generally through a free market. But Smith also opposed the power of monopolies, and believed some provision should be made for the poor, and that plays into Marx's thought. Marx had greater insight into the abusive dominance of monopoly capitalism, and its often cold-shouldered indifference to the inequities it produced. In a nutshell, Smith gave us the wisdom that the free market is better, but Marx has given us the corrective that a fair and just use of capital is a better (and yes - you might add even democratic of Christian) ideal. A free-market economy, with some corrective for social justice and common welfare, is my view of a compromise between them.

When I have studied economy in the University, I was taught that almost the entire book is devoted to the \\"invisible hand\\" which means \\"self-corrective markets\\", \\"liberalism\\", \\"Laissez-faire\\" and \\"state non-intervention\\". After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith did use the term \\"invisible hand\\" only once in the entire book, in the discussion of domestic versus foreign trade.To illustrate the point, let me quote the text where term \\"invisible hand\\" is used: \\"First, every individual endeavours to employ his capital as near home as he can, and consequently as much as he can in the support of domestic industry, provided always that he can thereby obtain the ordinary, or not a great deal less than the ordinary profits of stock. Thus, upon equal, or nearly equal profits, every wholesale merchant naturally prefers the home trade to the foreign trade of consumption, and the foreign trade of consumption to the carrying trade. In the home trade, his capital is never so long out of his sight as it frequently is in the foreign trade of consumption. [...]Secondly, every individual who employs his capital in the support of domestic industry, necessarily endeavours so to direct that industry, that its produce may be of the greatest possible value. [...]As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can, both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce maybe of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain; and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it.\\"After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith was influenced by French Physiocrats. The Physiocrats saw the true wealth of a nation as determined by the surplus of agricultural production over and above that needed to support agriculture (by feeding farm labourers and so forth). Other forms of economic activity, such as manufacturing, were viewed as taking this surplus agricultural production and transforming it into new products, by using the surplus agricultural production to feed the workers who produced the extra goods. While these manufacturers and other non agricultural workers may be useful, they were seen as 'sterile' in that their income derives ultimately not from their own work, but from the surplus production of the agricultural sector.I have found out that this book is not about \\"invisible hand\\" or \\"Laissez-faire\\". It is quite a complete study that covers almost every basic aspect of the economy, and remains an effective introduction to economics to this day. Just don't start reading economic books from this book. It would be hard to understand. It assumes that you already have economics background, i.e. have studied economics for a few years.This book is so often mischaracterized and politicized that I suggest you to read it completely by yourself.

First, it is truly \\"complete and unabridged.\\" So, you get the real deal, all thousand pages of it. Second, it includes Edwin Cannan's summaries in the margin that assist in reading this thick tome. Cannan also provides an enlarged index that serves as a quick reference. And third, the Introduction by Robert Reich and the Commentary at the end by R.H. Campbell and A.S. Skinner are very helpful in better understanding this work. You may get more out of those two sections than Smith's thousand pages of writing.This book was written before the field of economics theory existed. As a result, Smith's writings do not include such common words as: economics, recession, expansion, contraction, inflation, GDP, common stocks, and securities. Thus, his writings has no resemblance to modern economics commentary. Given that, it is challenging interpreting what he is saying in modern context.Smith could not be an economist since the latter profession did not exist he had to be something else: a moral philosopher. In the 18th century if you studied hard sciences you were a natural philosopher. And, if you studied anything else you were a moral philosopher. Such a broad base binomial taxonomy of all intellectual scientific fields had great advantages. This is because moral philosophy included all the fields that today are pretty separate such as: logic, rhetoric, psychology, sociology. On a more granular level moral philosophy as advanced by Smith included microeconomics, macroeconomics, international economics, behavioral finance, international economics, etc... Nowadays, all those fields are fairly demarcated.In view of the above, Smith's intellectual legacy is in part timeless. This is because he was concerned about the speculations that went inside individuals' minds just as he was concerned about the productivity of labor, small businesses, and the economy at large. His cogitations covered the entire fields of behavioral finance, macro and macroeconomics.Smith's thinking was far more complex and nuanced than the ones of his libertarian followers such as Friedrich Hayek, Milton Friedman, and Alan Greenspan. They all missed more than half of Smith's message. That included Smith support for labor unions (at a time when labor abuse was rampant), government regulations including very tight regulation of banking. Smith also was opposed to the might of large corporation as he was suspicious of their collaborating to depress wages and their colluding on prices before laws banned such practices. Thus, Smith was far more the precursor of Keynes than Milton Friedman. Yet, this is not what the economic profession conveys to the outside world.Smith's posterity and prescience are second to none. Unfortunately, his writing in a contemporary setting is unreadable. For my part, I got a lot more about Smith's thoughts from reading digested modern interpretations from others than from reading Smith's own writing. In this regard, I recommend three books. James BuchanThe Authentic Adam Smith: His Life and Ideas (Enterprise)is excellent and solely focused on Adam Smith and his writings. Arthur HermanHow the Scots Invented the Modern World: The True Story of How Western Europe's Poorest Nation Created Our World & Everything in Itcovers the entire Scottish Enlightenment. And, John CassidyHow Markets Fail: The Logic of Economic Calamitiescriticizes the entire field of economics.

We have come a long way. Now governments are simply inept including the USA government.

This is the predominant reason for reading this book. Secondarily, to trace the development of economic thought. Adam Smith was one of the greatest pioneers in the science of economics. There are areas where we now know he was in error. Science content of modern economics is more profound than most observers are willing to admit. If you just want to learn about economics you would be well served to first read more current economists. In modern times, Milton Friedman has played a similar role. Again there is that radical urgency to place Friedman in the conservative pile before they decide the correctness of his thought. The legacy of critically reviewing the errors of democratic governments as well as repressive governments will hopefully be kept alive and well. Much is left to be done-- even in the USA. A very exciting question remains what happens when the repressive leaders of China realize that good economic policy and political freedom are so deeply intertwined that there repression is truly doomed. Will the end be destructive or positive. It is surely coming.Similarly in the USA and other developed nations, as more people learn economics on the path to greater involvement in business, investing and entrepreneurship one would expect increasing rebellion against the reckless of policies by politicians and the uninformed contentions of the media. There are many helpful books some I have recently reviewed that can broaden ones understanding of governmental failings in economic policy.While everybody would benefit from more knowledge about economics, the basic shortcomings of the media and politicians is of critical concern. It is no surprise that reviewers of economics related books have to rush to place any book either in the conservative pile or the liberal pile.

Adam Smith's \\"The Wealth of Nation\\" establishes the theoretical framework for Capitalism covering every aspect of an economic system that has created the highest standard of living known to man. Adam Smith shows how the interplay between labor, stock and land serve to generate the wealth of a nation. The keys to wealth are freedom, productive men, productive stock, and productive land. Smith says that the role of government is threefold - to protect the land from foreign invasion, enforce contracts and maintain a physical and legal infrastructure that promotes commerce and investment. Government produces nothing and therefore the expense of government reduces the wealth of a nation. Taxes are akin to a proportional reduction in the productivity of labor, stock and land and so should be kept at a minimum in order to increase the wealth of a nation. Any government role beyond the promotion and protection of investment reduces the wealth of a nation and of its people Adam Smith would oppose the many government programs that litter the landscape of the Federal Government today. Welfare, Social Security, education spending by the government, and other non-defense or infrastructure related expenditures diminish the productivity of the people and consequently their wealth. The majority of the people in the United States would have been much wealthier had it not been for these programs.Adam Smith was also a proponent of free trade. He understood that countries varied in the productivity of the land and the people and that only through free trade could the advantages inherent in different lands and peoples be harnessed to increase the wealth of nations. He opposed guilds and unions which only protected the few at the expense of the many and consequently reduced the wealth of a nation by reducing the productivity of its people.Adam Smith was truly a man for all season and for all time. It's unfortunate that our politicians and educators are more familiar and enamored by the idiot Karl Marx than they are with Adam Smith.

It is for people who have an interest in classical political economy and its relation to the marginalist tradition. What I have attempted to do is take a critical approach toward contemporary mainstream economics based on what is written in the Wealth of Nations. I hope you enjoy it, and I look forward to constructive criticism and debate.Adam Smith has had by far the greatest general impact on the formation of economic theory of all economic thinkers since - it was he who cast the mold within which the future of economic thought would take place. What I believe has been neglected in most accounts of Smith's contributions to economic theory, however, is that in his attempt at establishing a unified theory of political economy he was instead responsible for developing the framework from which two conflicting theoretical approaches towards economic analysis would later be derived - one with focus on market relations and the other with focus on the relations of production. This marks the beginnings of what has been, in my opinion, a major inconsistency in the development of economic thought - the incompatibility of the former tradition of economic analysis, when taken in isolation from the latter, with the main pivot of Smith's theoretical justification for capitalist development in the \`Wealth of Nations'. The separation of these two areas, it will be argued, has been the result of the further development of certain aspects of Smiths core theoretical insights to the exclusion of deeper inquiry into an understanding of his attempted explanation of their origin and nature. Its product has been a superficial understanding of economic phenomena under capitalist relations responsible for the endless stream of conclusions that manage to both be incompatible with one another and claim immutability. Its practical impact has been to legitimize a system of ideas, culminating in the \`discovery' of universal economic laws detached from and functioning independent of social relations, that has fettered the further cultural and political progression of humanity through the intellectual impoverishment of human life.----------The \`Wealth of Nations', though it was overwhelmingly concerned with practical application and the specific policies of its time, has not cast such a long shadow on the progression of economic thought simply by merit of its attacks on the effects of Mercantilist economic policy. There were political economists before and after Smith who had carried out similar attacks, as is shown by the fact that Smith derived his argument against Mercantilist protectionist policy from Hume. Instead, the major impact of the \`Wealth of Nations' on economic thought has been its attempted establishment of a theoretical framework in which individual self interest was the driving force of an economic system that was propelled by its own momentum and functioned according to its own laws. In Schumpeter's words, it put forth the major assertion that \\"the free interaction of individuals produces not chaos but an orderly pattern that is logically determined\\". This orderly pattern was, for Smith, the tendential movement of the market prices of commodities toward their natural values. The major theoretical task of the \`Wealth of Nations' was an unveiling of the mechanisms that function to ensure this continuous movement of all nominal values toward their natural values within the framework of the free interaction of individuals. In this sense, Smith's argument against the Mercantilist system of political economy was, for all intensive purposes, an application ofhis general theory of natural value; there existed a \`natural' level to which any artificial adjustment in the quantity of money would adjust. The thrust of Smith's critiques on the effects of the Mercantilist doctrine are to be interpreted in the context of this distinction between natural and artificial value, within which its effects are extended beyond simple redundancy.Smith began his theory of value and price determination with a distinction between what he called the natural value of commodities and their market price, or their nominal and real price. The market price of a commodity is the price at any given moment of time in which commodities are exchanging for one another. Market prices fluctuate as a reaction to myriad natural and manmade phenomena and are in turn regulated by the interplay of supply and demand. If a drought adversely affects the yield of corn for a given period it would be the cause of a reduction in the supply of corn in relation to the level of effectual demand and a subsequent increase in market price; if it for some reason becomes fashionable to wear pink overcoats, assuming of course that individuals in a given society desire to be fashionable, then the effectual demand for pink overcoats will increase in relation to available supply and consequently so will the market price of pink overcoats. Value, on the other hand, is the point around which these movements, or vibrations, of price gravitate. Smith believed that individual commodities will rarely, if ever, exchange at their value due to constant changes and/or disruptions in the conditions of any given market. The hypothetical; point at which value and price meet may be understood as the more familiar concept of equilibrium; the point that competition would yield in the long run through the interplay of supply and demand on the market.The importance of these two concepts for Smith's theoretical framework was the effect that competition had on individual producers to cause the prices of commodities to always be in tendential movement toward their value. Essentially competition, which was restricted under the auspices of the \`Commercial System', was the force acting on individual producers which would ensure, in the long run, that commodities would be bought and sold at precisely the amount required to produce them - their value. There are two main justifications for the desirable nature of this process. On the one hand Smith believed that when prices were at their value the entire economic system was in turn at the highest point of efficiency and equality it could possibly be. On the other hand, Smith believed that this movement would ultimately benefit the mass of people with lower prices, which would continue to decrease in proportion to the advances in the conditions of production of commodities. Competition would in turn pressure individual producers to apply these cost lowering technical advances to the production process because of the need to reduce the value of their commodities in order to command a larger share of their respective markets, hence allowing for a higher rate of profit and the ability to continually reinvest their capital to repeat the same process indefinitely. Thus, it was on this tendency of competition to move the prices of commodities toward their values, and in time to reduce their values, that Smith's entire justification for the elimination of Mercantilist protection and privilege in favor of a system based on the free interaction of individuals ultimately rested. Not only was the Mercantilist doctrine of money manipulation redundant, but the means by which it attempted to achieve this ultimate redundancy prevented the functioning of extremely powerful mechanisms that Smith believed ensured the long run reduction in values of commodities - the betterment of the masses of people through the further development of the productive forces of society. As Schumpeter described: \\"It is the cheap cloth, the cheap cotton and rayon fabric, boots, motorcars and so on that are the typical achievements of capitalist production, and not as a rule improvements that would mean much to the rich man. Queen Elizabeth owned silk stockings. The capitalist achievement does not typically consist in providing more silk stockings for queens but in bringing them within the reach of the factory girls in return for steadily decreasing amounts of effort\\"Contemporary mainstream economics, a position held by the neoclassical tradition, though seemingly rejecting value as an \`economic' concept, has in fact incorporated selective parts of what has been its derivative into their theory of prices in market economies. This has been accomplished by simply supplanting the tension between value and price with what is their emergent concept of equilibrium, within which the whole of their analysis of price formation takes place. Within their framework, though for all intense and purposes similar, the nature of equilibrium, being for Smith a hypothetical position of the meeting of value and price, thus takes on an entirely different meaning. They essentially adopted a view of equilibrium as being determined by the equalization of the supply of commodities with their respective demand, the signals to which occur in exchange relations on the market. There is no contrast on which Smith placed prime importance between the 'natural' value determined in production to which all \`artificial' prices determined in exchange are constantly tending, but simply \`equilibrium' prices as given by the aggregation of subjective judgments of individuals - thus making the interaction of market mechanisms with man, which Smith attributed solely to the measuring rod of \`market' price, the explanation of value a. In this regard, 'value' is transformed into a function of the influence of demand upon costs of s well production - more specifically on the last fragment of want not satisfied - and ultimately purported to be a subjective calculation of individuals. Prices are now the reflection of the interaction between these marginal rates of substitution of individual consumers and marginal costs of production of producers - Marginal substitution as the demand schedule of individuals which, operating under the \`law' of diminishing marginal utility, decreases for every increase in the price of a commodity and increases for every decrease in the price of a commodity; Marginal cost as the supply schedule of producers which, under conditions of diminishing returns, decreases as more units are produced.The effect of this change, curiously enough, was largely on the classical theories of distribution. By shifting the focus of an inquiry into the forces acting on price away from the realm of production to the realm of exchange, essentially making the regulating force of price the subjective valuations of commodities and their impact on the costs of producing those commodities, it rendered meaningless what was of prime importance for Ricardo, and Marx thereafter - distribution between economic classes and its deterministic effects on the outcome of exchange. Theories of distribution had formerly attempted to explain the division of value between different social classes in a given society. Smith himself identified the \`three great classes' of society to \\"which the price of every commodity ultimately resolved\\" as being landowners, laborers, and manufactures - it was Ricardo, and more extensively Marx afterward, that showed the conditions in which this division of value between them took place was located in the realm of production before exchange took place. Gracious as they were in escaping them, these questions of class and the division of value between them became for economists not so much irrelevant in a greater sense, but \`outside' of what economic analysis set out to answer as they were now \`outside' of the theoretical determination of price. There was no longer a separation between exchange value and use value, but the derivation of exchange value from use value (utility). Distribution therefore became determined not from conditions of production but from exchange relations.This subtle maneuver of redefining equilibrium, or we should say using it for different purposes, served to retain positive aspects of Smith's analysis to the exclusion of what the logical extension of his system by further inquiry unveiled: It ultimately served the exact same purpose of having competition operate to tend prices to a point of efficiency and equality, where things are sold at precisely what they are worth (now subjectively determined by some feat of aggregating what occurs on the individual level of optimizing preferences), thus allowing for the maintenance of the virtuous development that Smith associated with the free interaction of individuals and the discarding of the negative features that became associated with Marx's later \`socially necessary labor time'. Not only were the later logical extensions of Ricardo and Marx that spoiled the virtuous cycle done away with in a single stroke, but extremely important aspects of Smith - from the identification and examination of the interaction between social classes to the objective nature of value existing in production - were all safely brushed aside.The vicious circle, however, eventually caught up with utopia: the attempted formalization of this interplay between market mechanisms and man as both the measuring rod of and the explanation for value brought an inconsistency: initial distribution continued to claim overarching priority in the formation of price. The expression of utility that was the interaction of man with the market could not possibly be based on subjective measurements of value, but on the actual purchasing power which translated into market pull. Thus, the independent postulation of some pre-existing income level or distribution was necessary for the internal consistency of any formal demonstration of price determination based on marginal utility. Essentially, This is the root of what will later be shown to be the major contradiction in the superficial extension of Adam Smith; it essentially revolves around the assumption most fundamental to all conceptual frameworks, that question supposedly \`outside' of the economists' domain - value.--------As Smith believes that the market price of commodities, regulated by their value, is established by the forces of supply and demand, he in turn identifies the natural price of commodities, the actual substance of value, as being equal to the labor necessary to produce them. He holds the latter to be the case because he believes that a commodity is essentially worth the amount of labor it is able to command on the market - if the producer of X enters into exchange relations with the producer of Y, and the production of X requires 10 hours or labor whereas the production of Y requires 5 hours of labor, then, in the hypothetical instance of commodities exchanging at their value, the producer of X will exchange one unit of X for two units of Y. Already within the beginning of his inquiry is the major problem, and what in the end removes all unity from his whole conceptual framework, to be found. It arises from the fact that Smith ultimately merges his explanation of the substance of value into what he before held as distinct, market relations - for what Smith is now basing his explanation of value upon is here the extent to which labor can be commanded in exchange, and not the \\"so much less labour than before\\" that makes up the substance of exchange value, or the labor embodied within commodities in the process of production.Let us examine this issue further. Smith, in holding the labor commanded by commodities as the explanation of their value, is essentially making what amounts to the same claim that it is the labor necessary to produce commodities that is the determinant of their value ONLY under conditions in which the whole produce of labor belongs to the laborer. Under these conditions Smith sees no contradiction because there is none; it is only after the fact that this separation comes to play a destructive role. We can easily see why Smith thought this to be the case - when a producer of a product exchanges this product, in which only his labor was used to produce, with an individual who has done the same, the labor which each of these commodities command on the market is equivalent to the labor embodied within them. There is X amount of labor embodied in the commodity, and the laborer, appropriating the whole product, thus exchanges it and receives X amount of materialized labor in return for it. Confusion sets in on Smith when he attempts to extend the labor commanded theory of value to instances in which labor is not the sole 'factor' ofproduction, but land and capital as well. He runs head on into what is seemingly a major problem - if labor does not appropriate the whole of its produce, but a portion is divided between either rent to a landlord or profit to a capitalist (manufacturer, in his words), then labor commanded is no longer equal to the price of the commodity it produces. The price of commodities on the market will in general be higher than the exchange value of labor. As Smith is well aware that he must have an explanation of value consistent with \\"the three great classes of society\\" for the functionality of his entire schemata, if only because the appropriation of the full product of labor by the laborer was \\"at end...long before the most considerable improvements were made in the productive powers of labour\\", he is now seemingly forced to discard the applicability of the labor necessary to produce commodities as an explanation of value to a society in which labor is not the sole \`factor of production' of commodities.Instead of further unraveling this contradiction, the task of which was left to Ricardo, and, more extensively Marx, Smith adopts what is now called a \`cost of production' theory of value - essentially, as Smith sees the necessity of the incorporation of \\"the accumulation of stock and the appropriation of land\\" into his conceptual apparatus, he simply makes the \\"natural value\\" to which all \\"market prices are constantly gravitating\\" equivalent to the \`returns' to land, labor, and capital based on the observation that it is into these \\"three parts\\" which \\"the price of every commodity finally resolves itself\\". Of course, \`value' is in this sense superfluous - simply identifying that rentiers, capitalists, and laborers all receive a portion of the value of commodities does not serve as an explanation of where the value of these commodities derives; but, then again, this is our problem, is it not? We can now see the starting point of superficial extensions - of profit simply being another form of wages for inspection and direction, risk or abstinence, which becomes plucked out of its proper context as being linked to the value of the stock employed. From whence does this value come - the sky? Thus, we are yet again gifted with another gem in the \`production possibility frontier' of neoclassical economics - in which there can be no mistaking the superficiality of \`switching between capital and labor'. Neither can the perspective required for the exposition of such insight be mistaken.It is in the evasion of one contradiction which Smith naturally becomes entangled in another, his recognition of this being doubtful. The contradiction materializes when Smith moves on to his analysis of the \`Wages of Labour', where he correctly maintains that returns to land and capital are derivative from labor and labor alone. Smith thus becomes his own greatest enemy, for he has now, quite explicitly, singlehandedly refuted both his own labor commanded theory of value and his cost of production theory of value. The only unifying force, and luckily for Smith what remains implicit throughout his whole analysis of the division of labor, is a labor embodied theory of value - that \`returns' to land and capital are not returns at all, but appropriation from the labor which they employ. Thus we have come to one major critique levied against Smith by Ricardo - the division of value between classes in no way refutes the principle that value is derived from labor.There are two rreasons why I believe that Smith did not realize his self contradictions: first, this contradiction was spelled out quite plainly, whereas the former was not. It thus makes little sense for Smith to have not made any attempt to remedy it as he did the former from which it came; second, and more importantly, the so called cost of production theory of value was, for all intents and purposes, consistent with his notion of tendential movements of price toward \`value', much in the same way as neoclassical equilibrium theory is functional solely by merit of the identification of a given supply. What it was not consistent with, which will be shown later, was his theory of the division of labor and the increases in productivity that it allowed as a function of decreasing value. It is from the combination of what Smith, in arguing with himself, found to be dead ends with his concept of the division of labor, on which the development of the former aspect of his inquiry relied, that is at the core my claims.---The Division of Labor---In sweeping away the Mercantilist doctrine, Smith put forth a new answer to the question of how to increase the wealth of nations; that it was be found in the realm of production, more specifically in finding a mechanism the influence of which caused improvements in the conditions of production. These improvements were the development of the productive forces which, by reducing the amount of labor required to produce them, caused a reduction in the value of commodities. Smith identified this mechanism as the division of labor.The division of labor, however, did not serve only to reduce the value of material output - it both fostered the growth and application of specialized knowledge to further innovate the production process. Innovations which were responsible for the introduction of new products and the increased efficiency of the production of existing products were the result of the division of labor. This is because a specialized producer would be more far more likely to posses, or have a much greater possibility of obtaining, the requisite knowledge to improve a product and themethod by which that product was produced than a person who was forced to spread his or her time across the production of many different products. The mechanism of the division of labor, in turn, was identified by Smith as being a function of the volume of exchange between individuals. He believed that when people regularly engaged in exchange relations they would become inclined to specialize in production - i.e. spontaneously form a division of labor. This is because with every increase in specialization there is in turn an increase in the volume of exchange due to a subsequent decrease in the self sufficiency of individuals. If an individual who formerly produced the whole of his or her necessary product specializes in the production of one of these products, he or she must then engage in exchange relations to obtain the rest. The growth in the volume of exchange then served to expand the division of labor, which itself served to expand the volume of exchange as it allowed for the individual the ability \\"to exchange all that surplus part of the produce of his own labor\\" and therefore \\"encourages every man to apply himself to a particular occupation\\".Thus, as exchange gave rise to the division of labor, and the volume of exchange was in turn directly influenced through the division of labor, the result was an increasing hold of the division of labor on society. The division of labor, then, functioned as a positive feedback mechanism. There was, however, a natural limit to the internal expansion of the division of labor. Smith identified this limit as the extent of the market, or the area in which exchange relations were able to occur. The essential notion behind this concept was that the extent of specialization between producers depended on the mass of producers available to specialize. Smith describes this phenomena with an identification of the further integration of the division of labor in areas that contain a large mass of people, such as \` great towns', as opposed to a small population, such as the countryside.IIAs Smith held that exchange was the driving force behind the expanse of the division of labor, and that this exchange was limited only by the extent of the market, he identified the elimination of spatial and temporal barriers - modern day \`transaction costs' - as the means by which exchange was able to be carried out in a widened area, and hence the means throughwhich the division of labor was able to more deeply integrate itself. This is because these eliminations served to open up further avenues of exchange between individuals and, flirting with their propensities to \\"truck, barter, and exchange\\", led to further expanse of the division of labor. Thus, Smith identified the emergence of commercial civilizations, or, as he says, the first \\"civilized\\" nations, in regions that had fewer barriers to exchange than others. As far as how this reduction of temporal and spatial barriers was accomplished, Smith was rather ambiguous. However, it seems fairly evident that he viewed the division of labor itself as the force that would accomplish this task in the long run. This is because Smith identified the division of labor as not only the instigator of increased material productivity but as the force through which innovation was fostered.But had a division of labor not already existed? And if so, why did the division of labor neither perpetuate itself as Smith had envisioned nor serve to harness the application of the creative potential of individuals to widen the market? Smith's answer to this was that the division of labor that existed, because it was not a system of free enterprise but a manifestation of Mercantilist doctrine, created an atmosphere of monopoly and special privilege that restricted or distorted the forces that signaled the spontaneous ordering of production. In a system of free enterprise, competition between individual producers would both incentivize the actual applications of innovations that the granting of special privileges and subsidies deinsentivized and would eliminate monopoly control because any sector with an above average profit rate would attract production that was formerly involved in a sector with a lower rate of profit, and therefore also ensuring the important movement of price toward value. The regulating force of competition was the main ingredient necessary to bring to life the positive feedback mechanism of the division of labor. Protection was preventing the functioning of the division of labor which, per contra to the conscience construction of Mercantilist policy, functioned by merit of a mechanism which was independent of the conscience design of man.It is in this context of Mercantilist protection policies that Smith's remarks on the interests of manufactures being at odds with that of society as a whole should be interpreted 12. For Smith, the secret of the wealth of nations was to be found in the positive feedback mechanism embedded in the link between the division of labor and the extent of the market: an increase in the division of labor lowers costs, raises real income, and extends the market, thus leading back to an increase in the division of labor and an increase in the extent of the market. Smith held that exchange between individual producers regulated by competition would cause the materialization and expansion of this virtuous cycle. It is in this sense that exchange is considered the driver of growth: it enlarges the pool in which the division of labor exists. The entirety of modern exchange based growth theory is thus derived from Adam Smith. Any argument put forth that identifies \`barriers' or \`limitations' on the ability to exchange being the immediate cause of poverty is thus derived from Adam Smith. Not only that, but Smith also implies that technological innovation is a factor endogenous to production based on a spontaneous division of labor. As technological progress is the long run mechanism through which temporal and spatial barriers are eliminated, not only does short run poverty due to the inability to exchange in this way derive from Smith, but the long run increase in the standard of living of the masses as well. The whole of contemporary mainstream economics has been an attempted formalization of the requirements needed for Smith's division of labor to function. This is the power that lies within the first twenty pages of the \`Wealth of Nations'.IIIBut it is precisely in this moment of glory where the disconnect occurs. For the role attributed to the division of labor is inexorably tied to the notion that labor is the \\"real measure of exchangeable value of all commodities\\". Redefining value as being determined in exchange contradicts the whole foundation of the Smith's division of labor: if the functioning of the division of labor is to reduce the value of commodities through paradigm shifts in how they are produced in the long run, in their conditions of production, then it is within the production process alone that an explanation of value must rest. Smith himself, in putting forth the labor commanded theory of value, maintained consistency with his theory of the division of labor to the extent that individual producers appropriated their own product. As this was incapable of being extended to capitalist production, Smith then switched to a cost of production theory of value in order to escape the trap he had laid for himself. However, as we have shown, this theory of value was not a theory of value at all and thus was incapable of explaining anything other than showing a hypothetical point at which value and price would be equal - it was therefore incompatible with the dynamic nature of the division of labor. It is from the latter which contemporary equilibrium analysis has its origins, and, quite naturally, why equilibrium analysis in neoclassical economics had also been doomed to a static existence: dynamics could only be incorporated as an element disturbing equilibrium, whereas within the whole of the operation of the division of labor equilibrium is only a fleeting moment of a vibration which is in ceaseless fluctuation. Smith, despite his fumbling, maintained conceptual unity because the whole of his division of labor was based around an environment wherein labor commanded was for all intents and purposes equivalent to labor embodied - or a world where the laborer appropriated the whole of his or her produce. His inclusion of the pin factory example, while highlighting the increase of productivity it allowed, served to hide the fact that this productivity was a function of a specific explanation of value. This dualistic nature, or perhaps the high degree of ambiguity, in which Smith conducted his analysis of the division of labor therefore turned out to be both his weakest and strongest point.This dualism carried on to his heirs, however it now took different form. In adopting the marginalist approach to value, it manifested itself in an attempt to explain the functioning of an economic system according to individual self interest as a function of profit on the basis, or perspective, of individuals who have left the production process, or left the process in which material objects are produced as a prerequisite for profit. Exchange, without production, yields no profit; no growth. I may trade you nine apples for one of your apples, a deal in which you have convinced me beyond doubt is best for both of us, and in the end we still have between us ten apples. This attempted escape, however, was not an escape at all but instead served to shift the search of error and inconsistency to the confines of marginalism, and, as we have shown that it was a purely exchange driven explanation of value, financial speculative excess naturally became the issue. For where there is no production process, or when value is explained in the ct the value of which is rooted in exchange becomes more a function of the degree to which people are holding it - hoarding it - as concerns scarcity than the aggregation of marginal propensities. The recent popularity of 'behavioral' economics corresponds to this identification."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"ALWAYS GO TO THE SOURCE!!!

You'd be amazed to discover how many of the MBA-Ph.D Economist drones quoting Adam Smith in support of so-called \\"free trade\\" policies have never read it (almost none). Although Mr. Smith supports open trade, what is being called \\"free trade\\" by modern politicians and multinational corporations who quote Adam Smith in support of their rape/pillage/burn of America bears no relation whatsoever to the policies Adam Smith wrote in support of. Adam Smith DESPISED big business and wrote his great economic tome in support of SMALL to MID-SIZED businesses ... the kind controlled by a real person and not an over-payed CEO and unaccountable board of directors. Pay special attention to Smith's comments about the herring subsidies (Monsanto, big oil), taxes (a necessary evil), and corporate monopolies (Walmart/big banks - whenever they get together the common man is worse off).Talking about this book at cocktail parties where MBA-drones congregate is great fun ... kind of like taking the Bible and completing the out-of-context biblical quotes spewed out by radical right-wing Christians (they say \\"woman obey your husband\\" and you finish the biblical passages in context and say something like \\"put your wife above all others ... and husbands don't be vexatious to your wife.\\"). Makes the person mis-quoting the great work look like a donkey and you look like Stephen Hawkings.Caveat ... although this book is understandable because Smith ties abstract economic pricipals to ordinary commodities such as herring and corn, it is best read in small, digestible chunks due to the archaic 18th-century English.

It is very clear from the context in both books that Smith is referring to the enlightened self interest of moral decision makers who have had specific religious instruction,as well as a general education.Smith spends nearly 50 pages(Smith,pp.716-766) advocating the necessity of such instruction,if necessary funded by the public .Both of Smith's books must be read together in order to understand his overall philosophy.The Libertarian approach,which considers only a small portion of Smith's second book, is a caricature of Smith .Smith advocated a progressive system of taxation.Smith advocated usury laws(interest rate controls).The First Bank of the United States,set up by Alexander Hamilton,was modeled after the central bank control concepts of Adam Smith,as opposed to the free banking advocated by libertarians.Most importantly,Smith's theory of comparative advantage opposed any offshoring of either employment and/or industrial/financial capital if the purpose of such offshoring was to supply the home market.Such foreign investment can only be made to supply the foreign market.Smith was one of the first opponents of globalization,since globalization directly conflicted with the theory of comparative advantage.Globalization advocates base their arguments on absolute advantage.Finally,Smith fully supported the use of counter tariffs if there was any probability that such a counter tariff would succeed in getting the offending nation to remove its initial tariff.Only if there was no probability of success would Smith forgo retaliation.A reader of both of Smith's books will discover quickly that he would have no sympathy for the atheistic materialism of any variety of anarchistic libertarianism. Smith would thus have been an ardent advocate of the conservative Federalist position of Washington,Hamilton,Madison,Franklin,Jay,etc.,while opposing the libertarian views of Paine,Mason,and Henry."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"This was absolutely a brutal read; however, it was more or less a paradox described as painfully interesting.

I found the ideas behind taxing to be simple but effective given their presentation as well as Smith's arguements for a free market economy. Reading this historical text has also helped placed into context his arguemnts against the mercantile system and the taxing of the American colonies because the depth that he goes into about said subjects is more than any history class that I have taken has allotted. For some the wording may seem dated or old or borring but for those who enjoy a more analytical style or writing, such as the style used in the translations of Roman philosophy texts, the writing style should not be a problem. The most intimidating aspect of this book is its size, an aspect which can easily be overcome if the reader finds the text engaging for the above reason. While I cannot say that it is a \\"must read\\" or a \\"required read\\" for an understanding of economics simply because of the ignorance which I still possess on the subject, I can say that it is an informative read that explains in depth, using cited examples, areas of economics that are easy to grasp if the reader enjoys the text.

To minimize repetition, the differences for this version: This massive book is complete and unabridged (all five books). There is a great added feature in the form of small summary notes in the margin that accompany each paragraph. Adam Smith was a masterful writer of prose and communicates some of the most important economic and philosophical ideas in the history of western civilization. Economic theory never read so beautifully.An interesting choice for an introduction is Robert Reich. He is one of the few intellectuals from the left, and while I disagree with him more often than not, I respect his thought process. He offers his interpretation of Smith and how the ideas found in TWoN fit neatly with his positions. Selective reasoning or not, Reich does offer a nice summary line: \\"In these times, as when Adam Smith wrote, it is important to remind ourselves of the revolutionary notion at the heart of Smith's opus-that the wealth of a nation is measured not by its accumulated riches, but by the productivity and living standards of all its people.\\" Nicely said and I agree. I just disagree with Reich and his ilk on how the \\"wealth\\" of the modern nation is achieved. Adam Smith offers the roadmap, but it is up to us to keep lawmakers in DC or [insert any central government here] from regulating and taxing us to death --relegating Smith's work to the dust bin."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"\\"The Wealth of Nations\\" is more readable than you probably think, and if you actually sit down to it you'll be repeatedly astounded by Smith's shrewdness.But parts of Smith's original can be tough going in many ways. Why don't publishers acknowledge this by coming out with something more helpful than just the raw text?Unfortunately, finding an edition that will be of great use to you is problematic. That's why I'm giving this book 1 star: not for the text itself, but rather for the paucity of well-done printings out there.Anyhow. I have three before me:1. The \\"Modern Library Classics\\" edition, the one you see on this page. This is complete and unabridged in a single volume, and has a handsome, sturdy feel to it. There is a 4-page introduction and a well-done index, but what irks about this edition is that while it has a plethora of footnotes, all the footnotes are of the \\"textual comparison\\" variety (e.g., \\"12 Car. II., C. 32\\"), rather than the kind that really help you understand antiquated terms and convoluted wordings. In other words, you'll get no help from the editors here.2. Then there is the barrenWealth of Nations (Great Minds Series). There is a 2-page introduction at the beginning and an index, but beyond that it's nothing more than the original text, complete with the original punctuation and spellings (neither of which has been made more merciful for the modern reader).3. The Penguin Classics edition, in two volumes:The Wealth of Nations: Books 1-3 (Penguin Classics)andThe Wealth of Nations, Books IV-V (Penguin Classics). This is probably the least worst edition I have seen, with a superb introduction (nearly 100 pages long), and a glossary, all done by Glasgow's Andrew Skinner. But the only footnotes in the text itself are apparently Smith's own. They appear directly on the bottom of the page in question.So good luck, whichever one you choose.In case you need to know, Smith's original consists of five long chapters, or \\"books.\\"If anybody has a more respectable edition at hand, please comment and I'll incorporate it into this review."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"To be an economist without having read \\"The Wealth of Nations\\" is like being a priest without having read the Bible. As is often the case with second hand accounts, textbooks have distorted and watered down Adam Smith. Going back to the original text is both refreshing and enlightening.The \\"Wealth of Nations\\" remains the most truthful defense of the economic science. But remember that Adam Smith also wrote \\"The Theory of Moral Sentiments\\"; for Smith, economics was a search to better people's life rather than simply a quest to optimize mathematical functions or estimate variables using econometric models.To simply associate Smith with expressions such as the \\"invisible hand,\\" does not do him justice. Take, for example, the opening chapter on the division of labor: first, Smith defends the division of labor as being efficient; then, he defends it as an essential component of the freedom to allocate one's labor to one's talents; finally, he links the division of labor to trade: without the freedom to exchange the fruits of one's labor, the division of labor is meaningless. The point is that Adam Smith defends the rationale for the market, rather than just explain its mechanics.Anyone studying economics in school would think that economics is all about efficiency; this preoccupation, inevitably, breeds economists who support the market simply because it works. But to read Adam Smith is to enter the realm of an economic science where the ultimate benchmark is not efficiency but human freedom and welfare. That is, probably, what Smith would remark if he were to sit in an economics class today, and why the \\"Wealth of Nations\\" is as revolutionary today as it was two centuries ago."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Another reviewer is correct in that there are SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS of the book missing in the Great Minds Series (green and black cover).

Go with a complete version if you're going to bother to tackle this book, or especially if you are focussing on one particular idea (since that may be one that they cut out!)...Smith may be wordy, but to cut out such an enormous amount degrades the integrity of the work.

On one hand the book is filled with ideas, some convincing, some out-dated, some fundamental to the current believe in free-markets. These ideas are combined with appealing (or appalling) examples of the injustice done to people by disturbing the free-market. On the other hand however, I find that certain sections of the book require a lot of concentration. The book is an interesting, but slow and at times difficult, read.Essentially, it is a treatise on the power of individuals to maximise their own wealth and therefor a support for the natural liberty of men and an argument for free-markets. Not as a perfect system in which there will be no misery, but as a system that gives individuals the greatest (and most just) opportunity to gain happiness and which will be the quickest to respond to changes in supply and demand (and therefor decrease the misery which is created when governments ignore gaps between supply and demand).It is not a book that believes in the pure goodness of companies (but explicitly states that companies have a interest which is directly opposite to that of society as a whole. I.e. the interest of companies is to create a supply shortage so they can ask prices above costprice), but says that the best way to break the power of these companies is the allow free competition. It also reveals that political decisions that at fist glance seems compassionate, might in fact be inhumane, cruel and the cause of much suffering (because on the long run they lead to a supply shortage). The examples given here, are still relevant to view the decisions made by politicians in today's so-called free market countries.Comment on review of Micheal Brady, june 13 2005:Brady remarks that Smith was the first opponent of globalization. The (strange) evidence he gives to support this statement is that Smith supports the use of counter tariffs, if (and only if) this might lead to the removal of the initial tariff. This statement clearly shows that Smith was against protectionist measures like tariffs and only condoned them if in the short run they would lead to less protectionism and therefor more globalization! Brady also supports his statement by mentioning that Smith opposed any offshoring if the purpose of such offshoring was to supply the home market. The keyword here again being \\"if\\".

There were certainly economists before Adam Smith (just as there were philosophers before Plato); and there are some, I am sure, who will claim that some of the economists writing before Adam Smith were actually superior to Adam Smith in some ways (just as there are philosophers who prefer the pre-Socratics to Plato).But Adam Smith, like Plato, was able in his work to define a relevant set of problems which to a large degree are the same problems that are still being dealt with, and debated, within economics today; and, like Plato, the work of Adam Smith has been the source for various strands, or schools of economic thought, each of which finds its ground in a different aspect of Adam Smith's work. Adam Smith's analysis of the division of labor (the productive forces of society), his adherence to a labor theory of value (at least in part) and his distinction between productive and unproductive labor have been sources for the tradition of economic thought following Ricardo and Marx; while Adam Smith's analysis of the benefits of laissez-faire economic policies, his analysis of exchange, and determination of price through supply and demand, have been sources for the Neo-classical, marginalist, and free-market strands of economic thought.Adam Smith sees the wealth of a nation as consisting in its annual produce (what we today would call GDP). This is the central idea behind the whole book and is Adam Smith's major innovation in regard to previous economic thought (as I understand it). Adam Smith will evaluate the harm or the benefit of various economic policies by attempting to determine the over-all effect each policy will have on the annual produce of society as a whole. If a policy increases this annual produce then it is beneficial to society as a whole. If a policy decreases this annual produce then it is harmful to society as a whole. This is still, to a large degree, the measure we use when evaluating the effects of a given economic policy, though we are perhaps beginning to see that the benefit or harm of a given policy cannot be reduced to its effect on annual produce or GDP (environmental effects, for instance, effect society as a whole and have to be measured against effects on GDP in determining the costs and benefits of any economic policy).With few exceptions Adam Smith believes that laissez-faire policies are the best policies for increasing the over-all wealth of a nation and he bases his argument on his notion of the \`invisible hand'. This is another one of Smith's important theoretical innovations; the notion that each individual, by pursuing their own interest, without any thought or conscious plan for society as a whole, does not lead to chaos but tends, as if guided by an invisible hand, towards a maximization of the yearly annual produce of a nation. It is not necessary for society to \`plan' for this outcome in a conscious way; in fact, no amount of conscious planning could improve on the outcome produced by simply allowing individuals to pursue their own interests unfettered by government. This has been one of the most influential ideas ever put forward by anyone since the beginning of human history, whether for good or ill.So there are a number of reasons why anyone who is interested in economics should study The Wealth of Nations. First, Adam Smith defines a common set of problems which to a large degree are problems that economists are still trying to solve to this day (in the same way that Plato determined a common set of problems that still occupy philosophers to this day). Second, some of Adam Smith's ideas have been extremely influential on all subsequent debate and are still used in policy debates to this day. People still use the notion of the invisible hand to argue for the benefits of free-trade for instance. It is important, therefore, to understand how the invisible hand is supposed to work and what the benefits of allowing it to work are supposed to be. And third, Adam Smith is one of the most accessible and readable economists who ever wrote. You do not have to be a trained economist (I am not) to benefit from reading this work.So I fully recommend this work to anyone interested in economics or social and political philosophy."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"\\"The Wealth of Nations\\" is a big book of economics, history, philosophy, and social criticism. It is much more than Adam Smith neckties at GOP conventions. It is much more than a reverential nod or two in modern econ textbooks. Econ students need to read it to see where their discipline came from and what it could be again.Dickey's abridgment reproduces enough of the text (about 25 percent) to convey the depth of Smith's erudition and the diversity of his interests. Unfortunately, the editorial apparatus is weak. The Comments are few in number and incredibly brief, and the short Preface fails to put the book into historical and intellectual context. Dickey does offer four appendices but these deal with specialized topics rather than the big picture.Bottom line: this edition is inexpensive but is probably not the best one for students."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"The Scottish Adam Smith is certainly the most important economists of all times and is the founder of modern economic thought, being &quot;The Wealth of the Nations&quot; his major work, where he introduces to the general public of his time - the book was first published in 1776 - new concepts and ideas as &quot;competitive advantage&quot;, &quot;divison of labour&quot;, &quot;the power of the invisible hand&quot;, and many others still powerfull today, even accounting for the changes happened in the world economy and politics. From this starting point, a crucial juncture in the world economy, that is, the beginning of the industrialisation in England, many renowed economists and social scientists construed their theories. To name a few? Karl Marx, David Ricardo, John Stuart Mill and many others acknowledge the importance of Adam Smith's work to their theories. Besides this opus, he did a lot in the field of philosophy, but was to become known as the father of the Classic school of economics. One of not so many Economics excelent Classic books to read. Enjoy it."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"This book is so widely cited and interpreted contrary to the author's original thought, that every economist should read it completely to avoid being misled by such incorrect interpretations.First, let us take the \\"invisible hand\\" metaphor. When I have studied economy in the University, I was taught that almost the entire book is devoted to the \\"invisible hand\\" which means \\"self-corrective markets\\", \\"liberalism\\", \\"Laissez-faire\\" and \\"state non-intervention\\". After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith did use the term \\"invisible hand\\" only once in the entire book, in the discussion of domestic versus foreign trade.To illustrate the point, let me quote the text where term \\"invisible hand\\" is used: \\"First, every individual endeavours to employ his capital as near home as he can, and consequently as much as he can in the support of domestic industry, provided always that he can thereby obtain the ordinary, or not a great deal less than the ordinary profits of stock. Thus, upon equal, or nearly equal profits, every wholesale merchant naturally prefers the home trade to the foreign trade of consumption, and the foreign trade of consumption to the carrying trade. In the home trade, his capital is never so long out of his sight as it frequently is in the foreign trade of consumption. [...]Secondly, every individual who employs his capital in the support of domestic industry, necessarily endeavours so to direct that industry, that its produce may be of the greatest possible value. [...]As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can, both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce maybe of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain; and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it.\\"After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith was influenced by French Physiocrats. The Physiocrats saw the true wealth of a nation as determined by the surplus of agricultural production over and above that needed to support agriculture (by feeding farm labourers and so forth). Other forms of economic activity, such as manufacturing, were viewed as taking this surplus agricultural production and transforming it into new products, by using the surplus agricultural production to feed the workers who produced the extra goods. While these manufacturers and other non agricultural workers may be useful, they were seen as 'sterile' in that their income derives ultimately not from their own work, but from the surplus production of the agricultural sector.I have found out that this book is not about \\"invisible hand\\" or \\"Laissez-faire\\". It is quite a complete study that covers almost every basic aspect of the economy, and remains an effective introduction to economics to this day.This book is so often mischaracterized and politicized that I suggest you to read it completely by yourself. This is a must read for every economist. You can get an audio version of this book to avoid lengthy read."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Hello,I made the mistake of buying a differnt kindle version of this book.

Thank You.Joe"},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"The Wealth of Nations is one of the most important books ever written. In some respects the Wealth of Nations was a tract for the times. Smith penned a crippling critique of the mercantilist \`Policy of Europe'. Smith, along with David Hume and David Ricardo, refuted the mercantilist case for protectionism. Much of what we read in this book is still taught in modern economics classes. Modern day protectionists still have no answer to the principles of absolute and comparative advantage, and for the basic logic of Hume's specie flow mechanism.Smith was more than an ordinary economist. He was a visionary who saw some of the potential for progress through Globalization. Perhaps the most important concept of this book is the dynamics between division of labor, labor productivity, and the extent of markets. Smith conceived of Globalization as a process that would raise productivity as local markets expanded to national and then international scope. His example of division of labor in a pin factory is simple, but illustrative.The most widely known part of this book is that part of the \`invisible hand of markets'. Invisible hand reasoning still pervades modern economic theory, though there are some variations in how economists interpret this concept. Smith does differ from Modern economists on certain issues. Smith thought of competition as a process and of monopoly as a government grant of privilege. In these areas Smith was ahead of many modern economists. Smith also explained market prices in terms of labor content. Here is Smith's great error. Labor value theory set economics on the wrong course. Labor value theory served as the basis for Marxism. This, of course, indicates the great influence of The Wealth of Nations on world history. Without labor value theory the Marxist idea of exploitation falls apart. Smith therefore played a posthumous role in twentieth century history, especially from 1918 to 1991. Of course, we cannot blame Smith for the misuse of his ideas. Smith would have surely opposed Marxism, had he been alive to do so.What we have in this book is a tremendous effort at discovering the proper limits between private and public institutions. Better still, Smith thought about society and institutions in evolutionary terms. This is another reason why the Wealth of Nations is preferable to modern economics texts. Smith understood the dynamics of capitalism better than many modern economists- who focus on static math models. Smith also influenced Charles Darwin with his ideas of social evolution. There is much evidence indicating that Darwin got the idea for the evolution of species by reading The Wealth of Nations. Smith therefore had great influence on the biological sciences.Modern economists reject Smith labor value theory (ever since Menger refuted it in 1870). However, there is no denying the influence of The Wealth of Nations. All members of the educated public should read at least part of this book. The question then in which edition should you buy? The Liberty Classics edition is unabridged. The Modern Library Classics edition has margin notes that could be helpful. Given the affordability of these editions, you might consider have both on your bookshelf (I do). I would avoid the Great Mind Series altogether. The Wealth of Nations should be read because it is both a book of great historical importance and a good source for understanding modern Globalization. The labor value theory part precludes a five star rating, but anything less than four stars would be absurd."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"I have read WoN in three different editions and undoubtedly the best was the definitive version in the Glasgow edition of his Collected Works. This is cheaply and conveniently reporinted in the Liberty Fund edition which I recommend to anyone who is actually *studying* the text. It notes variations between different editions and has extremely useful notes which are helpful in understanding Smith's relations to his predecessors.It's an interesting book, over-quoted and under-read. Read it - all of it - and you will find a rather different argument and conclusions from that bestowed upon this classic by partisans of untrammeled free markets who trumpet some sound-bites from the book but reject Smith's underlying argument."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Adam Smith's \\"An Inquiry Into The Nature And Causes Of The Wealth Of Nations\\" (often called simply \\"The Wealth Of Nations\\") is one of two great works from the Scottish economist and philosopher, the other being the lesser known \\"The Theory of Moral Sentiments\\". \\"The Wealth Of Nations\\" was published on March 9th, of 1776, but there were additional editions in 1778, 1784, 1786, and 1789. I read the free Kindle version of \\"The Wealth Of Nations\\", and while I do not recommend that version I do recommend the overall work.The issues with the Kindle version are that it is poorly formatted, and it is painful to attempt to read the numbers in the tables at the of Book I. You are much better off getting a hard copy so that you can more easily flip to the section of interest, and to read the information in a better format. As for the rest, the content is all there, once you get past the poor formatting.The work contains five books within. The first is \\"Of the Causes of Improvement in the productive Powers of Labour\\". In this book he discusses the benefits of the division of labor, the origin and benefits of using money, a section on the \\"real\\" price of commodities (i.e. how much toil it takes to produce them), a discussion of the natural and market prices of commodities (the forces of supply and demand), the effect of controlling a commodity can have on the price, the wages of labor (again a case of supply and demand with the commodity of labor), the profits of stock, a discussion of the ill effects of groups who use their influence to manipulate the government (this would include banking conglomerations, trade unions, etc.), and closes with a section on rent.The second book is \\"Of the Nature, Accumulation, and Employment of Stock\\" which deals with accumulating wealth which lasts a longer period of time. This book starts with how one divides their stock into what they need for personal use, and what they can dispose of in exchange for others available stock. He then moves into a discussion of money as a type of stock, and then how to use their excess money/stock to gain interest.The third book is \\"Of the different Progress of Opulence in different Nations\\", where he talks about the balance between the inhabitants of towns and those of the country areas and goes into how agriculture is discouraged over time, while cities and towns prosper.The fourth book is \\"Of Systems of political Economy\\" in which Smith discusses the commercial system, along with importation which contains a detailed look at the effects of restraints on importation/exportation. Smith also discusses commerce treaties, and the role of colonies. This book also has a brief section on the agricultural system, but here he is referring to a specific system where the produce of land is the sole source of the revenue of a nationThe fifth book is \\"Of the Revenue of the Sovereign or Commonwealth\\" in which Smith deals with taxation. This is an important area to read and understand, as it is the one which many ignore when using Smith to try to support other areas. There are hints here of the progressive tax, as well as a discussion of the expenses of the nation, an important acknowledgement that the poor spend the greater part of their income on the fundamentals, such as food, and so he suggests luxury taxes as not unreasonable. Smith then closes the final book with a discussion of the costs of war, both for the actual fighting, and in terms of the loss of trade."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"I was unable to read the book because the print in the book was very small.Very disappointed but will look for a different version or publisher."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"The Kindle format makes it easy to read.

Also makes it not worth my while to look for free ebooks, which I'm sure are available.

It's a 200+ year old book that predates the words capitalism and economics. I lack the economics and financial understanding to really absorb the book and able to regurgitate something meaningful.

In a nutshell, it details the mechanisms by which personal liberty -- accompanied by personal responsibility and a just system of government -- make nations, and the individuals who live in them, wealthy. I had a Marxist professor who did not like Adam Smith because Marxist theory prefers to emphasize class warfare, while Smith is saying that everyone is capable of providing for themselves and the less the government interferes, the better off we all are. Many conservatives, meanwhile, like Adam Smith because they seem to perceive a \\"survival of the fittest\\" philosophy in his works.

This is List's core argument and not to be confused with the &quot;infant industry&quot; characterization. Smith's work is of course a classic.

He also wroteThe Theory of Moral Sentiments. This book was first published in 1776, interestingly enough.Smith noted in the \\"Plan of Work\\" that prefaces the book that among the \\"savage nations of hunters,\\" the people are often \\"miserably poor\\"; while among civilized and thriving nations, \\"a workman, even of the lowest and poorest order... may enjoy a greater share of the necessities and conveniences of life than it is possible for any savage to acquire.\\" The First Book addresses the \\"causes of this improvement, in the productive powers of labour,\\" while the Second Book treats \\"of the nature of capital stock, or the manner in which it is gradually accumulated\\"; the Third Book deals with the circumstances regarding the establishment of towns, rather than of the country; and the Fourth Book deals with various theories of political economy.He begins the book with the observation that \\"The greatest improvement in the productive powers of labour... seem to have been the effects of the division of labour.\\" He cites the example of pin manufacturing, in which a single man could perhaps make one pin a day, \\"and certainly could not make twenty.\\" But by ten persons dividing the labor, they are able to make 48,000 pins in a single day. (Pg. 3-5)He frankly acknowledges that \\"masters\\" (i.e., employers) are \\"always and every where\\" in a sort of tacit, but constant and uniform combination, not to raise the wages of labour above their actual rate. \\"To violate this combination is every where a most unpopular action, and a sort of reproach to a master among his neighbors and equals.\\" (Pg. 66-67) Yet he also notes that the inhabitants of a town \\"can easily combine together,\\" so that by voluntary associations and agreements they prevent that free competition \\"which they cannot prohibit by bye-laws.\\" (Pg. 126) He observes that \\"People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices.\\" (Pg. 128)Of course, the most lastingly influential idea in the book is his concept of the \\"invisible hand,\\" by which an individual who \\"intends only his own gain... (is) led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention... By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it.\\" He adds ironically, \\"I have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good.\\" (Pg. 423)Ultimately, the private interests and passions of individuals naturally dispose them toward tasks which are most advantageous to society. \\"Without any intervention of law, therefore, the private interests and passions of men naturally lead them to divide and distribute the stock of every society ... as nearly as possible in the proportion which is most agreeable to the interest of the whole society.\\" (Pg. 594-595)One cannot adequately summarize a masterwork such as Smith's within the confines of an Amazon review, of course.

It is not from benevolence of the butcher, the brewer or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves not to their humanity but to their self-love and never talk to them of our own necessities, but to their advantages. The real price of everything, what everything really costs to the man who wants to acquire it, is the trouble and toil of acquiring it. Smith contends that there are only 2 ways countries can become wealthy: (1). Their citizens being good savers and then invest these savings toward productive ends; and (2). By way of trade. National wealth grows when things and money are circulated and exchanged to the most remote corners of the globe. Finally, Adam Smith believes that nations will become rich only if natural liberty is promulgated for, society has a natural tendency to allocate resources in the best way. This is now widely known as the \\"invisible hand\\" theory."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"This book is huge!!!

Voter thinking 11/03/09 focused on jobs and the economy, and sent a clear message of dissatisfaction with economic progress to-date. Smith's recommendations have had a large role in creating that dissatisfaction. Private sector employment has dropped since 2000, home ownership and median family income are down since 1998 and the proportion living in poverty has risen. The topic's importance was re-emphasized 11/06/2009 with the release of data showing the unemployment rate continuing to climb - now 10.2% (not counting those who have given up looking, or are working only part-time). Adam Smith and Free Enterprise are not working; meanwhile, China's GDP is growing 8.5%.Reinvigorating Main Street America's employment picture, however, will not be easy. Problems have been building for years, long before the sub-prime crisis. Some believe automation is the major source of recent job losses. However, it is difficult to look at the constant parade of long trains carrying shipping containers inland, or the millions of illegals turning up all across America, and conclude that this is the case. Substantial improvement on Main Street will primarily require drastically limiting Smith's 'Free Trade.' Free Trade supporters repeatedly cite the imposition of Smoot-Hawley tariffs as substantially deepening and prolonging the Great Depression, and conclude that we must not turn protectionist. Reality, however, is that prior to Smoot-Hawley, the 1929 Trade Surplus was an insignificant 0.38% of our GDP, and could not possibly have had significant impact even if lost entirely. True, international trade plays a much bigger role than in 1930 - however, the fact that we've run large and increasing trade deficits for decades is prima-facie evidence that eg. no trade whatsoever would at least stop the bleeding.As for Adam Smith's famous Free Trade support, that occurred 200+ years ago - before across-the-board very large and low-cost competitors like China, India, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam, the Internet, jet planes, and massive cargo ships made a much large proportion of economies vulnerable to offshoring than ever before. We need to also remember that protectionism is what allowed the U.S. and its new Asian competitors to achieve their original economic strength. (Smith himself warned against taking Free Trade too far - such that a nation's security was endangered.)Free Trade defenders might assert that manufacturing and IT have borne the brunt of offshoring to date, and their future offshoring is not likely to increase. Recent trends and data, however, suggest service jobs will increasingly also become affected. American firms are already establishing R&D; facilities in China; Asian competitors not only have a cost advantage competing for engineering work, they also have the advantage of greater experience in production gained through producing our manufactures. Unfortunately, this also provides them with a natural lead-in to new areas - eg. offshored CRT-tube manufacturing experience helped Asians in new areas of plasma, LCD, photovoltaic, solar, and LED screen development and manufacturing, and this trend probably will extend into nanotubes as well. Data reported in Business Week's 11/09/2009 issue confirms the shift - over the past year, U.S. employment of scientists and engineers has fallen by 6.3%, while overall employment has fallen only 4.1%.Proposed U.S. economic remedies frequently suggest increasing the proportion of Americans receiving college degrees as a defense against offshoring. Alan Blinder, former Federal Reserve Vice-Chairman and current economics professor at Princeton, warns that the key distinction in whether a job is likely to be offshored or not will be in whether a particular service is delivered in person (haircuts, brain surgery) or not (computer programing) - not whether it is education intensive. (Elective brain surgery can also be offshored.) Thus, a college degree may no longer be a panacea. Blinder also believes it is quite likely that offshoring (unless changed) will depress the real wages of many U.S. workers who do not lose their jobs, the offshoring transition will continue for 2 - 3 decades and bring gross potential job losses in the range of 30- 40 million, and that American standards of living will decline. Proposals by still others to deal with offshoring job losses via more jobs in high-tech areas (eg. biotechnology) become ludicrous when viewed in the light of these numbers. Professor Blinder's suggestion makes much more sense - increased vocational education.Additionally, some Free Trade defenders contend that Chinese labor costs will soon become non-competitive. There are two problems with relying on this 'defense:' 1)Chinese productivity has also increased considerably. Economist Steven Roach (author of \\"The Next Asia\\") lives and works in China and reports that productivity in China's industrial sector surged nearly 20%/year from 2000-2004. Further, even after six years of double-digit increases, average hourly compensation for Chinese manufacturing workers was only 3% that of the U.S. average in 2004. (It's difficult to get reliable up-to-date information on China.) 2)By 2020 it is estimated that there will be 553 million non-agricultural workers in China - 100 million more than in all the developed world, according to Martin Jacques in \\"When China Rules the World.\\"Others contend that China cannot continue its rapid economic growth without Democracy, something it shows few signs of doing. Jacques, on the other hand, provides data showing that most Chinese believe the political climate has improved since 1989 (Tienanmen Square), and 72% of its population are satisfied with the condition of the country vs. only 39% in the U.S. (As for the widely reported large number of civil disturbances within China reported each year, Jacques contends most have nothing to do with the central government - eg. local land issues.)Finally, there is the large and growing problem of illegal immigrants taking jobs from American citizens. The U.S. already has enough problems finding work for its own citizens, and the problems are going to become much more severe via currently unfettered offshoring. It is numerically impossible for the U.S. to also provide jobs for the current number of illegal immigrants from Mexico, Central, and South America - we must sharply reduce the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants in the U.S.Bottom Line: Main Street America cannot withstand continually losing jobs to Free Trade, illegal workers, and automation. Wall Street, on the other hand, has benefited immensely from these job losses and shows no signs of changing direction. The recent financial crisis clearly demonstrated that financial markets are not self-correcting, and that Adam Smith's 'invisible hand' is not infallible. Immediate government redirection is required."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"I bought this book because it seems like a must read for anyone interested in business and economics.

Many of Smith's great metaphors are found in the first quarter of the book, and I felt bored reading the latter parts. It is not that Smith was wrong, by any means, but rather that many of his arguments are now well-accepted and can be demonstrated in much more succinct manners. I feel that Smith's multitudes of examples are not particularly important to the average man.With that said, I reiterate that this is an important work that should be understood by everyone - but this does not necessarily mean reading all of it.

The vocabulary is be a little challenging, but that's why your Kindle has a dictionary built in - and you may also need Google, as I did, for some of the more obscure usages. A little background in 17th-18th century British history also helps. I recommend making plenty of notes in your Kindle as you go.Smith compares/contrasts the economies of hunter-gatherer, nomadic and warrior civilizations, as well as feudal and mercantilist economies, and outlines a free-trade system which he would like to see, which we call \\"capitalism\\". Unfortunately, it seems to me that the mercantile system has prevailed in the long run, at least as far as international trade is concerned. He makes considerable use of historical examples as well as contemporary (to him) events, and he seems ambivalent about the prospects for the American colonies which were then in revolt.Wordy?

All I can say is \\"genius.\\" It is of interest not only to the student of economics, but also of history and philosophy. I read this book because I was told that it is widely considered to be the foundation of modern economics. As I am starting a private study in this area, I felt this was a good place to start. If you are starting a study on economics START HERE! Adam Smith ties very abstract concepts to real-life examples that are understandable even today.I read somewhere that this book changed the world. Without knowing more about the period, I cannot say whether it did or not-but based on the magnificence and scope of this work, I believe it could be true. I can see the imprint of Adam Smith everywhere in modern economics-even in Karl Marx cites him! If you read my other reviews, you will see that I have never said this before-so understand, I do NOT say this lightly: This book has truly enriched my understanding of the world around me-and opened my eyes to things that I did not previously understand. Yes-this book changed my outlook on life!You know you are reading a work of timeless genius when you can apply directly what a man wrote in 1776 to the year 2010.If you are considering buying this book be aware of a few things:1) This book was published in 1776-and uses 1776 english. It's a little tough to follow at first, but you get used to it. If you've read America's founding fathers it really constitutes NO difficulty2) Despite the language, this book is VERY readable. His examples are understandable and the structure of the book makes it easy to follow him from point to point.3) This book is HUGE. This version (Bantam Classics) has 1208 pages.4) I wish Bantam would have given more room for notes in the margin.A few other observations about this book-* I was AMAZED by how different banking and financing were in the 1770s.* This book illustrates in SO many ways that people haven't changed AT ALL-very interesting - and amusing to see that illustrated over and over again.* Be prepared for an unrelating (and very convincing) argument for completely free trade.* Some of his digressions (especially the one on corn) were a little tough to get through.* He is SO honest in this book. In a day when pro-business talking heads will excuse any excess-Adam Smith has NO problem taking certain business practices to task. This book taught me, an Unrepentant Capitalist Pig that it is not only OK, but desirable to denounce bad business practices.* I feel a lot of the material in this book shows that a \\"gold standard\\" currency is not the magic bullet that many people today pretend it to be. (not that it's bad-but gold standard has it's own problems)* I feel the material in this book (specifically book 5) could be used to make a strong argument FOR the Fair tax (National Sales Tax)* The arguments he makes about the colonies in North America (us) are VERY surprising. I don't want to spoil it-but I had to re-read it a few times to make sure I understood what he said. - His argument makes sense, but I didn't see it coming.* Being a proud Pennsylvania resident, I was excited to see all the Pennsylvania references.* This book should be REQUIRED reading for any politician who will be assuming elected office.

This is by far the most expensive Kindle edition of Adam Smith, and shouldn't have screwed up its notes -- the only reason for paying five extra dollars -- in this way.Let me add that the Amazon reviewing mechanism is, as usual, inadequate for reviewing Kindle editions; my review ends up one of over fifty reviews discussing the book in general, not the Kindle edition specifically."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"After some 6 months of buying Kindle books, I've found that the better-known publishers as often as not DON'T do a better job of formatting their titles for Kindle. The Modern Library's Kindle version of \\"The Wealth of Nations\\" is a case in point. The footnotes, which appear at the end of each chapter, are all run together in one big paragraph, without any numbers to show where each footnote begins. Moreover, while the footnote references in the text are linked, the links take you only to the start of the footnotes for that chapter, rather than to the pertinent footnote itself. A lesser problem is that the paragraphs in the text do not begin with indents; thus, the only way to tell when a new paragraph starts is if you come to a line that extends only halfway across the screen.On the plus side, this edition does include the explanatory call-outs of the original (in italics at the end of each section they pertain to) and the lengthy 1906 explanatory introduction by Edwin Cannan (though for some reason not the introduction by Robert Rubin to the recent Modern Library paperback).But it's a shame that Modern Library didn't do a better job with the formatting, especially since other Kindle publishers have made TWON available at a fraction of what Modern Library charges."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"This book is so widely cited and interpreted contrary to the author's original thought, that every economist should read it completely to avoid being misled by such incorrect interpretations.First, let us take the \\"invisible hand\\" metaphor. When I have studied economy in the University, I was taught that almost the entire book is devoted to the \\"invisible hand\\" which means \\"self-corrective markets\\", \\"liberalism\\", \\"Laissez-faire\\" and \\"state non-intervention\\". After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith did use the term \\"invisible hand\\" only once in the entire book, in the discussion of domestic versus foreign trade.To illustrate the point, let me quote the text where term \\"invisible hand\\" is used: \\"First, every individual endeavours to employ his capital as near home as he can, and consequently as much as he can in the support of domestic industry, provided always that he can thereby obtain the ordinary, or not a great deal less than the ordinary profits of stock. Thus, upon equal, or nearly equal profits, every wholesale merchant naturally prefers the home trade to the foreign trade of consumption, and the foreign trade of consumption to the carrying trade. In the home trade, his capital is never so long out of his sight as it frequently is in the foreign trade of consumption. [...]Secondly, every individual who employs his capital in the support of domestic industry, necessarily endeavours so to direct that industry, that its produce may be of the greatest possible value. [...]As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can, both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce maybe of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain; and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it.\\"After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith was influenced by French Physiocrats. The Physiocrats saw the true wealth of a nation as determined by the surplus of agricultural production over and above that needed to support agriculture (by feeding farm labourers and so forth). Other forms of economic activity, such as manufacturing, were viewed as taking this surplus agricultural production and transforming it into new products, by using the surplus agricultural production to feed the workers who produced the extra goods. While these manufacturers and other non agricultural workers may be useful, they were seen as 'sterile' in that their income derives ultimately not from their own work, but from the surplus production of the agricultural sector.I have found out that this book is not about \\"invisible hand\\" or \\"Laissez-faire\\". It is quite a complete study that covers almost every basic aspect of the economy, and remains an effective introduction to economics to this day.This book is so often mischaracterized and politicized that I suggest you to read it completely by yourself. This is a must read for every economist. You can get an audio version of this book to avoid lengthy read."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Based on his previous writings on human behaviour, Adam Smith shows, systematically and consistently, how a market-based economic system promotes general welfare through the sole maximisation of individual outcomes.

Smith has written much better in 1776 than nearly all economists do today.The marginal notes are good too. This book is a great book because it argues for some iron-hard economic rules in a way that Centre-left people, such as myself, will listen seriously to. Smith is not a neo-con by any stretch of the imagination. He speaks of employer combinations openly, whereas most economist writers won't talk about them, and he notes that combinations of employees (unions) are, in 1776, banned by the entire world. He also approves of regulations when they improve the safety of working people, something management still has a problem with.So Smith is more even handed than the right wing voices who cite his economic principles constantly, and deserves reading and citing by Centre-Left people."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Reading this reminded me of my Latin classes many years ago, trying to decipher the likes of Cicero.

Reading the observations of someone who was a contemporary of America's founding fathers, but not one of them, gave me a new perspective on the 1700s. Passing references to the vast, but stagnant wealth of China, as well as to colonial enterprises from South America to Asia, add historical flavor to what could have been a dry summary of economic theory, but is instead a rich and colorful exposition of the world as it was.Having just spent some time in Manila earlier this year visiting historical sites and museums, I was intrigued to read about Spain's \\"Acapulco ships\\" that carried silver and other commodities from Mexico across the vast Pacific to the Philippines. Indeed, over and over I found myself putting my finger between the pages so I could daydream for a few minutes, imagining Spanish galleons loaded with treasure, or European merchants bartering and haggling. I suppose a vivid imagination helps to make any book more interesting, but this book in particular lends itself to such flights of fancy.The English of the mid- to late 1700s is not exactly the same as ours today, but it's close enough that few people will have any difficulty with the book. There are a lot of references to weights and measures of gold, silver, corn and other commodities, and their relative value to one another. Frankly, after the first few such references, I simply began skipping over them. Readers who enjoy playing with numbers in their heads may prefer to read those items carefully and playfully -- but I suspect most folks will skip across them as quickly as possible just as I did. It's not the specific values and figures that make this book so important (or enjoyable), but it's ideas about how capital flows, accumulates, is put to productive use and so on.Read this book and gain a new appreciation for the wisdom of the past, and you may also find yourself noting how ideas apply so directly to issues in today's headlines.

There are a lot of references to issues that were occurring during Smith's time that may not seem to be pertinent to the reader, but can still be applied to modern times. I most enjoyed the last sections of the book on taxes and public debts. His 4 maxims of taxes are that they should be- equal, certain, convenient, and beneficial. He viewed inflation as \\"extremely pernicious\\". The book contains ideas that Americans should possibly revisit in the near future."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"This book is so widely cited and interpreted contrary to the author's original thought, that every economist should read it completely to avoid being misled by such incorrect interpretations.First, let us take the \\"invisible hand\\" metaphor. When I have studied economy in the University, I was taught that almost the entire book is devoted to the \\"invisible hand\\" which means \\"self-corrective markets\\", \\"liberalism\\", \\"Laissez-faire\\" and \\"state non-intervention\\". After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith did use the term \\"invisible hand\\" only once in the entire book, in the discussion of domestic versus foreign trade.To illustrate the point, let me quote the text where term \\"invisible hand\\" is used: \\"First, every individual endeavours to employ his capital as near home as he can, and consequently as much as he can in the support of domestic industry, provided always that he can thereby obtain the ordinary, or not a great deal less than the ordinary profits of stock. Thus, upon equal, or nearly equal profits, every wholesale merchant naturally prefers the home trade to the foreign trade of consumption, and the foreign trade of consumption to the carrying trade. In the home trade, his capital is never so long out of his sight as it frequently is in the foreign trade of consumption. [...]Secondly, every individual who employs his capital in the support of domestic industry, necessarily endeavours so to direct that industry, that its produce may be of the greatest possible value. [...]As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can, both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce maybe of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain; and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it.\\"After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith was influenced by French Physiocrats. The Physiocrats saw the true wealth of a nation as determined by the surplus of agricultural production over and above that needed to support agriculture (by feeding farm labourers and so forth). Other forms of economic activity, such as manufacturing, were viewed as taking this surplus agricultural production and transforming it into new products, by using the surplus agricultural production to feed the workers who produced the extra goods. While these manufacturers and other non agricultural workers may be useful, they were seen as 'sterile' in that their income derives ultimately not from their own work, but from the surplus production of the agricultural sector.I have found out that this book is not about \\"invisible hand\\" or \\"Laissez-faire\\". It is quite a complete study that covers almost every basic aspect of the economy, and remains an effective introduction to economics to this day.This book is so often mischaracterized and politicized that I suggest you to read it completely by yourself. This is a must read for every economist. You can get an audio version of this book to avoid lengthy read."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"This book is filled with great information you will find useful as well as having to find new things you never knew about.

For this reason I have marked it down to three stars. Smith is necessary reading for anyone interested in the history of Western thought, the Enlightenment or economics, but it must be said that it is dry, if admirably clear, reading and difficult to chew and swallow. For that reason, it is disappointing to get so far in and then find that one is not getting the complete work.There can be few books that have had such lasting influence on the cultural milieu. Unlike Marx, Smith's ideas seem to have stood up to the tide of history without being washed away, although I write at a time when the finance system appears to have just collapsed, so who knows how a little more history will judge it. At any rate, the correctness of Smith's ideas is perhaps of less import for the student of Western thought than its place in the emergence of a rationalist, secular culture. For Smith was part of the conscious project of the Enlightenment to introduce naturalistic models of our world in place of the magical thinking, in the form of divine providence, which preceded it. Smith was building a model of economy which did not rely on an external, disembodied agency but which emerged deterministically and reached equilibrium through the rule-based interactions of its component parts. His \\"invisible hand\\" replaced another.At the same time, he was making a case for personal autonomy and the right of economic self-determination. As such, Smith combines the two most salient threads of the Enlightenment project - liberation from authority and liberation from magic. More than perhaps any other Enlightenment figure, Smith has shaped the way we think as a political culture today. As such, one must read this book to understand the legacy of the Enlightenment. It is hard going, as he was a very thorough worker and this is economics, the most dismal of sciences, but indispensable.There is one misconception that this reading corrected for me which I ought to share, and that concerns Smith's alleged scepticism about \\"corporations\\". For Smith, and presumably for his contemporaries, this did not, as I thought, indicate opposition to public companies and multinationals in the way we would currently understand it. Rather, he referred to, and condemned, the system of closed trades and apprenticeships by which the market for certain trades was until recently widely protected from competition. I demur from taking sides in this, but it is important to mention the misunderstanding which arises out of the word \\"corporation\\", incautiously read."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"The Wealth of Nations ranks among the best of the unread classics.

The multitude of examples and depth of discussion could stop a Mack truck, but the lessons are critical. It teaches you about the true nature of money; where it comes from, what it means. That, in turn, as you reflect on your own life, will illustrate much about how you prioritize your own life.Along with Ayn Rand's \\"Atlas Shrugged,\\" this book will indisputably change your perception of the nature of money and a how person chooses to earn their living.The only drawback to the book is that it is brutally boring--but get a large cup of Java, sit back, and dig in.

And slavery like it or not is a part of economics. It's a way to get labor for very cheap (like food, water and shelter only). On page 744 he does however call it the unfortunate law of slavery. Slavery is abhorrent and prevents the whole from reaching their great potential for the benefit of a few (the wealthy who have slaves and the consumers who get products much cheaper because of it).On page 110-111 This really stands out \\"No Society can surely be flourishing and happy of which the far greater part of the members are poor and miserable\\"Adam Smith does however place too much emphasis on Corn being the commodity that everything is measured against. It's just as easy to switch to a different food source like Rice for instance. That if enough people switched to would cause the price of corn to drop or stop being planted.On page 986 He says there is no public institution for the education of women and he talks about not educating the women like the men. He says they are taught only what their parents or guardian judge it necessary or useful for them to learn and nothing else. This clealy isn't good either but I know he was just stating a fact of life at the time.I cry BRAVO!!! for Adam Smith's take on Religion. He got the true religion right! On page 998 it says \\"because in every religion except the true it is highly pernicious and it has a natural tendency to pervert the true, by infusing into it a strong mixture of superstition, folly and delusion. Each ghostly practitioner in order to render himself more precious and sacred in the eyes of his retainers will inspire them with the most violent abhorrences of all other sects. No regard will be paid to Truth, Morals or Decency.\\" The true religion extols Truth, Morals and Decency as Jesus taught us to keep the commandments. This is the whole duty of man. To speak the truth and walk uprightly. To not steal, Not Lie, Not commit adultery, etc. But today's organized religions are more interested in building bigger buildings to get more money collected for the most part than to do good works.On page 1067 Adam Smith says \\"the ground rents of uninhabited houses ought to pay no tax\\". I wholeheartedly disagree with thisstatement. This would allow the very wealthy to own so much land that the poorer people could never own their own piece of property. That's what property taxes are for to prevent this from happening. If the poor abandon all these houses that the very wealthy own then eventually the very wealthy will be unable to pay property tax and the government will take control of their property and put it back into circulation providing their workers places to live. That's why the proper way is the way the government of the the U.S. (or maybe Idaho) has implemented it. You get a tax break for your primary residence for your place to live but none from additional properties. Not to mention another country with a lot of cash could buy up all the property in your country and control too much without doing the labor needed to keep a country functioning properly.But overall it's a very good book.Sincerely,Jon Beckmon"},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Adam Smith's \\"The Wealth of Nations\\" is truly one of the most influential books in world history. Published in 1776, it discussed many of the economic ideas of the thought system we refer to today as classical or nineteenth-century liberalism.First and foremost, it enumerated the capitalist doctrines that led to the awesome increase in living standards over the past two centuries--doctrines such as free trade, the importance of economic growth for a society, and the idea that the entire society benefits when the individual is encouraged to pursue his economic self-interest.Smith also examined the topics of paper money and commodity standards and provided examples from the past of when currencies were debased during hard times. Perhaps the most sobering part of the book from the point of view of today is the section that discussed how governments, when they have spent far too much and can no longer service their debt, must either repudiate the debt or incinerate it via severe inflation--we can only hope that the gross overspending in recent years on the part of both parties in Washington will not bring us to that point in the coming years.Some of the other topics on which Smith held forth include apprenticeships, colonies, agriculture, defense, taxes, the differences between public and private sector employment, and fascinating comparisons of wage rates between England and the then-colonies and between parts of Britain.The book is very readable despite the fact it was written in eighteenth-century English, and is definitely worth tackling if you have a serious interest in economics."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"The works of Adam Smith are an essential part of universal culture, especially for economics.

He explained that all work had to behighly organized in order to be productive. In addition, herecognized that machinery facilitated work. This notion servesas an important foundation for more modern patent practice.He praised the ingenuity of inventors and makers of newmachinery. The author spoke of increased production as acondition precedent to enhancing the power of labor. From thisprecept, he explained that the size of a market would dictatethe division of its constituent labor. For instance, a smallcommunity in the suburbs might be serviced by a local&quot;General Store&quot;; whereas, a county in a large city would beserviced by a retail chain store with hundreds of employeesand a highly sophisticated management structure.In Adam Smith'stime, metals were popular in the manufacture of commodities.Problems were encountered in weighing the metals and arrivingat a uniform system of metrics. The theory of pricing wasa function of the toil needed to purchase a good. For instance,the price of an auto was a function of the many hours of labornecessary to earn the money to buy the car. In addition, the price of an item was related to its constituent parts.For instance, the price of linen was a function of the laborof the flaxdresser, spinner, weaver, bleacher and overallemployer. The natural price varied with the price of componentparts. For instance, if the semiconductor was reduced significantly in price- then the overall price of an electronicappliance would go down. Adam Smith saw labour as a functionof national wealth. He recognized that laborers had to earnmore than a mere subsistence in order to live dignified lives.He told a story of a mother in the Highlands of Scotland whohad to raise 20 children so that 2 would survive. Presumably,18 children would die from various diseases and poverty.The interest rates at the time were low. In England, rateshovered at 5%. In France, the rates were 3-5% . The governmentcould borrow at 2% in Holland.Adam Smith defined a wage as a function of the following:o the ease or hardship to do workConsider the case of a diamond cutter. The art of cutting adiamond is a precise process which requires extensive trainingand expert worksmanship. The demand for precious stones was afunction of their inherent beauty, scarcity and workmanshipinvolved in polishing them and preparing them for commercial use.o the difficulty and expense of learning a tradeA skilled surgeon required years of medical training and along apprenticeship in anatomy and surgery.o the constancy of employmento the trust reposed in the workpeopleConsider the case of a landowner who took a year-long vacationto the Orient. He/she would leave behind a manager to run theentire business on a 24/7 basis. This high degree of trustreposed in the workperson required a commensurate compensation.o probability of success or failure of the ventureConsider the effort required to cross the Atlantic. The tripwas lengthy, dangerous and prone to failure due to the vagariesof nature, pirating on the high seas and disease. Naturally,a worker had to receive a greater compensation to take thesefactors into consideration.o the danger inherent in doing the workConsider the danger inherent in entering a diamond mine.The possibility of collapse was a constant threat. Accordingly,workers were compensated commensurate with the threat level.Adam Smith explained that fear of misfortune dampened the takingof risks. He knew (intuitively) that investors were risk averse.In addition, there was a restriction on training new labor.In Sheffield, no master cutter could train more than a singlecutter . Apprenticeships were lengthy. i.e. 7 years in lengthAdam Smith explained that food was a source of rent to thelandowners. The pricing of metals was a function of the pricein the most fertile mine in the world. Whatever increased thefertility of the land increased its value by implication.Markets in foodstuffs were restricted because refrigerationdid not exist until motors and condensers were perfected.Essentially, there were no operable refrigerators until thefamous Clausius statement was perfected in the engineeringsciences.Accordingly, the market for butcher's meat was confined to thecountry of origin. Wool and raw hide could be transported;however, meat was consumed locally as its shelf-life was limited.The value of money was a function of the value of annual produce.Accordingly, increased quantities of commodities raised thevalue of money. Low fixed rates of interest promoted businessand discouraged usury. Riches were a function of the annualproduce which created the wealth and supported the tax base.High duties were enforced to protect the local markets. Treatiesbetween countries helped local merchants to craft meaningfultrade sequences. Exports were encouraged . The expense oferecting public works was a function of the taxes raised on theland and the proportion of yield from the crops.Governments granted bounties to merchants who wanted to selloverseas in order to assist them in making a profit anddefraying costs/risks.

That tradition later found expression in Adam Smith's \\"Wealth of Nations\\" in which is posited a \\"rational self-interest\\" operating as an \\"invisible hand\\" upon \\"free markets\\". Recent accounting crimes and corporate scandals, however, amount to enormous empirical evidence that \\"laissez faire\\" capitalism is a myth and the \\"invisible hand\\" is mere \\"wishful thinking\\".It is obvious that there is no \\"invisible hand\\" which militates against crooks, charlatans, and fast buck artists now seen to have firmly ensconced themselves as much in the board rooms as among sleazy fly-by-nighters.Markets left to their own devices trend toward oligopoly in which oligarchs effect political plutocracy through the exercise of sheer political muscle, intimidation, fraud, and outright bribery.If there is an \\"invisible hand\\", it has never moderated the rich and powerful. If a ruling cabal is to be moderated it must be done by political action.This is less a criticism of Smith himself than of modern economic conservatives and/or 'supply-siders' who find in Smith --ex post facto --a rationalization for rapacious and monopolistic behavior. Smith is no more to be faulted for this than Darwin should be faulted for the excesses of \\"Social Darwinism\\" --neither Social nor Darwin. \\"Social Darwinists\\" are most often associated with the age of the Robber Barons, providing them an ideological bias that justifies all manner of corporate crookedness and sleazy practices.To his credit, Smith himself feared the rise of monopoly power --a fear which modern conservative commentary either does not understand or omits entirely.The picture is complicated, however by Immanuel Kant who assailed the pursuit of self interest in favor of \\"good in and of itself\\" --a \\"categorical imperative\\". It is a moral standard that no one, of course, can live up to. Nevertheless, Kant became the other great influence upon American conservative thought --though I cannot give most contemporary conservatives credit for having actually read Kant or, for that matter, understanding him.Yet --Kant may be found lurking beneath the ideological surface of the extreme right-wing and the religious right which seeks to impose upon us a \\"transcendental\\" reality and morality whether we like it or not.It is unfortunate that Kant himself defined this \\"transcendent reality\\" --which he calls the noumena --as being unknowable. If follows, by definition, that one cannot make meaningful statements about it, but that has not kept righteous ideologues from deducing from this \\"unknowable\\" value judgments and imposing those values judgments on others. By definition, nothing meaningful can be said about whatever is \\"unknowable\\"!We are given a choice of two mutually exclusive alternatives: \\"selfishness\\" or \\"selfless transcendentalism\\". Neither position, however, is entirely true and neither is completely understood even by the conservative mentality that espouses them. Adam Smith's \\"invisible hand\\" is no more valid than Laffer's \\"trickle down\\" theory and it is highly doubtful that even Kant lived up to his own moral dictum --though I credit Kant with sincerity but doubt it among his followers. I rather think that \\"mankind\\" is neither entirely selfish or entirely selfless.The truth is most likely found in the middle. The work of mathematician John Nash, celebrated of late in the motion picture \\"A Beautiful Mind\\", wrote a brilliant paper on \\"binding agreements\\" that casts grave doubts upon many \\"conservative\\" fables, shibboleths, and fairy tales --including those whose origins lie in \\"mutually exclusive\\" intellectual traditions.

Brian Oley"},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"This book has two massive and core problems, each one of them large enough to make this book incredibly, even dangerously, misleading.The first problem of Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations is not to be found in identifying all those familiar, and illogical anomalies that have been proven through experience false, and are well known (the \\"invisible hand\\" and others); nor the fact that Smith completely hides the history of his own country (how after the English civil war the English pursued an incredibly protectionist series of policies); but that all these complaints can be seen as stemming from one underlying problem in Smith's analysis: which was almost exclusively that of a micro-economist. This is highly contrary to how this book is interpreted, yet, if understood, explains many of Wealth of Nation's failings.The second major failing of this book is that through its clever wording and euphemisms it completely changed the language of economics. No longer would the British come out in direct language of their intentions in the House of Lords of the hostility and economic warfare that they were perpetually waging (and continue to wage to this day, albeit in a much different form) in open, brutal and naked language; they would do it through euphemistic and sophistical language. When we observe other methods of modern economic imperialism, the IMF for example, we see that the tools of the language that Smith pioneered have been perfected to a science - just Google the latest IMF policy papers or interviews to see what I'm talking about.To illustrate this fact in summation, rather than in a case-by-case, chapter-by-chapter disassembly that nobody would read nor would fit in this format, I'll turn to Friedrich List who illustrated these problems of Smith's \\"Wealth of Nations\\" brilliantly in his 1841 book \\"The National System of Political Economy\\". For the sake of brevity, I'll only include List shining a light to the later of these two problems, that is, the total obfuscation of the language of economics post-Wealth of Nations.\\"...The ministers of George I in 1721 openly declared, on the occasion of the prohibition of the importation of the manufactures of India, that it was clear that a nation could only become wealthy and powerful if she imported raw materials and exported manufactured goods. Even in the times of Lords Chatham and North, they did not hesitate to declare in open Parliament that it ought not to be permitted that even a single horse-shoe nail should be manufactured in North America. In Adam's Smith's time, a new maxim was for the first time added to those which we have above stated, namely, to conceal the true policy of England under the cosmopolitical expressions and arguments which Adam Smith had discovered, in order to induce foreign nations to imitate that policy.It is very common clever device that when anyone has attained the summit of greatness, he kicks away the ladder by which he has climbed up, in order to deprive others of the means of climbing up after him. In this lies the secret of the cosmopolitical doctrine of Adam Smith, and of the cosmopolitical doctrine of Adam Smith, and of the cosmopolitical tendencies of his great contemporary William Pitt, and of all his successors in the British Government administrations.Any nation which by means of protective duties and restrictions on navigation has raised her manufacturing power and her navigation to such a degree of development that no other nation can sustain free competition with her, can do nothing wiser that throw away these ladders of her greatness, to preach to other nations the benefits of free trade, and to declare in penitent tones that she has hitherto wandered in the paths of error, and has now for the first time succeeded in discovering the truth.William Pitt was the first English statesmen who clearly perceived in what way the cosmopolitcal theory of Adam Smith could be properly made use of, and not in vain did he himself carry about a copy of the work on the Wealth of Nations. His speech in 1786, which was addressed neither to Parliament nor to the nation, but clearly to the ears of the statesmen of France, who were destitute of all experience and favour of the Eden Treaty, is an excellent specimen of Smith's style of reasoning. By nature he said France was adapted for agriculture and the production of wine, as England was thus adapted to manufacturing production. These nations ought to act towards one another just as two great merchants would do who carry on different branches of trade and who reciprocally enrich one another by the exchange of goods. Not a word here of the old maxim of England, that a nation can only attain to the highest degree of wealth and power in her foreign trade by the exchange of manufactured products against agricultural products and raw materials. This maxim was then, and has remained since, and English State secret; it was never again openly professed, but was all the more persistently followed.\\"-Friedrich List, 1841 Political EconomyWe can all agree that certain areas are more suitable to certain types of farming, but what does it mean that \\"England was thus adapted to manufacturing production\\"? As if, while grapes to make wine sprung from the earth in France, fully formed factories were springing from the earth in England and that each nation should therefore simply take what was provided to them. This sheer nonsense was later refined and perfected by such degenerates as J.B. Say and, of course, David Ricardo.As a book that professes to explain macro-economics \\"Wealth of Nations\\" is a catastrophic failure. And this explains a lot of why the modern schools of economics that build their edifice upon this \\"foundation\\" are so worthless at creating prosperity, progress, predicting anything of any merit, etc. This book originated, insofar as I am aware, the idea of looking at The Market and The State as a dichotomy rather than as using an observational and scientific approach, which concludes that looking at Macro-economics with anything other than the role of modern Nation-State at its primary focus is pure folly. Friedrich List defines Smith's work brilliantly when identifies \\"Wealth of Nations\\" as the \\"economics of a shop-keeper\\" - that is, a focus on the exchange of value rather than the creation of value. What a different world we would live in if List was widely read and understood; for List's work is infinitely more adept at explaining how productive forces come into being and how macro-economies function than Smith. Adam Smith's work, the State is giving the far back-seat in favor of The Market that Smith mythologized and the legendary Individual (Man, as such) that Smith makes so popular. There are many books that dispel this nonsensical view from simply observing the historical record, read \\"Debt\\" by David Graeber or Friedrich List's \\"Political Economy\\" (I recommend both, but the latter book much more so). If you accept the major tenants of this book as they have been popularized then you will be yet another anti-historical fool, but don't worry, you'll have plenty of company.However, for many things, Smith's micro-approach is very good and yields usable information and therefore shouldn't be completely disregarded. But drawing the line of what is useful and what is fantasy in this book is no easy task for those that don't read an incredible amount of economics books or who's minds haven't already been turned to mush from an \\"education\\" (indoctrination) in modern economics. It is this very reason that I, reluctantly in spite of this books merits, give it 1 star.If you are going to read this book then you should read the other side of the argument and give it fair consideration. The \\"other side\\" (that is, the objective, factually based one that is derived from historical observation) from what Smith professes can be found with the following authors: Daniel Raymond, John Barnard Byle, Willard Phillips, Friedrich List, Webster G. Tarpley, Ha-Joon Chang, Steve Keen, Michael Hudson, Herman Finer, Heikki Patomaki, John Quiggin, Les Leopold, and of course Alexander Hamilton."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"I ordered this book for my son.

He delivers Smith's sarcasm and indignation very well. Contrary to popular belief, Adam Smith was a bit of a radical. He adamantly reiterates that of the workers, the landowners, and the merchants (read business people), the latter are the only group who should not lead a nation because their priorites will always lead it into ruin. Based upon his theory, which is still valid, the only reason the United States' economic system has not tanked is the petrodollar.As the book progresses his radicalism becomes increasingly apparent as he expresses his low opinion of the efforts to block free trade and posh schools like Oxford University, as well as his list of alternatives of what should be done with the new American colonies. He even declares that the missionary campaigns by the Catholic church during colonialism were only a pretense to get more gold--and this was in 1776!There are also miscellaneous digressions on the history of liberal education, banking, currencies, and organized western religion.

Adam Smith did not found economics, and The Wealth of Nations is not a must-read. It is not the first or best case for economic liberalism, or even the best case of its time.While Adam Smith's work was a much-needed rebuke to mercantilism, it was in many ways a step back from what had already been written on economics by the School of Salamanca in the 16th Century,Richard Cantillonin 1730, andAnne Robert Jacques Turgotin 1766. It was even a step back from his own previous work, including theLectures on JurisprudenceandThe Theory of Moral Sentiments. Smith's analysis contains many serious errors that would lay the foundation for Marxism, notably his crude labour theory of value (as opposed to marginal utility), his exaggeration of the importance of the division of labour (putting in the shade such critical factors as capital accumulation and the growth of technological knowledge), his identification of some innate \\"propensity to truck, barter and exchange\\" as the cause of the division of labour (rather than differences in ability), and his adoption of the dubious Physiocratic concept of \\"unproductive labour.\\"An economist won't benefit from reading Adam Smith any more than a physicist would benefit from reading Aristotle.

When I have studied economy in the University, I was taught that almost the entire book is devoted to the \\"invisible hand\\" which means \\"self-corrective markets\\", \\"liberalism\\", \\"Laissez-faire\\" and \\"state non-intervention\\". After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith did use the term \\"invisible hand\\" only once in the entire book, in the discussion of domestic versus foreign trade.To illustrate the point, let me quote the text where term \\"invisible hand\\" is used: \\"First, every individual endeavours to employ his capital as near home as he can, and consequently as much as he can in the support of domestic industry, provided always that he can thereby obtain the ordinary, or not a great deal less than the ordinary profits of stock. Thus, upon equal, or nearly equal profits, every wholesale merchant naturally prefers the home trade to the foreign trade of consumption, and the foreign trade of consumption to the carrying trade. In the home trade, his capital is never so long out of his sight as it frequently is in the foreign trade of consumption. [...]Secondly, every individual who employs his capital in the support of domestic industry, necessarily endeavours so to direct that industry, that its produce may be of the greatest possible value. [...]As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can, both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce maybe of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain; and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it.\\"After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith was influenced by French Physiocrats. The Physiocrats saw the true wealth of a nation as determined by the surplus of agricultural production over and above that needed to support agriculture (by feeding farm labourers and so forth). Other forms of economic activity, such as manufacturing, were viewed as taking this surplus agricultural production and transforming it into new products, by using the surplus agricultural production to feed the workers who produced the extra goods. While these manufacturers and other non agricultural workers may be useful, they were seen as 'sterile' in that their income derives ultimately not from their own work, but from the surplus production of the agricultural sector.I have found out that this book is not about \\"invisible hand\\" or \\"Laissez-faire\\". It is quite a complete study that covers almost every basic aspect of the economy, and remains an effective introduction to economics to this day. Just don't start reading economic books from this book. It would be hard to understand. It assumes that you already have economics background, i.e. have studied economics for a few years.This book is so often mischaracterized and politicized that I suggest you to read it completely by yourself.

Less than a century later, Karl Marx was able to demonstrate, in his book, THE POVERTY OF PHILOSOPHY, how vacuous the ideas of good and bad, as they are usually applied in political economy, turn out to be in practice. Americans have largely accepted the notion of a consumer society totally dependent on copyright and trade laws to protect the value of the entertainment and related therapeutic products which it produces. What might be most upsetting to readers of this book, that someone like myself could use it to reflect on the events of 9/11/2001 as a challenge to such modern assumptions, as if the policing powers which maintain the world financial situation of today have more to fear from an examination of how this book treats consumption than from the usual lessons based on the growth of wealth, might make this an unacceptable view of what this book actually says.When this book was written, Adam Smith was able to combine economic ideas about the distribution and production (which he considered the highest good) of articles of commerce, in contrast to \\"the bad effects of the monopoly,\\" in a way that caused thinking people in Britain to believe that the world would be materially better off if the American colonies were free of rules which required those who produced all the tobacco from Maryland and Virginia to sell it in or through Great Britain. Adam Smith was worried that capital maintained to store this product in London was depriving England of the opportunity to produce goods that would generate more wealth. \\"At the port of London, indeed, it is commonly sold for ready money. The rule is, Weigh and pay. At the port of London, therefore, the final returns of the whole round-about trade are more distant than the returns from America by the time only that goods may lie unsold in the warehouse; where, however, they may sometimes lie long enough.\\" The American revolution was greeted by economic free traders as an event likely to cause a great increase in the wealth of nations, and the normally victorious political element maintains a strong belief in this fiscal ideology.The current situation might be closer to \\"the time only which the goods may lie unsold in the warehouse.\\" Near the end of Book IV, \\"Of Systems of Political Economy,\\" Chapter VII, \\"Of Colonies,\\" there was a frightening example of how bad things might get to be. \\"In Spain and Portugal the bad effects of the monopoly, aggravated by other causes, have perhaps nearly overbalanced the natural good effects of the colony trade.\\" Plenty of things went wrong, causing a large portion of the population to feel that they were victims of circumstances, \\" . . . but above all, that irregular and partial administration of justice, which often protects the rich and powerful debtor from the pursuit of his injured creditor, and which makes the industrious part of the nation afraid to prepare goods for consumption of those haughty and great men to whom they dare not refuse to sell upon credit, and from whom they are altogether uncertain of repayment.\\" Certainly, a great deal of money is in circulation today, and a tremendous amount is considered working capital, capable of producing many things that people might want, but the routine search for contraband includes cash in an amount exceeding $10,000, the amount which might be capable of buying a large amount of illegal substances. Police are actually so unfamiliar with cash transactions that large amounts might be held as evidence, until the police have been convinced that they have no reason to suspect the person who had the money of being involved in any sort of laundering activity. When Adam Smith was writing, his work was as shocking to those controlling the monopolies of his day as radical protests of today rile the police on the beat today, whose confiscation of vehicles, which are sometimes temporary, to see if they were used to transport illegal substances, is not considered in any way similar to hijacking airplanes in order to crash them into buildings which symbolize a violation of the right of the people to personal pleasure in a manner which averts the collapse of society as we know it.

As a result demand and supply is created for such labour.He makes the natural assumption that each individual pursues their best interests.He foreshadows the concepts of marginal utility and scarcity in determining the shapes of demand curves for commodities. ( He never actually mentions curves ).Similarly, he describes the three factors determining supply prices for commodities ( rent of land, wages and capital costs ) and the various factors which influence them ( the equivalent of modern supply/demand curves for each factor ).He puts these together under ideal circumstances to show how supply and demand meet to clear markets ( equilibrium in modern language ).He then turns to macroeconomics laying the foundations for GDP and shows how capital can be distributed to \\"unproductive labour\\" ( that labour used to maintain productive labour ) such as doctors lawyer entertainers etc and \\"productive labour\\" ( that labour used in the manufacture and distribution of raw and finished products ). He explores the consequences of various distribution of each from both the micro and macroeconomic perspective.He concludes by emphasizing the importance of government in providing international and domestic security as well as providing public works and institutions especially education.Naturally this requires state revenue and he devotes almost one entire \\"book\\" to taxes.He delves briefly into political economy especially merchantilism and it's detrimental effects to society at large.A great introduction to modern economics that is often missed in didactic lectures. This book gives the motivation for many modern economic concepts that is often lost in mathematical formalism."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations brilliantly analyzes how a nation's living standards can be raised. In large part his wisdom still applies today. To briefly summarize Smith's thinking:1. Standards of living are determined by the productivity of workers.2. Productivity of workers is greatly enhanced by specialization (see the famous example of the pin factory in the first chapter!).3. Greater specialization is possible only if the market size grows. Thus, government laws that prohibit growth of the market hurt specialization, and thereby keep living standards from rising. This is why Smith opposed laws that restricted trade or created monopolies. Smith actively worked to keep Britain from going to war against its American colonies over trade issues. The Wealth of Nations is a political tract designed to sway the British parliament (obviously it failed in that regard).4. Productivity of workers is enhanced by raising their wages.5. Productivity of workers is enhanced by publicly funded education.6. The role of markets is exquisitely analyzed by Smith. Self-interest leads people to carry out private activities that lead to social betterment, as if by an &quot;invisible hand.&quot;7. It is a serious misinterpretation of Smith to assert that greed or selfishness is the same as self-interest. Smith labored hard to avoid any such confusion. Please see his other book which addresses this specific issue: The Theory of Moral Sentiments.8. Clearly Smith favored limited government. But Smith was NOT a strict advocate of laissez-faire. He ended his illustrious career as commissioner of customs, a job he took seriously, and which he would not have taken had he not thought this level of intervention in the economy warranted.Read the first three chapters of WN: they contain the essence of the arguments above. Then look in the index to find reference to the &quot;invisible hand&quot; &quot;monopoly&quot; &quot;colonies&quot; and other subjects of interest.Buy the GLASGOW EDITION of the Wealth of Nations. This is the most up-to-date annotated version. It is available (very cheaply) from the Liberty Fund Press in America. If you only want one copy, that is the only one to buy today."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Just as some editions of The Wealth of Nations shouldbe avoided because of undisclosed abridgement (seereviewers below), other editions ought to be sought outand preferred.Look for versions involving Edwin Cannan as editor.These include the University of Chicago edition (1976) inpaperback and the Modern Library edition (1994) inhardcover. (To my knowledge, neither of these editionsis abridged.) In 1904, Cannan, a professor at theLondon School of Economics, did two things that greatlyadd to the value of Smith's book.First, Cannan prepared a detailed index. For example,\\"invisible hand\\" appears in it. Just try to find theone (and only one) appearance of that phrase withoutan index. Most of the non-Cannan editions I've lookedat lack an index.Second, Cannan wrote and added brief marginalia. Hiswords facilitate skimming, something most readers ofthis thousand page book are apt to do. His words andphrases are also easily ignored. They don't get in yourway once you've found the pages you want to read.(Reviewer T. Grimes comments on the marginalia aswell.)Finally, reading The Wealth of Nations shows Smith tobe different from his usual portrayal. He can bewickedly satirical. Anyone who has been to college willrecognize much that is familiar in his thoughts (inBook V) on \\"Education of Youth\\". And he also franklyaddresses the downsides of capitalism. The book beginswith the division of labor as a powerful means ofadding productivity. But later (pp. 839-41 in my ModernLibrary edition), he recognizes the destructive effectsof division of labor and, in response, recommendsgovernment investment in public education.

Great book, it's just a shame it came out like this."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"This book is a modeling exercise about the components of a nation's wealth, whereby: Wealth of Nations = Land + Labour + Stock (ie Capital accumulated). This model serves as the foundation of the arguments in the entire book; and an excellent guide to analyze our modern market economies. Smith touches on various topics, ranging from market economics, history of colony establishments, state of opulence (briefly describing China in the 18th century), and of human nature and behavior in general.Much of Adam Smith's ideas have been distorted by subsequent scholars, some of whom contorted his ideas to suit their own purposes, while others might have simply misunderstood. For example, in coining the word 'the Invisible Hand', Smith recommended free market competition as the foundation for progressive opulance. However, his implicit assumption was that people seeking their own benefits also embraced compassion and sympathy in their moral values. This 'moral value' part is often missing in contemporary economic analysis. As such, to gain an understanding of his complete doctrine, you should read this economics book together with his other book \\"The Theory of Moral Sentiments\\", which explores definitions of moral values and virtues.Another issue worth mentioning is that lots of people thought that Capitalism was derived from Adam Smith's doctrine, and the current market economies in the USA is a descendent of this ideology. However, if we used his definitions and analysis to compare the current USA market system, you will find that parts of the US system seemed to match closer to the Merchantile System that Smith lambasted as inefficient and short-sighted.A lot has been said about Smith's keen observations and eloquent quotes, however, most failed to mention his uncanny sense of humor. For example, in discussing about labor compensation, Smith remarked that \\"The public admiration which attends upon such distinguished abilities, makes always a part of their rewards; a greater or smaller in proportion as it is higher or lower in degree. It makes a considerable part of that reward in the profession of physics; a still greater perhaps in that of law; in poetry and philosophy it makes almost the whole.\\"; when taken into contexts that Smith is a Scholar in Philosophy, and hence should expect \`public admiration' as his total compensation package, this sentence is almost hilarious.This book is an insightful read, albeit one that requires much pondering. It took Adam Smith ten years to complete the first edition of Wealth of Nations, hence I would strongly recommend taking a slow pace in this exploration of his wisdom.You might ask whether there is an easier way to read this book, perhaps through some summary others wrote.My opinion is really not to do that, because the gist of this book is on the thinking process and good learning does not come easy. Spend the time to reflect on his reasonings and you will gain significantly from his wisdom. Not to forget that you should get a copy of his other book \\"The Theory of Moral Sentiments\\" to fully appreciate the Wealth of Nations."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"I didn't read this exact edition, and I did read an abridged version. I'd also like to add that I'm not a student of economics. That said, I'd now like to unreservedly recommend this book to anyone who wants to get a handle on economics. I thought going back two hundred years might be a dicey move, but Mr. Smith's voice remains perfectly lucid, compelling, and marvelously informative. I cannot praise this book highly enough."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"The Wealth of Nations is an overview of economics by the Scottish philosopher Adam Smith around the time of the American Revolution. At the time of the writing, the popular ideology of economics was mercantilism - that is, countries should export as much products and import as much gold as possible. Hence, the somewhat strange title of the book. (The fact that \\"capitalism\\" and \\"economics\\" were not common phrases at the times doesn't help either)Much of what the book says confirms what any Economics 101 course would tell you - when you try to modify a free market, there are ripple effects. Take mercantilism again, as an example. Countries at the time tried to have \\"positive balances of trade\\", through methods such as prohibiting the exportation of gold, and encouraging exportation of everything else. This supposedly makes a country richer. In reality, all it does is make gold worth *less* in that country, because there are less products to buy per unit of gold available. This also leads to smuggling, where gold is sold to other countries where it is worth more.Smith understands that some government and taxation is necessary - there are some services that the free market cannot effectively provide. Conservatives seem to over-emphasize the famous \\"invisible hand of the free market\\" endorsed by Smith, while ignoring the fact that he endorses the idea of taxing the rich at a higher rate than the poor. (Source: page 1065 of the Bantam paperback edition)What would Smith think about the 21st century? I think he would be disappointed in our politics, both Democrat and Republican. Both Bush and Obama have overseen increases in the size of the federal government. Smith would likely be a conservative, but not a Republican or a \\"Tea Party\\" protester. He probably would've voted for Ron Paul in the 2008 primaries and Bob Barr in the general elections, despite flaws in both candidates. He would be against the War on Drugs, the bailouts, and probably the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. He would be just as worried about corporate monopolies as he would government monopolies. I'm not so sure what he would think about healthcare - there are definitely problems with American healthcare, but don't think he'd want a public option or insurance mandate as a reform.Adam Smith is a very clear writer. Despite the book's length, it's not a boring read. I only skipped about 100 pages, mostly numerical data and obsolete information. Definitely worth a read."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"The Wealth of Nations handles a lot of economical phenomena in a concrete but sometimes complex way. On one hand the book is filled with ideas, some convincing, some out-dated, some fundamental to the current believe in free-markets. These ideas are combined with appealing (or appalling) examples of the injustice done to people by disturbing the free-market. On the other hand however, I find that certain sections of the book require a lot of concentration. The book is an interesting, but slow and at times difficult, read.Essentially, it is a treatise on the power of individuals to maximise their own wealth and therefor a support for the natural liberty of men and an argument for free-markets. Not as a perfect system in which there will be no misery, but as a system that gives individuals the greatest (and most just) opportunity to gain happiness and which will be the quickest to respond to changes in supply and demand (and therefor decrease the misery which is created when governments ignore gaps between supply and demand).It is not a book that believes in the pure goodness of companies (but explicitly states that companies have a interest which is directly opposite to that of society as a whole. I.e. the interest of companies is to create a supply shortage so they can ask prices above costprice), but says that the best way to break the power of these companies is the allow free competition. It also reveals that political decisions that at fist glance seems compassionate, might in fact be inhumane, cruel and the cause of much suffering (because on the long run they lead to a supply shortage). The examples given here, are still relevant to view the decisions made by politicians in today's so-called free market countries.Comment on review of Micheal Brady, june 13 2005:Brady remarks that Smith was the first opponent of globalization. The (strange) evidence he gives to support this statement is that Smith supports the use of counter tariffs, if (and only if) this might lead to the removal of the initial tariff. This statement clearly shows that Smith was against protectionist measures like tariffs and only condoned them if in the short run they would lead to less protectionism and therefor more globalization! Brady also supports his statement by mentioning that Smith opposed any offshoring if the purpose of such offshoring was to supply the home market. The keyword here again being \\"if\\". Smith was against a nation stimulating offshoring because he saw no national gain. This however doesn't mean that governments should restrict labor/capital mobility, because this would go against the natural liberty of men."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"The Wealth of Nations (An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of The Wealth of Nations) by Adam Smith.

Their topics are present in the political agenda of our governments right today, and after all other reviewers have written, better than I would do so, i should add four key points:- With no proper political institutions there is no possibility of creating wealth (it reminds me sad examples from today...Argentina?). Smith thinks it is very important having economic liberties, besides independent magistrates, and a national state committed to enforce the contracts privates sign up to make transactions when some party doesn't want to comply them.- Under the right framework of political institutions is posible to have private interests and public interest converging on the same \\"bargain zone\\". Under Smith's point of view is the mercantilism, as a policy of state, policy that picks up the winners since the desk of politicians instead of from the shops of every-day industry and parsimony of workers and entrepreuners what creates the conflict (even though he makes some exceptions, like the Navigation Act, but he regards the need of this monopoly of english navy by national security reasons only).- After the short-run adjustments, the income distribution matters, that are so important for politicians, should be resolved by the market and the entrepreuners whom, by searching opportunities to make more profits, will make converging the prices of land, labour and goods.- The accumulation of capital is the process that lowers interest rates, expands the supply of loans and suports higher degrees of division of labour in the economy. This process should let people have cheaper goods along the time and improve the wages of workers. The tax system should not stop this process, by \\"punishing\\" profits and the letting the remaining sources of rent free (wages, and rent of land).Under Smith's point of view scarcity and poverty are historical and social problems, and their solutions are in history and in social interaction too.There are not worlds beyond every-day reality, as socialists made us to believe some time ago...just trade and division of labour and accumulation of capital, and so on. Let history and people surprise us. They will make the wealth, not the governments. The Smith system is open to history and change, and learnship, and only requires good foundations to secure an historical outcome of wealth.The world of today has institutions that were not in XVIIIth century: global financial institutions and spread trade agreements, that create barriers at some places and open gates at anothers. And now we have new constraints (the environment,..) and new key players (global corporations, ..). But this new scene only makes smaller the room of economic policy choices for latin american governments. At the core of the room which is remaining for them, the Smith's suggestions still have urgent and actual importance.Sad thing to recognize that in XXIst century latin america, we need to read a great book from XVIIIst century to find out solutions."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Adam Smith's WONs should be required reading / course work in high school.Long winded, yes, but also relevant.

As pointed out by Ronald Coase,we don't see any further insight on the understanding of economic system over these 200 years. We could only see every newspaper and magazines are talking on how to stimulate the consumption to boost the GDP; or government officials announce to increase government expenditure to stimulate the economy. It seems that the only question to economic growth depends on how much we spend. But if it is true, do it imply that we could be wealthy by just spend and spend and without further work?It is only after reading the first sentence of the book I remember the only truth that seems also to be forgotten by many people: it is only our labour that determine the wealth of nations, and also yourself. The book use a lot of illustrations to show how the division of labour could increase the production and it is on our self-interest to make exchange that give rise to division of labour, the theme that has mentioned by other reviewers and books.You should have read a lot of quotations from the book but you could not understand fully the central theme of the book by just few sentences.

From the very first chapter, Smith makes clear the genius of markets, the benefits of the division of labor, and how government intrusion upon &quot;perfect liberty&quot; creates economic inefficiencies. As the Industrial Revolution was in its infancy, Smith keenly perceived the theoretical framework for its future development: property rights, markets, free trade, and government non-intervention. These institutions allowed for unprecedented economic growth (there was more economic growth in the 19th century than in the preceeding 4000 years) and thus the sustainability of modern life.

You will not be disappointed!"},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"Bill Gross raised the question, \\"how does a search engine get quality searches?\\" The enemy of all search engines is \\"Spam\\" content. Bill Gross innovation was realized in his company Overture and his ability to broker traffic for advertisers. Overture attracted advertisers willing too pay for Internet traffic. Gross bought the traffic from Microsoft and Yahoo and resold it to the Advertisers. Gross initially reduced advertiser entry cost and reasoned that competition between the advertisers would drive up price. Bill Gross theory turned into a reality as his company became a multi-billion dollar corporation.The key to quality searches is attracting users and understanding what the user wants. Google has yet to fully integrate personalization in its main index. It is still much of Google character not to assume too much about he person typing the queries into the search box. Googles current focus is increasing accessibility to the search engine by increase opportunity when and where users are most likely to be inspired to conduct a search, \\"A search could happen anywhere on the web\\" (Google desktop). Amazon seems too be leading the race in the area of personalization by serving up offers relevant too the interest of its viewers.The problem with the Internet is there is too much information. Many in the industry believe search technology will be revolutionized by meta-data. Meta-Data provides information about what you choose to browse. Berners-Lee says, \\"The real power of the semantic web will be realized when people create many programs that collect web content from diverse sources, process the information and exchange the results with other programs.\\" Berners says, \\"The effectiveness of such software agents will increase exponentially as more machine readable content and automated services become available.\\" Intelligent agents work to reduce the amount of information and return more content relevant information in terms of the interest and importance context too the user. \\"If an engine of the future combines a reasoning engine with a search engine, it may be able to get the best of both worlds. It will be able to reach out to indexes which contain very complete lists of all occurrences of a given term, and then use logic to weed out all but those which can be used in solving the given problem\\".The second problem with the Internet is lack of memory. With billions of Web pages coming into existence and going out of existence the Internet has a problem with memory. Google attempts to solve a portion of the memory problem by offering Gmail, 2 gigabytes of free email storage for the duration of the Internet account. An idea for Larry Page: Provide a Google domain where users can manage their own content, upload articles, and provide the search engine to provided localized searches; furthermore, provide the search engine indexing allowing users storage of their image media and video; extent Google into the world of Bloggers content by adding advanced voice to text conversion of content and then index the content. Google needs to provide a software package that will allow the user to convert all his VHS home video to digital and then upload the media onto Google media servers. The media should have the ability to be limited to family and friends. Eventually, Google should allow all real time video feeds to be indexed and stored, so a person can search any time in their life they want to replay. If Google can search a person's genetics code, why couldn't Google search a segment in time, a specific location, or a specific person?I'm been working on a search engine. My focus is localized searches based on a Maven model of expertise. I believe eventually people will want to search out information from Mavens rather than general search queries. The localized search engine will only be able to provide content for very specialized domains of knowledge.Eventually, the search engine will be able too ask the user specific questions about the information they are search for. I have a simplistic question system on the travel site. I'm working to extend that Q&A; system to a broader range of subjects. Just as an expert asks a few questions to determine context, so will my system. The marriage of an expert system and content search engine."},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"I had dramatically underestimated the power the search engines have/will have over our lives. The book provides an acute understanding of how search is about to expand into local markets doing to the world what Walmart has. Walmart makes or breaks local economies by their presence. Search will do the same. Great story telling from a highly intelligent writer. Well researched with many insightful facts and predictitions. A must read for any marketer.Secondarily, it is interesting to read about the tremendous success story of a company born in the bubble era. VCs, deals, control freaks, CEOs as puppets. The story carries nicely throughout."},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"Well presented research on the evolution of the search industry. In addition to documenting the evolution of the search engines, the author does a fine job of discussing the implications of search on current and future online commerce. Helps understand reason for the recent corporate strategy moves by Google and other online firms... Only small drawback - you will have to put up with the extended soapboxes from the author on certain relatively trivial topics..."},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"I would imagine there are lots of folks out there who utilize search engines on a daily basis and have absolutely no idea how this amazing technology came to be. You want to know more but feel intimidated by many of the books out there that are written in technical jargon you simply are unable to understand. For those who find themselves in this predicament John Battell has written \\"The Search\\". Here is a book written in plain English that will at once catch you up on the history of search engines and give you a heads up on what to expect from this technology in the years ahead.Do you recall the first time you ever utilized a search engine? You suddenly realized that nothing would ever be the same again. Think of how this technology has evolved in the past 8 or 9 years. Then contemplate that according to John Battelle the search technology that we consider so advanced today has only reached approximately 5% of it's potential! It is really quite mind boggling! In \\"The Search\\" John Battelle discusses the development of the earliest search technologies from a handful of college campuses, most notably Stanford University. In addition, Battelle introduces us to those pioneering individuals who were most responsible for making search engines a commercially viable techology. Later on we meet the founders of both Yahoo! and Google. John Battelle compares both the technologies and the business philosophies of these search giants.As \\"The Search\\" winds down John Battelle pauses to consider some of the various legal, privacy and business implications of these highly sophisticated search engines. It seems that the technology is advancing so rapidly that we simply have not had time to fully think through all of the ramifications of having so much information at our disposal with just a few clicks. \\"The Search\\" will likely expose you to quite a bit of practical information you were never aware of. But more importantly, I think it was John Battelle's intention to make each and every reader stop and contemplate what is going on all around us. Search engines can contribute so much to this world when used in the way they were originally intended. At the same time, the potential exists for much abuse of this incredible technology. Perhaps its time you read \\"The Search\\" and considered these issues yourself. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"Battelle's is a great book with amazing, captivating storytelling. I've only read one other industry book that I tell people is a must-have if you're in the IT business or into the web lifestyle, Stephen Segaller's \\"Nerds 2.01 - A Brief History of the Internet\\".Battelle's fine work is right up there with it.The book's main focus is primarily Google, but there's also a healthy dose of the other major players in the search game, like Amazon's A9, AltaVista, AllTheWeb, Yahoo and Microsoft. So there's a holistic view of the search industry, without leaving out any of the majors.The book does, in my opinion, lack a bit of the technical explanation behind Google's processes (I'm a software developer, so I like that kind of thing). I would have enjoyed reading more about Google's data center and distributed computing philosophies and the company's adoption of open source software (there are a couple of paragraphs dedicated towards detailing the former). Google rolled their own Linux implementation, which wasn't mentioned, and have pretty much put Python on the map as a programming, which also didn't make the final cut.But not taking anything away from Battelle's work - he does a fantastic job early on of breaking down web-wide search and the components involved. The book is still spot-on in terms of the strategy, financial profile, legal issues, unique corporate culture, human resources practices, adventures with venture investors, stock performance, insider interviews , horror stories, brutal truths and a historical look at the company. The final chapter, \\"Perfect Search\\" also talks about what's on the horizon for search, maintaining the belief that in all, web search is only 5% completed.It's fine writing. Pick this one up. Kudos, John - well done."},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"Both entertaining and highly informative on the history and future of search. The back room risks and strategies employed by Alta Vista, Yahoo, Google, AOL and the others was fascinating. This book reveals how Google almost became an \\"also ran\\"...that chapter alone is a good enough reason to read this one."},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"Anyone seeking to familiarize themselves with the basics pertaining to search and the search industry should read this book. It provides solid information not only on Google but the other major players in the search engine wars.My only complaint is that the author seems to have an axe to grind with the Google co-founders. Reading the book, one strongly suspects that he wishes to be in their shoes - leading a multi-billion dollar company and the object of envy by peers. In my mind, the author tries too hard to show how smart he is, rather than focusing on the subject matter."},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"This book provides an interesting history of Internet search technology with an emphasis on Google. The book also highlights how search engines and the Internet have rapidly changed and offers insights into where search technology may be heading next. There is no doubt that Google has gone from obscurity to, in some ways, the envy of the world in a matter of a decade. But time will tell as to whether it can maintain its dominance.The author points out that search is the key to the future of technology - the ability to answer one's questions on any subject at the speed of a click in addition to anticipating and exposing searchers to products and ideas they did not even know they were looking for is clearly where we are headed. Search has leapt off our computer screen and has now invaded our cell phones and handheld devices. At the rate the industry is changing, Battelle would be wise to begin a supplemental book in a few more years to capture a behind the scenes look at the fast-changing world we now live in as well as its implications, both good and bad."},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"Interested in learning how Google went from the smallest of startups to one of the largest IPO's in history? Do you wonder how Google and companies like it will impact our future? Are you interested in finding out just how Google returns the results when you type something in the search box? If so, then The Search is for you!Written by John Brattle, an accomplished author (Wired) and well respected journalist and entrepreneur, The Search first walks the user through the rise of Google from a dorm room at Stanford to the corporate giant it is today.The book is well researched and contains information from over 300 interviews documenting the rise of the biggest and most profitable media company in the world. The interviews are some of the most interesting reads in the book making you feel like you were in the room when Battelle was conducting them.In the early chapters, the reader gets what seems to be an inside view of the rise of Google as a startup during the dot-com boom. As Google grows, Battelle starts to focus on how Yahoo and Google (and others) struggled to get the search algorithm \\"right\\" and become the leader in the \\"search\\" industry. Google was clearly the winner of this competition and went out to streamline their algorithm and business to be one of the most successful media businesses in the world.Battelle uses the last chapters to discuss the future of Google and how the technology that Google is developing today could impact our culture. Considering Google has significantly changed out culture in the short eight years it has been around, one can only imagine what the future holds!An excellent, non-technical read, The Search, is a great book for anyone interested in Google, how search engines work and/or portal developments are sure to find this book enjoyable, insightful and well worth the read![...]"},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"This is an excellent book.First, from the business stand point it describes perfectly how google beat the internet bubble and came up with a very lucrative business model.

Having been a co-founder of Wired Magazine, he was able to see in detail the growth of the industry giants at the beginning and ending up with Google. This is really a fun ride, especially interesting is the compare and contrast he does with the growth of Yahoo and Google. We also get a history lesson about the growth and change in the industry.I use both Google and Yahoo in my recruiting work. Now I have a very different perspective on what is available to me.Anyone in business will learn about search from reading this book. I think the challenge and opportunity is how we use this very rich resource to our advantage.

This book, along with Tom Friedman's \\"The World is Flat,\\" are two recent books to tell your teenagers and college students to \\"chew and digest,\\" to quote Francis Bacon, because these books define the future now, and, if they want to borrow the car, \\"read 'em.\\""},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"This book really gets what the new technological trends for the future are going to be. The idea of search is very clearly explained and it gives a good overview of how the internet developed and why. The author writes very well and brings in some of the excellent stories along the way. The idea that the internet can permeate our culture is already underway and Battile gains creditability with some of his predictions. Most notably the UTube acquisition which was not underway at the time he wrote this book.

It talks about the growing information glut & our own lifestyles & the consequent increase in the need for faster and more effective search tools to get us what we need. The book deals with the ubiquitous presence of the internet and the nature of information stored & the methods of storage, which adds to the theme of search. In traversing this path, the book takes delightful detours into the trajectories of companies - some known, some unknown - that waded through the murky waters of search in finding themselves. It's no surprise that Google tends to dominate most conversations on search, but what I really liked about the book is that it is primarily about search & Google is thus the oft-quoted example.Having said that, the issues and questions that surround search have been excellently elaborated. John Battelle is clearly a well informed writer with a flair for putting complex ideas down in simple statements. His own sense of vision on the future is quite compelling & makes the reader sit back and think more than once. I've since then subscribed to John Battelle's blog and continue to find his thinking refreshing and out of the box. Clearly, once you're done with this book, you're going to think every time you hit Google on your browser and enter your keywords! Quite a brilliant book indeed!"},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"This book was a great story about how the world is being transformed by the likes of Google. It delves into the details of the players who imagined the different business models that lead to Google and the re-birth of the search engine industry. I found that one of the most fascinating parts of the book was the focus on the real inventor of the Google Adwords model, the man behind Idealab: Bill Gross. He seems to have had a vision of what worked and is still exploring the future of what he describes as pay-per-sales (the logical continuation of pay-per-click). This man, Gross, who launched Goto.com before Google took over and made theirs this new business model, seems to be the most visionnary of the characters in the book, but somehow he remains stuck in the shadow of the Googles and Yahoos of this world. The book is a great read, despite the subject matter which could easily lead to an overly technical or purely business focus. I enjoyed the way he described the story and reflected on some of the thoughts for where this industry is going and how it will transform the world of business and society as a whole. As always the claim that we are only at the first 5% of the transformation that is about to take place is a little difficult to buy, but somewhere you know that there is a lot more to be done before we have seen the full impact of the new search based society we are evolving into.Worth reading for anyone who wants to understand the future of communication, marketing, ecommerce, the internet or is just curious..."},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"This book is not just about Google but about search companies and provides an excellent history..

Check it out..."},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"This book delivers all it promises and more. \\"The Search\\" takes the reader on a walk down memory lane, back when numerous search engines served the Internet's search needs. During the '90s, search engines such as Alta Vista, Lycos, Excite, HotBot, AOL Search, MSN and, of course, Yahoo, served us all the searches we needed-but, alas, they did not work in the long run and are now virtually obsolete.I remember how those SEs were visciously spammed and manipulated by Search Engine \\"Optimizers\\" (SEOs.) The search results were seldom relevant and porn links prevailed. (I recall the time when my 7-year-old son searched for \\"Pokemon\\" and landed at a hardcore porn site.)There had to be a better way.Then, out of the blue, appeared a new search engine that changed all the rules and introduced \\"link popularity.\\" Search was never the same again. Now search results are ALWAYS relevant. In fact, Google always returns exactly the sites I look for. Amazingly, it sometimes even suggests what it THINKS I'm looking for.This book tells this story and more, in detail. Although Google is featured prominently in the book, the author discusses in depth the search industry as a whole. You'll read about how ambitious and hungry Google, the company, is and about the power it possesses over Internet users.Very engrossing reading. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"I was fascinated to know some details about the search industry & especially Google. This book has served both the inquisitions.The book explains the evolution of online search industry. It has indepth coverage of different players involved(more on google compared to others), different personalities involved.It does give some inner details about:1. The working and hiring culture in google(some times in comparision to yahoo).2. Possible negatives about the founders, in a relative context.3. Future possibilities and directions of search.4. Different aspects involved in intricacies of search economy(like click through etc).My only gripe is that the title should have been clearer that there is more coverage on Google, compared to others. But, Google is considered the main pure search play with tractions now-a-days. So, I can understand the approach of the author."},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"This is a great book about Google, its rivals, and the search industry. It tells you about the evolution of internet search - the problems Yahoo, Altavista and other search engines had early on - and how Google revolutionized search and became a huge success.I can imagine that the average person might look at this title and think \\"Search? How can that be interesting?\\" To John Battelle's credit, he does an excellent job of making otherwise mundane topics interesting and easy to understand. Battelle also spends some time talking about Google's possible expansions into the future - it's amazing to think about what the future might hold.All in all, a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"I would certainly recommend this book to everybody who is using search engines and interested in knowing the history and the evolution of internet search and the business of search. The book also talks about the birth and growth of Google Inc. and how it became such a huge success. This is a book you cannot drop until you finish!"},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"In a very easy-to-read (and understandable for those who may not have a technical/engineering/computer science background) book, Battelle presents an interesting notion of \\"database of intentions\\" - analysing what people are searching for at any given timeperiod, we can get snapshots of popular culture (assuming of course all sections of the society uses search engines - not realistic, but that's what assumptions are for, right?). By further studying these snapshots, we can peform some anthropoligical cultural study, according the author. Plausible. The rest of the book, however, doesn't directly address his premise, but provides a \\"layman's\\" account of what Internet search means, and how it has evolved. It discusses the history of \\"search companies\\" from the first main company Altavista to Google. Much of the book is certainly focused on talking about the company whose motto is \\"Dont be evil!\\" (google), though at appropriate contexts, the author provides interesting snippets of how other companies dealt with similar issues, or when their paths crossed. It does make for an interesting reading. A slightly romanticized version of Google's initial days, and its IPO is also presented by the author.Each chapter is neatly organized and presents additional insights into the growth of Google and the underlying stories within the \\"search\\" community. The chapter, \\"the pefect search\\" is perhaps the best written chapter in the book and presents some interesting questions that could very well set the agenda/checkpoints for years to come in this field. The discussion on the Patriot Act and its relevance in the context of search makes for some dry reading, though it does raise some pertinent and important issues.The rather superficial technical discussion, when it does exist, makes it is clear that the author is targeting people without much technical background but enough technical curiousity (and maybe he wants to cash in the hype Google seems to create every other day!) Regardless, the book is well-paced and the use of a simple narrative style makes it read like a novel (and thats a good thing). A must read."},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"I remember watching the movie Catch Me If you Can and thought it was a great movie. But then I realized with a cast that includes Leo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks and is directed by Spielberg, it's pretty hard to NOT make a good movie. The Search is in that kind of mode. Take an interesting topic, a couple funky companies, add in a seasoned technology writer who can write for the Wired masses, and you're going to get a decent enough book about Google and the search engine biz.But you're also left wanting a lot more. More history on Google. More insights into the background of its founders. More on internal corporate culture.Gimlette tends to wax philosophically on the matter of search when he should have spent his time digging up more information. He touches well on Overture and Altavista, a couple search engines that never got their due.A fine enough read but you get the feeling, aside from a handful of actual interviews, that what you're reading is a bunch of google searches on google, put into the author's own words, and then strung together.I wanted more."},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"Being a non techy, I was enthralled with the way search has developed and the possibilities for the future. The future of not only search, but business models as we know them."},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"The book is excellent, although if you are a true techno-geek it will be pedestrian from a technical sense. However, for the novice it is a great overview on the history of search engines and the power they are just starting to demonstrate. I found the history of all the various engineers and technology overlaid against the backdrop of luck, economics and timing, to be a fascinating glimpse into the reality that the best technology is not usually what makes the most money.At the core of the book though is the concept of what a search engine can do. Obviously there are as many possibilities to develop and implement search algorithms as there are creative people to invent them (Microsoft MSN, Yahoo and others have products that compete directly with, and in many cases outperform the more well known brand the book focuses on), but essentially they have the power to pull together unbelievable amounts of formerly disconnected data, and create a targeted marketing aimed at you personally.The potential danger of all of this technology is that depending on how you set the algorithm, you no longer simply search reality, but actually create it. For example, a change in how the search engine works can drive business to some on line retailers while destroying the business of others. It can conceivably literally create trends, and promote views, all through the seemingly blind eye of the program. The problem is that these programs are anything but blind, and we are on the verge of tremendous legal battles due to the creativity of those trying to use the system to deflect traffic from the owner of a trademark, to their own competing brand, with full compliance by the folks at Google.Overall, this book is an excellent way for the novice to understand this phenomenon a little better, and be more aware of how our world is changing. Sure, there are valid literary criticisms of the book, and the author is biased towards (seems enamored with) Google, but it is a very interesting book that is informative, and certainly not dull. Recommended."},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"Though I'm coming to a review of The Search a year too late, I can explain why. I bought the book on its release, very excited to read some good journalism about the hottest business topic of the day. I was sure that Battelle, who had been chronically his progress on the book on his own blog, would deliver. Halfway through the book (in a matter of three days - a possible sign pointing to its lack of depth) I'm realizing that this is not the case.Thus far, I have two major gripes with the book. The first is the writing itself. The book is written in informal magazine style, in keeping with his roots as a \\"cutting edge\\" technology writer (having worked for Wired and Business 2.0, magazines that try desperately to be \\"too cool for the room\\").This would be fine enough, except that Battelle has a habit of jumping around from year to year, talking about decisions made by players in Google's history before he actually introduces them. He never fully explains why it was important for Sergey Brin and Larry Page - Google's founders - to resign their chairman and CEO posts, nor does he tell the reader what their new titles are. Battelle also has a habit of reintroducing people several times, a practice which at times seems a cheap way to up his page count. His writing style thoroughly muddles however much thoughtfulness there was to his project. I considered keeping a tally of how many times he used \\"well\\" as an interjection, but lost interested after I ran out of fingers.On page 150 he discusses a lack of managerial prowess on the part of Brin, Page and new CEO Eric Schmidt. According to Battelle, one of Google's investors, John Doerr, insisted that Intuit founder Bill Campbell come on as a leadership coach. Battelle uses an anecdote from journalist John Heilemann's GQ article on Google, which quotes Doerr as saying, \\"I don't know where the company would be without him.\\" However, Battelle doesn't include any of his own reporting on what Campbell actually did. Neglecting to explain right away what this \`miraculous' shift was is, in my own journalistic view, irresponsible. Not to mention that he doesn't include the actual title of Heilemann's article in either the main book or the citations.Later in the book on page 172, he tries to play the role of not only a technology writer, and search historian, but also media theorist and critic, waxing about how Google ought to be considered a media company - not just a technology company.In the book's final chapter, Battelle introduces the idea of having several different kinds of information contribute to \\"perfect search,\\" including every tech writer and journalist's favorite idea, the blog. He bulldozes through a description of the blog and later posits that we have reached the critical mass point, \\"but we don't know it yet.\\" I suspect that Battelle means that he's savvier than users and other writers and he knows something we don't, but he doesn't explain why he thinks we've reached the tipping point, nor what that means in the overall discussion of what the blog can do.Though Battelle tries to play his book as a \\"history of search,\\" it is nowhere near as comprehensive as such a book must be. It is a book that sings the praises of Google, nothing more. However, that the book is a history of Google is fine. The company certainly is interesting and large enough to warrant an historical account and Battelle ought to be forthcoming with his intent. The short discussions he does include of the company's search engine precursors such as Lycos and Alta-Vista need considerable expansion and deserve to be considered as more than also-rans, if he really wants to be considered the historian of search and not just Google's unofficial corporate historian."},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"John Battelle knows search. His blog on the topic has become a standard of sorts in an industry that evolves by the minute (almost) and his book on the topic is as comprehensive as it is insightful. He does an excelled job at looking back at the evolution of the search field from its early days, going into greater detail about Google, and delving some into Yahoo!, Altavista and A9. Yet, he cleverly manages to keep the book fresh by not just sticking his head in the past, but posing interesting philosophical questions throughout the book.After doing a fairly comprehensive assessment of the evolution and current state of the industry as of the publishing of the book, almost the entire last two chapters of \\"The Search\\" are devoted to the exploration of the possible avenues Google specifically and the search domain at large will likely be taking. This part of the book is bound to be fascinating to SEO/Internet Marketing professionals as well as to the average web user.If you want to learn more about Google, I suggest you pick up \\"The Google Story\\", published shortly after this book. The truth is it will only save you from reading just a couple of chapters on the mega-successful search company in this book. Otherwise, there is not that much overlap between the two books. If you haven't read either one, I'd say start here, and if you feel like it, move on to \\"The Google Story\\". That for sure will wet your appetite for knowledge on the Search Engine topic."},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. It was well written and provided enough information to keep me glued to it. However, I was really hoping to find out more about Google than what would be possible from Google's own PR machine. The early search engine history and the development of that technology is probably the more fascinating part of the book. Which is ironic, since the book is supposed to be primarily about Google. My guess is that the author sacrificed the ability to write about more intriguing and behind the scenes happenings at Google for the almost unlimited access to the founders and the top managers.Overall, this is a pretty good book, but a hard-nosed investigative reporter would probably have come up with more intriguing content."},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"This book gives a great overview of the past, present and future of search. Given the dominance of Google in the web and in culture, it is tempting to forget the companies that preceeded Google, and did a damn fine job in their own right. This book describes long forgotten search engines like AltaVista, Excite, Overture, and how their missteps allowed Google to overtake them as the dominant search engine. Read about how Yahoo changed their focus to being a media company, and by doing so, forever altered the landscape of the internet. Apart from the history of search, the bulk of the book focuses on Google, and gives a particularly interesting insight into the culture and inner workings in of the company. I spoke to a director at Google right before I read the book, and the book complemented what he told me really well.Last but not least, the last chapter, 'The Perfect Search' was just fascinating. It relates so well, because it is essentially summarizes all the frustrations I ever had when searching, and describes how the perfect search is already becoming a reality in many ways, slowly but surely.All in all, a great read that changes the way you look at search."},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"Less than five years ago, two PhD. candidates, Sergey Brin and Larry Page launched their own search engine. Naming it Google, after the name of the largest known number, it has literally changed the face of internet searching as we know it. Gone are the days of multiple hits for basic search inquiries. With Google's page-ranking system, the searcher gets to see the most relevant searches listed first.This book does a remarkable job of telling Brin's and Page's story. From humble Silicon Valley students to the owners of the most prosperous company in the world, Brin and Page have changed the playing field for the entire internet. While many companies died out during the dot com days, Google survived and flourished. One of the oddities of Google's success is that they have achieved all of thier miraculous growth without a real working marketing plan. They have let the sheer influence and size of Google do the talking, and it has worked extremely well.Today, Google has become a household name. People constantly say \\"I've Googled this\\", or \\"I've Googled that\\". And they're right. With Google's method of search, it makes it very easy for the user to type almost anything into the search box and get back a near-perfect response. But we haven't made it to the \\"perfect search\\"; the idea of retrieving exact results for a specific search. With the way Google is going, it wouldn't be surprising if they solved this enigma.I read this book for a Master's degree course in library science, and I was fascinated by it. Brin and Page got to live everyone's ultimate dream; find something that will make you insanely rich. I use Google almost extensively in my own research, and I've been extremely pleased with the results. I was fascinated with the story of Google's unheard of rise from a small company being housed in a college dorm room to a giant that employs thousands of people. I highly recommend this book. Google is a one-of-a-kind company, and their story is truly remarkable. Read this great book and discover how the brainchild of two students turned into one of the world's most profitable companies."},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"This is an extremely insightful book on the concept of search in the information age. The internet is ubiquitous with loads of information and billions of users. The problem is to match our information needs and the source in this vast ever expanding ocean. The book is about bridging the gap and also making money in the process.The book starts with an explanation of our intentions to find something and how we find it. The methodology of search based on ideas like crawling , indexing and retrieval linked to key words initially looks simple. However the need for the huge amount computational power and storage to run search engines is mind-boggling. On the other hand to make search really contextual and interactive with inclusion of text, audio and video wherever necessary is not a simple task. The search for such technologies seems to have just begun. At best we have reached 5% of what we need to achieve says the author.Some aspects that I found really interesting in this book are :- Excellent non technical approach to explain the working of search engines- Outline of the rise ( and fall) of several companies grappling with the technology of search- Biography of Google and to some extent other search engines, Yahoo in particular- The business model of Search - making Billions through millions of transactions, a few cents at a time.- The strategic importance of Search in the next years and the need to assume leadership in this vital business/technologyApart from technology and business the book is also a lively read with some interesting episodes and litigations.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"The idea of making billions of dollars on a business based on searching online indexes is inconceivable, except when you consider how the Internet has changed the business world. This concept is so vague that it is difficult even to consider, let alone write about. Yet author John Battelle has done a thorough, entertaining job of identifying how this attempt to pin down cyberspace works, and how two graduate students turned their mathematical challenge into Google, the fastest growing company in history. While this is primarily a corporate biography, Battelle does not pander to the company's billionaire founders. They are portrayed as authoritarian geeks with few warm qualities. But they are also shown as visionary engineers who turned their killer application into a business that successfully defied Wall Street when their company went public. This is a great story, which is why we recommend it to technology fans searching for meaning and to business readers who want to understand the future of search technology. Or as Google says: search and you shall find."},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"I started searching the Internet when it most mostly for scientific data and governmental information. I paid by the minute and it wasn't uncommon to charge $300 to my credit card for one month of very slow connection speeds and websites that were only \\"Text!\\" Nothing was in color and so much of what we now take for granted, like flash animations and live interactions, was only in the dreams of developers.John Battelle succeeded in captivating my entire attention from the time I started reading his book, until late that evening when I finally had to put it down and accept the fact that I finished reading it. \\"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture\\", authored by Battelle, is clearly written by someone who could be considerd one of the forefathers and early architects of the Internet.I hope that my review, based on my own personal opinion, will inspire you to read this wonderful book if it seems to meet your interests. With so many books about the Internet and the \\"Web\\" on bookshelves, taking the time to find the best of the best is worthwhile. I personally felt that Battelle wrote the most compelling and exciting book, of this genre, that I've ever read.I consider myself to be an expert \\"Googler\\"-or perhaps I should say I am a \\"Googlex\\"? Whatever the case, \\"The Search...\\" will explore almost every imaginable aspect of Internet searching and way beyond. Google and its rivals are likely a part of most everyones lives. But we are about a million miles away from the peak potential of the Internet Search Engine Power (ISEP)that is potentially available. Battelle actually had me emotionally excited when I started to think of the endless possibilities of the future and how only a tiny portion of the potential of GOOGLE has been utilized. It reminds me of when a teacher told me that I would likely only use about 15% of the capacity of my brain. In a similar sense, my former teacher would say that GOOGLE is only at 1 or 2%-perhaps even less.I really think that to tell you too much more about the book would take away from the joy and energy you will experience when reading this book. It's not one of those books that you'll read a part of a chapter and then go about your business until a later date. You won't want to stop reading and you'll likely learn a great deal more about GOOGLE, its Rivals, and \\"Searching\\" in general.I hope that at least a portion of this review was helpful to you. It was a pleasure to write a review about a book that was intelligently written, but also to be considered an easy read. Thanks again and ENJOY READING-no matter what you choose to purchase today or at another time.Peter CanniceScottsdale, ArizonaEMAIL HORSEPETE@AOL.COM"},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"John Battelle did a really nice job here. I bought the book, so obviously I expected it to be reasonably good, but Battelle's analysis easily surpassed my expectations.Without ever losing focus or getting off course, Battelle covers the technical and business history of search. One of the most interesting aspects of the book is the constant comparing and contrasting of the technical and business decisions of the various technology companies and how they led each of them to success, failure or a particular spot in the market.A lot of this book is dedicated to the market leader in search, Google, its very interesting leaders and the quirks that make it unique. Battelle's analysis of the oft-controversial Google is even-handed and insightful, letting you make your own judgement of the company.The rest of \\"The Search\\" speculates intelligently on the future of search both as a business and as a technology. Battelle gets a lot of good input on this front because of his access to prominent people in the search industry he's gotten working at Wired Magazine. He makes a lot of Amazon's own A9 search product and really lays out the different paths search firms are taking to target the future.This book is really well done from start to finish. It'll make search interesting and instill a genuine interest in watching the search industry like a horse race. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"i have just begun my career in a big search engine company and bought this book to learn more about the industry. It does not make me disappointed. John described the history of search engine industry comprehensively and you understood what happened to those famous names like Yahoo, Overture (Goto.com), Altavista and Google.

Best choice for everyone who has a interest in SE industry."},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"This is a very enjoyable book that is definitely in the tradition of Steven Levy's \`Hackers' and Robert Cringley's \`Accidental Empires' when it comes to outlining the history of search on the internet; the story of the people and the companies etc. But where Battelle's book differentiates itself from a historical book only about Google and the internet, are in his insights in to the importance of search as it relates to the internet, knowledge and ultimately our lifestyle.Battelle's book definitely gives you a great story of the internet from Yahoo, EBay and IdeaLab, to the story that most people want to read about, Google; the story of Page and Brin's archetypal journey from Stanford's computer labs to Silicon Valley millionaires. But more important than this story is the real philosophy of \`search' and how it underpins how we interact with the internet at one level, but more fundamentally how we search for and interact with knowledge. Think about a world where through RFID and Google's search capabilities you could be able to search for physical things in your house and the world at large - Google's Desktop search taken to the next level!Battelle explores the topic of search and dives deep enough to give us great insights while outlining the implications of this search for knowledge. He describes a concept called the \`database of intentions', the idea of being able to see what everyone actually wants at any moment in time. This is a marketing miracle, where people through their searching are actually giving us access to their very desires. Being able to tap into people's desires is definitely a holy grail of most marketers and advertisers! The reason that Google IPO'ed at such a high valuation during a time when other companies were struggling, was due to the fact they tapped into this database of intentions and provided a service for advertisers to access it. The actual business model was first created by Idealab's Bill Gross through his company GoTo, but it was through Google's application that this model truly succeeded. Obviously there is much more to Google's rise to success, otherwise we would be reading a book about \`GoTo' and Bill Gross.The Search - attempts to be many things and surprisingly does them all well; from being a great story about the history of the internet and the story behind Google's rise to fame, to exploring the philosophy behind searching for knowledge and how and why this is so important. The writing is solid and keeps you turning the pages, while imparting some interesting thoughts along the way. But this is not a fluffy business book.I normally judge a book by a number of factors; story, writing, new information gained etc. But the most important factor (for me, anyway) is how \`stimulating' the book is. For me \`stimulating' translates to how many ideas and notes do I generate while reading it. Well Battelle's book is the gold standard for stimulating reading; on, nearly, every page of my copy there are underlines, highlights, notes and scribbles that were inspired by the book."},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"I liked the book. Before I read this, I was interested in two things. (1) Business model: How and when did they come up with the business model? (2) Technology: exactly what type of technology are they using to achieve their superior search engine? Regarding the question (1) , the book explained very well, how Brin and Page started the company without any business model in late 90's (they even tried to sell the technology for $1M, and no one bought it!), and how they incorporated the Goto.com's Overture's successful business model.But the book never answers the question 2. Many pages are consumed to explain the ranking system, but many readers already know the Google's ranking system. I was more interested in exactly what type of database (SQL?), what type of sever, what type of mainframe they use. And exactly how the server picks up the request in a blazingly fast speed?

John Battelle got the big picture uncannily accurate (e.g., colliding turf between Google and Amazon) even though he missed a few key influences that had already started in 2005 (e.g., social, Facebook) and Google eventually pulling out of China. Several assumptions that stood the test of time in US will be re-tested in emerging markets (e.g., net neutrality) but this time the stakeholders are more informed by historical choices and implications.The book deals with concepts at a high level and is built on author's discussions with key players in the industry rather than a first hand working experience in the nuts and bolts of the industry and this shows."},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"this book is really good, and in good condition.

This book details some interesting scenarios and insights into the power and future of search. For instance, full integration of web search and digital TV as a powerful targeted advertising platform is merely a contractual agreement away. But can Google's inference of an individual's preferences compete with the factual data that Facebook holds, which is volunteered by it's users?Google is the most visited site on the internet, but how much time do users actually spend there? Google is many people's starting point (with the exception of Chinese who use Baidu), but it's only used as a gateway to go somewhere else. John Battelle explains how Google's rise to the top stems from it's ability to return relevant search results - thanks to it's core intellectual property PageRank (named after Larry Page). However, since most of it's users are anonymous to Google, it cannot correlate personal identity with browsing behaviour - so dad gets daughter's adverts, and worse, daughter gets dad's adverts!The book is not only about Google, but about search as a business and some of the pioneers of search that were around long before Google - remember Alta Vista and Lycos?

For example, the concern that the federal government could require Google furnish the personal information of its users is misplaced.fireflySun DOT com/book/Google2.phpAnd victims of gang cyberstalking might welcome such a registry. Consider the following:1. Stalking gangs use Google to search IP addresses to keep tabs on the activities of its victims, often disrupting their relationships with third parties and collecting information to create / disseminate dossiers.2. Just a single post by an epileptically-posting belligerent in Usenet's unmoderated news groups (over 90% of which amount to flame wars) is cloned by news readers (as many times as there are news readers to archive it to the web under a unique URL). Google then archives all these posts, and they rank highly in a search of your name in Google.3. Google's customer service could not keep pace with its OCD-like hoarding of content, and when you request that Google remove a link to a malicious and libelous message containing nothing accurate except your illicitly-procured residential address and phone number, Google threatens by claiming that if you compel them with a legal document to remove any message, your name and document will be referred to a free speech web site for blacklisting (chillingeffects.org).So Google itself, and our infatuation with it (and dependence on it), is still young enough that we ignore the fact Google is a public safety and health risk (i.e. \\"The Great Repression\\")."},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"Writing in a style that web neophytes can read, John Battelle manages to make his book interesting to old web hands as well.

I was a bit proud of myself that I had read most of them--at had at least heard of the rest. For whatever reason, though, one book had escape me over the years: The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture. I was more than five years late, but figured that I owed it to myself to give it a read.I'm glad that I did.I had seen Battelle on Bloomberg West and he was particularly smart and articulate. My one initial hesitation with The Search: I had already read many books about Google. (I count Ken Auletta's book among my very favorites.) Did I really need to read yet another book about Larry and Sergey's company?But here's the rub: Battelle's book is hardly Google-specific. Rather, it's about the vast implications of being able to find an increasing amount of information within seconds, a trend that shows no signs of abating. Now, to be sure, you can't write a book about the history of search without delving into Google, but this is a book about so much more than one company. For instance, I learned a great deal about the role of Bill Gross and GoTo.com, a precursor to Google and the guy who cracked the nut on paid placements. I hadn't realized that Larry and Sergey modified Gross' central idea.A Glimpse of What's BeyondWhile I probably should have read this excellent text when it was released, in a way I'm happy that I stumbled upon it now. Sure, AOL and Yahoo! are not nearly as relevant today as they were when Battelle was hammering away on his Mac. But reading books like this years after their release allows you to assess the author's predictions ex post facto. Battelle's vision of then then-future in 2006 is, for the most part, panning out.On a general level, my very favorite business books do the following:* advance a big idea* teach me something new (not that easy to do, since I read many non-fiction, business, and technology books)* tell interesting stories* leave me wanting moreBattelle does all of the above with considerable aplomb.

The story is still valid today!"},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"This book at its core is primarily about Google - the fastest growing company ever - but the author's aim is to increase awareness of the significance of web search services: how widely they are used, and the possible consequences for society. Web search is a key to discovering (or recovering) valuable information scattered across a huge and ever changing internet. Captured search information has value to researchers and marketers, and to the extent that search engines drive traffic to sites they are valued by the owners of those sites. As of 2004 more than 65 million Americans were averaging more than thirty searches a month, and that number was growing 20% a year. The author describes in detail how search engines work and how they evolved: from DEC's AltaVista, to Lycos and Excite, to Google's PageRank algorithm based on citations.Ironically in the late '90s major destination sites were focused on keeping visitors on their own content pages so they could charge e-commerce providers for partnership deals, rather than providing a search service so users could go elsewhere. Hence Google was able to make its start as a service provider to Netscape and Yahoo. It was not until 2002, however, that Google adopted auction and pay-per-click advertising, as pioneered by its competitor Overture, then beat Overture at its own game by replacing it as a partner to AOL.Pay-per-click advertising has proved a compelling value for customer aquisition, resulting in a search engine optimization (SEO) industry that uses techniques - appropriate, inappropriate, and borderline - to boost the rankings of e-commerce sites. Revenue at Google soared over five years by a stunning 400,000% and the company went public in 2004 in an idosyncratic but ultimately successful IPO.In addition to Google's history the author also discusses privacy concerns, given that the company has the ability to retain all searches performed by an individual, but that it must accommodate national governments, be it China or the US authorities seeking information using the PATRIOT act. In addition there is a wider society impact when public information, for example about court cases are easily accessible by anyone such as prospective employers.Apart from the occasionally overwrought digression the book is dense with details and provides an excellent introduction to Google and the history behind it."}]`),q={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:x},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},L={class:"card-container"},M=["disabled"],H={key:0},B={key:1};function W(n,e,s,c,r,i){const m=g("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",L,[(t(!0),a(y,null,p(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),w(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",B,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",H,"See more"))],8,M)):b("",!0)])}const D=u(q,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-c64c433e"]]),N=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/19.md","filePath":"glossary/19.md"}'),G={name:"glossary/19.md"},E=Object.assign(G,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(D)]))}});export{N as __pageData,E as default};
