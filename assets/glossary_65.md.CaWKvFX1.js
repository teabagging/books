It also explains how our Federal Reserve manipulates imaginary dollars to effect and even control our financial economy, not only for our financial economy but the World financial economy. So if you are a person that has never studied how the monetary system works this would be a book to help you understand all aspects of it from the very elementary to the complexity of it all.

The hypothetical stories are so realistic that two of the stories (\\"Words\\" and \\"Leadership\\") actually occurred in real life between the time when the story was written and when I read the book! Since it only takes about ten minutes to read a story aloud, there is definitely enough time to read it and discuss a topic during a half-hour time period. I could see this being used in a high school or college ethics class; or even in a business seminar focussing on core values.Some of the topics covered include abortion, homosexual marriage, separation of church and state, victimless crimes, relative truth, and are all religions the same? I especially enjoyed The Game Show story. It focusses on little known facts and common assumptions that aren't actually true. If you want to get a lively discussion started, try reading one of these stories and watch the fur fly."},{"Title":"Ten Lies and Ten Truths (Hudson, Parker)","review":"I've been waiting for a day like this to occur. I really wasn't too certain whether I was willing to give one last chance. Parker Hudson's stories are always from the heart. But I always had trouble sticking with them, hoping his writing might get a little better. And it has. And this time around Parker doesn't go for the latest 350 page bestseller. He doesn't look to dazzle you with genius. He simply challenges you to think through 10 simple short stories. And he ultimately leaves it up to you to make your choice. He presents his evidence, and it rings true! But what are you really going to believe? 10 lies, or 10 truths?My favorite stories in this collection would be \\"The Plane Trip,\\" \\"The Vote,\\" (a scary concept, and it hits right between the eyes!!) \\"Definitions,\\" and \\"The Past is Present.\\" And the other stories are great as well. There is no bad presentation in this entire collection, and Parker Hudson made sure of that.In a nut shell, the subjects are simple, and it is what Parker Hudson chose to address. 1. Evolution 2. Our founding fathers 3. Abortion 4. God and Allah, & Islam 5. Absolute Truths 6. Character and integrity7. Marriage 8. Popular opinion, or the elites in today's society 9. Porn and promiscuity, who it hurts. 10. Our relationships in our daily lives.These are all addressed in 10 short stories. The question is, do you believe what the world tells you? Or do you stand on what God says, because you know it to be true? There is truth!!! We need to have the guts to stand up for it! Parker Hudson took the opportunity to give us something to think about. He gave us a great witnessing tool. God wants us to be witnesses for Him! Let's give God what He deserves, and that's honor, glory and praise! It's about time somebody got a little brash, and Parker Hudson wasn't afraid to approach that line, and cross it from time to time. That deserves a slap on the back, and it gives us the opportunity to serve a most awesome God the in the way He's meant to be served!"},{"Title":"Ten Lies and Ten Truths (Hudson, Parker)","review":"This is a thought provoking book and entertaining book.Divided into ten chapters, each one presents a short story that focuses on moral and ethical issues. It would be great for starting discussions in a Bible study, ethics class, or any other small group.The topics covered include the following: evolution, history, abortion, absolute vs. relative values, character, marriage, whether the elites know best, pornography, and relationships. The last chapter entitled 'Two Lists' about human relationships is one that everyone in our fast paced culture would do well to read and ponder.Another chapter that is incredibly creative is 'The Vote'. It deals with the functioning of government - pure democracy vs. a republic.

As a work of literature, if nothing else, &quot;Never Call Retreat&quot; is worth the read.But there is more. Because of his eloquence, and his passion for the subject, Catton has produced an account truly worthy of the poignant subject matter. If the reader does not weep as Catton describes Lincoln's assassination, or Stonewall Jackson's death, then he cannot be moved to tears by written words.Catton portrays the war as a living organism, which, like Frankenstein's monster, got loose from its creators, and almost pulled the house down with it.Catton's centennial trilogy (&quot;Coming Fury,&quot; &quot;Terrible Swift Sword,&quot; &quot;Never Call Retreat&quot;) is an admirable place for the average person to begin a study of the Civil War.Because of its poetic qualities, however, it is also a must read for the professional historian. All too often, historians have no heart in their writing. Perhaps a good dose of Catton might cure that"},{"Title":"Never Call Retreat","review":"In &quot;Never Call Retreat&quot;, the third volume of his Centennial History of the Civil War, Bruce Catton writes of the last two years of that horrendous conflict. As he did in his first two volumes in the Centennial triology, Catton effectively covers the social and political aspects of the war, as well as the military. A work of this scope is, of necessity, a top-down view of the Civil War, focussing on the principal commanders and their subordinates. Yet, Catton is able to impart to his readers the confusion of battle; we can almost smell the powder smoke and hear the racket of musketry. As always, he writes with an elegance and an eloquence that many historians aspire to, but most cannot hope to match. Catton never loses sight of the war's ultimate, and higher, purpose and he poignantly brings home to us the human cost of our bloodiest conflict. Perhaps nowhere is this sense of loss brought home more forcefully than in this passage about Lincoln's assassination:&quot;No one will ever know what Abraham Lincoln would have done--with Stanton's scheme for military government, with radicals like Wade and Sumner and Stevens, with any of the separate aspects of the intricate problem that lay ahead--because it was at this delicate moment (about half-past ten on the night of April 14) that Booth came on stage with his derringer. Booth pulled the trigger, and the mind that held somewhere in cloudy solution the elements that might some day have crystallized into an answer for the nation's most profound riddle disintegrated under the impact of a one-ounce pellet of lead: the heaviest bullet, all things considered, ever fired in America. Thinking to destroy a tyrant, Booth managed to destroy a man who was trying to create a broader freedom for all men; with him, he destroyed also the chance for a transcendent peace without malice and with charity for all. Over the years, many people paid a high price for this moment of violence&quot;.Four decades after its publication, this book, and the two that precede it, still stands as one of the best introductions to the war that defines us to this day."},{"Title":"Never Call Retreat","review":"My husband received Bruce Catton's American Civil War Trilogy as a gift and he said that he didn't want to see it end. After finishing Volume 3, Never Call Retreat, I agree with him completely. I can understand why it remains so popular almost 50 years from when it was first published. The Civil War trilogy is a scholarly work, but reads more like a novel.Never Call Retreat starts after the Battle of Antietam (Sharpsburg) and the author will take us through some of the most momentous events to take place during the Civil War including the Emancipation Proclamation, the Battle of Gettysburg, the fall of Vicksburg, the siege of Charleston, the presidential election of 1864, Sherman's March to the Sea, the surrender at Appomattox, and Lincoln's death. He also shows how even before the war was over, Lincoln was debating reconstruction and how the Confederate states could best be reunited with the Union. But it's the additional information that Catton provides that makes these books so interesting. He tells us about the deficiencies of the southern railroads and how that handicapped the Confederacy. He relates how the Union and the Confederates still traded goods (especially cotton) despite being at war. He gives examples of how military technology was more advanced than the soldiers using it. All of these different facets provide a more in-depth understanding of the war.Where Catton is especially talented is in analyzing the characters he writes about. In book one, Lincoln begins to stumble through his presidency. By book three, his genius shows through and he is in commanded of everything from his cabinet to the military. Catton also is a good judge of military leadership. Lee and Grant were brilliant, but many of the officers on both sides were uninspired, reticent and lacking in military skills. In Never Call Retreat, the Confederates are especially plagued by poor leadership in the Western Campaign. \\"John B. Hood was uncomplicated, and when they gave him Joe Johnston's army, he assumed that he was expected to go out and fight. This he did, and as a result the South lost 20,000 good soldiers, Atlanta, the presidential election and most of what remained of the war.\\"Catton also has a special skill in taking complicated situations and describing them with simple eloquence. In talking about the Gettysburg Address, he writes that Lincoln \\"spoke of liberty and equality instead of victory, as if these words alone could give meaning to what had been done here, and instead of dedicating the ground he called upon those who stood there to dedicate themselves to something that might justify all that Gettysburg had cost them.\\" In describing the end of the war, he writes that after Appomattox, Lee \\"rode straight into legend and took his people with him...The cause that failed became The Lost Cause, larger than life, taking on color and romance as the years passed, remembered with pride and heart-ache but never again leading to bloodshed. Civil Wars have had worse endings than this.\\"The Civil War may have ended in 1865, but as long as Bruce Catton's works are still in print, he will continue to turn younger generations into Civil War buffs. What better way can there be to honor our nations past?"},{"Title":"Never Call Retreat","review":"\\"Never Call Retreat\\" concludes Bruce Catton's trilogy of the Civil War in the same excellent fashion which the reader enjoyed in the first two volumes, \\"The Coming Fury\\" and \\"Terrible Swift Sword\\" (see my Amazon reviews). Once again, Catton explains the war from all aspects, Northern and Southern, Military and Political, Social and Economic.Beginning in December, 1862, this volume takes us through the siege of Vicksburg, the battles of Gettysburg and those around Atlanta, the March to the Sea and the destruction of the Army of Northern Virginia and the dissolution of the Confederacy. Each theatre of the War is covered in its turn. The campaigns are described, not only as battles but as the wars of supply, command staffing and maneuver. The gradually increasing role of U.S. Grant is apparent as the book progresses.The war is shown, not only as a military contest, but as a political struggle as well. Abraham Lincoln is seen in his struggles against Copperheads, such as Clement Vallandingham. The pressure from the Radical Republicans forced Lincoln had to balance the need to advance the rights of blacks while maintaining the support of Unionists who were not willing to accompany Emancipation with political enfranchisement. The contending forces within Lincoln's cabinet as well as those in Congress and in the states are carefully studied.Jefferson Davis' vain efforts find the right combination of generals and to rally his countrymen in support of the war merits our sympathy. The twin challenges of despair and desertion were beyond even Davis' impressive powers of persuasion.One figure who earned some admiration from me is General George B. MacClellan. I had always viewed MacClellan as an unsuccessful general and a political opportunist. Through this trilogy I came to see MacClellan as, a poor general, to be sure, but a politician who adhered to a consistent platform of support for the war and Union, but without any support for emancipation or equality for blacks.One figure who did not improve his standing in my estimation was General Ben Butler, the Massachusetts Pro-War Democrat whose combination of military incompetence and arrogance was tolerated only so long as it was outweighed by his political usefulness. Once Lincoln was reelected, Butler was given a well earned ticket home.Throughout this book, as in the first two volumes, we see Union Wars aims gradually shift from that of Union, regardless of Emancipation, to Union with Emancipation. Catton skillfully weaves the story of the inexorable shift in Northern opinion on the subject of Emancipation which forced this shift in war aims.At the end of the book we see the wrap-up of the War and a hint at the challenges of Reconstruction and healing, the effects of which we still struggle with today.At the end of this book I have a much deeper understanding of the Civil War than I had when I started the trilogy. For this, among other reasons, I recommend this book and series to everyone."},{"Title":"Never Call Retreat","review":"Bruce Catton's Civil War trilogy, as I have noted previously, is essentially a Northern counterpart to the more Southern-oriented Shelby Foote. Catton writes with considerable eloquence, and this third volume, which covers the last two years of the war, from Fredricksburg to Appomattox Court House, is perhaps the best. Since he's covering the politics of the war most carefully, and more or less skimming the military features, or at least the battles, this book covers those two years in some ways rather cursorily. In other ways it's very detailed, and in either case it's very entertaining.This volume covers essentially McClellan's successors in Virginia, starting with Burnside and moving on through Hooker, Meade, and eventually Grant. In the West, Grant's continued rise is chronicled in the first half, and by the end we're of course following Sherman across Georgia. All of the major battles, Chickamauga, Chattanooga, Vicksburg, and so forth, get good coverage, though as I've said it tends to be pretty short, as Catton is much more interested in the politics and strategy of the war than he is in the battles. His discussion of Lincoln's evolution from a cautious war leader in the first book to a more-or-less full-on abolitionist (not as radical as some, though) is particularly good.I heartily recommend this first book as much as the first two. Should be required reading for Civil War buffs, alongside Foote."},{"Title":"Never Call Retreat","review":"This is Bruce Catton's third book in his Civil War Trilogy - no doubt this is one of his best. This volume covers the war from Fredericksburg to the surrender at Appomattox, and finally the assassination of Lincoln. Catton's approach in this book is generally the higher level strategy and the politics of the war. In many ways, it is a President's approach to the war, as Catton explains the actions of both President Davis and Lincoln. The most amazing aspect of this volume is Catton's smooth, running account of all events of this war, fought on various fronts and parts of the country. A tough literary feat, and Catton does it superbly in this book!I received a first addition, like the one pictured here. It is in pretty good conditioned, I am pleased to get a \\"collectable\\" if it can be classified as one."},{"Title":"Never Call Retreat","review":"\\"Never Call Retreat\\" is the third and final volume of Bruce Catton's classic Centennial History of the Civil War. This volume was published in 1965. Although the details may have been improved upon by later scholarship, \\"Never Call Retreat\\" endures as a superb reading experience based on Catton's matchless presentation of history as dramatic literature.Catton picks up the narrative in December of 1862, with the bloody slaughter of Burnside's failed assault at Fredericksburg. Whatever chance for moderation might have ever been possible, the Emancipation Proclamation and the rising casualties create an remorseless tide toward total war.In the West, Grant will grapple with the Confederate Fortress of Vicksburg, enduring a series of failures before finally and dramatically laying successful siege to that city. In the wake of Vicksburg, Grant will be directed to retrieve the failure of Chickamauga by breaking the Siege of Chattanooga. His success there will cause Lincoln to summon him to command of the Union Armies. Sherman will be left in the West to take Atlanta before marching to the sea through Georgia.In the East, Burnside and Hooker will each have a turn as commander of the Union Army of the Potomac, and each will be badly beaten by Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. George Meade, summoned to the command of the Army of the Potomac as Lee invades the North, will be just good enough to hang on and win at the three day trial of Gettysburg. The arrival of Grant as supreme commander will presage a bloody year long struggle between the two great Eastern armies, ending in the Siege of Petersburg, where Lee's Army will slowly bleed nearly to death before finally surrendering at Appomattox in April 1865.Catton does not neglect the politics, North and South, behind the fighting. In the South, Jefferson Davis struggles to forge a unified war effort with a Confederate Government too decentralized to marshal the necessary resources. Abraham Lincoln, his Union counterpart, struggles to bring the Union's superior resources to bear while maintaining a democracy and holding off a defeatist opposition. Linconl will win reelection in 1864 after surviving the darkest hours of the nation's will to reunite the country.Catton's narrative moves easily between theaters of war, detailing the struggles of very human leaders in the face of great challenges while placing those struggles in the context of the great themes of the war. Catton's superb narrative captures the uniqueness of an American Civil War.This book is highly recommended to the student of the Civil War and to the casual reader, both of whom will enjoy this volume and series."},{"Title":"Never Call Retreat","review":"I was a bit disappointed with this third and final book in Bruce Catton's Centennial History of the Civil War. Don't get me wrong, it is a remarkably good work but I found it a little redundant. Perhaps it is because the three books in this series were meant to be read either individually or in sequence and in order to satisfy both goals, a fairly significant amount of material regarding slavery, changing public attitudes and the politics, both North and South, had to be repeated for a third time. These redundancies, not apparent when the books are read on an individual basis, necessarily rise to the surface despite Mr. Catton's best efforts to deliver the information with a fresh and innovative approach when the trilogy is read close together. This certainly is not Catton's fault but is a necessary by-product of the publisher's desire to satisfy two diverse audiences. This said, if you read these books sequentially and in close proximity to each other as I did, skimming those parts that become noticeably redundant in this, the third book, will likely yield a better experience.The organizational comment aside, the history that Mr. Catton narrates which is unique to the period this book covers, from Fredericksburg to the war's conclusion, is first rate. I found Catton's analysis of Grant's Vicksburg campaign, Rosecrans and Grant's central Tennessee struggles and the Chancellorsville through Petersburg operations particularly instructive. The maps are excellent and materially aid the narrative. Catton's continuing analysis of the primary participants, Lincoln, Davis, Grant and Lee remain decidedly evenhanded. Seldom does Catton take individual participants to task but he does give Confederate General Braxton Bragg a bit of a well deserved keel hauling for his inexplicable conduct at Chickamauga and Chattanooga and I was delighted to see him give Union General George Thomas materially more credit for his actions subsequent to Chickamauga than other historians generally award. Moreover, Catton covers the smaller engagements of the war, like Morris Island, Charleston Harbor and Mobile, particularly well with insightful and detailed scrutiny.The closing chapters of this book are quite extraordinary. When published in 1965, Dr. Martin Luther King's Civil Rights movement was still in something of a developmental stage and, at the time, was quite controversial. These final chapters make very clear that the ongoing struggles of suffrage and equality were the direct result of the Civil War's unfinished business, bold assertions given the date of publication. The section on the coming Southern reconstruction is quite poignant and underscores that at war's end no one, North or South, understood the implications of the freedoms won for all Americans through the deaths of over 600,000 of the men who were engaged in this contest.America will always struggle with its future, seeking to make life better for all its citizens. We are not a country to pat ourselves on our backs for too long or spend too much time celebrating our achievements. We are never satisfied with the status quo. We consistently look to the future, seeking to reinvent a better version of ourselves.Reaching for the future is what America is all about. Mr. Catton understood that and his ending to this book and the trilogy is not to be missed."},{"Title":"Never Call Retreat","review":"Don;t be confused by the name of the new fiction by Mssrs. Gingrich et al - using this name was wrong, but well, that is to be expected. Catton's multi-volume history of the Civil Wat, when combined with Shelby Foote's is all anyone who is not a \\"buff\\" ever needs to read. Catton provides a macro and micro view of the war in a balance way -- he does not write as elegantly as Foote but his writing is relentless in its depiction of the growing strength of Union leadership and capabilities and, after a period of time, the inevitability of Union victory. This movement from the battlefield to the overall conflct is the best approach if you are hoping to read just one or two treatments of the Civil War."},{"Title":"Never Call Retreat","review":"For THE CENTENNIAL HISTORY OF THE CIVIL WAR--Bruce Catton's superbly written trilogy--NEVER CALL RETREAT is the concluding volume. It starts with the battles of Gettysburg and Vicksburg, and ends with Lee's surrender and a tidying up of the remaining rebels.I am not an authority on the Civil War, but besides this trilogy I have read James M. McPherson's Pulitzer-winning BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM (a single book, though a thick one) and Shelby Foote's classic CIVIL WAR (a lengthy trilogy). So if you are interested in plunging into the Civil War beyond what you will get from a historical atlas or an illustrated history, which of these three do I recommend? This CENTENNIAL trilogy by Bruce Catton.McPherson takes a long time to get into the war, and though his preliminary material about the causes of the war is informative, it will probably bore many readers. Foote devotes only a few pages to preliminaries--he gives sketches on, Jefferson Davis and Abraham Lincoln, the two commanders in chief--but he focuses so very much on battles that many readers will become tired of battles before they reach the end.Like BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM, Catton's first volume, THE COMING FURY, does take a long time to get into the war. But McPherson's book begins around 1850. Catton's story begins in 1860, closer to the war and with the war always teetering on the brink, keeping readers hopeful that it will not happen (even though they know it WILL happen). That adds an element of foreboding suspense.Each of Catton's three books, at least in hardcover, has excellent maps, and each has footnotes, bibliography, and index. None has photos, however; so I advise accompanying your reading with something like THE CIVIL WAR: AN ILLUSTRATED HISTORY by Ward, Burns, and Burns.Though this CENTENNIAL HISTORY is not truly a comprehensive account of the Civil War, it is a reasonably full one. And for what it omits--raids by Quantrill and Moseby, some battles, some naval action, and some other information that is not critical--it redeems itself with impressive prose and penetrating truth. McPherson and Foote are topnotch Civil War historians, and none of these three authors waves a flag for the North or the South. Still, Bruce Catton is a notch above."},{"Title":"Never Call Retreat","review":"I picked up a \\"vintage\\" paperback from 1967 in great shape.

It has clear, concise diagrams, explanations and ways to problem solve for each exercise, so that even a novice rider or beginning instructor could easily understand the exercises and the reasons for them. We were memebers of US Pony Club growing up and one of our primary focuses around horses was and is always safety. The author offers very helpful ways to deal with possible problems/outcomes during the exercises so that not just the &quot;how&quot; is covered, but the &quot;why&quot; as well. When instructing novice riders or children, this approach is particularly helpful. For someone schooling horses on their own, these ideas are most helpful in creating a positive experience for both horse and rider.

The style and insights into Victorian England is more a result of intuition than study. The heavier topics don't encroach on the pleasant plot, making W&D; a more shallow affair than it should be. While I would hardly put Mrs. Gaskell in the same class as Austen, there are some similarities. The style is very readable, while not quite a page-turner. The plot is fresh and fleshed out, as are most of the characters. There is a tendency towards caricature, but the fine portraits of Molly Gibson, her father, and the Hamleys more than make up for the others. This is where Gaskell and Austen part company. Gaskell doesn't have quite the ear for nuances or the skill of pen, often repeating phrases and including too many allusions to then-contemporary sources for almost-inside-jokes. The writing seems less polished because of these unnecessary distractions.For those interested in Victorian times, the novel provides a pleasant, graceful look into the lives of country folk and gentry without getting into the nitty-gritty of Eliot or Dickens. And, unfortunately, there isn't quite the depth and range of the latter authors that gives you a real taste of all the amazing and terrible lives of common Victorians. It's a light classic, easy to read and engaging enough to take on your commute, but for a deeper view of country life, try George Eliot or Thomas Hardy. And as I understand it, W&D; was a departure from Gaskell's usual topics, so maybe her earlier works will have that combination of readability with a less pretty look at society."},{"Title":"Wives and Daughters","review":"There are striking resemblances between Jane Austen's Mansfield Park and this novel. Mansfield Park is my least favorite book of Austen's for the reason that the lead character is, in my opinion, weak and all-too humble. You will find both Molly Gibson (heroine of this book) and Fanny Price (heroine of Mansfield Park) to be admiringly unwavering in their morals, however they are boring and uninteresting characters to read (so so sorry, I am a MAJOR Austen fan, and I appreciate both of these novels for other things).Molly Gibson goes to live with some friends for a time (briefer than Fanny's stay in MP). There she meets the second-born son who becomes her mentor and comfort and a brother/sister relationship forms. This gentleman is above her \\"station\\" and has no real prospects at becoming wealthy enough to consider marrying her. Another more dazzling, beautiful, and outspoken/outgoing woman enters the picture and wins his heart. Ultimately, this woman is undeserving of him. In the mean time, Molly's sisterly-like affection changes and it is evident to the reader how much she adores him. The only thing that makes this novel more interesting and a little different is the way it ended. I won't spoil that.In summary, it was okay. As okay as \\"been there, done that\\" feels. :o)"},{"Title":"Wives and Daughters","review":"I just recently discovered the novels of Elizabeth Gaskell.

Very interesting book!"},{"Title":"Wives and Daughters","review":"I read the book because I enjoyed the BBC movie so much, and with each page I read I enjoyed it more. Having been written omnisciently gave much insight into the characters, I felt. At times there would be much expounding without dialogue but Gaskell managed to make it all interesting. I enjoyed her extreme intelligence. I learned a lot about the British from reading it which although that wasn't the reason I would pick to read a book, I thoroughly enjoyed learning so much because at the same time it was such a pleasant read. The characters and plot have been mentioned in other reviews here and they're right on; Gaskell's ability to write about the people who aren't that likeable in a sympathetic way, especially through the mind of the main character, Molly. I didn't care that I knew from almost the beginning that Roger Hamley would end up with Molly even though he was in love with Cynthia, although I like stories with surprises...this didn't need that tactic, it was so good. I didn't want the novel to end. My favorite book of all time. I've read Eyre, Dickens etc. but they didn't make me as happy a reader as Gaskell. This author put me on a quest to read her books and hopefully some others similar; have just begun a Trollope book. This probably wasn't a very good review but I'm just so happy to find literature I'm crazy about. I wondered, had Gaskell finished writing the book, if Molly actually would have ended up with Roger...I imagine so, but it's fun to imagine something else might have happened."},{"Title":"Wives and Daughters","review":"Elizabeth Gaskell's last novel is often considered her masterpiece. \\"Wives and Daughters\\" captures life in an 1830's English village in a superb domestic drama that mixes humor and social commentary.Molly Gibson is the daughter of the village doctor, motherless and just coming of age. When her father decides to remarry, she stays temporarily with the family of Squire Hambley. There, she becomes part of the family, including building relationships with the Squire's sons Osborne and Roger. Mr. Gibson marries a widowed school teacher, Mrs. Kirkpatrick, who has her own daughter, Cynthia, who is Molly's age.Molly finds her new mother to be a vain, manipulative social climber, while the beautiful Cynthia is a talented flirt who seems to attract the attention of every male in the neighborhood, including Molly's favorite, Roger Hambley. The honest and dutiful Molly repeatedly finds herself trapped between her loyalties and her desires, until Cynthia's follies threaten to ruin both of them.\\"Wives and Daughters\\" is a slow-roller, but readers are likely to appreciate Mrs. Gaskell's patient building of characters and plot. Her characters are especially remarkable for being fully rounded and sympathetic, even the ones the reader is meant to dislike. Mrs. Gaskell died just before completing the novel, but a final note indicates the obvious destination. \\"Wives and Daughters\\" is very highly recommended to fans of Elizabeth Gaskell and her excellent novels."},{"Title":"Wives and Daughters","review":"I love this book because it is written with such a level of complexity, depth and sensitivity that you begin to really feel for the characters. There...moreI love this book because it is written with such a level of complexity, depth and sensitivity that you begin to really feel for the characters.There are some very touching scenes in this book that were just amazingly written. By and large, this book has to do with older teenage girls and the same basic conflicts that they have today with their parents around opening their big mouths in public, behaving appropriately and dating.The book also addresses the class system in England - trades, landed gentry, titled gentry - and, of course - the \\"help\\" or laborers who have virtually no voice in the world of the other three classes. There's also a real sense of the striving to belong and concern with perceptions and image/appearance.And of course - there's a whole level of being \\"real\\" and being \\"good\\" being more the same thing than in the world of striving. I really quite enjoyed the BBC production of the book and I like the way the edited the story to fit it to format, really keeping very close to the most important parts of the story."},{"Title":"Wives and Daughters","review":"This book reminded me of Mansfield Park by Jane Austen, but it wasn't nearly as good. Molly, a quiet and shy young lady who never asserts herself, reminded me of Fanny while Roger seemed like Edward, the second son of an important man who falls for the wrong woman. Despite the similarities, this book was very different from Austen's work, and it wasn't nearly as good. It was looong, and the parts in between the action were, well, rather boring. I didn't enjoy this book nearly as much as I had hoped, but I did finish it. However, if you love Jane Austen, you may want to try this book since it is written similarly."},{"Title":"Wives and Daughters","review":"This is a wonderful book! What a find. It was a rare treat and a free treat, to boot! The characters are well done. Gaskell is compared to Jane Austen and no doubt they appeal to the same reader. But I particularly enjoyed the strong female main character in this book and in North and South. Gaskell Molly (Wives and Daughters) and Margaret (North and South) are somehow more substantial individuals even than some Austen ladies. Do see theThe Elizabeth Gaskell Collection (Wives and Daughters / Cranford / North and South)which Amazon sells. They are delightful."},{"Title":"Wives and Daughters","review":"Molly Gibson has always been satisfied to live with just her father in the quiet country town of Hollingford. As Molly tends to Squire Hamley's sick wife, she becomes closer to the Hamleys than she has been to anyone, except her father. However, her life turns upside down when her father decides to remarry. The former Mrs Kirkpatrick takes over her life as she tries to infuse some of the new styles of the society into the quiet lives of the Gibsons. When her daughter, the beautiful, Cynthia comes to stay with them, Molly forms a close bond with her new step-sister, which would have been closer still if Cynthia did not insist on being so secretive about her past. On the other hand, the situation at Hamley Hall seems to be going from bad to worse.Before reading this book, I had just seen the BBC adaption of North And South by the same author, which I loved immensely. Still, I doubted that I would like reading any of Mrs Gaskell's novels. After reading Wives And Daughters I stand corrected. I have never enjoyed reading a classic as much as I did this one. The writer draws the reader into the story and binds them to it till the very end. While reading Wives And Daughter I was surprised to notice some similarities in our time and theirs even though this book is set almost a century and half before. The craze to be dressed in the latest fashion, the gossip about who is going about with whom and relishing in the scandals involving other people- maybe these things will always remain the same no matter what the time period. Other than that it was interesting to see the characters talking about inventions and discoveries that were yet to be. This book is set in a time when many changes were impending to happen, both in the scientific community and the aristocratic one. The effects of these impending changes on both the communities are beautifully interwoven into the book by the author.When we first meet Molly she is just twelve and with the all the innocence of a child living a simple and happy life with her father. The next time we meet her, the time has fast-forwarded and Molly has become a young woman of seventeen yet apparently still as innocent and nave as a child under the protected care of her father. However, we see her change slowly into a responsible woman after her step-sister, Cynthia comes in her life. Molly becomes the one who cleans up the mess created by Cynthia. Maybe I would have liked Molly to be a little more assertive. Still, she is on the whole a likable character. Her willingness to sacrifice for the betterment of others is indeed touching. As for the other characters, they were perfect in their own ways. At first I had an immense liking for Cynthia. Her charming nature with all her little imperfections seemed adorable to me at first. However, her callous attitude towards those who cared for her made me dislike her by the end. As for Mrs Hyacinth Gibson, her histrionics were entertaining to read about even though she was too self-obsessed to be liked much.The only thing amiss in this book is that the author was unable to complete it before her death. Even though the ending as thought by Elizabeth Gaskell is written by her editor, still it was not the same without her beautiful description to accompany it. I must mention a little warning for those who don't like to read long books. This book is pretty lengthy. However, it is still a book that no one should skip a chance of reading.Favorite Quotes:\\"Nay, nay!\\" said the Squire. \\"It's not so easy to break one's heart. Sometimes I've wished it were. But one has to go on living--\`all the appointed days,' as is said in the Bible.\\"\\"I say Gibson, we're old friends, and you're a fool if you take anything I say as an offense. Madam your wife and I didn't hit it off the only time I ever saw her.

Delinquent youths and difficult step-parents were as much a part of the past as they are of the present. Anyone who ever had a stepmother can relate to what Molly goes through with hers. Molly is an engaging heroine, sweet and backward but always virtuous and pure. She is a beautiful role model for readers young and old. I loved this book; it was easier to read then the Bronte sisters."},{"Title":"Wives and Daughters","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The story was very engaging, and the characters were all so interesting and well-developed. But this particular version has so many spelling/punctuation errors that it was quite distracting.I realize that it was a free version, so I am not upset about all the mistakes, but I would recommend investing a few dollars in another version if you do not have the patience to try to figure out what the words are probably supposed to be."},{"Title":"Wives and Daughters","review":"In her last novel, Gaskell avoided her usual urban milieu to concentrate instead on the wonderful parochial doings of a country village in the mid-Victorian period. Although she left the novel without its very last chapter before she died, this should not dissuade you from reading the novel: you'll know by the end exactly where Gaskell was going to finish the book and what would've happened to all the characters.WIVES AND DAUGHTERS is frequently compared to Austen, but it is very different; the comedy and social observation is marvelous, but there's a greater sense of despair here more akin to MIDDLEMARCH. Hyacinth is without question the single most complex and engrossing character Gaskell ever created, and despite her menadacity and her manipulativeness you can't help but feel fond of her in spite of her less attractive qualities. Her daughter Cynthia is nearly as fine a character, and the others are also topnotch. A delightful read."},{"Title":"Wives and Daughters","review":"What is up with all the reviews that compare Mrs. Gaskell unfavorably to Jane Austen? Jane Austen is wonderful, but she works in miniature, and even her major characters are often one-dimensional. Who can really visualize Mr. Darcy? It is true that Mrs. Gaskell can be as satirical as Austen when she wants to be, but even her most vain or vicious characters are human beings, with complex feelings and good impulses as well as bad. And then there's the incredible sweep of this novel, the way in which Gaskell manages to portray an entire community without losing her lightness of touch. The only novel I can think of to compare this to is Eliot's Middlemarch, and I'm still not sure which I think is better.There are so many instances in which Gaskell could have taken the easy way out and didn't. Take the two pairs of characters, Molly and Cynthia and Roger and Osborne. Osborne is thought to be more brilliant than Roger; Cynthia is more beautiful and less moral than Molly. It would be so easy for Gaskell to make Cynthia the evil stepsister, and Osborne the dissolute brother you love to hate. Yet Cynthia and Osborne are both sympathetic despite their faults, and both are even more complex, more finely drawn, than Roger and Molly. There are plenty of novels in which a character exerts a fascination over everyone he/she meets, and usually the fascination is completely lost on the reader. Cynthia has this fascination, and for once it is completely convincing. We understand why Molly can't help loving Cynthia, even while Cynthia is blithely taking Roger away from her. And Cynthia is self-aware; she knows that she can't bear to have people not think well of her, and she knows this is a fault. When Molly has learned Cynthia's secret and risked her own reputation to help her, Cynthia is grateful but cannot keep herself from doing what she always does and drawing away from Molly. Mrs. Kirkpatrick is another beautifully drawn character -- she seems poised at the beginning to become the evil stepmother from a fairy tale, but she is simply weak, vain, and not very bright. She has every intention of being a wonderful stepmother, but she is too shallow and self-centered to enter into Molly's feelings or any one else's. She tries so hard to please, and her panics when she's talked herself into a corner are both funny and pathetic.I know I've said a lot about Cynthia, but I don't agree with the reviewer who said that Molly seemed one-dimensional in comparison. Molly has fewer problems; she's a pretty normal, intelligent, awkward girl with a happy childhood behind her, but that doesn't mean she's boring. She has a pretty vivid emotional life, although she doesn't always admit the source of her feelings, and she's very shrewd.I am amazed by the people who said this book needed editing or cutting down. This is probably the most nearly perfect book I have read - I do not mean by this that it is the best - and the one glaring imperfection can't be helped. I do think, though, that if it has to end prematurely at least it ends on an excellent sentence."},{"Title":"Wives and Daughters","review":"Having read and reread Austen and the Bronte sisters, and looking to branch out to new authors while still staying in the general time period and genre, my sister recommended Wives and Daughters. I had never heard of Elizabeth Gaskell---but what a treasure to discover! My husband bought me the book for my birthday, worried that because it was an unfinished novel I would be disappointed. Hardly! I couldn't put the book down. I fell in love with all of Hollingford and its people, especially young Molly Gibson, as constant in her character as Cynthia is changeable but both equally likeable and more importantly, believable. Mrs. Gaskell was able to show us where the novel was headed or, I should say, where Molly was headed matrimonially, and though it is something to mourn that the conclusion could not be written in Mrs. Gaskell's own words, I would still recommend the read. AND the DVD which is so true to the book (Justine Waddell makes a perfect Molly), even while leaving out Molly's extended illness toward the end. Definitely one I recommend."},{"Title":"Wives and Daughters","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book and I highly recommend it to any one who wants to read a well written and sweet novel. The principal character is Molly Gibson who is the daughter of a small town doctor. The story is mainly about what happens with Molly and those she loves when her father remarries and his new wife and stepdaughter come to live with him and Molly. The story is simple, but at the same time enchanting. Mrs. Gaskell's excellent writing will keep you reading even though some parts of the story are full with details and past stories of the characters. But at the same time, it is these background stories and details which allow the reader to really understand who each character is in the story and how they feel. So I don't don't agree with those who sugget that the book needs editing.The novel is full with very interesting characters and all are presented in a way you'll end up feeling close to them, and caring for them. Even Mrs. Gibson and Lady Cumnor, who are mean and selfish, will claim your sympathy at some point because the author has the ability to present her characters not as good or bad, but just as human. She has an incredible way of describing regular people. And only this characteristic makes the book very enjoyable.The book is long and does not have an ending... nonetheless, it is so beautiful!!!... I really recommend this novel because you'll never get bored. Even more, you'll learn to enjoy each of the things and stories that are going on in Hollingford (the little town where Molly lives)!. And although this is not an \\"addictive\\" reading, there are some parts in the novel where you cannot stop reading and for a hundred pages you won't be able to put it down. I think this is a novel to enjoy, not to read in an afternoon.The fact that this novel is unfinished could be a drawback for some people, but the story is almost complete and you can tell what will happen at the end. Besides, all novels end at one point, and no matter how much the author tells us about the story, we readers always want to know more. So, I think that you can easily imagine what will happen in the last chapter in the same way that you can imagine what will happen with Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy at the end of Pride Prejudice (even though Jane Austen never wrote about that).I agree that there is some similarity between this author and Jane Austen because both authors have the same sweetness in their writing. However, Mrs. Gaskell provides more details about the setting and the characters of the novel. So, all and all I would recommend this novel to the Austen readers and to all of those who enjoy romantic and classic novels."},{"Title":"Wives and Daughters","review":"It's interesting that another reviewer here recommends this novel on the strength of its Austen appeal. Me, I never cared for Jane Austen. But Gaskell's book is subtle and brilliant and amazing on so many levels that a little, Austen-like parody is only another flavor. Molly Gibson's moving through her life and the lives of those near to her is solid in every way that literature must be; yet it is in the stunningly realistic depictions of relations between the characters - her father, her stepmother, her stepsister, the Hamley brothers - that Mrs. Gaskell reveals her genius. She refuses to settle for easy reactions and expected responses. If at times her people suffer a bit from a Victorian eye's love of form, her brilliance will allow for no false note. As absolute evidence we see the evolution of Hyacinth Gibson's role in the family, the desperate wrongness of it, perfectly muted to the compromises life brings forth in all such situations. This single character, vain and selfish, inconsiderate but not monstrous, is as real a human being as I have ever encountered in literature of the 19th century, or this one. I conclude with saying that, having been introduced to this woman's work, George Eliot has had to share her place in my mind as the preeminent female author of that century."},{"Title":"Wives and Daughters","review":"\\"Wives and Daughters\\" is a novel of provincial life, set in the small town of Hollingford. Some commentators have identified this with Mrs Gaskell's own home town, Knutsford in Cheshire, but references to the Malvern Hills and to its proximity to Birmingham suggest that it is located further south, probably in Worcestershire. The action takes place several decades before it was written in 1864-65, although the exact time-frame is difficult to determine exactly. Some topical references, such as to Catholic emancipation which took place in 1829, suggest that the book is set in the late 1820s and early 1830s, but other factors suggest a somewhat later date. (The barrister Mr Kirkpatrick is referred to as a Q.C., not a K.C. as he would have been before the accession of Queen Victoria in 1837).The main character is Molly Gibson, the daughter of the local doctor. Molly is befriended by Mr Hamley, the local squire, and his wife, who see her almost as a substitute daughter (their own daughter having died in childhood). Molly falls deeply in love with Roger, the Hamleys' academically brilliant younger son, but he sees her only as a friend, being infatuated with Molly's stepsister Cynthia. (Dr Gibson is a widower who has remarried a widow with a daughter around the same age as Molly). Roger is a scientific explorer who travels to Africa in search of new species of animals and plants; his character may have been inspired by the exploits of the likes of Charles Darwin and Alfred Russell Wallace. (\\"The Origin of Species\\" had been published only a few years earlier).The book is clearly influenced by the work of Jane Austen (at times it reads like a pastiche), not only in its subject-matter but also in the way in which Mrs Gaskell tries to draw ironical, satirical pen-portraits of her characters. Cynthia, for example, is beautiful but shallow and fickle, and her mother, Hyacinth Kirkpatrick Gibson, is hypocritical, manipulative, conceited and snobbish. Dr Gibson is generally portrayed as a sensible, level-headed man, so it is not easy to understand why he should have taken such an obnoxious woman as his second wife.The Austen novel with which \\"Wives and Daughters\\" has the greatest affinities is \\"Mansfield Park\\". In both books the central male character (Roger/Edmund) is the younger son of an upper-class family, overshadowed by a flashier elder brother (Osborne/Tom), but steady, reliable and decent. In both books he is loved patiently and in secret by a quiet, demure girl (Molly/Fanny) but becomes infatuated with another woman, beautiful but flighty and superficial (Cynthia/Mary). In both cases the patient girl's devotion is rewarded with marriage to the man she loves; Mrs Gaskell died before she could write the final chapters of \\"Wives and Daughters\\", leaving it unfinished, but there can be little doubt that this is the ending that she intended. Mrs Gaskell left what may have been a deliberate hint that Austen's book was her inspiration; the Hamleys refer to Molly as \\"another Fanny\\", that being the name of their deceased daughter.I have some sympathy with those readers who preferred Cynthia, who for all her obvious character flaws is at least a rounded human being, to the idealised but insipid Molly. (But then, I am one of those who hoped that \\"Mansfield Park\\" would end with Edmund marrying Mary rather than Fanny, surely Austen's dullest heroine). Mrs Gaskell seemed to try so hard to make Molly good that she forgot to make her interesting.Some of the most interesting scenes in the book were those involving Roger's older brother Osborne and his clandestine marriage to a French nursery maid. Osborne needs to keep this marriage a secret because his autocratic father, who has set his heart on a brilliant, financially advantageous match for his son and heir, would not welcome a daughter-in-law who was foreign, a Catholic and a former servant. I felt, however, that this potentially interesting theme was wasted by being relegated to a sub-plot, and wished that Mrs Gaskell had paid more attention to Osborne and Aimee and less to the Roger/Molly/Cynthia triangle.At well over 600 pages this is a long book, much longer than any of Austen's, being a product of the system of publishing by weekly or monthly instalments, a system which had the effect of inflating by a considerable amount the average length of a novel during this period. Dickens also used this method of publishing, but although he was occasionally guilty of padding his books he was generally able to turn the system to his advantage by producing plots of ingenious complexity and finishing each episode at a dramatic point in the narrative. The plot of \\"Wives and Daughters\\", however, is too slender to support such a weighty book, and at times I found it frustrating as the action was slowed down to a standstill by yet another lengthy and discursive conversation a propos (to use a typically Gaskellian phrase) of nothing. (The book was successfully adapted as a TV series a few years ago, possibly because the dramatist was able to keep the basic plot but to prune out the duller passages) There were characters whose appearances I learned to dread, particularly the Misses Browning, a tedious pair of garrulous spinster sisters. Even the satire at the expense of Hyacinth, amusing at first, gradually became repetitive; Mrs Gaskell seems to have lacked Austen's gift for playful irony.Elizabeth Gaskell is often regarded today as a novelist of the early Victorian industrial North, writing social-realist novels which tackled the problems of poverty, unemployment and labour relations (\\"Mary Barton\\", \\"North and South\\") and unmarried motherhood (\\"Ruth\\"). In \\"Wives and Daughters\\" she tried to move into Austen's territory, love and marriage among the provincial upper and upper-middle classes, but my view is that her gifts lay much more in the direction of social realism."},{"Title":"Wives and Daughters","review":"'Wives and Daughters' was this month's choice for our book club. We all commented that it took us a long time to read but everyone appreciated the fine writing and skilful characterisation. We found Molly a delight and Hyacinth one of the most delicious 'love to hate' characters. The men in our group thought this was a 'woman's book', well written but too slow and without enough action to interest them. We wanted to know why we call the author 'Mrs Gaskell', when we don't refer to 'Miss Austen', or 'Miss Bronte' We would recommend this as a good read."},{"Title":"Wives and Daughters","review":"Sadly unfinished, in consequence of Gaskell's death, \\"Wives and Daughters\\" breaks off at the end of chapter 60; It is ultimately unsatisfying because of this, even though the fate of the characters is already clearly marked out; it is a major disapointment not to be able to read Gaskell's ending, which she would have done so charmingly!The whole novel can at any rate be called charming, and comletely captivating to the reader. Elizabeth Gaskell weaves a tale of a small county, full of life and detail and greatness at every turn. The characterization is nearly perfect, in my opinion, and would have achieved a greater perfection had it only been a finished novel. The story is one of the coming of age of Molly Gibson, and in this \\"everyday story\\" of every day domesticity, Gaskell follows and captures perfectly the little incidents in Molly's life. The small things that make her happy, the minor tragedies, and her concealed, though very real love for Roger Hamley, which is in fact one of the most realistic and true portrayals of love I have ever encountered in a work of fiction.This is not a masterpiece, surely, but it is an important last(though unfinished) novel of a very great talent;Elizabeth Gaskell. It is long, but still very readable; and I would recommend it to anyone who is studying victorian literature. There are also great lessons to be learned from it by the aspiring writer. Not to be missed!"},{"Title":"Wives and Daughters","review":"I confess that when I got the book I thought I had quite a daunting task ahead of me -- I didn't know it was going to be so thick! However, it was surprisingly easy reading, and I finished it in less than a week. The pace is slow, but not tiring. We really feel for poor dear Molly Gibson, who does her best for others without thinking too much about herself or her feelings. But good things come for those who deserve it, and no one deserves more a happy ending than Molly. It is very unfortunate, however, that Ms. Gaskell passed away before finishing the book. Of course we know that Molly and Roger are perfect for each other and should end up together -- most of the time the end in romantic novels is predictable enough; the getting there is the most important and often satisfying, and of that, we have been deprived. The last few chapters that Ms. Gaskell did write are very sweet, as Roger starts to realize his true feelings for Molly. The fact that Mr. Gibson (who, by the way, is a wonderful character) did not allow Roger to see Molly before leaving again for Africa was certainly a ploy to make the conclusion a little longer, and finish up in a final chapter that never came. And that is a real shame."},{"Title":"Wives and Daughters","review":"I just could not seem to finish this book! It was so long and covered, so much of nothing but a little bit of everything. Very sweet tale, with wit and good taste, I'd wager to say in the same vein of writing as Jane Austen. Yet Jane could tell her tale a bit quicker than this, for such a simple tale of English country life in the 1860's it is. Enjoyable and engrossing, the story is told around the doctors daughter, and the events that occur with her fathers remarriage to a rather shallow former governess and schoolteacher. Molly Gibson, the main character, is an upright citizen and honest soul, after her fathers example. Watch for the predictable love triangle between Molly and her new startlingly attractive stepsister, Cynthia. I was tired of the tedious overuse of the phrase, &quot;tete a tete&quot; but intrigued by several characters. Gaskells characters, such as Lady Harriet and the Sisters Browning, are fleshed out and their personalities pursued with familiarity. Don't you know someone just like Hamley of Hamley, today in 2001? Or maybe the new Mrs Gibson reminds of you of one of your friends? This is what you can look forward to: familiarity and the historicity of all sorts of little tidbits; how &quot;the apple of his eye&quot; was considered a vulgar term, for example. Please read if you are coming off of a Jane Austen high and are desperate; but see if you can find an abridged version, if one exists, for it is sorely needed! PS I got this book to read along with the PBS show currently running. The movie doesn't do it justice, but intrigued me enough to literally hunt for this book! Go for it!"},{"Title":"Wives and Daughters","review":"I don't know why everyone keeps comparing Elizabeth Gaskell with Jane Austen. It's not like they are not two different people that write completely different. Both having unique talents that were worthy of being published. At that time, it wasn't easy. They didn't publish what they thought was garbage, like they do today.I ran across the mini-series, on Prime and loved it. It prompted me to download all of her books. The characters are all special in their own right. There are no characters that don't belong in this story. Even though it was unfinished, at the time of Ms. Gaskell's death, it did seem to take a long time to get to the end, but that was probably my impatients, because the entire story is enjoyable and it is easy to get sucked into it for hours and not realize it. Even characters that were not carrying the story were mentioned enough to understand why they were included.Definately worth the time"},{"Title":"Wives and Daughters","review":"Harkens to the days of Austen-ness.

I loved the story, the characters especially molly, so loveable and sweet. I bought the book after I saw the series. The book was her last one before she died, so it wasn't completed. The book is great although lengthy, but wonderfully written. I found it somewhat hard to like cynthia and her mother, I didn't really like the way they treated molly it was kinda a cinderella thing but not really. I feel like cynthia and her mother take advantage of how kind molly is and she is caught up in the middle of the problems."},{"Title":"Wives and Daughters","review":"Many years ago,I discovered Mrs. Gaskell.Her novels are simply marvelous.It is not fair to compare her to Jane Austen.

They were slow and trudged along. I decided to keep with a saying learned from one of my high school teachers, &#34;Give a book at least three chapters before you give up on it.&#34; After three chapters I became invested in the story. This reminds me of Jane Austen without ever trying to be her. There's delightful insight into the manners and expectations of a bygone era. The characters become alive with their struggles - they seem real and not artificially created."},{"Title":"Wives and Daughters","review":"The characters are cleverly depicted through their conversations which reveal both flaws and attributes, which are often amusing.

Highly recommend this to anyone who loves a good love story and is intrigued by relationships within a blended family."},{"Title":"Wives and Daughters","review":"the story is about little molly gibson, who's mother died when she was a child. Molly has just reached an age where a mother is a necessity so her father, the country doctor, partly for her and partly for himself, re-marries a widow with a daughter about molly's age. The new Mrs. Gibson turns out to be a silly, fashionable woman, who is more interested in finding well-to-do husbands for the girls and giving herself airs then maintaining a respectable doctors household. And there seems to be some unspoken regret on the part of the Gibson family. Cynthia, her daughter, is a strikingly beautiful girl who loves attention from men, and gets a great deal of it. But unlike her mother, Cynthia is smart enough to know her faults. Little Molly is a steady, kind girl who loves Cynthia-and thinks her as free of fault as herself- and likes her new step mother as much as anyone ever could.The trouble begins when Molly falls in love with the local squire's son, and the local squire's son falls in love with the bewitching Cynthia. Problems escalate as the gossipy town stumbles onto a mystery connected with one of Cynthia's past conduct at a boarding school in France. One she refuses to tell. And it becomes apparent that there is more then one person who thinks that he is going to marry the beautiful Cynthia.The story seemed like it was 90% done, and then the author died. Though the last few chapters aren't written, most of the characters have reached there end, there is no doubt where the remaining few are going. I prefer that the story stopped where It did. The ending seemed just fine."},{"Title":"Wives and Daughters","review":"If &quot;Wives and Daughters&quot; was made into a college drinking game, the young men and women playing the game would soon be drunk if they took shots every time the phrase &quot;tete-a-tete&quot; appeared or every time Molly Gibson's eyes brimmed with tears.Those are the more annoying redundancies, but there are others. In addition, there are frequent inconsistancies of dates, facts and figures which led me to believe that this book was truly a first draft left untouched by any editor out of some sort of respect for the deceased author.My final complaint is that the story rambles in so many spots that I had to skim in order to get to the meat of the story.Enough of my complaints. Now praise: I think I have not found another book that leaves so full an impression of the personalities for each main character. Namely, Cynthia and her mother, Mrs. Gibson, are so well done - they are unlikable, selfish women with so many faults and annoying tendancies. Yet, they do not grate against the reader. In fact, I found events that revolved around either women very fascinating and Ms. Gaskell's skill in demonstrating their manipulative, coy ways was very adept.The book was not finished, due to Ms. Gaskell's untimely death, but we are satisfied with how we assume the story will end.One must truly have patience to read through this, sorting out the gems.

I guess they all are, really, in the novels of the day. As much as I enjoy reading about Victorian, pre-Victorian and Edwardian times, the novels really have a hard time holding up for me, when the characters are so cliched. In all of the books of this era, it seems, the \\"good\\" people enjoy fresh air and long walks...if they don't enjoy these things, you can be sure they are not \\"good\\" people, or if they enjoy them only in moderation, like stepsister Cynthia, they will have \\"issues\\" to \\"overcome\\" in order to been seen as good. Anbd what is with everyone getting sick and/or dying if they hear bad news? I know there were tons of fatal illnesses in those days, but it seems as though everyone falls ill whenever they are the slightest bit unhappy, Molly included. In some books, the clothing had a lot to answer for, but I don't know that Molly was being squeezed into tight corsets on a daily basis.Jane Austen was the same way about the fresh air and long walks syndrome...the good honest folk thrived on these elements, while the selfish, ill-mannered ones scorned these fine pursuits. A funny way to judge people...Anyway, \\"Wives and Daughters\\" is a good story, if you can bear the priggish, self-righteous characters and can also bear knowing exactly who Molly will end up marrying. Also, be prepared for little bits and pieces of the typical racial prejudices of the day when the hero goes off to Africa..."},{"Title":"Wives and Daughters","review":"I watched the television adaptation of \\"Wives and Daughters\\" and loved it so I decided to read the book on kindle (it was free, does not get better than that). I was glad I did since I got to understand the characters so much better. In my opinion,the only downside to the novel was the ending. I'm glad I saw the television adaptation first since it gave me a sense of closure even though the book leaves the reader to make your own conclusions as to what would have happened between Molly and Roger.

This may be Gaskell's wittiest book. She let's her character's tell the story through their own selfish, or honest, or naiive, or manipulative actions. The beautiful and brilliant Cynthia is really the star of this tale-her self-centered mother is the machinating demon, wrekeing havoc with domestic tyrany.A handsome, successful widower with daughter marries a pretty, winning widow with daughter, and all hell breaks loose.

I ordered the book, expecting that the it would be even better. It really wasn't. (Better than the movie, I mean.)Amazingly, the movie stuck nearly exactly to the book, even down to entire dialogues, in some scenes, word for word. I'm glad I watched the movie version first -- it was superbly cast -- and the producers could not have found more perfect actors for the parts. Since I had seen the movie first, I enjoyed reading the book with the mental images of the movie characters, their personalities, voices, costumes and facial expressions -- which, for me, created an extra, richer dimension to my reading experience.Really, the movie's only deviation from the book was the ending. In the case of 'Wives and Daughters' however, nobody really knows the ending, because Elizabeth Gaskell's 'Wives and Daughters' is considered to be \\"incomplete\\". I'm not sure if author, Elizabeth Gaskell, died before 'Wives and Daughters' was published, or if she is thought to have abandoned the project. Whatever the case may be, I found the book's ending charming just as it was left by the author -- finished or not. In fact, I would argue that the book's ending was creatively inconclusive. It left a bit to the reader's imagination as to how everything turned out. A reader doesn't always require a definite \\"The End\\", with all the drama neatly tied up and concluded. Undoubtedly, the movie's producers felt they could interpret (or take a bit of artistic license with) the author's intended ending to the story, giving the movie a smoother conclusion. In my opinion, they did an admirable job!'Wives and Daughters' is a charming, wonderfully written story with rich characters -- highly recommend."},{"Title":"Wives and Daughters","review":"I wasn't that excited about reading \\"Wives and Daughters\\", since I'd just finished \\"North and South\\" by Mrs. Gaskell, and found it rather tedious. I was pleasantly surprised.Gaskell did a fabulous job drawing the characters in this book. Cynthia is one of the most skillfully crafted characters I have ever encountered. She's shallow and selfish, but also very kind and lovable -- and it's completely believable. All the others are very easy to accept as \\"real people\\" - something I don't encounter very often in victorian literature.It's a love story that becomes predictable early on, but the complexities along the way are fascinating. Molly finds herself in the middle of every scandal, although she has nothing to do with any of it. Her stepmother, who throws off phony aristocratic airs at every turn, is actually a very funny character rather than a villain. Though Molly has had to face many hurtful challenges, she never acts victimized. Though she struggles with the choices she has to make, she never loses her strength.It's sad that Gaskell didn't live to finish this book, but it's pretty much wrapped-up where she left off, so not much is lacking. Don't let that stop you from reading this book."},{"Title":"Wives and Daughters","review":"I received this book for Christmas, along with two Jane Austen novels. I read Austen's novels first and I liked them. I have just finished Elizabeth Gaskell's, Wives and Daughters and I loved it! This book portrays the lives of Molly Gibson and her step-sister, Cynthia Kirkpatrick as they grow up in the town of Hollingford. I thouroughly enjoyed this marvelous book and I would recommend it to anyone, especially Jane Austen lovers, for I think they will enjoy Wives and Daughters more then any of Austen's books, as I have done."},{"Title":"Wives and Daughters","review":"Mrs. Gaskell is the perfect author for avid Jane Austen fans. Here is humor, &quot;quiet suspense&quot;, and in-depth characterization. For those of us who like to lose ourselves in the bucolic life of daily 19th-century England, this book is a treat! Another similar title equally satisfying is &quot;Framley Parsonage&quot; by Anthony Trollope."},{"Title":"Wives and Daughters","review":"Having spent years absorbed with the works of the Brontes' I was a latecomer in accepting anything by a Unitarian Preacher's Victorian wife who was better known by the settled name of Mrs. Gaskell. I'm glad I proved my prejudice so wrong. It is probably noteworthy for any serious reader to become acquainted with the socio-history of the time. While Jane Austen (admittedly, an earlier writer) takes on the more acerbic tones of character assasination and the Brontes are more brutal in their emotional exhaustion Gaskell is subtle in her astute observation of the minute aspects of social comings and goings.The title, alone, is an intriguing insight into the sexual competition/tension. Children and their relationships with parents is definitely an underlying theme throughout the novel and offers a refreshing insight into the lack of predictability that might have been seen from earlier writers (eg, Austen, Burney etc) where heroine falls in love with hero (only eligible, upstanding and decent male in the plot). There are plenty of characthers in W&D; that are true to form, ie having blemishes, imperfections etc.The social significance of the novel should be underscored. There is a continuous reminder of the class struggle between 3 very different classes (and still excluding the working class). Differences between the sexes are emphasised and it could almost be seen as an early example of literary feminism. Molly Gipson's passion for learning (outside the traditional role) is an interesting take on the movement (and acceptance) of women within academic circles (ref, the BlueStockings). The scientific references would demonstrate the underlying Darwinian theories that would have been shaking Victorian society. Gossip was, as always, the brutal reminder of the petty lives that people lived and the strength of a bad reputation that could befall any 'lady'!I guess I could go on but I would recommend any reader to take a further examination of this book before dismissing it as simply 'one of the classics'......."},{"Title":"Wives and Daughters","review":"I have seen this novel recommended to lovers of Austen, but they may find themselves disappointed. Mrs. Gaskell was of an altogether different era than Austen, and compared to the latter author's lightness and elegant wit she downright oozes Victorian ponderousness. The story is a fairly simple one, revolving around a mere handful of characters, and hardly bears protraction to around 600 pages.A scheming, hypocritical stepmother tries to secure one of the sons of the local, impoverished squire for her own daughter, Cynthia. The younger son falls in love with the frivolous girl, but then sets off on a long scientific expedition to Africa with only a vague engagement settled, and Cynthia strangely indifferent to his adventures. Her stepsister Molly, meanwhile, is the one who has real feelings for him; she is also the one who soon delves beneath all the surfaces and discovers why the eldest son of the squire wasn't interested in marriage, and which secrets govern the whimsical behaviour of her stepsister. The marital ups and downs of Molly's father, a country doctor, and the occasional interference by the local grandees and the town gossips provide secondary plot material.The outcome is a foregone conclusion, looming large at an early stage - though ironically we never actually reach it, as death whisked the author away before she could pen the final one or two chapters. Her editor wrote an afterword revealing the unravelling of the plot as already sketched out by Gaskell.It takes some stamina to arrive there. After the first half, the narrative starts to drag, making obvious points over and over again, and deluging the reader with obsessive detail. Once Osborne Hamley's secret and fate have been revealed, it seems as if the author is groping her way towards the predictable end, not sure how to get there. Her predilection for inserting pedantic literary and biblical references at every turn also grows tiring soon enough (and makes an annotated edition a necessity).Despite all that, there is a general sense of charm; nor can it be denied that there are several well-rounded and believable characters in this book, squire Hamley and the new Mrs. Gibson the most successful among them (the former truly endearing, the latter, however, eventually degenerating into stereotype). For those with a taste for (upper) middle class life in 19th century in England this will hold interest, but I find it hard to believe in this novel as a work of genius, and it certainly doesn't compare favourably to major works by Austen or George Eliot."},{"Title":"Wives and Daughters","review":"Mollie Gibson, heroine of the this tale and sweet malleable ingenue, has her world thrown into disarray when her father, a respectable doctor marries again. The new Mrs Kirkpatrick is a strange mix of willfulness, snobbery and pride. She also comes with a grown daughter of Mollie's age for whom she feels a certain amount of unmotherly ambivalence - Hyacinth Kirkpatrick. Thus the title, 'Wives and Daughters' and the book is set up for complex interplay of these three lives.This novel reminds me in a superficial way of Austen's &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; - although Mollie is in a much better position than poor old Fanny. The relationship the new Mrs Gibson has with her daughter and with Mollie, and the wonderfully likeable but manipulative way Hyacinth ties everyone up in knots makes great fun reading. Like Mansfield Park though there is an edge of darkness behind it. In the midst of this all is Squre Hamley and his two sons, the Brilliant but rather idle Osborne, and the younger brother hard-working scientist Roger. Mollie is treated as a confidante by almost everyone in the book a painful situation, and when Roger (whom Mollie secretly loves) falls for Hyacinth and both wish to confide in length about the other. Unfortunately Gaskell died before she could finish this book - however it does end at a stage where you know that there is likely to be a happy ending."},{"Title":"Wives and Daughters","review":"Elizabeth Gaskell is one of my favorite authors. Her novel North and South is one of my favorite books of all time and one I read over and over. Wives and Daughters is also a favorite of mine. It has a different storyline than some of her other works. In this book human relationships takes the center stage. All kinds of relationships are described, father/daughter, husband/wife, mother/daughter, father/son and the relationships between children and their step-parents. All of her characters are honest, believable people and even though the times are much different I can find myself comparing relationships in this book to relationships in my own life.This book follows young Molly Gibson, a daughter of the country town's daughter. Mr Gibson is a widower and starts to feel that as Molly is growing into a young woman she could use the influence of a mother. He meets and marries an older woman who has her own daughter around Molly's age. Molly finds her situation unbearable until the arrival of her new sister Cynthia who becomes Molly's closest friend and sister. As Molly grows up she begins to see people differently and learns to take everyone for the people they are not what they seem. Intermixed into the story, is the family of Squire Hamley and their relationships with each other and the social environment of the day.There are some inconsistencies in the story, but it is important to note that this was Elizabeth Gaskell's last novel and she died before it could be completed. Despite of this fact the story is till fantastic, Molly is one of the most honest, kind hearted heroines in literature and the we get to follow her as she grows up to become an exceptional woman. Even though it is not finished it is a rare book to treasure."},{"Title":"Wives and Daughters","review":"This Serenity edition is full of errors in spelling and punctuation. I'm guessing that entire words are missing at some points. It provides no information regarding what text or texts were used as the basis of this edition. No wonder the publisher declares that, \\"This book is presented as is, without any warranties (implied or otherwise) as to the accuracy of the production, text or translation.\\"If you want to read a decent edition of Gaskell's novel, do not buy this one."},{"Title":"Wives and Daughters","review":"With its fairy-tale beginning (\\"In a country there was a shire, and in that shire there was a town, and in that town there was a house . . .\\"), the subtitle of Wives and Daughters is gently ironic. While the basic plot is standard--boy and girl meet and overcome many obstacles, including themselves--Gaskell's tale is as much about the rapidly changing Victorian world as about Molly Gibson and her provincial village of Hollingford.Set before the 1832 Reform Bill, Wives and Daughters consciously brings together England's aristocratic past, represented by Squire Hamley and the upstart earl and countess of Cumnor Towers, and the future, represented by Molly Gibson and Squire Hamley's sons, especially Roger. The elder son, Osborne, puts his own interests and more modern sensibilities above those of his father, while Roger envisions a future of science, exploration, and expansionism. To Mrs. Gibson, who marries to avoid having to work and dependence on the aristocracy, Osborne offers her daughter an entr&eacute;e into at least the landed gentry, whereas Roger is merely a second son demeaning himself by dabbling in the sciences. Although renowned in London for his travels and discoveries, Roger becomes worthy of her notice only when he is taken into the inner circle of Lord Hollingford and the Towers as a result of his personal achievements.While the visible action takes place within the small circle of Hollingford, Cumnor Towers, and Hamley Hall, Gaskell encompasses the widening world of rural England. Cynthia attends school in France while the Hamleys are off to Cambridge. The Hamley home is filled with relics from India, while Lady Harriet advises the Miss Brownings on how to obtain the best-priced Indian tea. Cynthia returns from her jaunts to London fashionably dressed and with hints of admirers, while Roger comes back from Africa browned, bearded, and mature in aspect and mien. Even villagers like Miss Hornblower feel the pull of the larger world and the new technology. As Mr. Gibson tells Molly, \\" . . . if these newfangled railways spread, as they say they will, we shall all be spinning about the world; 'sitting on tea-kettles,' as Phoebe Browning calls it.\\"The spheres of the sexes are vastly different. Clare Kirkpatrick thinks \\"how pleasant it would be to have a husband once more; some one who would work while she sat at her elegant ease in a prettily-furnished drawing-room.\\" Even as Mr. Gibson thwarts the advances of Molly's first suitor, he tries to keep his \\"little goosey\\" unprepared for anything but life under the protection of a man, either father or husband. He advises her governess, \\"Don't teach Molly too much: she must sew, and read, and write, and do her sums; but I want to keep her a child, and if I find more learning desirable for her, I'll see about giving it to her myself.\\" As men of science, he and Roger believe themselves to be dispassionate and rational, yet Molly senses their obvious mistakes before they do and that they are more deeply affected than they appear to be. Gaskell's characters, however, do not follow stereotypes. Lord Cumnor, a garrulous gossip, and Squire Hamley, an openly emotional man, are \\"womanly\\" in their ways, while Lady Cumnor and her daughter, Lady Harriet, are models of independence and detachment. Rather than assert her own independence and risk upsetting her excitable, patriarchal husband, Mrs. Hamley wastes away, ironically depriving her husband of her management of his emotions and their expression.Molly is raised to suppress her feelings. As Mrs. Gibson's values clash with those of Mr. Gibson and Molly, he is able to ride off and immerse himself in his work, while Molly can only swallow her emotions or, as a last resort, hide them in solitude. There is hope, however, that Molly can avoid the life for which Mr. Gibson is preparing her, that of an obedient wife. Her life as companion to Mrs. Hamley shows her impressionable mind the folly of pride and the lasting harm it causes as it separates Mr. Hamley and his elder son. Her natural curiosity and intelligence, consciously discouraged by Mr. Gibson, are encouraged by Roger Hamley, who bridges the ancient Hamley past and the future of science and discovery. This future will be built on achievements, not family name, which makes young Osborne's parentage significant only to traditionalists like the squire and Mrs. Gibson. Their vision of the possibilities never extends beyond their own desires and concerns.In Wives and Daughters, Gaskell addresses myriad issues important to her and her contemporaries--medicine, science, marriage, the family, gender roles, monetary wealth and land wealth, rural mores, the perception of English heritage and strength and French decadence, exploration, and change. Her characters are so richly drawn that the reader begins to anticipate Mrs. Gibson's \\"infinite nothings\\" and Mr. Gibson's searing irony. Gaskell imbues some of them with an enticing air of unsolved mystery. What are Mr. Gibson's origins? Who was Jeanie, his first love, and why did he not marry her? How does that and his other early relationships influence his behavior toward Molly? Why, at age 28, does Lady Harriet refuse a good match and seemingly scorn romance? Gaskell does not judge her characters--even Mrs. Gibson has redeeming qualities--nor does she reveal all their secrets. Wives and Daughters is an enlightening, captivating, and, despite its unfinished state, satisfying look at Victorian life and society, the influence of which is still felt."},{"Title":"Wives and Daughters","review":"I am a huge Jane Austen fan, and this book is the closest and best book to her writing that I have found- and believe me I have read a lot from this genre.

Molly spends a lot of time at their house as both a friend and helper with the wife. Eventually she also meets Roger who has returned from travels for the Geographic Society.

But I was so surprised to discover this amazing author who's writing style rates up there with Austen, Brontes, Eliot and others.The most refreshing thing about Gaskell is that as an author, she comes across as very upbeat and mentally well-balanced. Often, an author's \\"issues\\" are evident in their works and the reader walks away with a strong sense of the author's psychological make-up and is even sometimes affected by it if it's negative. I did not get that feeling at all with this one but felt an overall sense of peace even though it portrayed a realistic situation that at times was very uncomfortable."},{"Title":"Wives and Daughters","review":"\\"Wives and Daughters\\" by Elizabeth Gaskell was written for serialisation in the Cornhill Times between 1864 and 1865. However Gaskell died suddenly shortly before finishing the book. The ending had already been planned and the book is satisfyingly complete as it stands.\\"Wives and Daughters\\" is Gaskell's best book in my opinion and it shows her talent at its peak.The language and descriptions are not as convoluted or drawn-out as in her other books. In fact the language is quite modern compared with the flowery style of the era.The narrative itself is gripping, especially towards the end of the book when events reach their climax. There are exciting twists and turns in the plot, almost like a modern thriller. This is where Gaskell shines - she is a very skilful constructor of intricate story plots. It is difficult to put the book down as we near the end of the story.Gaskell is brilliant in evoking mental images in the reader. We are drawn into the story in our imagination and construct our own imagery of the characters and settings. This, of course, is why books will always be with us and will never be supplanted by TV. Some of her descriptions of the English countryside, with its plants, crops and seasons are quite beautiful and show a very observant eye.Another area in which Gaskell shines is her vivid depiction of characters, even though they might be standard \\"types\\" to readers of her day. Mrs Kirkpatrick is especially interesting, although she will intensely irritate many readers. She is superficial, self-centred, manipulative, selfish and fawns over the local aristocracy - in fact, just like many young women of today! While these traits might be expected, although unattractive, in a silly teenager, they are distasteful in a middle-aged widow such as Mrs Kirkpatrick. Readers will love to hate her!But every reader will love Molly and side with her in her jousts with Mrs Kirkpatrick. Molly is probably the most likeable of all the characters in Gaskell's books. She is more realistic and less of an exaggerated \\"type\\" than many of the others.\\"Wives and Daughters\\", like all Gaskell's books, is an enjoyable read and the plot moves on apace. Perhaps this is due to the requirements of serialisation - short, self-contained episodes that leave the reader keenly awaiting the next episode. Dickens' books are successful for much the same reason, as are modern TV soapies.The book also gives a valuable insight into attitudes and ways of life in the early 19th century. This will interest readers who love history. Fiction such as this can illuminate social history.If you want to explore Elizabeth Gaskell's books, start with \\"Wives and Daughters\\" and then move onto the earlier books."},{"Title":"Wives and Daughters","review":"i thought this was a great story. i am a huge austen fan and was very pleased with this book. it is long but it did not feel that long when reading it. there is great insight to characters and you see their faults and flaws, even in the heros and heroines.i would say it was easier to read than austen and gaskell did use \\"tete-a-tete\\" a lot. i was also unfinished and leaves you wanting more of the ending,but i would recommend it to anyone who enjoys this genere of book. I would have given it 4.5 stars if possible"},{"Title":"Wives and Daughters","review":"This is the third novel by Elizabeth Gaskell that I have read. I thought Ruth was beautifully written and North and South became an instant favorite immediately! Wives and Daughters is really different from North and South, but I was absolutely charmed by it.Life changes for young Molly Gibson when two events in her life take place. The first event, her widowed father remarries. The second, she is sent to stay at the old ancestral home of local Squire Hamley. Molly's new step-mother is the lovely Mrs Clare, later Mrs Gibson. She is considered quite the beauty for her age, but after marrying Molly's father, Dr Gibson, Mrs Gibson puts on airs and dramatically changes the relationship between father and daughter. Mrs Gibson brings a daughter, Cynthia, from a previous marriage into the Gibson household. Cynthia is everything Molly is not. She is outgoing, witty, and charms the pants off of everyone she encounters, especially men.Cynthia and Molly became like sisters, but their relationship with Squire Hamley's sons complicate their relationship. The Hamley sons, Osborne and Roger are as dramtically different as Molly and Cynthia. The novel reminded of something written by Jane Austen. There are many romantic twists and turns and unexpected secrets.As I started reading this novel, I thought I knew what the plot would consist of, but I was 100% wrong. Although the novel and the characters turned out to be a surprise, I was quite charmed by it. The novel was never finished due to the author's death, but the reader will not feel cheated because it is quite obvious how Gaksell intended the novel to end."},{"Title":"Wives and Daughters","review":"This is the sweet story of Molly Gibson, the only child of a widowed doctor in a small village in 19th century England. Molly's dad, a no-nonsense Scotsman, decides it will be in Molly's best interest for him to remarry, so with characteristic swiftness, he does so. But will he and Molly live to regret his somewhat hasty decision? Herein lies the major conflict of the novel. As Molly grows into young womanhood, she finds her life, home, and relationships altered by the arrival of her new stepmother and sister. Just when Molly begins to realize that her feelings for old friend Roger Hamley may be more than friendly, she finds herself watching helplessly as he becomes enraptured by her enticing, beautiful, charming, but ultimately shallow and manipulative stepsister Cynthia. This novel lacks the power of Gaskell's North and South and some of Cranford's charm, but is worth reading nonetheless, especially if one enjoys the genre. And if you are a fan of 19th century British fiction who has yet to discover Gaskell, may I recommend her highly to you? You owe it to yourself to check her out! (In parentheses I will add that the version I ordered from Amazon, published by Wilder, is cheaply bound and riddled with typos. Do yourself a favor, and order a different one than that.)"},{"Title":"Wives and Daughters","review":"I think I see this book differently than the other reviewers. I saw it as being rather critical of the female sex -- and rightly so. I myself am not very fond of women. I much prefer the company and companionship of men. This novel shows women at their worst--overly emotional, indecisive, manipulative, jealous of each other, irrational, concerned with the petty things in life, etc. The men of the novel are constantly being wounded by their women, and constantly complain that women are nothing but trouble and have a knack for creating problems, often over petty issues. SInce I am really not generally fond of women, my sympathies throughout this novel were on the side of the poor men who were attempting to cope with their women.Despite this, I enjoyed the book. I read it as I watched the film. The film was quite true to the book, and added a great ending ... beautifully done. Try it! read the book and follow it in the film."},{"Title":"Wives and Daughters","review":"Book looks great. This is in great condition and only looks slightly bent from travel. otherwise it is in perfect condition."},{"Title":"Wives and Daughters","review":"Having exhausted Austen for the time being and seeing that Cranford was funny and touching I began reading the Wordsworth Classics edition of Wives and Daughters. For about 300 pages I was thinking this is really good but at about page 385 nothing seemed to be jelling so I put it down for a few days only to start again at the end to find that the author died before she had finished. There was enough to go on however so that wasn't a big problem. The problem is that the really sad husband/wife relationship was never developed (did I miss it?)I would really advise anyone to read Wives and Daughters:In Half the Time instead of this. Normally I would not want to read a condensed book. For Instance, Thackeray's Vanity Fair must be read in all of its 743 page glory.But see the movie Vanity Fair (first?) The long one."},{"Title":"Wives and Daughters","review":"I began Wives and Daughters by Elizabeth Gaskell in late July, and have only just finished it - yesterday, as a matter of fact. I had already seen the movie about a year ago, but I really wanted to read the book. It started out much like the movie, only the events and happenings were much more drawn-out. Let's face it, the book was dull. Way too many unnecessary conversations and long descriptions.Nevertheless, I was determined to finish it. I wanted to be able to say I'd read all 648 pages of Wives and Daughters. So I did. By the time I began the last chapter I was anticipating the end and the lovely scene I knew was going to happen (after all, that was the way the movie ended). I turned the page, right in the middle of another long-winded \\"tete-a-tete\\" (as Mrs. Gaskell so often likes to term it) between Mrs. Gibson and Molly, when BOOM. It ended. My mind was reeling. Wh-wh-what??I immediately went on to read the note from the editor, who coined it thus:\\"Here the story is broken off, and it can never be finished. What promised to be the crowning work of a life is a memorial of death. A few days longer, and it would have been a triumphal column, crowned with a capital of festal leaves and flowers: now it is another sort of column - one of those sad white pillars which stand broken in the churchyard.\\"She died?! In my anguish I could not help but wonder how, if only the author had not wasted so much time on those never-ending, tedious passages, perhaps - just perhaps - she would've actually finished it?I threw down the book in disgust (quite literally, I'm afraid) while muttering, \\"Stupid, stupid book!\\"So now I must go and watch the movie - at least it has an ending! Sadly this is one case where the movie is much more worthwhile than the book."},{"Title":"Wives and Daughters","review":"I am three-quarters through Gaskell's Wives and Daughters (Hard Press Edition) and am enjoying the unusual narration style. The omniscient narrator reads the thoughts of all characters except those of Cynthia. The narrator, perhaps giving a reflection of the author's views, seems to be gently mocking the Victorian mindset, styles, concerns, and customs of the characters. The English country setting in the small village of Hollingford, probably about 1830, gives background to the mimicked mannerisms and foibles of the wealthy or indolent or want-to be's and provides an implausible counterbalance to today's frenetic world. It actually is a relaxing read for a summer's evening.Gaskell was a personal friend of the Brontes and wrote a biography of Charlotte Bronte. A very minorcharacter \\"Miss Eyre\\" appears as a governess to Molly Gibson, the young lady protagonist. Rosalie L'Ecuyer, Fairbanks, Alaska"},{"Title":"Wives and Daughters","review":"I stayed up many late nights because this book is so engrossing. The storytelling, the pace, the characters, the intrigue all kept me up late, even when I had early morning meetings. Gaskell has a simple and eloquent writing style as well as a wonderful story to tell.She does a sublime job of populating a village with memorable and distinct characters. The story centers around the Gibson family, first Molly and her father, gifted surgeon Dr. Gibson. Eventually Mr. Gibson realizes that Molly needs a mother to guide through her \\"young womanhood,\\" and so he marries the superficial, exceedingly self-centered, but ultimately harmless Hyacinth Kirkpatrick. The new Mrs. Gibson brings with her her breathtaking beautiful but troubled daughter Cynthia (anagram). Along with this family, we follow the Hamleys with their rich past and future which is inextricably linked with the Gibson's -- Molly's especially.While the author patiently delineates all her characters, I agree with an earlier post that said she could have benefitted from a great editor. Some of her observations ARE redundant. How many descriptions do we really need about Molly's goodness, Mrs. Gibson's selfishness, Cynthia's beauty, etc.?Moreover, contrary to what Gaskell intends, I think the true heroine in the story is Cynthia. Cynthia is both selfish and kind, witty and naive, winning and annoying, pitiful and enviable -- in essence, she's a fully characterized, complex human being. Molly, who is so wondefully patient and good and sweet and caring and loving, is a shell of a girl compared to Cynthia. There are no shades to Molly. Why the intended heroine of the story lacks dimension is beyond me. Nearly every other character is allowed contrarian thoughts and feelings, whereas Molly occasionally borders on peevishness or impatience only to retreat back to docility.Having said that much, I did enjoy the book immensely and was more than a little disappointed that Gaskell's untimely death forever suspends Molly and Roger in a state of unfulfilled love. Yes, my imagination can provide the ending easily but I would have loved to have read Gaskell's exquisite conclusion.I would not put Elizabeth Gaskell in the same league with Jane Austen or George Eliot. Although, I think Gaskell's story has more immediate social relevance than Austen, her writing is simply not as good. For one, Austen's dialogue is incomparable. Austen's social commentary is so intertwined with her characters that you hardly perceive the narrator. She speaks through her creations. Gaskell's personal beliefs leaks through. George Eliot is in a class of her own; her writing is so subtle yet powerful you don't realize how great she is until the end when you put down Middlemarch and are in awe. Her characters, the village, the story is so richly textured that few novels even approach Middlemarch to be considered a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Wives and Daughters","review":"Elizabeth Gaskell was a truly great writer. Definitely under-appreciated. This book was very enjoyable. I have seen the BBC adaption before, and really enjoyed that, but the original book has even more depth (of course, as books usually do!)"},{"Title":"Wives and Daughters","review":"WOW. My only disappointment was that I did not read this classic so much sooner. At first the beginning was not as easy as I like, perhaps due to the small print, but what a complete gem!!! As I read on.

Highly recommend, especially to those fans of the British reprints such as Cold Comfort Farm, Excellent women and even fans of Little Women or Anne of Avonlea books from their youth."},{"Title":"Wives and Daughters","review":"she didn't finish the story. after writing a long story she cut it off before it was ended in the middle of the wrapping up. it was like she was only going to write so many words and not a word more. other then that the story was good."},{"Title":"Wives and Daughters","review":"I always like to read the book first, then see the movie.

It's an engrossing novel chock full of mystery, romance, wit and a peek at middle class life in 19th century England. At the same time, it's a literary read. Any fan of Jane Austen would enjoy Elizabeth Gaskell and especially Wives and Daughters."},{"Title":"Wives and Daughters","review":"I didn't know much about the author before I started reading this book - I certainly didn't expect to read such a great book. Even unfinished (the free Kindle version doesn't include the closing essay some other versions apparently have - it just stops abruptly), it's a masterpiece of characterization. I can't understand why the author isn't better known.It's so rare to read a long, sprawling novel with such attention to detail. Even the minor characters are drawn with a completeness that speaks to Gaskell's ability. Molly, the main character, is thoroughly good - but she battles with real feelings in a way that keeps you from feeling like you're just reading an account of the travails of a goody-two shoes. Hyacinth and Cynthia are two of the greatest creations ever. Hyacinth should be just hateful, but Gaskell humanizes her in a way that is astonishingly deft. Cynthia, instead of being just a foil for Molly's goodness, comes across as a well-rounded person. Nothing proceeds exactly in the way that you expect.It looks as if Gaskell gets compared to Austen a lot and that doesn't really do justice to Gaskell. She isn't as witty as Austen, the dialogue doesn't have that sparkle to it. But that isn't what she was trying to do, so judging her by that standard is just unfair. Instead, she's created a village peopled with characters so realistic, you feel as if you know them. She made her time become real. I don't know what it would have been like to read her books as a contemporary, but I know what it feels like to read them now. It is like stepping into a time machine.Highly recommended, despite some errors in the Kindle edition. There isn't anything that subtracted from my joy at finding this book."},{"Title":"Wives and Daughters","review":"Mrs. Elizabeth Gaskell (1810-1865) is an excellent Victorian novelist! Among her gems are \\"North and South\\"; \\"Sylvia's Lover\\"; \\"Ruth\\" and \\"Cranford\\" (a well received series from BBC which was shown to good reviews in the USA). Mrs. Gaskell lived in Manchester where she and her Unitarian pastor husband raised a large family; helped the poor and socialized with such literary luminaries as Charles Dickens. Mrs Gaskell wrote \\"The Life of Charlotte Bronte\\" about her late great friend.Wives and Daughters is her last novel which was not quite completed (even though it is easy to figure out the tying up of the plot knots). The long novel of over 600 densely worded pages deals with young Molly Gibson who lives in the village of Hollingford in the 1820s and 30s when industrialization was changing life in the English Midlands.Molly is the daughter of Dr. Gibson a widower. He marries the flighty widow Hyacinth who sets about changing his eating and living habits. She is not a bad woman but she is shallow and obtuse. She and Molly develop a toleration for one another. Her daughter Cynthia arrives from schooling in France. It is with her entrance that the leisurely pace of the novel speeds up and engrosses the reader's attention.Cynthia is courted by Roger Hamley scion of an old Hollingford family. She is also courted by Mr. Preston a land agent who was earlier engaged to her and Mr. Henderson a rich Londoner. Osborne Hamley is the oldest son of the family. He has a secret French wife who gives birth to a baby boy. Osborne is sickly and poetic while Roger is a scientist modeled after Mrs Gaskell's relative Charles Darwin.Before the novel ends both Cynthia and young Molly will be wed. The novel is comedic and at times slows down to a caterpillar crawl but like most great novels it packs a punch. This novel is wonderful at portraying English life in a transitional age.Wives and Daughters has been made into a fine BBC miniseries which is a palette of bucolic scenery and excellent acting on display for the viewer. Who the dickens is Mrs. Gaskell? She is an excellent author who needs greater readership in America. If you want a gentle story which will keep your attention then Mrs. Gaskell's short stories and novelswill meet your literary needs. Wives and Daughters is Mrs. Gaskell's masterpiece and holds its own with the best British fiction of the nineteenth or any other century!"},{"Title":"Wives and Daughters","review":"Enchanting books, full of romance, intrigues, and gossip. A wonderful example of an old English society and the partitions and biases built into each social class. I would suggest this as a great book to read, and a resource on social structure and etiquette for historians."},{"Title":"Wives and Daughters","review":"\\"Wives and Daughters\\" was Elizabeth Gaskell's last, longest, and perhaps best novel. Set in an 1830's rural English village, it deftly mixes domestic drama and comedy with some rather subversive social commentary.At the center of the story is Molly Gibson, the daughter of the village doctor, who has been motherless from a young age and raised by her father. She is modest, considerate, and honest, if a little unworldly. When one of the doctor's trainees takes in a romantic interest in the seventeen year-old Molly, the panicked Mr. Gibson packs her off to Hambley Hall, where Squire Hambley, his invalid wife, and their sons Osborne and Roger treat her as a member of the family. Mr. Gibson rather precipitously proposes to a widowed school teacher, Mrs. Kirkpatrick, who has her own daughter, Cynthia, about Molly's age.Her new family will be a challenge for Molly. The new Mrs. Gibson is vain, shallow, and manipulative, while Cynthia is a pretty and talented flirt who attracts the attention of many young men, including a marriage proposal from Molly's favored friend Roger Hambley. Molly becomes a keeper of confidences and painful secrets; her loyalty to her new sister will involuntarily involve her in Cynthia's indiscretions, which threaten to ruin both their reputations.The novel was written for magazine serialization, with episodic chapters. The characters are well-developed and very human; even the ostensible villains are fully rounded and often sympathetic. The social behavior of men and women is repeatedly constrasted, often for humor but also to highlight contradictions. Mrs. Gaskell takes her time telling the story, but readers won't notice the length. The author died just before finishing the novel; a final note sketches the ending toward which she was plainly heading.\\"Wives and Daughters\\" is very highly recommended to fans of Elizabeth Gaskell and her excellent novels."},{"Title":"Wives and Daughters","review":"Mrs Gaskell's obscurity, relative to the likes of Dickens, Trollope, Eliot or Bronte, is unfortunate, as she combines many of the strengths of each of these writers into a less flashy whole that almost seems designed to appeal to a latter-day reader of more modern(ist) tastes. Particularly with Wives and Daughters, Mrs Gaskell's a writer of deceptive moderation. None of her leading characters are altogether bad or altogether good, and her plot seems to evolve almost organically and unobtrusively out of a random stream of nearly uneventful circumstances, rather like real life. Indeed, there's a point half-way through this book when things seem to be sagging and wandering horribly, but, by the end, everything has been made relevant, a single tile in a chain of collapsing dominos. Many marvel over Gaskell's creation of the callow, superficial Mrs Gibson, and she really is a fantastic creation, rather too close to my own mother for comfort. But the story of Wives and Daughters really is Molly's and it comes alive when she's on centre stage. She may be the most endearing flawed heroine after Natasha in War and Peace. And her flaw, although never spoken forth, always masked behind her apparent selflessness, is her seething jealousy of Roger's love for Cynthia. The bright, truthful Molly just slowly wilts away for the latter half of the book until her shot at Roger re-emerges. In the end, the greatest achievement of Wives and Daughters is its humanity. These characters are living within a stifling, dehumanising social code, and what makes Mrs. Gibson ultimately a sort of admirable figure is how she is always voicing the self-serving Id within that code. And characters like Cynthia and, most of all, Aimee manage to be accepted in ranks above their station, to move within this class-conscious world, with little or no comment, and that, in itself, is revolutionary."},{"Title":"Wives and Daughters","review":"This book portrays the life of young Molly Gibson. Molly is a sweet girl with a good heart, but when her father remarries, Molly finds herself with a new stepsister, Cynthia. Cynthia is quite popular and flirtatious but is very troubled. Molly and Cynthia become good friends though Molly doesn't always agree with Cynthia's actions. This story shows how Molly and her sister grow from girl to woman within the gossiping little town of Hollingford, England.I decided to read this book after seeing the Wives and Daughters presentation from ExxonMobil Masterpiece Theatre on PBS. This book is captivating and touching. It is too bad that Elizabeth Gaskell passed away before finishing the book. But though the novel is incomplete, I still very much enjoyed this book and never regretted reading it. I would recommend that you view the Masterpiece Theatre presentation of this novel because it really helped me to understand the characters better. Overall, this book is wonderful and an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Wives and Daughters","review":"As one furthering an interest in Victorian novels, I thought the novel to be deeply enthralling. I found myself caring so much for the shy beauty, Molly Gibson, that I was impatient to get to the end --- yet I was enchanated by every word of the novel.There are so many elements to the novel outside of two young girls developing into womanhood in mid-Victorian society. Gaskell's attention to small details about everyday life and mannerisms is delightful. The characters are far from static and have the capacity to make you fully care (be it positively or otherwise) about them.I only wish a proper ending could have been writing, though perhaps one is not necessary."},{"Title":"Wives and Daughters","review":"This is a charming novel! Though Mrs. Gaskell's untimely death prevented the final chapter from being written, the story is not incomplete. We only miss her delightful way of telling us what happened in the end. The notes in the back of the Penguin Classics edition are invaluable and very interesting all by themselves. If you enjoyed the television mini-series, you won't be disappointed in this book. I recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys \\"parlor\\" romance-comedy-drama. Mrs. Gaskell's style is distinctive from Jane Austen's but equally entertaining."},{"Title":"Wives and Daughters","review":"The characters in this classic novel are very well drawn. Mrs. Gaskell breathes life into these characters, so much so that you feel you know them. There are flaws and inconsistancies in the text, but Mrs. Gaskell died before she could complete the book, and many errors were never corrected. I like the Oxford World's Classics version because of the informative preface and notes at the end."},{"Title":"Wives and Daughters","review":"Elizabeth Gaskell writes in beautifull details. A simple but captivating story about Molly's everyday life in a time gone by. The only drawback I see, is the fact, that she was not able to finish the book. Of course, the conclusion of the story is clear and not at all far off; though, I still would have liked to have read the last 1 or 2 chapters in her hand."},{"Title":"Wives and Daughters","review":"Mrs. Gaskell's final novel is a simple but compelling story.Molly Gibson has lived a quite life in the countryside with her father, the county doctor. Having lost her mother early in her life she is content with her father, her books, and her mother's old friends who keep an eye on her. When she is around 17 her father sends her away to a neighbor to keep one of his students from courting her, and Molly grows very close with her neighbors, Squire Hamley, his wife, and his two sons Osborne and Roger. While she is gone he decides to remarry as he thinks having a woman in the house will help protect Molly. Mr. Gibson chooses Mrs. Kirkpatrick, a widow he had seen occasionally at the local lord's home. Mrs. Kirkpatrick comes with a nearly full grown daughter of her own, the willful and magnetic Cynthia. And with everyone in play life takes over, dolling out romances, death, intrigues, betrayal, adventure and disappointments.In telling this story Mrs. Gaskell(as she liked to be called) mocks the rigidity and judgements of the old traditions and beliefs while showing the pitfalls of the younger generations actions. Like Miss Austen she subtly points out the perils of marrying for something less than true love and appreciation. Sadly Mrs. Gaskell died before she could write the last chapter, but an author that was also being published in the magazine that was running Wives and Daughters conveyed her plans for the characters as she had told them to her family in a column that is part conclusion and part obituary. I greatly enjoyed the book, which is widely considered her masterwork, but I am partial to North and South. I also recommend the BBC adaptation."},{"Title":"The Martin Chronicles: A True Story of Adoption and Love in Mexico","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading Mary Beth's personal account of her experience in Mexico while waiting for the finalization of her son's adoption. As a mother waiting for her son from Guatemala, I found this book to be comforting. Although Mary Beth and her husband had a difficult period in their lives (Mary Beth being in a foreign country, Eugene being away from his newly found family), they all remained positive about the experience. I truly felt as though I knew Mary Beth as she described her experences in her emails to her friends and family. I also enjoyed the lessons in Spanish that were embedded within her leters.

Now Dylan arrives home, where he'll visit for six weeks while recovering from surgery, not expecting the profound changes he finds. His mother is taking belly dancing lessons, died her hair blond, got rid of her glasses and lost weight. The house has likewise been transformed, and Dylan isn't necessarily happy with all the changes. Worse, his mother's new job has her working as a &quot;romance coach.&quot; Dylan blames the changes on the influence of his mother's boarder Maddie Lamont. Dylan hasn't seen Maddie since she was fourteen, and her transformation is also profound.Dylan would like to be the advice-filled, world-wise big brother, but he hasn't been around enough to nurture a relationship with his brothers. Indeed, he leaves his island paradise not so much to reconcile with his family, as to flee a woman who wants to take their relationship to the next level. Although he initially fights his attraction to Maddie, he finds himself quite challenged to get close her. Maddie has been casually seeing someone else for six months, and she doesn't want a man who's not going to stick around. But then, she's never reacted to anyone the way she reacts to Dylan.Pamela Bauer pens a character driven romance in 14 VALENTINE PLACE. In the beginning, readers may feel a bit ambivalent about Dylan as he initially presents himself as superficial. Dylan doesn't like the changes in his mother, his youngest brother's life altering decisions, or Maggie's influence. As a result, he acts like a thirty-one-year-old spoiled, petulant boy until a brother reminds him that he's the one who chose to absent himself from their lives. As he becomes honest with himself about his feelings for Maggie, however, Dylan becomes the hero romance lovers expect.The key to 14 VALENTINE PLACE is honesty. As characters become honest with themselves about their feelings and desires, and then with one another, the magic of love does the rest, whether the magic occur within a romantic context or between family members. In addition, Maddie makes a captivating heroine with her charming stubbornness and determination. Further, secondary characters truly sparkle, especially Dylan's mother whether adorned in her belly dancing costume or giving love advice. Recommended."},{"Title":"14 Valentine Place","review":"If you haven't read a good romance lately, take a look at Pam Bauer's latest. I've been a fan of Bauer's since I read WALKING ON SUNSHINE.

Well, she does try. And I love the way she loses!This book has more depth than the usual light romance. It's a very satisfying read that has more to it than a happy ending.

Not only does it provide detailed guidance on all the trails & roads in the park, but it is also a wonderful source of information regarding the history along these paths and trails.I have hiked every inch of every maintained trail in these parks and this book has been my constant companion throughout. This book has the right balance of providing a detailed milestone description of trails, as well as an easy to read history of the things you will see while on the trails themselves."},{"Title":"Le Crabe Aux Pinces D'Or = The Crab with the Golden Claw (Tintin) (French Edition) (French Edition)","review":"This Tintin is one of the best ever.

'Face for a Clue') is the book I would recommend. The story is set in the Breton harbour town of Concarneau, and begins with the non-fatal shooting of a prominent citizen one stormy night. His friends, card-playing regulars in the Admiral Hotel cafe, fear they will be next, and sure enough strychnine is soon found in their pernods. Escalating fear in the town is accompanied by a mysterious giant's footsteps and a yellow dog always present at the crime scenes. The Mayor who has sent for Maigret becomes exasperated when the policeman seems casually indifferent to the case, allowing further crimes to occur.'Yellow Dog' is model Maigret for a number of reasons. It crystallises the Maigret detective method, rejecting Holmesian deduction or modish scientific procedures, the Inspector preferring to silently absorb the atmosphere of a place, the charactetrs and faces of its people. The progress Maigret makes with this infinite patience he keeps to himself, exasperating superiors, colleagues, citizens, even the reader. In these books, crime isn't static, a thing of the past to be frozen and endlessly analysed, as in Agatha Christie et al, but a fluid, ongoing part of the social fabric. The book introduces the young Inspector Leroy, who, throughout the series will become Maigret's most trusted ally. The narrative plays variations on Simenon's favourite themes, most especially the different levels of vice and transgression in French communities, hypocritically categorised by class. His charting the development of public fear into the violence of mob panic is terrifying and prescient.But 'Yellow Dog' is especially notable for the clarity of what one might term Simenon's tripartite characterisation. First of all, there are the actual human characters, whom Maigret observes, and generously allows the freedom to reveal or hang themselves in their own words, waiting for them to play their petty charades and deceits, before breaking down to the truth. Though Simenon can be sentimental, on the whole, they are not a pretty bunch. Secondly, the meticulous evocation of place, with the vivid description of the harbour; the town divided into the Old, with its ancient, narrow, winding streets, and New, with its markets, gaudy hotels and the ever-recurring clock; the dingy tavern with its oppressive, aquarium-like windows; the persistant presence of dirt and trash, visible emblems of barely concealed social rottenness. And thirdly, the presence of the weather, mostly dark, windswept, beating rain, but breaking into festive plays of light. The story begins with a brilliantly atmospheric, cinematic panorama of the empty town in which the crime is almost incidental; the most forceful set-piece is literally cinematic, as Maigret and Leroy shiver on a roof, spectators looking down through a window-'screen' at a silent lovers' drama they can only partly comprehend."},{"Title":"Maigret and the Yellow Dog (A Helen and Kurt Wolff Bk.)","review":"The English and American schools of crime detective fiction ultimately come from Edgar Allan Poe's \\"The Purloined Letter\\" and \\"Murders in the Rue Morgue,\\" in which the solution of a crime is effected by the application of deductive reasoning from start to finish. These \\"tales of ratiocination,\\" with Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes being the apotheosis of the reasoning investigator, are still the norm today in the English-speaking world.Such is not the case in France, where Georges Simenon has created an entirely different kind of detective, Superintendent Jules Maigret. In MAIGRET AND THE YELLOW DOG aka THE PATIENCE OF MAIGRET (1936), a man named Mostaguen has been cut down by a bullet in the Breton seaside town of Concarneau. At the scene of the crime is found a strange ungainly yellow dog. The victim belonged to a informal (and somewhat unpopular) group of businessmen who got together for cards and drinks every night in the bar of the Admiral Hotel.Superintendent Maigret is called in to investigate, along with Inspector Leroy. No sooner do they arrive, than attacks on the little group begin to ramp up: an attempted poisoning with strychnine, a missing local newspaper writer taken from his car leaving bloodstains behind, and the murder of a notorious philanderer. All these occur more or less under Maigret's nose. As the mayor begins to lose his patience with the big city investigator, the Paris press moves in en masse and camps out in the bar of the Admiral Hotel, kibitzing his every move.From the start, Maigret and Leroy take divergent paths. While the latter attempts to apply close deductive reasoning, his boss hangs out in the bar and has his attention riveted to the barmaid, Emma, and the yellow dog, who is somehow drawn to her. He instinctively feels that these two are somehow at the heart of the investigation and slowly begins to add to his knowledge of these two until the fog lifts.For most of the novel, Concarneau is besieged by foul weather; and the town is full of confused, frightened people who inevitably jump to the wrong conclusions and put pressure on Maigret and Leroy to follow up on their suggestions. Maigret not only keeps accumulating evidence but rudely ignores the press, the mayor, and the residents while marching to his own drummer. In the end, Maigret's instinct trumps Leroy's patient data-gathering and the wild surmises of the others, and everything falls together as the bad weather finally breaks, leaving Concarneau and us readers bathed in sunlight.The brooding quality of the scene, the confusion of the other characters, and the mysterious, almost solipsistic concentration of Maigret are the ingredients that make this a most delectable detective novel. This is the tenth Maigret I've read, and he seems to get better with every book I read."},{"Title":"Maigret and the Yellow Dog (A Helen and Kurt Wolff Bk.)","review":"Even if you dislike police novels, you have to read Maigret's novels (and others Simenon's non Maigret novels) because of the humanism and psychology in these novels. And more over, you have the pleasure to dive in the Simenon's atmosphere : close to impressionism (only few words to restitute an impression ...).This novel, in particularly, is a good example of Simenon's art."},{"Title":"The Four Agreements with Companion Special Edition","review":"The workbook that accompanies the Four Agreements was an excellent idea.

The brief synopsis of each poetess's life and historical context in the biographical notes section makes this book especially rich. I adore it."},{"Title":"Love Poems By Women","review":"This anthology looks at the broadest possible definition of a \\"love poem\\" -- there are poems to lovers & husbands, poems to mothers & children, poems to nations & political figures, poems to nature & God. They also cover the wide range of emotions that a person in love experiences: passion, jealousy, heartbreak, bitterness, contentment, fulfillment, joy, grief, devotion, regret, hope, etc.I think it's kind of pointless to name-check some of the writers compiled in this anthology, because the true beauty of it are all the little gems by writers you will have never heard of. I'm not going to say that I adore every single poem the book contains, but it definitely opened the door to several writers that I would not have otherwise encountered."},{"Title":"Love Poems By Women","review":"I was disappointed with this volume. The title said implied that these were &quot;love&quot; poems, but it seems that the most of them were poems about what jerks males were. Although I am sure that many, if not most, males are jerks, writing a poem about it does not really make it a love poem. Nevertheless, it was quite interesting to see what a great many women really feel about the men in their lives. One plus is that poems were included from many different times and cultures that allows one to get a broader perspective on the subject, however."},{"Title":"Black Hawk: The Battle for the Heart of America","review":"Though I came to the subject of Black Hawk and this book as a result of my constant reading about the life of Abraham Lincoln (he was a militia captain at age 23 in the Black Hawk War), I soon found that there was much more to this story than first meets the eye.As the sub-title suggests, in many ways a battle for the heart of America, both figuratively and literally, was taking place in the first half of the 19th century. Americans continued their westward expansion into the lands that Native Americans called their own, leading inevitably to bloodshed.The Black Hawk War is perhaps generally unknown, but, as masterfully laid out here by Kerry A. Trask, it will never be forgotten once you read this book. You will gain an understanding of life on the frontier from both the Native American and \\"White\\" points of view. Once gained, this knowledge is quickly put to use as Trask details the various battles and encounters that took place during the War, as well as the rationale for them.Many of the individuals on both sides are vividly brought to life, Henry Dodge on the American side certainly comes to mind, but it's Black Hawk himself, much an enigma, who will keep you enthralled."},{"Title":"Black Hawk: The Battle for the Heart of America","review":"I had a personal interest in this book because the Black Hawk war was fought literally in my back yard. This engrossing book game me a new perspective of the circumstances about the war. The history and tradition of the Sauk, the onslaught of emigrant settlers and the clash of cultures are well depicted in the book Black Hawk. The savagery of the Sauk and the Militia, the famous people involved in the struggle and the intrigue and deception kept my interest and I didn't put the book down until it was finished. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Black Hawk: The Battle for the Heart of America","review":"I came upon this book entirely by accident while killing time waiting for a flight. I spent my first 21 years in Northwest Illinois, and while I only became interested in U.S. history 30 years after moving away, as Trask states at the end of this book, people from that part of the Midwest can't really get away from Black Hawk. It was certainly one of our myths, tangential to history, growing up there. I had no idea that Alexander Hamilton's son, sometime Indian fighter, had a fort within ten miles of my hometown and Henry Dodge, founder of Dodgeville, became a frontier hero in a nearby skirmish. Author Trask is dead-on contrasting today's sleepy Illinois-Wisconsin towns with their brief brushes with Black Hawk during the summer of 1832. The whole story fits nicely, or maybe awkwardly, into white America's concept of settling North America.I found the book fascinating and an artful mix of history and perspective. There is just enough analysis of white and native interaction and perspective to keep this anything but a dry historical account. The research seems meticulous, the writing and editing superb, and the narrative strong enough to make the book a page turner. It is hard for me to imagine better coverage of the Black Hawk War.I'll have to disagree with another reviewer who thinks Trask goes to far with naive, modernist analysis. I hate pedantic, term-paper analysis and frankly, I found very little here. I liked his Trickster analogy and was most happy this book was not a rote recital of historical events."},{"Title":"Black Hawk: The Battle for the Heart of America","review":"Dr. Trasks's work FINALLY attempts to balance the Black Hawk War with something other than Black Hawk-- the hundreds of other personalities and downright characters that participated in the 12 week war. A bold, even radical departure from the tired monographs from the 1970s on the same subject. For a change, Black Hawk is looked at as a human being-- and not a sub-diety-- and major players including Dodge and Henry are seen in the significant roles thay played-- and not as smaller than life 'angry white guys.'The book does have some drawbacks. I agree with the numerous post-modern \\"Professorisms\\" that leak into the book (as mentioned by a previous reviewer.) Trask ardently refuses to cut through the the accounts of Stillman's Run to present his interpretation of what happened.Three American accounts indicated that BH's men fired first; BH does not indicate that in his autobiography-- and Trask waivers between \\"can't decide\\" and siding with BH anyway. Trask makes mincemeat of early settlers (calling the frontiersman a \\"myth\\" and presenting a big dissertation regarding Trask's use of James Fennimore Cooper's work as an example of an indian captivity story upon which the myth subsisted. unfortunately he neglects to tell his readers that the captive narrrative in Cooper's \\"Last of the Mohicans\\" was in part based on TRUE events!All in all, the narrative is much more balanced that previous works, and is generally insightful into the conflict as a product of its times. Buy or borrow it."},{"Title":"Black Hawk: The Battle for the Heart of America","review":"This book gives detailed information related to the causes, effects, and events leading up to, and including the BLACK HAWK WAR. While the title suggests the book is a biography of Black Hawk's life, it is not that at all--and this did not disappoint me in the least.Trask tells the story with just the right amount of depth, and in a contemporary, reader-friendly style. I had read a few other books about the BLACK HAWK WAR and Black Hawk's autobiography, but this book was more thorough, and easily understood. There are ample footnotes and resources listed in the apppendix for those who desire further research."},{"Title":"Black Hawk: The Battle for the Heart of America","review":"Like some of the previous reviewers, I grew up in Black Hawk country. As a result, I have read many accounts of the Black Hawk War, and this is one of the best.Black Hawk : The Battle for the Heart of America is fair and balanced (and not in a Fox News kind of way). Trask documents the rapacity of the government and the businessmen who cheated the Sauk and Fox out of their lands. He discusses the Indian culture in which internecine warfare, including revenge murders and mutilations, was considered to be an essential element of manhood, and how this reputation led to panic among the whites and the subsequent overreaction to the Sauk incursion into Illinois. He explains how a similar macho culture among the white frontiersmen led many of them to feel they had to prove their own manhood by going out and killing a few Indians. He points out not only Black Hawk's qualities as a leader but also the flaws that eventually contributed to the destruction of his people in a tragic precursor to the massacres at Sand Creek and Wounded Knee.Trask's book tends to concentrate more on the social and cultural issues behind the conflict rather than on the military campaign. This is appropriate and after reading the book, I feel I have a much better understanding of the background of this significant episode in American history. However, I would have liked to have seen a little more detail about such military events as the Battle of Stillman's Run in which Black Hawk led 40 Sauk warriors against 300 Illinois Militiamen and completely routed them.I was also annoyed by the fact that Trask chose to end this otherwise excellent book with a rather silly and specious analysis of why so many things in northern Illinois and southern Wisconsin are named after Black Hawk. It's guilt; he says. I disagree. People everywhere like to identify with famous people that lived in their area. In central Illinois, things are named after Abraham Lincoln, and across the Mississippi in northern Missouri, after Mark Twain. In my area, it's Black Hawk. If the people south of us feel guilty about Abe and Mark, that's their problem. Around here Black Hawk is the only famous and heroic figure we've got, so we build strip malls and bowling alleys in his honor. And if that theory sounds silly and specious to you, well I have an excuse-I don't know what I'm talking about."},{"Title":"Black Hawk: The Battle for the Heart of America","review":"This is a focused history of the \\"Black Hawk War\\"\\" which took place in 1832 in what are now northern Illinois and southern Wisconsin, between the local militia and a band of Sauk and Fox Indians under the command of Black Hawk. Trask describes the state of relations between Native Americans and settlers during that time period, and briefly covers the history and traditions of Black Hawk's people, as well as Black Hawk himself, who at the time was an elder statesman with no real authority among his people, but a great deal of influence. However, after this background information, Black Hawk himself is not very prominent in this book, making the title and cover illustration misleading. Instead, Trask's historical coverage becomes a standard account of the settlers' military movements and strategies.Meanwhile, trouble arises when Trask attempts to explain the motivations and inner thoughts of all those involved (first of all, beware of any historical or biographical work that claims to know exactly what people were thinking). In a great disservice to the informed history buff, Trask uses a creaky postmodern cultural studies focus, applying modern intellectual concepts to historical developments. On at least four different occasions, Trask goes off on extended discussions of gender issues and identity politics, with multiple attempts to analyze how \\"manly\\" the Indians and settlers had to feel at the time. Trask also makes several very weak attempts to explain Black Hawk's behavior via the trickster motif from Native American mythology, in an exercise that you'd expect from a student trying to impress a history teacher. The book then concludes with some half-hearted ruminations on White guilt and the politics of glamorizing Indians. Hence, rusty professorisms unnecessarily weigh down on this book, but fortunately the basic history of the Black Hawk War remains informative.

Great writing."},{"Title":"Black Hawk: The Battle for the Heart of America","review":"This book should have been titled \\"The Men that Fought Black Hawk,\\" as it deals more with the American forces than Black Hawk himself and his Indian band. While this is certainly an invited viewpoint that is perhaps under-represented in this famous conflict, I felt a little deceived. I had bought this book to learn more about the enigmatic nature of Black Hawk himself, and found little more than generalizations that described him as confused or powerless.Trask dutifully chronicles the American side of the conflict with great skill and pace, and for this he should be commended. But the Native side of the story is (as usual) left out. The book starts off with two promising chapters explaining why the Sauk were so upset in light of the changing world around them. A later chapters discusses the Sauk practices regarding war and battle, but the rest of the book is devoted to American troop movements and military correspondence. At this point, I couldn't help but feel that the book was being told solely from the American point of view. Trask has crafted a well researched and highly articulate book with a very narrow focus, and it just wasn't what had been promised by both the title and the description on the back cover.Unless you're a big 19th century American military buff, I would search for other resources to better understand the Black Hawk conflict."},{"Title":"Black Hawk: The Battle for the Heart of America","review":"Being born and raised in Illinois, I've always been interested in the History of the state. I've read everything I can get my hands on about Illinois History, and was especially happy to get this book. Unfortunately, Kerry Trask's \\"Black Hawk: the Battle for the Heart of America\\" left quite a bit to be desired.Trask is an excellent researcher, and it shows in the depth of sources he uses. He is also a fine writer, and \\"Black Hawk\\" does not read like a History dissertation. The Black Hawk War was a truly miserable war that brought out the worst in both the Native Americans and the white Illinoisans. Trask does a fine job of putting the war within the context of politics and culture of Illinois.The problem with \\"Black Hawk,\\" and the reason I can only give it three stars, is that Trask is unable to step out of the role of the liberal professor. I mean that not as a political title, or to insult Trask. Rather, he refuses to see the settlers as rational actors doing what they think is best to survive on the frontier. Instead, he puts forth a preposterous thesis that the settlers were acting out a hatred of Native Americans that was in part caused by the novels of James Fenimore Cooper.Trask then goes further, explaining that the Illinois militia men were fighting out of a perverted desire to emulate the perceived glory of the American Revolution. Tellingly, the author refuses to acknowledge the fact that many of the militiamen who fought in the Black Hawk War were veterans of the War of 1812, where they had experienced the less-than-glamourous losing side of battle. Though Trask acknowledges it, he refuses to buy into the idea that the militia believed they were fighting for the security of their homes (many farms and small settlements were raided by Native Americans). It is as if, since Trask cannot believe it, then the white Illinoisans must have been mistaken in their thoughts and motivations. Trask's book spends so much time trying to explain this convoluted thesis, that it defeats what would otherwise be a great book."},{"Title":"Black Hawk: The Battle for the Heart of America","review":"When Black Hawk began his return to Illinois and his ancestral lands his advisors were not any more honest than the U.

This book shows Leopold in a far wider context. Leopold held many jobs and had many hobbies in his full life: forest ranger, administrator, hunter, game manager, laboratory director, wilderness traveler, professor. Every time he encountered a new situation he thought about it deeply and creatively, and recorded his thoughts in vivid, non-technical essays, many of which are collected in this book.I was particulaly impressed by Leopold's thoughtfullness -- that he reached his conclusions not by following the majority nor by catering to the powerful nor by jerking his knee, but by deep and clear thinking. Reading these essays renders vivid the fact that current public discourse is dominated by power play and snide insults rather than by civil, reasoned debate."},{"Title":"The River of the Mother of God: and other Essays by Aldo Leopold","review":"Readers of outdoor ethics and conservation philosophy have likely seen collections of Aldo Leopold's essays elsewhere, but I doubt you will find a more diverse and wide-ranging collection than this. Browse the brief chronologic summary of his life and then skip the lengthy introduction (for now), and you will get to the meat of this book. It starts with an essay written by Aldo Leopold as a high school student. From there, the path of essays winds its way like a river through his life, with many stops along the way. The reader can see how Mr. Leopold's outlook matured and changed over time; from such things as a letter to a newspaper editor, to my favorite: an introductory lecture from the first college course he taught. What I would give to go back in time and be a student in that classroom!Aldo Leopold may be gone, but his body of work remains. His written work has proven to be prophetic. We still face many of the same conservation problems that we faced in the early 1900s; some of these problems have worsened. As a society, we have to realize that we cannot go on repeating our past mistakes. There are solutions to these problems. And the words of Aldo Leopold hold some of the answers."},{"Title":"The River of the Mother of God: and other Essays by Aldo Leopold","review":"I got this book quickly and it is in the condition described.

All of them were drop-shipped, via their parent's fiat, to worlds where their mother tongue was no longer heard. These are the stories of how they lived, learned, spoke and eventual wrote English. Initially, their minds were full of ideas, but the words to express them were no longer understood outside of their family. The need to communicate burned inside of them and drove them to English, and maybe drove to the unencumbered freedom found in writing.If you are looking for a work in the field of linguistics, keep looking, for this book is a \`niche' book that gives one an unusual vista on the joys of words via quasi-autobiographies. This anthology is as unique as it is interesting to read. Strongly recommended"},{"Title":"The Genius of Language: Fifteen Writers Reflect on Their Mother Tongue","review":"Wonderful collection of essays by first-rank writers on the transition from the native language to our American version of English. Starting of course with the example of Joseph Conrad they offer insights into their intial contact with English in their childhoods and how this shaped their perceptions of the US and ease their entry into our society. Since I have first hand experience with most of the languages and cultures described (living in Bangladesh, Poland, and Russia, Scottish grandmother), this rang true. Useful for linguists to see how their theories work, something I don't quite understand, but which they do as perceptive writers. The brief essays are well-crafted and easy to understand, much more accessible than their own writings may be or a sociological analysis of the transitions they outline."},{"Title":"The Genius of Language: Fifteen Writers Reflect on Their Mother Tongue","review":"Modestly squeezed within the neat format of an old-fashioned Penguin book, thin austerity-feel paper and all (I don't have the hardback, obviously!) these fifteen essays on life with two languages - arranged, quite simply, by language, from Bangla to the inevitable Yiddish - attain a uniformly (and improbably) high standard. All were specially commissioned, not often a good sign; how on earth did Lesser know to pick the contributors, were there rejects and how firm an editorial hand was required? What a roster! Even the Greek piece, not among the best IMHO, is immensely rich, with some great cross-purpose dialogue(p120), an American Crystal Palace (in Astoria, Queens!), some Canadian local colour and some choice Greek swear-words. Louis Begley (of the stunning Warlime Lies) also diappoints, and Ariel Dorfman was altogether too tricksy, but it was an unexpected pleasure to come across John Campbell, whose back-page JC column is the main reason for reading the TLS, in this company, while Gary Shteyngart's winning piece sent me scurrying straight to my bookshelves. Wendy, sit down; I think I love youNeither Turkish nor Arabic (nor Hebrew, come to that) make the cut. For some future edition the Turkish-American Murat Nemet-Nejat might be worth a punt; in his eccentric Questions of Accent (Exquisite Corpse 43) he says things like 'Zukovsky, a foreigner, teaches Creeley, the Puritan, English as a foreign language, a structure of power Creeley does not completely own' and seeks to show that since American English is mongrel no American poet 'is writing in his or her mother tongue'(!) but his more personal musings might be evocative"},{"Title":"The World of the Theory of Constraints: A Review of the International Literature (The CRC Press Series on Constraints Management)","review":"The world of the Theory of Constraint"},{"Title":"Decorating Inside & Out (Clever Crafter Series)","review":"An easy to use source for projects with many having multiple applications.

This one takes the already-interesting world of &quot;Sing the Four Quarters&quot; and vastly improves on it. It's not really a direct sequel in that the main focus of the book is not on the same characters, and even that in itself was a great choice. Huff has a talent for writing deeply flawed characters that are still very interesting and sympathetic, and this book is probably the best example of that. The characters are fascinating, the plot is suspenseful, and the mythology of the world (one of the most interesting aspects of the first book) is greatly expanded on. This book and the third installment, &quot;No Quarter,&quot; are definitely two of the best and most original examples of the multi-volume fantasy genre."},{"Title":"Fifth Quarter (Daw Book Collectors)","review":"A 'noir' fantasy. &quot;Fifth Quarter&quot; reminded me of one of those old German woodcuts of the Grim Reaper stalking through a medieval village, bishops, commoners, and knights falling dead in his path. The grim reaper in this tale is a pathetic old man with a Song that can seal the souls of the dead back inside their decaying bodies.Tanya Huff sets &quot;Fifth Quarter&quot; in the same world as &quot;Sing the Four Quarters&quot;. There are Bards who can Sing to the 'kigh', the elemental spirits of earth, air, fire, and water. The Empire and its armies are major elements in the plot. However, &quot;Fifth Quarter&quot; is not a continuation of the earlier book. It is the story of brother and sister assassins, who end up inhabiting the same body (the sister's) when they attempt to kill a man who has discovered the secret of eternal life. How the brother gets his body back is one of the book's dominant plot lines, along with the hunt for the grim reaper, who has abducted the Emperor's son.I didn't enjoy &quot;Fifth Quarter&quot; as much as Huff's earlier book. It dwells too much on incest and decaying bodies. However, it is a strong, well-plotted novel with likeable, interesting characters (the only exception is the narcissistic brother-assassin). Huff does her usual good job with the minor characters, too. I grew especially fond of the city guard who is one of the first to encounter the walking dead. She survives the encounter, only to be demoted because no one believes her. Next, she barely escapes death at the hand of the sister-assassin. Finally, she stumbles across the assassin who has sworn to kill the brother-sister team because they deserted the Army..I've already bought the sequel, &quot;No Quarter&quot; to see what happens to Vree and her new live-in companion. Huff is always worth reading, especially for her carefully developed characters."},{"Title":"Fifth Quarter (Daw Book Collectors)","review":"This book brought back fond memories of The Firestone...my first encounter with Huff...managed to create a tapestry of words, revealing all the many things going on just beneath the surface. The simplistic yet complexity of each character reminds me of people in 'real life' The petty bickering of sibling rivalry mixed with very serious issues of FAMILY blend well with the other aspects bubbling away within the pages. Even though i felt more kinship with Vree (there is nothing i would not suffer for my brother) Bannon managed to find a special place in the circle of my thoughts...Despite his self-centered rediculous behavior...Shallow, vain, beautiful, mysterious but most of all silly. I read this in one day...now i'm just slightly vexed because that's it...the end! well of course there was the Quartered Sea... and to think...I kept frowning and leaving this book on the store shelf for so long!"},{"Title":"Fifth Quarter (Daw Book Collectors)","review":"This is a an amazing book! The characters are built, and I felt that I really understood what they were feeling. The action was fast-paced, but the plot was still built delicately. I really enjoyed the topic also, two assassins whose target turns their lives upside-down. I found the characters highly amusing with their witty remarks and sometimes stupidity. But, be warned, if you don't want love in your books, this might not be the book for you. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Fifth Quarter (Daw Book Collectors)","review":"Huff continues in the world she started in \\"Sing the Four Quarters\\" but with a new set of characters. We meet two Imperial assasins, brother and sister, Bannon and Vree, who are quickly shown to be the most impressive and skillful assassins on the block. The beginning is a bit disconcerting as we traveled through Huff's last book with bards and kigh in a completely different kingdom (Shkoder instead of the Empire), and so it takes a bit of readjustment to get settled into this part of the world and the way it works. But the adjustment is small and only noticeable for the first few chapters.Vree and Bannon have been trained together since they were 7 and 6 respectively, and have no family save the Imperial Army. They have been brutally trained throughout their lives to act as two blades with one mind. But when they go on a mission to take out Governor Aralt all that changes between one heartbeat and the next as Bannon blinks and finds himself in the dead body of his target, looking up at his own smiling face. Apparently it is possible for your kigh to jump bodies, and that's exactly what Gov. Aralt did to trap Bannon within the Governor's dying body. Vree is able to reach Bannon/Aralt's dying body and take her brother's kigh into herself before the body dies. Now these siblings are closer than they've ever been, and that may just tear them apart. Instead of being two blades and one mind they are now one blade and two minds. An unsteady truce is struck between the man who took over control of Bannon's body (his name is actually Gyhard) and Vree/Bannon to capture a new body for Gyhard to jump to so that Bannon can have his returned. Unfortunately the one Gyhard has his sights set on is the Imperial Prince, the one person above all else those in the Army are sworn to protect. Because Bannon and Vree share so many memories it becomes quite confusing which memory belongs to whom. Vree and Bannon have to deal with the uncomfortable mixture of their kigh and the resulting loss of identity without going mad while formulating a plan to not kill the Prince and still get Bannon's body back. Packing all this in a few hundred pages makes for a very suspenseful and fast-paced read.Okay, I could have done without quite so much of Bannon's thoughts in this book, though they often served to lighten both mine and Vree's mood. I simply found his thoughts not as interesting and wished that he'd shut up and let other characters have more dialogue in the story. ^_^ It's very interesting to watch Huff take her characters to the brink of insanity and back, and to see how each of their personalities deal with their mutual loss of identity."},{"Title":"Fifth Quarter (Daw Book Collectors)","review":"The main theme of this book is the issues raised by thecoexistence of two individuals (of opposite genders) inone body. I found it to be a fascinating treatment of thesubject, contained in the vehicle of a gripping fantasynovel.Military life was featured heavily, and reminded me ofElizabeth Moon's &quot;The Deed of Paksenarrion&quot; series, whilethe handling of the supernatural called to mind some ofMercedes Lackey's Valdemar works.I was impressed by the matter-of-fact handling ofbisexuality."},{"Title":"Fifth Quarter (Daw Book Collectors)","review":"Fifth Quarter has quite a few interesting characters involved in intricate relationships. There's excellent action, horror, romance, and a bit of humor mixed in throughout the story. This book explores taboos but doesn't step delicately; rather, it plainly thrusts the situation in your face. I enjoyed the emotional stress on all the different characters as their self-images changed. Tanya Huff does a lot of character development in her books."},{"Title":"Fifth Quarter (Daw Book Collectors)","review":"Having found the first of this series and being totally hooked, I was certainly not disappointed. If you enjoy Anne McCaffrey or Mercedes Lackey, you will love this and indeed the whole series. Be careful...not a book easy to put down."},{"Title":"Fifth Quarter (Daw Book Collectors)","review":"Maybe you will like this book. I didn't. Huff attempted to do something new with gender by pushing a male into a female's body (actually, a brother and sister are sharing her body). Personally, I think it fell rather flat. The hint (well, MORE than a hint) of incestuous desires was mostly gratuitous. I wasn't impressed.In addition, I didn't care for the objects of their quest: (1) to acquire the body of a prince and push HIS spirit out of his body and (2) to locate a &quot;could-have-been&quot; bard who is raising the dead, like zombies. The whole &quot;walk of the living dead&quot; portions of the novel were too dark for me, but I generally prefer my fantasy to be more idyllic, epic, or lighthearted.Hey, this book might be for you if the gothic or vampires appeal. If not, I'd pass on this one. Read &quot;Sing the Four Quarters&quot; (book 1) and &quot;The Quartered Sea&quot; (book 4) instead and skip the two middle novels. Both are self-contained enough that books 2 and 3 won't be missed."},{"Title":"Fifth Quarter (Daw Book Collectors)","review":"When I read the back of this book I thought it would be a typical SciFi/Fantasy book. You know the type, where the characters do the same thing as the characters in the last SciFi book. They all seem the same. But this book totally blew me away! I've never read anything like it and I love the love-hate relationship between Vree and Ghyard. And the next book, No Quarter, is just as good and also a must read."},{"Title":"Fifth Quarter (Daw Book Collectors)","review":"I was hoping this would continue the characters of the previous book. Rather, it was a really odd mix of new characters, and seems it has nothing to do with the original world of book 1. Actually, I just stopped reading it after about 90 pages, skimming the rest. It didn't hold my attention at all."},{"Title":"Fifth Quarter (Daw Book Collectors)","review":"This is a pretty good book. However, there are some incestuous bits that are a bit disturbing as well as a great deal of focus on death and rotting. Beyond that the book is well written, the characters believable and interesting and a story you can get into."},{"Title":"Fifth Quarter (Daw Book Collectors)","review":"This is probably my favorite book, the characters are wonderful and amusing, the relationship between Bannon and Vree is very funny, even though it's strained. Vree and Gyhard are so 'cute.' I use that word loosley. But overall it's a very interesting book, I was first attracted to it because it was about a female assassin (I have a thing for that kind of book) and it was a fantasy book but really there's a lot more to the story than that."},{"Title":"4 Steps to Financial Security for Lesbian and Gay Couples: Expert Advice for Reducing Your Tax Burden, Increasing Your Wealth, and Protecting Each Other","review":"Lustig's book is a must-read for any gay or lesbian couple, as it tackles such sticky wickets as purchasing life insurance when one has serious medical problems, viaticals, and the hurdles of retirement plan assets when a partner with an employer-funded plan dies. It's easy to read with &quot;frequently asked questions&quot; and gives step-by-step instructions for approaching insurance companies, mortgage brokers and traditional bankers. If you think the world of financial responsibility is difficult to navigate with laws and mores directed at traditional heterosexual couples - imagine the nightmare it can be for those who are discriminated against, and for whom there is no protection. The book isn't a long exercise in financial planning - it's an explanation of fundamentals with sound advice and tips. Very worthwhile reading for just about anybody."},{"Title":"4 Steps to Financial Security for Lesbian and Gay Couples: Expert Advice for Reducing Your Tax Burden, Increasing Your Wealth, and Protecting Each Other","review":"This is a well written and easy to understand book that provides some much needed advice for lesbian and gay couples. That being said, the author's advice is not without bias (in favor, for example, of using insurance as an investment vehicle), so readers are advised to compare these recommendations to those of other experts with differing opinions. For myself, I agree with those who look with a jaundice eye at whole or universal life insurance as a planning or savings tool. (Term life is usually best and cheapest: consider the advice of Suze Orman, for example; or the excellent and readable \\"Personal Finances for Dummies\\" book by Eric Tyson.) Also, the book's warning that under New York law a lesbian or gay partner is not an \\"insurable interest\\" seems incorrect or perhaps out of date: my partner and I had no trouble getting life insurance naming one another as beneficiary. And some of the more complex strategies that involve transferring title to assets don't include a complete set of their disadvantages. On balance, I'd urge anyone reading this book to both (1) read it carefully and (2) assess the advice for your personal situation while comparing approaches from other advisors (like Orman and Tyson).Still, any book that gets gays and lesbians to focus on savings and legal strategies to protect our relationships is a needed one, and this one provides a helpful focus on issues that are specific to our community."},{"Title":"4 Steps to Financial Security for Lesbian and Gay Couples: Expert Advice for Reducing Your Tax Burden, Increasing Your Wealth, and Protecting Each Other","review":"My partner and I just bought a house, combined our checking account, and were unaware of the problems we could be facing.

Takaki is nothing more than an apologist.I for one am glad that both FDR and Truman had the guts to develop and use the bomb (and I am a Republican, btw). My only regret is that we did not have ten of them to use on Japan.As to Takaki's rather childish claim that racism was involved in the decision to use the bomb against Japan, he is obviously quite ignorant of the history of the bomb and the decision-making process. Germany, as with Japan, was fire-bombed without mercy. What the Hiroshima-handwringers manage to ignore is that fire-bombing killed many more Japanese (and Germans) than did the bombs. Had Germany still been fighting in August 1945 there is no doubt that we would have used the bomb on them as well.Takaki is also apparently ignorant of the blatant racism of Japan throughout the war.The only decision I would have made different from Truman is that I would have detonated either Fat Man or Little Boy directly above the emperor."},{"Title":"Hiroshima: Why America Dropped the Atomic Bomb","review":"Biased, poorly researched book related to the boombing of Hiroshima. The bias begins on the dust cover (insinuating that Truman knew this would be the start of the Cold War). The book goes downhill from that point. selecting the low estimates of US losses and providing a revisionist view of the bombing (guess what--the Japanese approach to existance where the country supercedes self was real hence kill the 'Round Eye' who are invading our country) and would have resulted in horrible US losses. As is often true about revisionist history, no real attempt is made to project what would have happened if the war draged on and the Soviets participated in the proposed invasion of Japan. It is hard to comprehend how such a poorly written book made it past any editorial staff."},{"Title":"Hiroshima: Why America Dropped the Atomic Bomb","review":"This book is worth buying for many reasons; mostly because it opens your eyes to the truth which people have been either ignoring or shielding themselves from.I plan to lend my neighbor (and friend) my copy, because she has grown up reading \\"All-Anerican\\" text books. In a place of no diversity seen for miles and miles; I couldn't expect any less.Everyone is taught about the Attack on Pearl Harbor, and how cruel the Japanese were to do this. But what about Americans? The textbooks kids study from today are all biased and corrupts minds. If everyone has bad-sides then why not show Americas? They obviously don't have a problem showing 'bad sides' of Japanese, Iraqis, Koreans, etc.We're always portraying ourselves as al-mighty and most level headed, as well as most powerful. Is it true? Of course not.We never show kids what we did to the Japanese; and how creul we were. Just show an example of today's world (rasict against Muslims).If kids are exposed to such racism and prejudism at a young age, their minds will be set; which will make them close-minded in the future.I reccommend everyone to read this extraordinary book. It is the great (to some harsh) truth about the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombing.-16 years."},{"Title":"Hiroshima: Why America Dropped the Atomic Bomb","review":"Book details the reasons why the U.S.A. used the atomic bomb at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Generally the main reason given was that an American invasion of Japan would have cost half a million American casualties. The author also states several other reasons. Among them: the American belief in unconditional surrender, impressing the Soviets, and Truman's racism. There might be some truth in these areas, however the Japanese military would never have debated using a weapon like this. They waged total war, are we as Americans not supposed to wage total war when the other side is? Ron, if the bombs saved U.S. lives, I think it was worthwhile using these devices. Truman did the right thing."},{"Title":"Hiroshima: Why America Dropped the Atomic Bomb","review":"I see that most of those making arguments against this book are relying on \\"two wrongs make a right\\" fallacies and other logical fallacies. One of those arguing against this book states that he would like to have dropped more nuclear devices, thus showing himself to be mentally unstable.I've yet to hear a single good argument for dropping the atomic bombs on Japan. After reading the arguments against this book presented here, I've still not seen a single good argument in favor of dropping nuclear weapons on Japan or anywhere else."},{"Title":"Hiroshima: Why America Dropped the Atomic Bomb","review":"Dr. Takaki has earned a reputation as America's most prolific (and generally accurate) historian of Asian America over the past three decades. It saddens me, though, to see such an otherwise careful historian tarnish his reputation with a work whose accessibility will find it being read by secondary students who may not balance his account of the bombing with other viewpoints. I certainly hope the history teacher who reviewed and used this book demonstrated such objectivity in his lessons over this issue. I dread to think what will be thought of our involvement if students are left to Takaki's impressions. Aside from the historical inaccuracies in the book, I find it interesting that so little attention is given to the Japanese (military and civilian) culpability. Ron, you're usually on target, but not this time. If one wants a real read on this issue, I recommend &quot;Truman and the Hiroshima Cult.&quot; Here's hoping you drop out of that cult, Ron!"},{"Title":"Hiroshima: Why America Dropped the Atomic Bomb","review":"The famous excuse to drop the atomic bomb was ti \\"end the war sooner and, by doing so, to spare thousands of lives\\". H&aacute;! One of the greatest lies of history.Japan was already defeated. All they wanted was to keep their Emperor (and, even after the bombs, they managed to obtain that!!). Hiroshima and Nagazaki launched the world into the atomic phase. After all, how could should the Russians react to a government capable of comitting such evil and merciless deed?!The bombs were dropped just to:1) Give a \\"message\\" to the Russians;2) Justify millions of dollars spent in the Manhattan Project.THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO NEED TO DROP THEM. It's the plain truth. It was evil manifesting itself in its worst form."},{"Title":"Hiroshima: Why America Dropped the Atomic Bomb","review":"Ronald Takaki has written a book which presents the \\"Revisionists\\" view of why the U.S used the atomic bombs on Japan in the waning days of World War II. His thesis is that the bombs were dropped because Americans in general and Harry Truman in particular were racists. The bombs were in effect a racially motivated revenge attack on innocent Japanese civilians. His second thesis is that Harry Truman, insecure and bullied as a child because he wore glasses and played the piano now had the ultimate weapon to prove his manhood.Takaki uses as his sources for these conclusions, magazine articles, letters to editors and anecdotal conversations with \\"real\\" Americans.The value of Takaki's book is as a readable counterpoint to mainstream historical writing - it might provoke discusion and thought. The reader should bear in mind that Takaki has \\"an axe to grind.\\"If you are looking for a more balanced view on the topic of why the atomic bombs were used on Japan try J. Samuel Walker's \\"Prompt and Utter Destruction.\\" In his book Walker cuts through the political posturing and tries to present the facts and his opinions in a logical, balanced way. Historian Gar Alperovitz (another revisionist historian) dismisses Walker's book as \\"a mere 110 pages\\" - that in itself recommends the book as an interesting read."},{"Title":"Hiroshima: Why America Dropped the Atomic Bomb","review":"The author seams to have predetermined that useing the bomb on Japan was a bad thing. Try reading &quot;Japans Longest Day&quot;. It was writen by a group of Japanese historians about Aug. 13, 1945. It describes how untill the bomb was droped on Hiroshima the Japanese Government and Military leadership was planing to contest the war to the last Japanese life rather than suffer the indignity of surrender. This would have been at a much higher cost of human life than the 73,000 who died at Hiroshima and 45,000 that died at Nagasaki. the cost w/o the bomb could have quite possibly have been tens of millions of Japanese and the total destruction of Japanese culture, which did survive the bomb. Altho it was changed forever."},{"Title":"Hiroshima: Why America Dropped the Atomic Bomb","review":"This is a typical revisionist account attempting to prove that Dropping the A-bomb was not militarily necessary. I had to read this book for my WW2 class, with no counter-argument offered by my professor. This book will have you believe that US only dropped the A-bomb to stop the Russians from spreading to Asia, as indicative by Truman's hate of communism. The author gives a little bio of Truman to further his point. He asserts that the estimates of probable US dead in a mainland storming was execrated. This book is in essay form, putting out this type of argument. I think anyone who has any background in the Pacific campaign would not buy Takaki's argument. If one looks at the number of Japans dead at Okinawa and those dying in US fire bombings, the numbers killed by A-bombs don't seem as staggering."},{"Title":"Hiroshima: Why America Dropped the Atomic Bomb","review":"The argument that racism determined America's use of the atomic bomb to end World War II is the stuff of revisionism, sophomoric analysis or ideological creep. For those who do not know the situation, let me give you a history lesson.The world is and was a racist planet. Does anyone think the Nazis weren't racist? The Japanese? Look around. The Hindus, Hutus and Bosnians practice ethnic cleansing to this day. While the U.S. was more racist in 1945 than it is today, far bigger forces were at work.Japan initiated WWII for America. It was Japan's choice to engage the slaughter. That fact alone debases any argument for the \\"proper treatment\\" for Japan.Japan was reeling militarily, yet it refused to surrender. Japan could not defend its waters or its skies yet it would not consider terms clearly set fourth 3 years earlier. Japan, not the United States, chose the nuclear option.America was fatigued from war. The European theater was finished and Americans were in no mood to prolong the conflict. Had no atomic bomb existed, the entirety of America's military would have been directed at Japan with no interest in a \\"just peace.\\"Far, far more Japanese would have died had there been an invasion of Japan. Fire bombings alone would have killed one million souls. Japan's infrastructure would have been ashes. Then, the invasion would have occurred.The USSR, which entered the war as a grandstander in 1945, would have invaded and occupied more Japanese territory than it does today.As to the alleged cruelty of the atomic bomb, Japanese and their apologists must look in the mirror before complaining. They might see the Koreans, the Chinese and the soldiers from Bataan looking back. They might also consult the unlucky German citizens who could not escape Berlin when the Soviet army arrived as to how much less cruel a conventional war was."},{"Title":"Hiroshima: Why America Dropped the Atomic Bomb","review":"I totally disagree with Professor Takaki. I am a Japanese American like he is and I was subjected to racial discrimination just after Pearl Harbor perhaps not as much as he had (if he was born then) because I lived in Hawaii and not sent to internment camp. Nevertheless I felt the sting of discrimination. I was a military member of the military intelligence service assigned to ATIS a division of General MacArthur's G2 or Intelligence Section.We saw many highly classified documents at the headquarters and involved in numerous translations of enemy documents. We were also sent on temporary duty assignment on special missions to the frontline units and engaged in scouting and capturing enemy soldiers and interrogating them. I had experience at the lowest and the highest level. Therefore, I have my own perspective of why the A bomb was dropped over Hiroshima and Nagasaki.The casualties for both cities exceeded 210,000 people. The strategic bombing of Japan in six months exceeded 300,000 casualties and millions homeless. Invasion planners stated blockade of Japan chokes but does not kill. The bombing destroys cities but not the army. General Eisenhower agreed. General MacArthur was for the invasion and use of the A bomb for tactical purpose. Subsequent data showed he was wrong.Operation Olympic the invasion of Kyushu was to be launched in November 1945. I was scheduled to be assigned to the 1st Corps to invade Miyasaki, Kyushu by the 6th Army under Gen. Krueger. The XI Corps to land at Ariake Bay to the South and the Marine V Amphibious Corps to land on the southwestern shore. We would have faced 790,000 Japanese versus our 550,000 troops. Operation Coronet was the invasion of Kanto Plain near Tokyo with an invasion force twice as large as Olympic and scheduled for April 1946..Postwar: I read Ketsugo the Japanese defense plan. The Japanese had not only the kamikaze aircraft, but piloted bombs, piloted torpedoes, suicide speedboats in the thousands, mini suicide submarines and four thousand scuba divers to blow up the troop transports . The beaches were mined, spiderweb network of machine gun nests, hidden artillery behind 50 meter high hills. There were 12700 kamikaze aircraft to be launched from partially hidden runways from underground installations. The Japanese estimated about 50% of our troops to be killed. Our estimate was between 20% and 30% but postwar information revealed it to be much higher. The cave networks were designed from lessons learned in the Pacific war. General Marshall estimated a million Americans would perish. Omaha World Herald in their editorial stated, \\"These plans that called for the invasion of Japan paint a vivid description of what might have been the most horrible campaigns in the history of man.\\" Prince Fumimaro Konoye said Japan would be a nation without cities. A whole nation and culture would vanish.The Supreme Council of Japan felt that unconditional meant the elimination of the Emperor. The Emperor also felt that he would be eliminated. President Truman felt less than unconditional would result in future problems if the Japanese armed forces were not eliminated. They may rise again like the Germans. The bomb also saved Japan from being divided into north and south like Korea with Russian participation.I was one of the first to occupy Japan. I saw caves and caves everywhere and other fortifications. Civilians began to appear two weeks later and I asked what are those caves for? They all said to hide in them and attack us at night. I asked with what? They showed me bamboo spears, bows and arrows, pitchforks, knives, samurai swords, sickles, etc., etc. There were 28 million civilians in a unit called the National Volunteer Combat Force. They were trained in guerilla warfare and attack at night. Women and children ages 15 to 50 were recruited. Everyone I interviewed told me that they will fight for the Emperor and not for the military. They consider him a descendent of God. The history of Japan would show this. This sentiment to save the Emperor was unanimous. Millions of Japanese would have died and that is not counting the suicides expected like in Okinawa. President Truman was concerned with history repeating itself. His decision was based on saving lives both Americans and Japanese and not based on racial prejudice. President Truman and his cabinet although not perfect were honorable men. It is incomprehensible that racial hatred was the basis for dropping the bomb. I was there, I saw and talked to the people. The bomb saved me and my fellow soldiers and millions of Japanese. Takaki is dead wrong including those that said the bomb should not have been dropped. These are people who were not involved and based their conclusions on assumptions and had not read Ketsugo nor saw the fortifications and talked to the people.This review is concise because of limitation on number of words; otherwise, it would have filled five pages."},{"Title":"Hiroshima: Why America Dropped the Atomic Bomb","review":"Like other GIs I was delighted when I heard the news of the atomic bombing of Japan. Within a year or so several articles appeared that described the deaths and sufferings of the innocent Japanese civilians in both Hiroshima and Nagasaki. These articles caused many people to have second thoughts as to the wisdom of the decision. In the 70s I read Gar Alperovitz's book, &quot;Atomic Diplomacy&quot;, and was convinced the bombing was a mistake. I was shocked by the Smithsonian controversy--an honest portrayal of both sides of the subject could not be shown. During the periods mentioned I was exposed to writers who discussed various aspects, pro and con, of the bombings.Although I had previously read quite a bit on the subject, I decided to read \\"Hiroshima\\" because I wanted to refresh my knowledge of the bombing, I had read a most favorable review of the author, and the book was small--I could read it in a short time.It was a good decision. The book packs a tremendous amount of pertinent information within its short length. Besides the decision itself it explores factors that might have influenced that decision. These would include: the desire for revenge of Pearl Harbor; to impress Russia and make her more manageable; the racism that existed in Truman and America and was exacerbated by the war; the masculinity factor of a new president who wished to show he was no wimp.One gets to see that there was considerable disagreement before and after the bombing as to the wisdom of the decision. The dissenters were not a bunch of revisionist historians but many prominent Americans in the military, government, science and the media. The names include Generals Dwight Eisenhower and Douglas McArthur and Admiral William Leahy-many who would be considered conservatives if they were alive today. We can not return to the past to alter that decision, We can only speculate as to what might have occurred. There is evidence that had the Japanese been offered the peace terms that were eventually given them-maintaining the emperor instead of unconditional surrender-THE WAR COULD HAVE ENDED SOONER THAN IT DID. It was unconscionable not to have at least given the Japanese the option to accept an offer of peace--on the terms we subsequently accepted--before considering using the bomb.If your knowledge of this historic event is limited and you desire to get an overall view of this tragedy read this book."},{"Title":"Hiroshima: Why America Dropped the Atomic Bomb","review":"Like many people, I managed to exist my formal schooling knowing very little about the dropping of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In preparation for an extended trip to Japan, I wanted to learn a little more about this important event.Ronald Takaki does an excellent job encapsulating the political climate in the U.S., Japan and Russia of 1945. The death of Roosevelt and the elevation of Truman to the presidency had a profound impact on world events. These presidents had different philosophies concerning the use of atomic weapons, and the world might be a very different place had Roosevelt lived to see the end of the war. Truman and Stalin provided a smooth transition from World War II to the beginnings of the Cold War.Ultimately, I left \\"Hiroshima : Why America Dropped the Atomic Bomb\\" with a better understanding and appreciation of why America decided to use atomic weapons against Japan. Takaki provides motivations for most of the key players, along with supporting evidence. The book is extremely readable, and was as captivating as any novel.Whether or not dropping the bomb was \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\" is left up to the reader. Honestly, I have yet to decide."},{"Title":"Hiroshima: Why America Dropped the Atomic Bomb","review":"Takaki's book gives a good introductory account of the actions which led to America's use of atomic warfare. For someone looking for a quick overview of the American rationale for destroying two cities, it's a good read. However, it will ignite further interest as there is much more to be said and read on the subject. This is good, it is a subject more Americans need to learn about."},{"Title":"Hiroshima: Why America Dropped the Atomic Bomb","review":"I used &quot;Hiroshima&quot; in a high school history class and found that the students could access Takaki's ideas, sources and themes fairly easily. His summary of Truman's insecurities from boyhood throuh his term in office had an impact on the students in my class. I would recommend this book for those who have at least some degree of knowledge regarding World War II and the era. Some of Takaki's points make use of obscure evidence that may seem unapproachable to the lay reader. However, to someone versed in the topic, &quot;Hiroshima&quot; is a fresh look at the American motivations behind dropping the bombs."},{"Title":"Hiroshima: Why America Dropped the Atomic Bomb","review":"This is a good book and you will learn about from it. It mainly discusses the politically dilema between America and USSR. I bought this book for my research paper on the atomic bomb and the ethically reasoning behind it. This book helped me a lot. If you are looking for a book to help you in a research for the atomic bomb then you should read this. It isn't that long so you should be able to read it quickly."},{"Title":"Hiroshima: Why America Dropped the Atomic Bomb","review":"The most compelling part of Takaki's book is his description of the a-bomb's power to catastrophically destroy life. His descriptions of the personal stories cross the barriers of nationalism and racism. Some of the stories can make for difficult reading, but in his way, Takaki promotes the importance of peace and non-violence.While I respect Takaki's viewpoint regarding the morality of using the a-bomb, I did find his presentation skewed with not enough fair discussion on what the effects of alternative courses of action would have been. Nevertheless, Takaki shows how easily and how dangerously war can erode our sense of humanity."},{"Title":"Hiroshima: Why America Dropped the Atomic Bomb","review":"This book really helped me write my history paper. I was assigned to write an argumental paper about anything. I thought of writing about the atomic bomb, and I found this book.The information on the book was what I exactly wanted to know to write my paper. I argued that atomic bomb was militarily unnecessarily to end the war against Japan, but U.S. used it for other reasons, such as to threat the Soviet Union, racism toward Japanese, and personality of Truman.My term paper went successfully. Even if you are not writing a history paper, you should read it anyways becasue it really helps you learn about the decision under atomic bomb. It really worth reading and is trully interesting"},{"Title":"Hiroshima: Why America Dropped the Atomic Bomb","review":"This book is one of a seemingly endless series of drivel that attempt to discredit the decision to use the atomic bomb on Japan. By claiming there was no military necessity to use the bomb, these books invariably offer any number of conspiratorial theories to explain the decision. Ronald Takaki takes the anti-bomb genre to new lows of ridiculousness by arguing that the real reason Hiroshima was destroyed can be found inside Harry Truman's pants.Like a TV sitcom, this book follows the standard formula for its' genre: To wit, claiming that there was no military necessity for using the bomb by selectively quoting various authorities who state that the U.S. could have been victorious without it...emphasizing Japanese attempts to negotiate a peace by using the Soviet Union as an intermediary, distorting their intentions and elevating their seriousness to a much higher level than was ever the case...giving no real explanation of why these peace initiatives failed to end the war, other than blaming our policy of unconditional surrender and hinting that Truman didn't want the war to end until he had a chance to use the bomb...relying on speculation about what might have taken place and presenting it as fact...and above all, never laying any of the blame on the Japanese. After it appears as if all common sense explanations for the use of the bomb have been eliminated, the author can insert his own pet theory.Admiral Leahy's opinions are enlisted to inform us that a naval blockade by his forces could have ended the war. There is no discussion of how long this operation might have taken to have the effect intended or of the massive starvation and death it certainly would have caused. Leahy's belief that the bomb would never work and his desire to use a third one on Tokyo (shared by Carl Spaatz) after he was proven wrong are also never mentioned. Eisenhower is said to have attended the Potsdam conference and asked that the bomb not be used. In reality he never attended the conference, and his after the fact recollections of speaking out against the bomb at this time are unconfirmed and contradicted by other sources. Finally, General Macarthur, who later wanted to nuke the Chinese when they interfered with his plans in Korea, is portrayed as some sort of peacenik.Certainly it was clear to Allied leaders that Japan had lost the war. However the Japanese leadership was highly reluctant to accept this reality and surrender on our terms. The Japanese insisted on preserving their emperor not as a figurehead but as the actual ruler of Japan, thereby avoiding any admission of defeat. This is a pivotal fact the book ignores entirely.Like the book as a whole, Takaki's treatment of the Allied policy of unconditional surrender reveals a deep lack of understanding of the subject and a highly selective use of information in order to support a predetermined conclusion. The policy is falsely said to have been nothing more substantial than a campaign slogan, and almost all of its' main purposes are simply not mentioned.Roosevelt and many others drew lessons from the history of World War I, when a negotiated peace gave rise to the belief in Germany that the war was lost as a result of political backstabbing, not military defeat. The Nazi's exploited this belief to the fullest during their rise to power. More than anything else, the Allied policy of unconditional surrender was meant to prevent a third world war by demonstrating beyond any doubt to the people of the Axis countries that militarism leads to total disaster. The peaceful nature of Germany and Japan since 1945 has proven the wisdom of this policy. Roosevelt also wanted to avoid the event of one country in the Allied camp coming to terms with the enemy on their own and then dropping out of the war.None of these basic facts are ever touched upon by Takaki, who prefers to spend the majority of the book reviewing America's treatment of Indians, slaves and Japanese immigrants - and then linking these events to Truman's childhood insecurities and use of racial epithets in private conversation. It is suggested that the most important factor in Truman's decision making is that he didn't want to be a sissy. The desire to intimidate the Soviet Union and the tremendous cost of making the bomb, among other things, are given lip service as additional factors in the bomb's use, presumably to give the book a veneer of balance.There is little doubt that hatred towards the Japanese was widespread in America during World War II. However it was far from the decisive factor in our conduct of the war, much less the decision to use the atomic bomb. And Takaki is wrong again when he claims that the practice of collecting the ears of dead Japanese soldiers would never have been repeated in Europe where our opponent was white. In fact this practice did occur there as well.The use of the term \\"racist\\" has great cache these days, and pseudo-psychological analysis can be amusing, but neither of these things can redeem this book. It's best quality is it's mercifully short length - you'll only have to waste about an hour of your life reading this one. A better idea would be to read the even shorter article by Robert Maddox on the subject in the May/June 1995 issue of American Heritage magazine. Here is a publication known for its' objectivity and high standards - qualities that are glaringly absent from this deceptive little book."},{"Title":"Hiroshima: Why America Dropped the Atomic Bomb","review":"Author's account of events surrounding the nuking of Hiroshima and Nagasaki does not do justice this book.Neither erudite nor analytical the book mostly reads like a Truman apologia.Book does not contain any fresh insights and is just a rehash of what has written earlier by other historians.Whatever arguments Truman and his team have resorted to justify nuclear bombing does not carry weight upon a closer analysis.There was no need for Americans to invade Japanese mainland.Japan was pulverized from the air by American bombers and US Navy subs had imposed a virtual maritime blockade so much so that ordinary Japanese had started feeling the pinch.If Americans had kept up this devastating attacks for a few more months ,Japan would have collapsed.This has also been the opinion of America's leading soldiers.However President and his men had no patience for this form of warfare.If the decision to drop atomic bombs on Japan was prompted by a desire to intimidate Soviet Union ,as author has endeavoured to show ,then one must admit that incident backfired.Stalin saw to it Soviet Union was not subjected to an American nuclear blackmail by quickly developing a nuclear deterrent.Japan was willing to surrender despite opposition from die-hard militarists. But only obstacle was they sought clarification about Emperor's status;never wanted emperorhood abolished.President thanks to media propaganda had a warped view about Japanese;considered them scounderels for launching a sneak attack on Pearl Harbor thus deserving terrible punishment.If Truman had endorsed this Japanese demand which he later accepted the horrible human tragedy could have been averted.Conditional ultimatum while issuing Potsdam declaration would have ensured Japan's surrender."},{"Title":"The Second Circle: Tools for the Advancing Pagan","review":"Venecia Rauls has done something I didn't think possible. She has written a transitional book that will move a beginner down the path and out of the plethora of basics books. I have already recommended this book as a reading choice for a group I am with. But I am also recommending this book to students basic as well as advanced.I started down this path when Venecia was 8 years old. I absorbed much from this book nonetheless. Of course, I don't think you can't teach an old b!tch new tricks. :-) One of the more interesting experiences that happened to me was reading her words about learning to pay attention to symbols. As I was reading I realized I was ignoring a robin just outside my balcony. He was singing his good morning song and I had my nose stuck in a book.I could go into details about this book, but suffice it to say that I think it is an important piece of work. You will gain from it what you put into it.She takes a four pronged approach exhorting her reader to LEARN, THINK, QUESTION and DO.

The book is said to be directed to everyone who feels that they need something more then the \\"beginning pagan books\\". It had a lot of interesting bits here and there but there is a lot of lecturing. The first few chapters probably annoyed me and ruined some of the amazing content of the rest of the book. It seemed to suggest that you need to read harder books, and differant types of books. This set the tone that if you weren't already constantly reading hard books and only needed to feel validated for the hard work which seemed to equals an advanced pagan according to the book you have a lot to look forward to on your way be advanced.

If you've done the work, grown in the God/dess and are living the spiritual life you've always wanted then I say to you: enjoy your contentment! If you know you can grow further and that there is still more to assimilate, The Second Circle is just what you want to reach for.There are several \`advanced' books for pagans, and most of them are useless or mediocre, falling into the trap of telling us what an advanced practitioner must know rather than honoring our own process of thinking for ourselves.. As a result, most of us look outside of our community for information we can use - gleaning new directions from the fields of psychology, physics, and even other religions. In response to this need, Ms. Rauls spent many years crafting her offering and has given to us a wonderful gift.No guide book can be everything to every pagan, but The Second Circle manages to given consistently useful direction as to where to go to discover the answer for oneself. Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"The Second Circle: Tools for the Advancing Pagan","review":"This is an excellent book to read if you're looking for more than the plague of pagan 101 books that are usually available in books. In this book, Rauls, points readers into directions that will help them move past the 101 books and into the more advanced magical work that awaits the, I particularly like how she urges readers to look into other fields of study than just the metaphysical section of the bookstore. Pagans need wider exposure to other perspectives on life. Better yet, Rauls advocates integrating those perspectives into magical practice.This book also gives good advice on how to do more than just read...practice is essential for really appreciating what this book has to offer and the exercises offered within it accordingly challenge people to do more than recite a spell by rote. Also the focus on personal responsibility is much appreciated by this reviewer as its a skill more people need to learn.Still I don't agree with every point that is made in this book. For instance, Rauls argues that the primary purpose of magic is to connect with Deity, but that's not the only primary purpose for practicing magic. Also I'd have liked to have seen in-text citations and a large bibliography.But with that said, this book is an excellent primer toward helping someone find resources and skills that will move him or her past the 101 and into a real personal relationship with magic. 5 stars out of 5."},{"Title":"The Second Circle: Tools for the Advancing Pagan","review":"This book was not what I was expecting, but I was very pleasantly surprised.

But the meat of the books are pretty much all the same. In the Second Circle Venecia Rauls encourages you to think for yourself, to expand your mind. She give the craft a sense of dignity as well, by taking honest thought into what she is writing. From my experience studing magic is about learning and growing with your mind, body and soul.

Sometimes the most profound epiphanies are down-to-earth and RIGHT there to find if you just use your common sense and think for yourself in creative and innovative ways. Rauls assists the reader in doing just that.Rauls encourages you to use her book as a jumping-off point into further exploration for the advancing pagan.

She gives exercises and tips on developing your OWN path, not just blindly following what the books tell you. She has focused on the inner journey, not how to cast spells or whether the wand goes in the East or South. How to, through study and reflection, develop yourself and your path so that you are ready to step over the threshold into Adepthood should you choose to make that step.This is a book that I will keep for many yeas to come, and would highly suggest it to all advancing pagans.

Rauls explore the inner path of interconnectedness at many levels: archetypal, symbolic, experiential. She writes about living the experience, and validates what happens for us as we progress on the path. The theme of living symbolically points us toward integrating the communications coming to us from the natural world with what we are sending out. The longer I am on this path, the more I see signs and symbols in the world around me. Highly recommended for those who have read all of the 101 books and asked themselves &quot;is that all there is&quot;? The answer is oh no, there is much, much more - a reality that has been elusive to discuss, but is becoming more a part of mainstream pagan experience, when authors like Rauls have the courage and inspiration to write about this level of being and experiencing the spiritual path."},{"Title":"The Second Circle: Tools for the Advancing Pagan","review":"Do you feel like there's nothing left on the New Age shelf that can challenge you?

She does this so wonderfully that I wish I'd had this book two years ago. Reading this book was like reading the story of the past few years of my own life--and as much as the &quot;treasure hunt&quot; for challenging material has helped me grow, it was validating to find that others were on the same search.This book covers where to find books that aid your path in places other than the New Age/Metaphysical shelf; ideas for gaining a rapport with Nature; one of the most thoughtful chapters I've ever read about how to get closer to your deities; and an examination of different &quot;specializations&quot; one can choose.

In fact, the student moves beyond the need for spell books and becomes, in the author's words, a journeyman or apprentice moving toward mastery.This book moves the reader past basic principles, building on what you have already learned. It guides the reader into expanding knowledge of the worlds within, without and even beyond. Through a simple four-step process laid out in each chapter, the beginner moves forward by reading, thinking, questioning and finally doing.There are more places to find spiritual knowledge than the metaphysical section at your local bookstore. Ms. Rauls encourages exploration beyond what you already know into new avenues of study. She states that the occult knowledge really isn't as hidden as we are lead to believe we just have to learn how to see beyond our assumptions and ingrained behaviors to achieve mastery of our chosen Paths.I enjoyed this book, but found little of it useful for me personally. I do recommend it for the person who has moved beyond their newbie status and wants more than the basics so many books seem to be reiterating over and over again. This book is a fresh look and really is what it claims to be - tools for the advancing Pagan.W. Lyon Martin Author/Illustrator of \\"An Ordinary Girl, A Magical Child\\""},{"Title":"The Second Circle: Tools for the Advancing Pagan","review":"I finished this book not too long ago, and I was pleasantly surprised by how helpful it was. Unlike most books that focus on the \\"this is how it is...now do it\\" mindset, Rauls puts the brakes on and goes \\"hey, wait a minute, why are we doing this? Why did we ever do this?\\"If you're feeling at all cynical about Wicca or Paganism in general, definately pick this one up. I know from experience that combing through the same BS over and over again - with no explanation to ease my overly rational mind - can make you frustrated and annoyed with Pagan concepts. \\"Second Circle\\" gives you some commonsense examples and those explanations to let you know that, yeah, there is a reason we are doing this. Somebody didn't just make it up.\\"Advancing\\" is a good term for this work. It isn't \\"Advanced\\" at all - these aren't cryptic, specialized concepts she's presenting. This is perfect for those who are...well, advancing, and on their own. You've read all the \\"...for beginners\\" titles, looked at every website imaginable...and you like this. You want to know more, but don't know where to start. For those who don't have teachers, guides, or a nice friendly coven just around the corner to turn to, \\"Second Circle\\" helps fill in those annoying little gaps of wisdom all \\"101\\" books forget to mention.Rauls doesn't go too in depth about anything - she doesn't mean to. This is a springing board to doing research on your own. While experienced elders are the key for good information, this is definately something all newly serious, solitary pagans should definately pick up."},{"Title":"The Second Circle: Tools for the Advancing Pagan","review":"Contrary to the other reviews, I was very disappointed in this book. From her own web site Venecia states that she has been a Pagan for some 19 years (which is longer than me) but if this is the case, why couldn't I find anything but the obvious in this book?Reading other texts apart from Pagan ones (such as Hawkings, Joseph Campbell and Jung), recycling and treating the land with respect, using the Magickal Pyramid, writing your own rituals etc etc was all part of my BASIC training - however Venecia considers this to be \\"advanced\\" workings???Maybe these techniques might be considered \\"advanced\\" to the eclectics or those who haven't been exposed to a more structured training pattern, but I am stumped to understand why they would be the necessary tools to master in order to become as \\"Master\\" Pagan.For those who haven't been taught such techniques, then yes, I would say that this book is a very good read - however the title is misleading and the material, in my opinion, extremely lacking in substance for someone claiming to have 19 years experience."},{"Title":"The Second Circle: Tools for the Advancing Pagan","review":"If you're Pagan and past the newbie stage, but aren't quite ready to be calling yourself an &quot;elder&quot; and are looking for a non-beginners book to get you going, definitely pick up a copy of The Second Circle. I'll be honest and admit that the author is a good friend of mine, but I don't think I'm being (too) biased when I say that her book covers some material I haven't seen in other &quot;Wicca 201&quot;-type books such as Patricia Telesco's Advanced Wicca (which is available from the same publisher; in fact, the two books seem to complement each other in terms of using different approaches to non-beginner Paganism.)Lots of people might look at a book like this and think, &quot;Cool! This is going to initiate me into the Secret Mysteries of Advanced Paganism and I can just skip all that beginner's stuff!&quot; Well, no. To get the most out of it you should already have a good grasp on how magic works, and a fairly solid understanding of the basics of Wicca or whatever flavor of Neo-Paganism you practice. The book isn't focused on one tradition or Pagan path, and it is mostly geared toward the solitary Pagan (though those belonging to a group or coven can also benefit from it), but it doesn't waste time explaining all that stuff every book for newbies already covers.The Second Circle discusses how the model of apprentice/journeyman/master can be used as an approach to one's own Pagan path. It examines how applying Jung's concept of the &quot;hero's journey&quot; to your own life can produce some surprising insights. There's a chapter on oracles and divination -- not the same old stuff about Tarot layouts and the inaccurate rune information you'll encounter in other books, but how to make oracles like the Tarot and I Ching meaningful to you *personally* and how to view events in your surroundings and in the natural world as oracles. The end of the book offers suggestions for Pagan &quot;specializations&quot; such as priest/ess, oracle, bard, healer, etc., based on one's own inclinations and abilities. There are no spells or rituals in The Second Circle. This book will not hold your hand or walk you through your next stages of learning and development, but will give you food for thought and help you decide how and where your road will take you next.This might sound dry, boring or even intimidating to people who're used to reading Cunningham or RavenWolf (two authors I personally feel are not very useful for non-beginners), but there are many personal anecdotes and some interesting &quot;side&quot; material included here that keeps the book very readable. Nearly everything in this book comes from the author's own experiences as a Pagan for over fifteen years. Rauls is a professional technical writer, and knows how to present complex material clearly and in a way that the reader should find useful and easy to understand.As I mentioned before, people looking for quick and easy techniques that will turn them into An Instant Advanced Pagan are going to be disappointed; the suggestions given here won't do anything for you unless you're willing to work on your own self-improvement. However, The Second Circle should inspire you to further augment your basic knowledge and practice and set you on the way to deepening your spirituality and finding your niche."},{"Title":"The Second Circle: Tools for the Advancing Pagan","review":"I bought this book based almost exclusively on the the rave reviews it received here at Amazon and on the fact that it claimed to be a book for the advancing pagan.For whatever reason, and perhaps this is a misunderstanding on my part, I thought this book was going to be about spiritual development. In other words, rather than a book that was going to teach me more about divination and what books to read, I was expecting a book that would discuss spiritual unfolding, and the ways we deepen our relationship to the sacred, and the ways we manifest the sacred in the ways we live. I had expected it to be something that said, \\"Now that you're past the basics (of knowing how and what to do) let's talk about the why and the where and address some of the difficulties you may face along the way.\\"In that respect, then, I was disappointed. The book is, in a lot of ways, the culmination of information and dragged-out debates one can find at any quasi-intelligent pagan message board or mailing list. This book suffers the same problem so many other books in the genre face--a basic lack of spirituality, a basic lack of an understanding of faith, and a lack of focus on the individual as a spiritual being and not just as a *pagan* operating under the traps of *paganism*. I think pagans would be better served by understanding how to enrich and deepen their spiritual selves as non-Abrahamic followers than being told where to go study and what to go study next. Any intelligent person with a minimum of research skills can figure that out.It wasn't a bad book, hence the three stars. It just fell so far short of what I had hoped it to be. I ended up keeping it for about three days and then I gave it to a friend, a newish pagan, who I thought could use the direction the book offered."},{"Title":"The Second Circle: Tools for the Advancing Pagan","review":"The author asked me to review this book, and I was very favorably impressed.The author first discusses how you know when you're ready to progress, the apprentice/journeyman/master system as a model for the pagan community. Then she systematically explores the steps that are needed to move from one level to the next. In her final chapters, she discusses how to choose your focus or focci.My favorite three sections were the chapter on how to find advanced pagan books (her approach closely mirrors my own), the chapter on new ways of thinking, and the final chapter on how to choose your focus.As a pagan, Rauls is somewhat conservative in what she suggests, and there aren't a lot of brand-new ideas to be found. Also, I think the book is lacking a chapter that truly focuses on mastery, rather than the journeyman/woman level, as well as ideas of \\"where to go when you're past the scope of this book.\\" This is why I gave it four stars instead of five.This is a must for pagans who are ready not to be beginners anymore! Those who have already moved to an advanced level will be familiar with much of what Rauls discusses, but I found that it made explicit a number of ideas that had been germinating intuitively in my consciousness. There are also some interesting metaphors, tips, and book suggestions you won't want to miss. Definitely the latest in a new trend towards serious advanced pagan books. Publishers and authors, keep them coming!"},{"Title":"The Second Circle: Tools for the Advancing Pagan","review":"This is one of several books on Paganism 201 that have come out recently. It's definitely recomended!The comparison of the pagan path to the progression of apprentice - journeyman - master is aptly utilized. I'm also very impressed by the book chapter, wherein Rauls shows the reader the many different avenues that can be travelled outside of the metaphysical section. That';s where paganism 201 can really be found!I'm also fond of all the Jungian imagery she brings in. She talks particularly about his concept of synchronicity, and how it relates to magical practice. Definitely another good lead for the intermediate seeker.And I do have to give her two thumbs up for explaining the differences between pets and familiars. Her discussions on magic, particularly how deities aren't always necessary, and the ethics of magic, are also highly recomended reading!I do have a few complaints. On p. 24, she says that all alchemical texts were really just referring to sex--in actualoty, sex is just one way alchemy can be interpreted; the original alchemists were speaking both of the literal physical components as well as personal enlightenment. Also, I think her chapter on omens and synchronicity shpuld have warned that people very easily can create self-fulfilling prophecies, *looking* for ways to prove what they *think* (subconsciously) will happen and ignoring other signs (ie, anything long and cylindrical being called a cigar).In her section on visiting magical spaces created by others, either ancient or modern, she neglected to tell people not to mess with others' ritual areas--ie, if you see a sand painting by a modern Native, don't add things to it just because you think you should! And, on p. 134, she says that animal sacrifice is illegal. It is, in fact, legal, according to the 1993 US Supreme Court ruling 508 US 520, the Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye vs. City of Hialeah. Also, she harps on the \\"evils\\" of illegal drugs (and some legal, such as salvia), but then advocates the use of legal drugs for magic--including alcohol. A drug is a drug, and all drugs can cause a useful state of consciousness, depending on dosage. The reason so many people overdose or have bad trips is because of misinformation, which perpetuates the bad stereotypes.Finally, I really didn't like the final chapter. She talks about \\"roles\\" within paganism, such as healer, warrior, bard, oracle, etc. I think this gives the idea that you *have* to specialize in something--I tend to agree with Robert Heinlen: \\"Specialization is for insects\\". We are all healers, warrior, scribes, and oracles--and whatever else we need to be.However, overall, I would recommend this book to someone looking to branch out. I've been a pagan and a magician for a decade, and I really could have used this book about 7 years ago. This is an incredibly realistic look at what options are available to the intermediate pagan, without a ton of fluff and filler. It even got me thinking some about where I am now--and that says to me that it's a worthwhile read for anyone, just to get you thinking about your path and where you are on it. I'd especially pick it up if I was feeling stuck or discouraged--there are some really good ideas in here!"},{"Title":"The Second Circle: Tools for the Advancing Pagan","review":"When I started reading this book I often wondered why some of the excellent material wasn't ever presented in Wicca 101. As I read on and really started to understand what the author was saying, I realized it was because you really do need to be a bit farther down the Path to understand what was being said. But more importantly, why these things are part of advanced training and growth and especially how to apply them.I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for advanced material. But don't just read it, really take in what the author is saying."},{"Title":"PEACE OUT: NEW KIDS ON THE BLOCK","review":"The New Kids on the Block as civil rights workers in teen fiction??? Yes, it is possible with this book.En route to a show, the Boston 5 help a Native American reservation and use their star power to bring the plight of this group to their predominately Anglo target audience.Although I intially bought it when I was in Junior High because Donnie had a staring role in this predictable adventure, some parts of this book are really incredible when it is understood that the New Kids were a very early and original version of the boy bands of today. Yet, because the author's attempt does not create a modern day Billy Jack (where a peace activist provides shady justification for his use of violence while helping Native American children) it is far more interesting than it could have been.Throughout most of the story, Donnie and the others act as mentors to the American Indian youth and learn about their friend's lives. Although the mentor plot is some what condescending in parts (after all, the book does not mention that Native Americans such as Lenoard Peltier and the American Indian Movement have long been at work on these issues) it also is a good attempt at trying to reach young minds.While not at all known for writing political books, the authors are careful to avoid preaching to the target readers, and enough material is woven into the otherwise flimsy storyline to encourage children to think about others who may be different from themselves. Since the 1980's was filled with doomsday reports that 60's style activism was all but dead in the age of greed, this remained a nice suprise.At the same time, there are moments where older readers (even those who grew up with NKOTB) will detect the saccharine plot and wish for something more substantial. Duh, of course the New Kids are going to help the less fortunate and help expand the conciousness of their fans.Still, not bad for a pre-teen marketed group. Donnie's not Abbie Hoffman or Martin Luther King, but he is given some nice lines in the blook."},{"Title":"Gregg College Keyboarding and Document Processing Kit 1 (Lessons 1-60)","review":"If you can't type then you wouldn't be buying this.

Heyerdahl's exploits indeed do come across as completely fantastic, as if from an imaginged story. This is mainly because important misadventures were not included in his text, and only after interviewing island natives and a careful look at his discoveries and methods were such things discovered. I reccomend this book to anyone who wishes to read about the great adventures of a single man and his crew aboard a raft, I do not reccomend this work to be taken completely literally and as a scholarly report. If such a book appeals to you, by all means, read it and enjoy it, but I highly suggest doing your homework before accepting his journey as full truth."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"I made some Mormons angry over my reviews of books that defend the Book of Mormon, and they have been slamming my reviews. Your \\"helpful\\" votes are appreciated. ThanksOn Kon-Tiki: I absolutely got lost in this magnificent adventure. Nevertheless, Heyerdahl's theory that civilization was spread around the world by some lost white race is simply bogus racism. Still, I enjoyed all his books, including \\"The Ra Expeditions,\\" and \\"Aku-Aku.\\"It is sad to think that Heyerdahl's career as a fearless adventurer is marred by his zealous devotion to a dated idea. Yes, Peruvian Indians could have crossed the Pacific, but it is more likely that contact came from the other way. At any rate, Heyerdahl manufactured the archaeological evidence he found on Easter Island.In the July 2002 issue of the \\"Smithsonian Magazine,\\" Richard Conniff demonstrated that Heyerdahl actually paid the natives to make reed-boats relics (Kon Artist?\\" was the title). \\"A good story,\\" said Conniff, \\"can be so compelling that teller and subject become entrapped together in its charms....\\" (p. 28). This astute observation could apply to novels claimed to be actual history, and anyone interested in the Book of Mormon should give it long thought.Heyerdahl wrote about Pedro Pate, an Easter Islander and how Pate found a two-masted reed boat in a cave. Conniff wrote: \\"I showed Pate a two-page photograph of the reed boat from Heyerdahl's book, and he grinned. He'd carved the boat himself, he said. Dubious, I offered him $100 to carve such a boat now, 37 years later, and he accepted.\\" \\"A few days later, he presented me with the 18-inch-long reed boat he had carved. It was as good as the one in the book\\" (p. 29).In \\"The Ancient American Civilizations,\\" Friedrich Katz asked some very hard questions of Heyerdahl's theory.\\"If the Polynesians really do come from America, why do their chronicles record the exact opposite direction, naming South-East Asia as their place of origin? Why is their language first and foremost related to South-Asiatic and Malayan languages? Finally, as Trimborn remarked, 'Were not the Polynesian Vikings, rather than the Indians, not the sailors who crossed the high seas?'\\" (p. 18).Heyerdahl should also be criticized for playing word games, selecting a word here and there, but ignoring the whole language. Many linguists criticized this erroneous method of relating two ancient peoples. See Robert Wauchope's magnificent little book, \\"Lost Tribes and Sunken Continents: Myth and Method in the Study of the American Indians.\\" See my review.Lost Tribes and Sunken Continents Myth Method in theMormon writers frequently cite Heyerdahl because he proved that ancient voyages across the oceans were possible--an idea going back hundreds of years and not new with Heyerdahl. Very few scholars ever denied that such ancient voyages were possible.But ah, there's the rub, as Hamlet said. If they occurred, what would be the effect on an entrenched native culture? The Book of Mormon has ancient voyages (the Jaredites were supposed have crossed the ocean on a 344-day voyage in eight submarines in about 2,000 BC). It is primarily about the great civilizations the Jaredites and Nephites established in the Americas.Robert Sharer summarizes the modern state of knowledge in his heavy and authoritative book, \\"The Ancient Maya.\\" Sharer writes:\\"After more than a century of gathering and analyzing archaeological evidence, we have discovered nothing to support the idea of intervention by people from the Old World.\\" \\"This is not to say that accidental contacts between the Old and New World peoples could not have occurred before the age of European exploration\\" (p. 6).\\"On the basis of the available evidence, then, the courses of cultural development in the New and Old Worlds seem clearly independent of each other and devoid of significant contact until 1492\\" (intro., p. 7).The ancient Maya civilization, Sharer continues, \\"are to be \`explained' not as a product of transplanted Old World civilization, but as the result of the processes that underlie the growth of any culture, including those that develop the kind of complexity we call civilization.\\"\\"The idea, which either explicitly or implicitly asserts that the peoples of the New World were incapable of shaping their own destiny or developing sophisticated cultures independently of Old World influence, is still popular in quarters.\\"\\"But this is but one more popular myth devoid of fact, for the evidence points unmistakably toward the evolution of civilization in the New World independently of developments in the Old World.\\" See Sharer's book and my review.The Ancient Maya, 6th EditionNone of these serious criticisms of the claims of Mormons or of Heyerdahl's theories, however, should detract from Heyerdahl's great adventures. His accounts of his raft voyages are breathless and compelling reading.For a masterful telling of Polynesian history (especially about Easter Island) by a scholar with a Moari heritage, read the essential book \\"Vikings of the Pacific,\\" by Peter H.

Not that I need loss of life or violent hurricanes for excitement, but a &quot;major event&quot; was the daily circling of dolphins, which Heyerdahl calls to our attention at least ten times. This alone attests to the opinion that the book is not organized or written well. It is a loosely conected batch of ramblings. Perhaps some of the power was lost in the translation, but in general, the story rates right up there with my 3rd grade narrative on my summer vacation."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"I finished this book a few months after Heyerdahl's grandson completed his own Kon-Tiki adventure taking the path of his grandfather from Peru to the South Sea Islands on a balsa wood raft. Will a book be the result of this most recent Heyerdahl excursion? Time will tell.It will be hard, however, for the younger Heyerdahl to top his elder's classic saga. This is a wonderfully clear read for all ages and a self-portrait of a good, decent, brave man who did something because he knew it could be done.The highlights for me are the descriptions of the marine life Heyerdahl and his five compatriots encounter on their trip, including the massive blue shark whale, the dolphins, and the playful flying fish. The \\"homecoming,\\" in which the six Scandinavians are welcomed by the Polynesian people in an elaborate ceremony, is also delightful and a wonderful way to conclude the adventure.KON-TIKI deserves its classic status and should be read by anyone looking to see how resillient the human spirit (and body, for that matter) really is."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"Kon-Tiki is the story of some Scandinavians who sail across the Pacific in an Incan raft made of balsa, in order to lend credence to a cultural-diffussionist theory hypothesized by the author and leader of the \\"adventure,\\" Thor Heyerdahl. (The theory is that Polynesia was colonized from the east, South America. The voyage across the Pacific was to prove that it was possible for ancient Peruvians to cross the ocean. However, the voyage does not prove Heyerdahl's theory.) The book goes into great detail describing the encounters of the crew onboard out on the open ocean including an encounter with a whale shark, a rare Gempylus, circling dolphins, flying fish so abundant that they fly onto the raft's deck whereupon they can be gathered for food, whales, and sharks. The men lived off the sea by fishing and trapping rain water, braving the elements in a 40-foot long raft for 101 days before finally shipwrecking upon a reef surrounding a small island.The book is well written and an enjoyable, absorbing read."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"If you feel really crummy, you are getting really desperate and you absolutely have to cheer up, this is the book for you!

(Many experts said this was impossible.) I loved this book and was pulled in from the very first page. I love true stories of people who throw caution to the wind and have astonishing and unique adventures. Imagine sailing over 4,000 nautical miles on a raft. I learned a great deal about sea life as I read the book. I found myself going to the web to find more facts about the fish and other marine life. Also incorporated into the book is legend and lore about Polynesian culture and history. Including Easter Island. I spent 2 weeks on Easter Island, and have a special fascination with it. I enjoyed this book immensely!"},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"The idea seems crazy because it is: Prove the possible validity of a scorned ethnographic theory by sailing over 4,000 miles across the world's largest ocean, laying your life and those of five companions on nine balsa-wood logs held together by rope. History would be made, if not of the kind author and expedition leader Thor Heyerdahl imagined.\\"Ours was a journey with an objective, and we did not want to be classed with acrobats who roll down Niagara in empty barrels or sit on the knobs of flag staffs for 17 days,\\" he writes.Oh well. Heyerdahl wanted to prove it possible for ancient Peruvians to colonize various Pacific islands, and managed instead to prove man's ability to realize the impossible fortified with little more than bravery. As feats go, it's a little like missing the Moon and landing on Mars. No one would remember the Kon-Tiki 65 years after its voyage, or spoken about it in classrooms around the world for two generations, if it had achieved a mere scientific objective.As a literary endeavor, \\"Kon-Tiki\\" the book leaves me somewhat flat. Published in 1948, one year after the expedition itself, it's an adventure story in which adventure is nearly entirely absent apart from the fact Heyerdahl and his companions are on this creaking raft in the first place. Other than early steering troubles on the Pacific's unforgiving Humboldt Current, a rough encounter with a whale shark, a close shave with another shark, and a wave-ripped landing, all described in a curious, detached way, what we get is a fairly placid ride. There are arresting observations of oceanic life, especially as the Kon-Tiki becomes a kind of lifeform itself, with crabs and barnacles finding safe harbor in its wood, plants growing around its edges, and pilot fish swimming in formation beneath. But there are many lulls in the story, too.What was it like for six men traveling in such close quarters and such uncertain circumstances? \\"No two of these men had men before, and they were all of entirely different types,\\" Heyerdahl states early on, warning of \\"the danger of psychological cloudburst\\" there. But nothing more is ever stated about the interpersonal relations aboard the Kon-Tiki; we don't even get to know any of these Norwegians (and one Swede) well enough to tell them apart beyond their names.The book does make a strong case for the fortitude of man, whether ancient or modern, provides some fine nature writing, and occasional gleamings of welcome humor. Heyerdahl makes a strong case for his belief in Mesoamerican settlement of the Pacific islands, even if his voyage doesn't prove anything. [The Kon-Tiki not only required towing out to sea but made an inauspicious landfall if one is to believe in the viability of his theory.] More than anything, it's time well spent with an interesting group of men doing a rather incredible thing, even if they were more impressed with the theory behind it than the feat itself."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading Kon-Tiki by Thor Heyerdahl.

But his thesis on this topic was ridiculed because no one would believe that the pacific ocean could be crossed by a flimsy raft made of balsa wood and bamboo. So Heyerdahl decides to prove IT IS possible by building a raft using exactly the same materials the ancient Peruvians used and sailing off the coast of Peru hoping to eventually reach Polynesia.Nearly every step off his journey was filled with nay sayers who said he was crazy and \\"experts\\" who variably told him he was going to die, the raft was going to break apart, or the balsa wood would absorb the sea water and sink. He ignored them all. When they told him balsa trees of the size he needed no longer existed along the coast, he took a jeep deep into the jungles through flooded roads and GOT his trees. Which then they floated down to the ocean in a river.Heyerdahl is keenly aware of his surroundings and describes his voyage vividly and in simple prose. I could smell the sea breeze and feel the spray of the ocean. It was like taking a mini vacation every time I sat down with this book. You'll swim with whale sharks and get caught in ferocious storms. The six men caught sharks with their hands and even had a pet parrot. I suppose all self respecting seamen need to have a parrot.The ending to this book was surprising but perfect. It brings the story full circle and could not have ended any other way. So prepare yourself a margarita, kick back, and begin a sea adventure."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"Kon-Tiki starts with an idea, conceived during Heyerdahl's stay on a South Seas island researching his doctoral thesis: could Polynesia have been colonized by trans-Pacific emigres from the pre-Colombian cultures of South America?A true scientist, Heyerdahl isn't satisfied with deciding &quot;yes&quot; - he must test the theory! In the hands of a lesser man this would have produced a musty old thesis collecting dust on the back shelf of an anthropology library. Instead, Heyerdahl marshals five friends of heroic spirit, acquires 9 giant balsa wood logs and some other supplies, and within a few months he sets sail from Peru to cross the Pacific. Drinking fresh water stored in hollowed-out bamboo shafts and eating fish that leap aboard the raft, they make their way across the ocean, well knowing that despite the advanced radio technology of 1936, their chance of rescue in the event of mishap is nil.The only sea book I can think of to rival this for sheer interest and adventure is Verne's &quot;20,000 Leagues under the Sea,&quot; - a fantasy. Heyerdahl's work is true, and his heroic heart shines through in every word. His love and reverence for the ocean and the primitive culture he sought to imitate, combined with his scientific clarity of exposition, make it a joy to read and will instill the sea-lust into even the most devoted landlubber.I think everyone ought to read this book, for sheer pleasure, and as an example of what can be done with stout heart, clear head, and good will. I recommend it to you without any reservation."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"\\"Kon Tiki\\" is one of the great adventure stories of all time. In 1947, six young Norwegians floated in a balsa-wood raft from Peru to the Polynesian islands of the South Seas. The trip took them 101 days and they traveled 4,300 nautical miles across the Pacific without seeing a single other boat or ship. Only occasionally were they able to communicate with the outside world by radio, and the possibility of rescue should their primitive raft sink or break up in the heavy seas they often experienced was slim to none.The journey was inspired by the theories of Thor Heyerdahl who speculated that the ancient civilizations of Peru had floated across the Pacific to reach the Polynesian islands. Scoffed at by scientists, Heyerdahl organized the expedition to prove that a raft crossing of the Pacific was possible. It was a foolhardy stunt -- but makes for a great story.\\"Kon Tiki\\" tells the story of the expedition from beginning to the end when the crew of the raft is marooned on an idyllic paradise isle in the South Pacific. Rereading the book after many years, I was most impressed with how isolated and empty the Pacific Ocean was and how unexploited was its sea life in 1947. I fear that such is no longer the case.Heyerdahl's theories of oceanic migrations from the Americas to Polynesia are still pooh-baahed by archaeologists today, although it seems that the sweet potato by some means made it from Peru to Polynesia in pre-historic times. Whatever your opinion may be regarding Heyerdahl as a scientist the story of the \\"Kon Tiki\\" is unique and original. Read it and weep because the opportunity for an adventure of such scope and daring is no longer possible in our over-crowded world.Smallchief"},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"I have just finished reading this book straight through. In and of itself this statement alone is high praise for any book since I have only done that a few times prior. The story grabbed me hopelessly, only to release me upon it's unwelcome finale. Even then my psyche was thoroghly unwilling to release the warm embrace of Kon Tiki's quest into the primitive and yet tranquil oneness with our world's awesome power and beauty. &quot;Whether it was 1947 B.C. or A.D. suddenly became of no significance. We lived, and that we felt with alert intensity. We realized that life had been full for men before the technical age also--in fact, fuller and richer in many ways than the life of modern man. Time and evolution somehow ceased to exist; all that was real and that mattered were the same today as they had always been and would always be. We were swallowed up in the absolute common measure of history--endless unbroken darkness under a swarm of stars.&quot; This page was earmarked by the book's previous reader, and I immediately shared his or her affection for the page; specifically, this quote. It, more than any other, summed up the emotions stirred in me by the author's gracious sharing over the years and miles of an adventure that I at once became a part of in my heart and soul. I am a brutish, biker-type dude. Generally speaking, tears are unacceptable in my &quot;Big Twin&quot; thundering realm of machismo. However, upon reaching the stories conclusion I was hard pressed to hold back...STRIKE THAT...I was unable to fight back (hard as I tried) salty tears unexplainable. Feeling an uncontrollable urge to let my girlfriend in on the moment, I struggled desperately to choke out for her the final few paragraphs. I now sense an overpowering need to alter my lifestyle; and will at the very least be haunted by this desire for a very long time! Thank you so much Mr. Heyerdahl, et.al."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"Do you like reading books that have adventure and keep you in suspense? Then Kon-Tiki by Thor Heyerdahl is the book for you. Kon-Tiki is about a few explorers that wanted to prove that the inhabitants of a certain island in the Pacific came from Peru. The explorers start off at Peru, build a raft, and set off to prove their theory on their 2000-mile journey. On their trip they discover interesting things about sea life. They encountered whales, dolphins, sharks and other amazing creatures of the sea on their journey and learned a few things about them. One of my favorite parts about this book is when the explorers catch their food and interact with some of the sea creatures. They use the resources around them to catch their food and discover that living at sea is not as boring as it seems. This is one of the best books of its time. It has every thing to make you enjoy the story. Kon-Tiki will make you laugh and make you nervous. It will keep you in suspense and you will discover amazing things about the sea."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"Early in \\"Kon-Tiki,\\" as Thor Heyerdahl and his compatriots are a assembling a make-shift raft to float across the Pacific, a government official calls Heyerdahl to his office.\\"Are your parents living?\\" the official asks.Yes, says Heyerdahl.\\"Your mother and father will be very grieved when they hear of your death,\\" says the official.It was a reasonable assumption. What Heyerdahl and his five Norwegian friends were proposing was beyond audacious -- it was foolhardy, by any standard. Here were six young men, none with sailing experience, who were building their own Inca-style raft out of balsa logs and hemp ropes and planning to sail it across thousands of miles of ocean from Peru to the South Seas.Surely, they would die.Of course, they didn't. For over 100 days, the Kon-Tiki bobbed along like a cork in high and low seas making slow but steady progress before eventually landing the men on an island in French Polynesia. In doing so, Heyerdahl, an anthropologist, had made his case that it was possible that the South Sea islands had been populated by immigrants floating on rafts from South America.It was a remarkable accomplishment, and while it is a tale imperfectly told, \\"Kon-Tiki\\" is quite worth reading.This is a book where the events carry the writing. For the most part, Heyerdahl does an able job of presenting the story, but he curiously skips over some parts. For instance, he doesn't explain clearly why he allowed the voyage to begin by having the Kon-Tiki towed out of port and many miles out to sea. After all, wasn't the point of the expedition to show that the raft could make it all the way on its own? (There may have been a good reason -- perhaps to avoid shipping traffic -- but he doesn't say what it is.)Because the trip actually turned out to be easier than expected, the middle section becomes somewhat flat. The crew had plenty of fish to eat, and collected rain water to drink. They found ways to make the craft easy to steer.Also, while Heyerdahl is detailed in his descriptions of the fish they saw while crossing the ocean, he fails to illuminate the personalities of his five crewmates. Even by the end of the book, they remained indistiguishable in my mind.These are weaknesses, yes, but hardly fatal ones, and the overall boldness of this adventure is what carries this book. There are exciting moments -- when one of the men falls overboard and is nearly lost, and when the Kon-Tiki dramatically crashes into a reef at the end of its voyage. And the crew's short stay on an island inhabited by just 127 villagers is memorable for its idyllic picture of the South Seas lifestyle."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"Although the middle part of this book drags (which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5), I was really satisfied when I finished reading this book. I was on vacation in Oslo and had visited the Kon-Tiki museum. I had never heard of Thor Heyerdahl before, but from what I saw at the museum, I was very fascinated and intrigued by the story of his trip across the Pacific on a balsa-wood raft. The week I came home I immediately started reading this book, and I was not disappointed. I was really fascinated by the accounts of interaction with sea animals, whales, sharks, dolphins, etc. that I immediately wanted to go sailing on a wide open sea in order to see all these exotic animals that Heyerdahl and his crew encountered. This book allows you to live vicariously and experience three months worth of sailing on a raft in the Pacific Ocean. This is a definite read for the sea lovers and travelers out there in the world who yearn for adventure."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"The voyage of the Kon-Tiki ranks as one of the great adventures of ourera. But was Heyerdahl's journey that of a &quot;luckyadventurer&quot; whose theories could be justly dismissed as&quot;junk science&quot; by the archaeological establishment? Or didhis knowledge that the seas were virtual conveyor belts unveil thepossibility that ancient peoples were not limited to migration overland bridges but could more easily have voyaged in rafts over openseas? Tom Dillehay's dating of the Monte Verde site in Chile to 12,500years ago -- hundreds of years before the Mackenzie corridor openedthe remote possibility of Beringia (dry Bering Sea) migration -- seemsto have driven a stake into the theory that man first migrated by landto the Americas. Now paleontologist Walter Neves has revealed that a11,500-year-old skull from central Brazil (&quot;Luzia&quot;) has theround eyes, large nose and pronounced chin characteristic ofAustralian aborigines and native Africans. Will Heyerdahl's theoriesfinally receive the attention in academic circles they have longdeserved?"},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"As a youngster, I watched the documentary of this amazing story and was immediately hooked on it. A few years later, I read the book and was enthralled. Dr. Heyerdahl's ultimate 'field study' to prove that ancient peoples could cross vast stretches of ocean held my attention from beginning to end; I read the entire book in just a couple of days. Heyerdahl's other works such as &quot;Fatu-Hiva,&quot; and &quot;Aku-Aku&quot; are also rousing stories of his real-life exploits. However, it is &quot;Kon-Tiki&quot; which retains the best spirit of adventure and human endeavor, and thus remains my personal favorite.As the above title states, there is a sad note to include in this review: I learned yesterday (4/18/02) that Dr. Heyerdahl died of a brain tumor at age 87. May he rest in peace."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"This is an immensely inspiring account of human adventure and perseverance. It sets man against sea, thin odds against practical ingenuity, conventional academic thought against the independent thinker. This four thousand mile journey across barren, treacherous seas can't help but inspire the would-be adventurer. The adventurers' single mindedness and determination, in the face of naysaying world experts (who said they would never succeed, and that their boat would sink at mid-sea), shows how determination and perseverance can lead to accomplishing what some may view as impossible goals, and in so doing it pushes the boundaries and commonplace notions of what is possible. We see that not all adventurous fools and are so foolish; that determination can see one across a massive barren and stormy ocean, real or metaphorical. On completing the book, all that remains is for the reader to respond to its call for adventure and begin plans for achieving personal goals or adventures ... all the tools needed for accomplishment are demonstrated in this voyage. In a corporate world where too often money is the primary force in leading us to act, where the value of an activity is measured by its potential financial payback, it is refreshing to be reminded of other motivations for action, and of other rewards. Can this book reawaken a spirit of adventure which may seem irrelevant to modern social or commercial life? Can it remind us how to dream and the virtues of following our dreams? I am reminded in these pages how, why, and where I can find adventure ... one walks away from the book convinced that anything is possible, should I choose to look beyond conventional thought or lifestyle and reach for the stars."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"Thorough living research gave rise to the journal it created - \\" The Kon Tiki Expedition.\\" Thor Heyerdahl had the courage to prove his theories and provided the world with answers to the way in which humanity spread to various parts of the world- to the Pacific and to Polynesia.This nonfiction work can be read by a cross section of people-it has been used a school text. Highly recommended for all readers."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"With fond memories of poring over a colorful \\"youth\\" version of Kon-Tiki when I was a school boy in the 1960s, I recently picked up a copy of Thor Heyerdahl's full-length recounting of his exhilarating 4,300 mile open-sea expedition, to understand the background and motivation behind the voyage in more detail. Kon-Tiki is a fascinating book, documenting the even more fascinating true story of why and how six courageous men set sail on a primitive balsa wood raft from Peru in April 1947, blown along on their hundred-day journey to Polynesia by westward trade winds, the same air currents that might have carried early (possibly even the earliest) settlers to these islands 1,500 years ago.Ostensibly, the purpose of the voyage was an exercise in experimental archaeology and ethnography, to demonstrate that a fair-skinned, reddish-haired people, originating from \\"where the current comes in from the Atlantic . . . instead of in the more temperate [Asian] regions where civilizations . . . have had easier conditions for their development,\\" could have, as some cultural clues suggest, sailed westward from the Americas to become the first human inhabitants of the South Pacific, including Easter Island, Hawaii and Tahiti, beginning around 500 A.D. However, as the author himself points out in the brief Appendix, \\"My migration theory . . . was not necessarily proved by the successful outcome of the Kon-Tiki expedition. What we did prove was that . . . the Pacific islands are located well inside the range of prehistoric craft from Peru.\\"Beyond its (controversial) ethnographical underpinnings, Kon-Tiki contains a wealth of interesting ancillary information about botany (how the sap in the core of freshly logged balsa wood prolongs flotation, while the softness and absorbency of its outer layers protects ropes and prevents fraying), ichthyology (the gigantic and ugly whale shark, deadly snake mackerel Gempylus, pilot fish, flying fish, how to catch sharks with one's bare hands, how to harvest plankton for a meal, etc.), agriculture (the origins of the sweet potato and palm tree), and cultural anthropology (generosity and warm spirit of the native people on the island of Raroia, where the Kon-Tiki landed, later studied by crew member, Bengt Danielsson).But, most of all, Kon-Tiki is an enthralling and inspiring adventure of a driven man (Heyerdahl) with an idea and a mission, who succeeds, against the advice of experts (\\"If we added up all that the different experts, each in turn, had pointed out . . . there was not a length of rope, not a knot, not a measurement, not a piece of wood in the whole raft which would not cause us to founder at sea\\"), in accomplishing what common opinion deems impossible. Apparently, such enthusiasm is contagious (or at least genetic), as the author's grandson (Olav Heyerdahl, Tangaroa expedition, 2006) recently completed a retracing of the Kon-Tiki's 1947 voyage. In the author's enthusiastic words during the raft's harrowing reef crossing at voyage's end, through bubbling \\"witches' cauldron\\" with green walls of sea water towering 25 feet above, \\"Hold on!\\" and \\"Hurrah!\\" Definitely a thrilling story!"},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"4550 Kon-Tiki Across the Pacific by Raft, by Thor Heyerdahl translated by F.

It tells of a 101-day tip from Peru to French Polynesia made in 1947 by six Norwegian men on a raft using balsa logs. It is a very interesting story, and one stands in amazement at the daring of these men, making such a fearful journey, with no support, though they did have radio equipment on board. I found the account totally interest-holding. The author was convinced that people from South America in about 500 A.D. settled in Polynesia. His trip at least proved that the trip was possible. I think the book ranks with other great adventure books I have read, such as Touching the Void, by Joe Simpson (read 9 Sep 2003) and Alone, by Richard E.

To prove his theory that a long-extinct race in South America was actually descended from a people that came from, and then later returned to Polynesia, Heydrahl set out on a remarkable journey. He, along with five others, made a raft out of balsa logs, and without using metal of any form, sailed thousands of miles across the Pacific Ocean. Their adventures and struggles, both on and off the raft, combine to make an incredible tale of knowledge, bravery, and luck."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"This was one of my summer reads and I found it incredibly entertaining. The story of how a bunch of crazy Norwegians, many of whom were WWII vets, floated across the South Pacific on a balsa raft during the middle of the 20th century is one of the best adventure stories I have ever read. The line between scientific investigation and insanity is thin on this one. The men set off to prove a link between Ancient Peruvians and Polynesians by proving that the Peruvians had sailed as far as Polynesia on balsa rafts. The group procures its wood from the dangerous, lawless countryside of Peru, floats it down a river to the sea, and sets forth on an epic adventure on a scrappy looking sail driven raft they slapped together using diagrams based off ancient documents.The accounts of flying fish, battles with sharks, and struggles against the elements are highly entertaining. They drifted across seas drawn by the currents through areas of the ocean free of shipping lanes, an adventure unparalleled for its time. Their raft literally became a home to hundreds of sea creatures. They encountered sea creatures that nobody had ever seen before. Although their voyage seems crazy, it was really done and I was actually relieved when the raft broke up on a reef on a South Pacific Island and the men were able to swim to safety.If you've ever dreamed of doing something crazy in the name of scholarly pursuits, or if you like a good adventure tale, this is a good read. Its also an interesting piece of history and Thor Heyerdahl went on to receive hundreds of awards for his incredible accomplishment."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"I read this book and its companion book, \\"The RA Expeditions\\" several years ago and enjoyed them both very much.

In this case, Thor launches himself into the vast blue waves and has the adventure of a lifetime. Even if you don't study history, this is a great read."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"Immediately after WWII, young Thor Heyerdahl tried to submit a paper to academia outlining his idea that the Polynesian islands were not settled from India and Asia, as was the current wisdom, but rather by people from South America. The problem with this idea, pointed out by a number of people, was that the only boats available to the natives of that area were balsa-wood rafts. It was almost impossible to imagine that such a raft could possibly travel 3,600 miles across open ocean to arrive at the Polynesian Islands intact and with living crew. Some people laughed outright at the idea. Many of them thought the idea was crazy.So, in true mad-scientist form, Heyerdahl said to himself &quot;I'll show them. I'll show them ALL!&quot;. Rather than building a mad-scientist deathray, which would not only be cliche but also out of his field (anthropology), he decided to literally show them. He, himself, would build a balsa-wood raft, adhering precisely to the old designs, and he would personally sail that raft from the coast of South America to one of the Polynesian islands a quarter of the world away.The saga of his quest to first find someone to back him on the journey, someone to crew his raft, a way to BUILD the raft, and finally the incredible adventure of actually taking the _Kon Tiki_ across the greatest ocean on Earth, makes fascinating reading. Such a voyage was something of an effort even for modern machines of its era; had Heyerdahl not done it, no one would have believed it. Instead he set sail and brought the future with him.This did not end Heyerdahl's adventures, but instead began them. Later he developed a theory that the Americas themselves were, at least in part, visited by or settled from ancient Egypt. Since the only boats THEY used to cross oceans were made of reeds, no one would believe it was possible..."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"After noticing numerous similarities between aspects of Polynesian culture and Inca culture, Thor Heyerdahl postulates an ancient connection between the two peoples: he argues that Inca traveled to the South Pacific islands and at least partially colonized them. His theory is immediately dismissed by anthropologists for many reasons. Foremost is the argument that the Inca did not have boats capable of crossing the Pacific. All they had were balsa wood rafts, which the experts argue would never survive the trip. Heyerdahl is so sure he is right, he sets out to prove that it is possible to cross the Pacific in a balsa wood raft by making the voyage himself!He recruits five Scandinavian shipmates and heads down to South America to build a balsa wood raft. After wading through much red tape, his crew finally builds a replica raft and sets sail. Everyone thinks they will likely die on the trip, but they are determined to prove them wrong. And they do. On the way, they have fantastic adventures with sharks, unexplained huge creatures far below the raft, fish jumping on board for breakfast, men overboard, and a final exciting crash landing on a South Pacific island.I can't say enough about how enjoyable this book was, but I also can't help but be sad that in the days of satellite mapping, GPS, and red tape, such adventures now seem out of reach. This book has a bit of everything: science, history, engineering, philosophy, and of course loads of maritime adventure from an era when the world's geography was a little more mysterious."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"It's a great read and an epic journey. What amazed me, even more than the raft itself, was that the crews' relationships with each other survived the trip.

I am totally buying this book as an addition to my library I'm building up for my children. I think the author's passion for the sea, adventure, history and the Polynesian people are inspiring. This book will make you want to see Peru and the Polynesian Islands, and if like me, you've been there already, you'll want to go back with the book in hand.

It was always his favoite, and I remember seeing it in his bookcase when I was a child. I stumbled upon an old first edition, like my Dad's in a bookstore, bought it, and read it in two days. This book is so good -- and so astonishing -- that it reads more exciting than any fiction that I've ever read. This is a great story for anyone yearning for adventure. These six men, alone on a hand-made balsa raft, adrift in the pacific -- by their choice! Just to prove the validity of a theory. What makes this account so astounding is the conviction these men had in their belief and their willingness to risk everything--including their own lives. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"When I was very young my father used to read my brothers, my sister and I books from his collection. Yesterday I picked up this book, by chance, in a store and could not put it down. I bought it, read it last night and realized that this was one of those books that had been read to me so long ago. It's funny to think this, but looking back on it I realize that I always believed the story to be fiction. Nothing like this could ever really happen!...but it DID happen, and not too long ago either. Last night I sat down with this book and could not put it down until it was finished. You are drawn into the planning of the expedition, the day-to-day life of the crew and, by the end of the book, you feel as though you were ON the Kon-Tiki with these six men. You reach the end of the book and instantly crave another adventure, or another thousand pages. I would be doing this book an injustice by trying to explain the feeling it gives the reader, but to say that it has effortlessly toppled every notion I ever had about what makes a &quot;good&quot; book would be very accurate indeed. A must read--for anyone of any age in any country."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"In this classic, Heyerdahl constructs a raft to sail 4,300 nautical miles from Peru to the South Pacific Islands in order to prove his theory that the natives of Peru could have migrated to these islands thousands of years ago. This book contains a great deal of information of interest to scientists. These include the appearance of previously little-known fish, the scope of marine bioluminescense, the deployment of ocean currents, etc. It is interesting to note that the Polynesians realized that the Earth was round. A re-examination of the common belief that prescientific peoples invariably believed in a flat Earth is clearly warranted."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"This book is for the voyeur that wants a window into the lost age of adventure, those years before 1940. The book is rightly regarded as one of the greatest accounts of real life adventures ever written. It paints exhilarating, vivid pictures of risk taking, and of the human hunger for adventure and desire to return to experiencing life through ones primal instincts. This book is about survival, a chase, and pushing the boundaries of what is possible. It sets The Sea against Man, thin odds against practical ingenuity, conventional academic thought against independent, irreverent, defiant thinkers. Reading about the author's 4,000-mile journey across huge expanses of treacherous ocean brings out the would-be adventurer in the reader. The adventurers' single mindedness and determination against all odds and in the face of nay saying experts (who condemned the journey from the start as foolish, and said their voyage never would or could succeed), sets an inspiring example of how determination and perseverance can lead to accomplishing what self-appointed experts and nay Sayers declare impossible. During their voyage the author and his team pushed the boundaries and commonplace notions of what is possible. The author in part wants us to understand that not all seemingly adventurous fools and are so foolish; that determination can see one across barren, stormy oceans, be they real or metaphorical. On completing the book, all that remains is for the reader to respond to its heed, to push ones own limits to their edge. In a corporate world where too often money is the primary force in leading us to act, where the value of an activity is measured by its potential financial payback, it is refreshing to be reminded of other motivations for action, and of other rewards. The ultimate reward of this book is that it can reawaken in the reader a primal instinct to pursue, instincts which often seems irrelevant or far away in our modern, comfortable lives... this book also reminds the reader of how to dream and the virtues of following dreams. The book serves to remind us of how, why, and where to find adventure ... personally, I walked away from the book exhilarated, and convinced that anything is possible, should I choose to look beyond conventional thought or lifestyle and reach for the stars. ***** Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"The theory suggested by Thor Heyerdahl that the islands of Polynesia were settled from sea-faring travelers from South America has been doubly disproved by both language and DNA. So why read this old book copyrighted in 1950?For the sheer adventure of it. Never has an escape from the war-torn modern world come at a greater seductive appeal than in KON TIKI: Across the Pacific by Raft.Crewed by five nutty Norwegians and one brave Swede, Kon Tiki is built from giant balsa trees freshly felled in in the forests at the foothills of the Andes and floated down the river to a naval yard on the coast of Peru. Surrounded by modern warships, the logs are lashed together with rope and a deck and cabin of plaited bamboo is added. Towed out to sea, the strange little craft and crew (six men and one parrot)is caught in the cold Humboldt Current and taken north, then the sail fills with the tradewind and it is swept east toward the islands.Sadly, after two months, the parrot is washed overboard. The remaining crew (six men) learn that the steering watch must wear a safety rope, that it is possible to catch sharks by hand and that the easiest way to make breakfast is to gather up all the flying fish that have jumped on board overnight. The grainy black and white photographs alone are enough to start the reader on a reverie of escaping to Tahiti. This is beach reading of the most dangerous sort!But aside from the sheer adventure, an important point was made by Thor Heyerdahl's voyage. In our modern era we are so impressed with our own technology that it is easy to lose sight of how clever our \\"primitive\\" ancestors were. Heyerdahl built a boat from ancient descriptions and discovered halfway through the voyage that it had a sophisticated steering mechanism which he didn't use since wind and current were taking him in the right direction. Kon Tiki could have made landfall sooner had he aimed for nearer islands. That this remarkable craft survived contact with a reef that had ripped up more modern boats shows that even amateurs could arrive safely. One wonders what the original builders of such crafts could do?"},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"As a youngster, I saw the documentary of this amazing story and was thrilled from the start. Soon thereafter, I read this book entirely in three days, completely enthralled in the narrative. Dr. Heyerdahl had proven his skeptics wrong, demonstrating how an early civilization (in this case, the Native Americans of Peru) could cross the Pacific on a raft to populate what is today Polynesia. Based on the Peruvian legend of the hero Kon-Tiki (later deified) who successfully built and sailed a similar raft many centuries ago.I have since read other Heyerdahl authored works, including &quot;Fatu-Hiva&quot; and &quot;Aku-Aku.&quot; Although they too are extremely rousing, I personally feel a greater spirit of adventure in this story, hence it is my favorite.As mentioned in the title, there is one sad commentary to make: on the day of writing this review (4/18/02), I learned that Dr. Heyerdahl died of a brain tumor at age 87. May he rest in peace."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"Forget idiotic movies like 'Jaws,' these Scandanavian maniacs grab sharks by the tail and kill them for fun.

Not Thor and his band of merry men; they were theoretically convinced and determined to put their tails on the line to prove it. I have never read anything in my life so full of intensity, danger and heroic, romantic adventure.

It's also a great travel epic complete with the quirky locals, the gadget guru, and a group of men willing to risk their lives for an ultimate adventure.Parts of the book did read like a 1960's documentary. I could almost envision the \\"exciting world of color\\" technicolor intro and Thor narrating over the action. But I think it all adds to the ambiance of the book. It makes you realize in days before GPS and sattellite radios how crazy this band of pioneers really were. Also Thor doesn't really get into the emotional implications of first signing on to the expedition, then being at sea with a handful of men for three months. Instead he spiced up the day to day desciptions with detail about sea life and what the crew did to entertain themselves. I would have imagined the trip to be much more monotonous and morale killing then he makes it out to be, but it definitly makes a much more exciting read.I woudl recommend this book to any travel book lover.

It is an adventure that captures the imagination. It might be old, but it is good."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"Although with my luck it would probably sink.Heyerdahl was one of the last great adventurers of our time, and his memoir 'Kon Tiki' is a testimonial of his trials before during and after his grand expedition accross the Pacific. In true adventure fashion he leaves no detail ignored, from the building of the raft, to the opposition he encountered to the myriad of marine life he encountered on the way to the polynesian islands.The reading can be a bit dry at times, but in the end it's worth it. Because when he finally strikes dry land you feel like you've been on the boat with him the whole time and not reading his adventures 50+ years after the fact."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"From the opening sentence to the final period, \\"Kon-Tiki\\" is a page-turner.The story is absurd on its face: One man, obsessed with the idea that the Polynesian islands were colonized by voyagers from South America, can't get anybody to take his theory seriously. \\"They didn't have proper boats,\\" was the argument.Heyerdahl insisted that the colonists had set forth on balsawood rafts. This assertion was met with derision.To prove his theory, Heyerdahl decided to do it himself: to sail from the coast of Peru roughly 4,000 miles to Polynesia. The story of how he assembled a crew of like-minded fools, put together his unlikely craft, and made the incredible journey reads like the best of fiction.Heyerdahl never bogs down the reader with pointless minutia, but he nevertheless treats the reader to details that make the story come to life: the phosporescent plankton, the daily breakfast of flying fish picked up off the deck every morning, the tiny crab who became a pet of the crew. And he doesn't stint on adventure, from the man nearly lost at sea to the harrowing wrecking of the raft on the reefs.\\"Kon-Tiki\\" is simply a great story, engrossing even to those not usually given to reading survival stories."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"Wow!

It was read to me first by my father, and I have since read it twice, soon to be three times. Highly reccomended!"},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"Thor Heyerdahl's masterful retelling of his epic voyage from the shores of Peru westwards across the Pacific. High adventure of the old type. The journey was intended to demonstrate the possibility of transoceanic vaoyages in ancient times, using the most primitive of crafts. He proved his point, in the most direct way possible.But as well as being a daring adventurer, Heyerdahl was a master story-teller, and he enthralls his readers with accounts of the ancient legends of Peru; of the Virachochas, led by Kon Tiki, who were said to have fled from their Andean homeland westwards across the ocean. We hear of the ancient and mysterious ruins around Lake Titicaca, which the Incas told the Spaniards had been built by the Viracochas. These people were said to have been a white-skinned race which had originated far to the north and west.In subsequent years Heyerdahl traced the origin of the Viracochas and the other \\"white\\" Indians of the Americas to the Atlas region of North Africa; and he demonstrated, in the Ra expedition, how ancient sailors from that region could have crossed the Atlantic to reach the Americas.Before he died, Heyerdahl had the satisfaction of seeing everyhting he said fully vidicated by science. To start with, in the early 1990s a forensic toxicology team in Germany, led by Dr Svetlana Balabanova, discovered traces of tobacco and cocaine, two American narcotics, in an Egyptian mummy. After repeated the tests many times, and examining other mummies, they found the same thing again and again.In the meantime, it has become clear that a whole host of American drugs (such as the notorious jimson weed) were known in the Old World in ancient times, and used in the various Mystery Cults to provide initiates with out-of-body experiences. Almost all of this knowledge was suppressed in Europe and the Middle East, where Christianity and Islam took a dim view of such things. It was preserved, however, in the Sanskrit literature of India.A little later in the 1990s an American team of geneticists dicovered a type of European/Middle Eastern mitochondrial DNA (the x haplogroup) in Native American populations. Again, after checking and rechecking for errors, they published their findings. And the percentage of this Old World DNA was highest in groups of Native Americans that were traditionally known as \\"white,\\" such as the Ojibbewa in North America and the Yanomamo in South America.When this is added to the clear evidence that Clovis Man was essentially Caucasian (as Kennewick Man has shown), then there's no doubt that Heyerdahl was right. But how long will it be before this is recognised, and Heyerdahl gets the academic recognition he deserves?"},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"I recently saw a list of bestsellers from my birth year of 1951. Kon Tiki had been #1 throughout most of that year so, out of curiosity, I bought it. It has opened an entire new world to me! Adventure, culture, bravery, aquatic life, and so on! The best book I have read in years!!! Mr. Heyerdahl writes like he is just talking to you in your living room, so down to earth and very entertaining in his calm, methodical approach to situations most of us would run screaming from! I highly recommend this book to everyone, young and old! It is a classic. My dream is to one day travel to the Kon Tiki Museum in Oslo and actually see that magnificent raft. Read this book! You will never forget it."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"Heyerdahl was either extremely ignorant of the sea, completely sure of his hypothesis that ancient peoples traveled the sea in rafts, or both.I worked offshore, and couldn't imagine doing what Heyerdahl did. I've spent my life on the water and the sea just has never been so forgiving in my case. To build a raft for the first time without testing it first against the sea was just madness. But to put out, without the technology we have today, that was just ballsy.In the end, history proved him right, over and over again. Heyerdahl is a man who certainly knows how to put his money where his mouth is. If you want to know about the spirit of those who have the faith to really lean on their convictions, this is a great book.-H"},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"I was very pleased that I stumbled across this book and thoroughly recommend it. In terms of history and the movement of people the book is very important. The idea that the Polynesian islands were populated solely from Asia had to be re-thought after this unbelieveable journey was made, even history books had to be re-written. Before the incredible journey was taken not many poeple thought it possible that a raft could leave the west coast of S.America and reach the polynesian islands solely by nature alone ie current and wind. Most people excepted what scientists wrote ,that is the polynesian islands were populated from the west side of the Pacific(asia)only and no native South Ameicans could have made such a journey especially before technology came into play. But these men had done there homework on sea currents,weather patterns(winds) and construction of the raft, which was constructed using the same materials as they had used in inca times.If you want an insight into how ancient peoples risked everything by sailing into the unknown this is the book for you,its compelling stuff."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"Kon Tiki is one of the best books I have ever read. Thor Heyerdahl describes the journey so vividly, it almost seems as if you were there. This book will transport you into another world far away from the troubles of modern society. Read Kon Tiki, and experience the wonders of primitive sea travel."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"An exciting book by a brave and gifted man, who, in the 1940s, sought to prove his theories that settlers of ancient Easter Island (the most isolated land on earth) might have come from South America. He did so by setting sail on a balsa raft from Peru and going thousands of miles into the Pacific, with a small crew of friends in a remarkable adventure. Heyerdahl was a genius to realize that ancient man need not have been hindered by oceans, which in fact could have acted more like conveyer belts than barriers. (I also recommend his books about the Ra expeditions in reed rafts from Africa to America.) The success of the Kon Tiki mission was a bold and evocative backing up of this general theory, though he also offers other kinds of fascinating evidence along the way. (By the way, I always grit my teeth when I hear modern scientists trying to discredit Heyerdahl by asserting that today's Easter Islanders are Polynesians who came from farther west, which isn't in doubt and wan't to Heyerdahl either. But they are not reading him closely - he suggested an *earlier* migration from South America, which was replaced by Polynesians later on. Perhaps Easter Island was settled twice.) Anyway, a good sea yarn and one of the world's rare radically eye-opening books."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"I read this book when I was in my teens, and I'm happy to see that it has been reprinted. Although I always preferred to read fiction over nonfiction, for some reason I picked this book up and began to read -- and I couldn't put it down. I found great excitement in the real-life adventure of Heyerdahl and his crew building a raft in Peru, then sailing the Pacific in order to prove that people from South America could have sailed to and settled Polynesia long ago. The details of building the draft and getting it to the ocean make the book come alive, as do the details of being on the ocean on nothing bigger than a raft held together with ropes and vines.

He start his narration telling the difficulties of having his studies accepted by scholars. They doubt his theory on the South American natives being the ones to populate the Polynesian islands, because they thought it was impossible for them to reach the islands using just a small raft.That triggered the desire for the author to prove himself right. He started looking for ways of doing this travel, finding crew and financial resources. After solving the financial problems through the sponsor of people from the explorer's club in New York, he start traveling multiple times to Washington to get licenses and approval for using military food and he find his first travelmate, Herman Watzinger. They are joined by Knut Haugland, Bengt E.Danielssen, Erik Hesselberg and Torstein Raaby. The book describes this incredible and marvelous journey taken by six people (five Norwegians and one Sweden) through the Pacific Ocean. Some photos taken by the author are presented in the book. This book shows how much courage those guys needed to have to expose themselves to the wind, the rain, the lack of comfort, and the risk of death just to prove a theory.This book is more than just a traveller's journal.

The book seems unusual in that, on one hand, it provides numerous examples of OTTER input/output files, useful tips on operating OTTER, and a plethora of exercises which, if carried out, will lead to a rapid understanding of the program and how to use it. But on the other hand, the book also works as a formidable introduction to automated reasoning. Starting from basic concepts such as inference rules and unification, and working up to more advanced topics in equational reasoning, one can gain a fairly good introduction to the theory of automated reasoning. My only complaint involves the lack of a good appendix or glossary which lists and summarizes the numerous commands that can be fed to OTTER. Furthermore, many of them are not even indexed, which makes referencing them somewhat tedious. Other than this, I highly recommend the book. However, I would encourage the novice to first study a more user friendly logic programming environment, such as swi prolog, before attacking OTTER. For having some experience with prolog programming will allow the reader to compare and contrast the two automated-reasoning methodologies. As for OTTER itself, I consider it more useful than a prolog interpreter since it allows for the use ofstrategies for finding the desired proof or computation. On the other hand, it is a living embodiment of the fact that there is much progress that still needs to made in developing useful and powerful tools for automating logic and mathematics."},{"Title":"Automated Reasoning With Otter","review":"Can one take any theorem or conjecture in mathematics and translate it into the language of OTTER in order to either prove the theorem or verify or disprove the conjecture? Unfortunately, the answer is no, as the translation of most of the statements of mathematics into the clause form required by OTTER will take a lot more research to bring it into fruition. The success of such research would be signal a major breakthrough in automated reasoning or automated theorem proving, as one could engage machines in the generation of new mathematical results and the settling of outstanding conjectures.A variant of OTTER, called EQP, resolved the &quot;Robbins conjecture&quot; in 1997, via the efforst of the mathematician/computer scientist William McCune. First studied in 1933 by Herbert Robbins, the conjecture asserts that every Robbins algebra is Boolean. The proof took 8 days to complete and made international headlines. The success of this proof motivated many to look more deeply into OTTER, and since it is in the public domain, anyone curious about it can obtain it and use it. This book gives a comprehensive and very understandable overview of OTTER, and can be read by anyone with a background in mathematical logic. Some knowledge of logic and functional programming will help too. In relation to OTTER, one goal worth pursuing is to find out to what extent various fields of mathematics can be translated into the (clausal) language of OTTER. Point-set, geometric, and algebraic topology come to mind, as well as algebraic geometry in the guise of schemes and functors of points. Some automated proofs have been found in topology and algebraic geometry. It remains to be seen whether most, if not all the concepts in these fields can be expressed in a language that will enable automated proofs to be given.OTTER is an ancronym for Organized Techniques for Theorem Proving and Effective Research&quot;, and after a forward to the book by Larry Wos, the author gives an introduction to the language in chapter 1. His concern is with applied logic and not theoretical developments, so the presentation is informal, and therefore useful to those who are anxious to learn OTTER and apply it. Theoretical developments are not completely ignored though, and throughout the book one can see to what extent expressions can be regarded as clauses and then translated into the language of OTTER."},{"Title":"A history of trade unionism in the United States, (Social science text-books)","review":"This was great.

I was finally prompted to start when Francine Prose, in her excellent book \\"Reading Like a Writer,\\" said that Chekhov's short stories were her favorite and that all aspiring writers should read them. She talked a lot about his stories, especially about their well-crafted language, character descriptions, and how they broke common rules.Maybe my expectations were too high, but I was a little disappointed. I do admire Chekhov's character description and his description of nature, particularly the Russian landscape. For me, though, a lot of his plots fell short. Some of the stories had no real beginning and no real ending. Rather they were inter-connected parts of other stories that were included in the volume, and read like a novel told in serials, with one short story picking up where another left off. It was interesting to read about the day in the life of a 19th-century Russian official, and to read his philosophical meanderings related to peasantry and education and the like, but some of the stories consisted of only that, and after awhile parts of them became rather redundant and boring. To me Tolstoi's Ana Karenina, which I have been reading off and on for some time (way too long!) now, contains everything that most of these short stories did, and more, because it sticks with the same engaging characters and has a moving plot, even if some of it gets bogged down with the same philosophical meanderings. Perhaps if I hadn't read Tolstoi or Dostoevsky I would have really loved Chekhov, I'm not sure. At this point in time, though, although I liked him, I didn't like him as much as those two authors.I liked the stories contained in the beginning of this book more than the stories at the end; perhaps it was due to the redundancy factor. My favorite was \\"The Grasshopper,\\" which was about a young woman who was married to a rather boring, older doctor, but her heart was with the theater and with the dramatic and famous people she hung out with. Eventually she has an affair and leaves her husband, and in many way this is a timeless story about relationships, that could have been told yesterday as much as it could have been told in Chekhov's time. The story seemed so realistic that I did some research into Chekhov's life and found that he married an actress named Olga (which is the name of the wife in the story) and that there were many other similarities between his life with her and the life of the couple in the story.I will read more short stories by Chekhov and thus far my conclusion is that I really enjoy some of them and I don't really enjoy others. So it may be one of those experiences where I read everything to find the gems. I did enjoy this book although I didn't love it as much as I was expecting to, and I give it 3.5 stars.For more book reviews and posts of interest to readers and writers, please visit my Blogspot blog, Voracia: Goddess of Words."},{"Title":"Django","review":"John Cech has given children a look at the beauty that can be created through music. In all of the stress of content area curriculum today we sometimes forget the arts. The author has shown how music can be a strength in children that adults may miss. It appears to give the reader the idea to let children share things that interest them and in turn share different aspect of culture and art with children."},{"Title":"Black River Falls","review":"&quot;Black River Falls&quot; is one of those books you hate to admit that you enjoyed, but it is to Ed Gorman's credit that this leisurely-placed dark story works so well.We meet Ben Tyler, an average looking &quot;nerd&quot; who finds himself falling in love with the mysterious Allison. Allison has her own sordid past, in that a roommate of hers was brutally murdered the year previously. Ben doesn't know this of course. Ben has a loving mother, who is a veterinarian, and a charming, handsome older brother, Michael, who wows the women, including one Denise Fletcher, a married woman whose husband is maniacally jealous. Enter David Weyrich, a seasoned PI, who is looking for one Steve Conners, who he is sure killed Allison's roommate, and just happens to be a good friend of none other than Michael Tyler.Gorman gives us some very touching scenes, including one in which Ben has to help his mother put his feline-leukemia afflicted kitten to sleep. This is poignant and rare in a book of this nature.Of course, there are now shocking surprises, once we find out the truth about Steve and Michael; from then on, it's a cat and mouse game, with the evil villain doing his best to silence those who could give away his dreaded secret.Gorman presents a strong case of inherited traits, in that the killer may have inherited his traits from his murderous grandfather.All in all, the story has some great moments, and even though our beloved heroine bites the dust, Ben's revenge, along with the just desserts for Allison's killer keep the plot moving.A nice, sneaky thriller."},{"Title":"Black River Falls","review":"While it may not quite be up to snuff with some of Gorman's other offerings, Black River Falls is a friendly enough book, with plenty of rich characters walking around. Ben, the unlikely hero of the tale, is an innocent underdog with a heart of gold. The veterinarian mother, Lynn, is the widowed caregiver with the heart of gold. Well, you get the idea.Gorman tapdances dangerously close to the territory of his buddy, Dean Koontz. There aren't any elements of the supernatural here, but the good natured intelligence of the Good Guys comes close to being a notch too sweet and tender for my tastes (yes, including the weepy 'putting the kitten to sleep' scene).It's another pretty-good rural mystery from a guy who can write it better than this. The Midwest gets painted pretty well, actually, but it's the formulaic tale of a psycho brother versus the good brother that wears thin towards the back pages."},{"Title":"Black River Falls","review":"This has to be one of my favorites of all time. I borrowed this little gem from a friend and read it in no time at all. In my opinion (as a fan of Gorman) this is one of his best. It really keeps you hanging to the very end."},{"Title":"Black River Falls","review":"This is a tough book to summarize, mainly because Gorman throws a number of plot twists into the mix. I can't go into details without spoiling the surprises, so I won't (unlike Leisure Books, which reveals a major plot twist on the back cover). Suffice it to say that the story deals with the murder of a young woman named Dana Albrego and its effect on Lynn Tyler, and her sons, Ben and Michael, a close knit family who live in the small town of Black River Falls. Dana's death, the catalyst for the story, triggers several additional killings, and ultimately results in the revelation of a black secret in the Tyler family.An engrossing tale of small town murder and mayhem, Black River Falls owes its effectiveness largely to Gorman's detailed characterization--he brings the Tylers and supporting characters to vivid life, which increases our anxiety when they are threatened. Gorman shows a sure hand, again demonstrating why many consider him a writer's writer, a consummate professional. Check this one out and join the ever expanding group of Gorman fans."},{"Title":"Black River Falls","review":"Ed Gorman has got to be one of the best thriller writers working in the genre today. Gorman's writing is sharp and easy to read, he doesn't over-write like so many others out there; his style is simple and straight-forward.Gorman keeps the story moving along, despite some slow spots, paces it well and keeps the premise pretty basic. The only pet peeve I have is the repetitive dialogue.&quot;Really?&quot;&quot;Really.&quot;That is what I mean. He does this several times during the novel and it gets a little annoying after doing it 4 or 5 times.However, the novel is excellent overall and Gorman is a master storyteller. This is a must-read for Gorman fans."},{"Title":"Black River Falls","review":"I enjoyed reading this!

There is a lot of confusion and misinformation out there. This book clears it up in one authoritative and concise guide to building techniques.

It turned out that these are indeed the best part of the book -- Lstiburek's choppy writing becomes annoying quickly, and even confrontational (i.e. \\"...for those who may not get it, [rant excluded] Get it?\\")But it may be the most comprehensive book on this subject at the moment, and the various construction details make it worth the price of admission."},{"Title":"Laboratory Experiments in Organic Chemistry","review":"This laboratory manual is designed for beginning students in organic chemistry whether they are specializing in chemistry or are seeking a knowledge of the subject for use in medicine, agriculture, home economics, biology, or related fields.The authors believe that it is very desirable for the beginning student to acquire an understanding of the more important manipulations and procedures encountered in organic chemical laboratory work before any attempt is made to prepare organic compounds or study organic chemical reactions. For this purpose a number of preliminary experiments have been set apart to be carried out first and are designed to give an opportunity to teach the student not only technique but also important principles involved in the common laboratory procedures.In the selection of preparative experiments to be included, the primary objective has been to choose those which illustrate important general reactions and furnish a pure product in good yields. Several sequences of preparations have been included so that the student may use previously prepared materials and gain experience with stepwise synthesis. The scope of experiments is sufficiently broad to provide adequately for a full years course.Some of the preparations are as follows-diethyl ether, acetonitrile, carbohydrates, acetylene, aniline, n-butyl acetate, ethyl benzene, aspirin, polymerization, and many more."},{"Title":"Cell and Molecular Biology: Concepts and Experiments","review":"The book looks suspiciously skinny for a cell biology book but it really is so well written that the author made it comprehensive without being too wordy. Although lots of people swear by the Molecular Biology of the Cell, 4th Edition (Bruce Alberts et al... and I own that one too), I found it too wordy and not as fun to read. This book however is lucidly written and has everything that a graduate student or senior undergrad would need to know in Cell Biology.I used Cell and Molecular Biology (I just called it Gerald Karp after the author) extensively during my undergrad and am still using it in graduate school (I'm getting my Masters in Microbiology).Cell and Molecular Biology by Gerald Karp is surpassed only in diagram clarity and simplicity by Cooper and Hausman's \\"The Cell: A Molecular Approach\\" which has the best diagrams of all cell biology textbooks but is slightly less comprehensive (I own that one too!). The book is neatly arranged and the continuity of topics within a chapter and from chapter to chapter is very good unlike Molecular Biology of the Cell, 4th Edition.Although sold separately for something like $38.00, the book has an associated study workbook sort of thing with it that is pretty good for testing your knowledge in the important and tricky concepts. For every chapter in the textbook there is a section of multiple choice questions, a section of experimental-data interpretation questions, a section of thought questions, and explain the role of each of the following\\" type questions. All questions except the thought questions come with answers. And there is a review of the key topics in the textbook for every chapter. I would greatly recommend buying the text and the study book together, especially if you're gearing to take exams like the Subject GRE."},{"Title":"Cell and Molecular Biology: Concepts and Experiments","review":"I've come to appreciate this book more and more over its succeeding editions. It has now replaced both the Alberts et al. and the Lodish et al. books (both nevertheless excellent) as my favorite textbook on cell and molecular biology.It is concise, covers a very large range of subjects and has very clear graphics. I think it is better balanced than many of its competitors in the sense that the reader never gets the impression that the author sacrificed certain subjects to give more room to his favorite ones. On many occasions, I was surprised to find things in here that I couldn't find in the bigger (and more \\"fundamental\\") Alberts and Lodish.It references papers and review articles that are very current, and is very up to date on its content.I think Gerald Karp is doing a very good job with each new iteration of this book and I will recommend it to my students."},{"Title":"Cell and Molecular Biology: Concepts and Experiments","review":"This is one of the most complete and easy-to-read book ever! I have studied with Gerald Karp books since I was an undergraduate student (Biochemistry, and Karp book was always by my side, very useful). This book explain the cellular metabolism, structures (cytoskeleton, microtubules, filaments, genes,relations between genes and proteins, DNA repair, cell cycle, cell signalling, lot of concepts that are not easy to understand at first, Karp does it very simple. You will love this book. I can strongly recommend it. Another excellent book I can recommend is Molecular Biology of the CELL by Bruce Alberts....is excellent! and before you take an exam, I will suggest the \\"Outline of Molecular and Cell Biology\\" by the Schaum's series.

First of all it depends while you are here looking at the book, if you need it as a textbook for a course and are looking for a bargain price it is a no brainer - just order it. If you are supplementing other books and you are in the field I think it is also a wise choice as it is very detailed, had great diagrams and is easy to follow.If you are a not a molecular biologist, like me, and are simply keen to learn I think it is a brilliant book on the topic - understanding that this is not my specialty. I can imagine this does not solve all issues in the field, nor could any book, so I would not hesitate for one second in ordering this. I particularly have interest in the mitochondria and this wonderful book looks at this little organelle from many perspectives - so I am more than happy with this purchase.What a great source"},{"Title":"Cell and Molecular Biology: Concepts and Experiments","review":"This book is being used by a 300+ level cell biology class at my university. I just want to say that if I had known how terrible of a study partner this text would be I would have never purchased it. As much as I appreciate the concept of learning a subject through past experiments, it just doesn't work for me. This is coming from a person who truly loves textbooks. In fact, most of the time I would rather read textbooks than listen to professors. Textbooks should present the material clearly and emphasize the important points. There is too much running text in paragraph form. Break it up! This is not supposed to be a dense novel about cell biology. If you wanted dense cell biology go read the Cell Journal. It is a pretty good journal too I might add. But! If you are looking for a guide to understanding cell biology look elsewhere. This is the only review I have ever written, and I mean every word of it. Hopefully a few professors out there will save their students some grief by looking at other options. One more thing... if you want a suggestion for a truly great textbook take a look at Charlie Janeway's Immunobiology. Not a cell bio textbook but by far the most helpful textbook I have ever had."},{"Title":"Cell and Molecular Biology: Concepts and Experiments","review":"Good basic concepts, not short enough for a review but a good first Cell & Mole.

Let me start by saying i purchased the second book and it was just as good as new and it was delivered pretty quickly. i literally finished a whole chapter in less than 30mins. The diagrams are perfect because it helps you visualize. The language of the book is really simple but not boring. The author writes alot of examples in some of the text just too keep your mined focused and steady. I did my high school 5 years ago and yet i am not as lost as i thought i would be. Really good book. Great layout. easy to understand. Not too many confusing big words. Though if you have no previous knowledge (high school level) of biology..i suggest you read up a little before u use this book. However if you have high school knowledge about basic biology. Then this is a good book for you."},{"Title":"Cell and Molecular Biology: Concepts and Experiments","review":"Another introductory book in the biology of the cell. I would say that the book is divided into mainly two sections, Cell structure and DANA, DANA replications etc. Second part takes almost two thirds of the book. I would prefer to read other Gene books when it comes to that point but for the cell structure, it is not bad. Some colored pictures, computer animations makes it easy to visualize things. Sections called &quot;experimental pathways&quot; scattered throughout the text takes you into current issues related to the subject. They are also quite sophisticated issues rather than practical problems. I think this book requires considerable guidance when read alone. I could not call this book as self sufficient or easy to read one compared to books by Alberts or Baltimore."},{"Title":"Cell and Molecular Biology: Concepts and Experiments","review":"The explainations and concepts are well written in this textbook and Gerald Karp is a great author.It can give you a lot of information about cell and molecular biology.

If I'd read this book first I would have given it 5 stars, but I was constantly thinking about how closely it resembled the previous two. In all three books you have two women, one a curvaceous, somewhat common American brunette from the wrong side of town with a chip on her shoulder, the other a very slim green eyed blonde from an artistocratic English background. The two are fierce enemies and determined to destroy each other, while fighting to prove themselves as successful business people. Toward the end they both experience business problems and realise that the only way to save their individual businesses is to put aside their differences and work together. They then become a formidable team, not only saving their businesses but also becoming friends. While all Bagshawe's books are well written and entertaining, I think she needs a new plot idea - in every book I felt like I was reading about the same 2 characters, just with different names. I was interested to read one reviewer's comments about the 80's lingo and atmosphere not seeming authentic - I had the same problem with &quot;When She Was Bad&quot;, another Bagshawe novel. &quot;When She Was Bad&quot; was ostensibly set in the 60's/70's, but the jargon was more consistent with current terminology - I'm not sure they used the words &quot;booty&quot;, &quot;like&quot; and &quot;heroin chic&quot; in that era :) It seems as if Bagshawe sets her novels in the various periods for a change of pace without actually doing any research into the time. Despit my criticisms, &quot;Tall Poppies&quot; still manages to be an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Tall Poppies","review":"This book is alot more than an escapist read, the book itself is fantastic, but if you read between the lines, it's not about men dominating women but about the jealous rivalry that threatens both women. The women in this book unwitingly manage to ruin each other through jealousy and then manage to blame it on men. It makes you stop and have a hard think about yourself and how hard your wiling to work to get something. A life changing book and definately Bagshawe's best."},{"Title":"Tall Poppies","review":"Louise Bagshawe has a genuine talent for writing. Her dialogue is believable and the ... scenes are steamy! I only wish she would spend a little more time researching her subject matter.This book takes place in the (very early) 80's. I got the impression that Bagshawe is too young to have actually experienced this time period. I felt the accumulation of inaccuracies distracting at times, and it detracts from her credibility as a storyteller.That said, I enjoy her enough to have all of her books, but I feel Tall Poppies is the weakest of them."},{"Title":"Tall Poppies","review":"Love it and I am going to keep on ordering from you guys if your going to keep on sending me all these good books.

I recomend this book to anyone who needs a little time out from reality. All of Ms. Bagshawe's books are a 10 plus!!"},{"Title":"Tall Poppies","review":"This is the story of a rich English girl and a poor American girl, whose lives cross as they both become very succesful. I have read other Louise Bagshawe books, and I have to say that she uses this rich English/poor American format a lot, and it's becoming boring.Personally I didn't like this book, and ended up skim-reading most of it."},{"Title":"Tall Poppies","review":"'Tall Poppies' is a fantastic example of girl power, an inspiring story about ambition, enemies, sex, winning, power and pure innocence. 'Tall Poppies' is a dynamic read about two women from different sides of the track yet it comes clear that they share more than realise, despite their background their goals and experience are much the same. Like 'Career Girls', Louise Bagshawe builds realistic characters around the social structure of the early 80's, weaving in snippets of info about famous people of the time. A page turning book for all those starting out in their career, those with enemies and those who have had to make choices."},{"Title":"Tall Poppies","review":"This is the first book I read of this nature, it was very interesting. I only picked it up to kill time while my father shopped around the library but I found myself wanting to read more.. then more and more.. ended up buying it and reading it to the end.The characters are relatable and the novel had an interesting point of view thing going on. The end was very satisfying too.. lemme say."},{"Title":"Tall Poppies","review":"Louise Bagshawe has definitely hit upon a successful formula -- either two or three go-getting women who wind up cooperating with one another -- but her telling of the tale is always so much fun, it doesn't bother me and doesn't seem stale. In Tall Poppies, I enjoyed how hard Nina worked to get past various setbacks, but absolutely loved Elizabeth and her skiing career. The descriptions of Elizabeth navigating dangerous Alpine trails were breathtaking, and her interactions with Texan skiier Jack Taylor excellent. Bagshawe is good at developing sexual tension without losing the plot's forward momentum. Bagshawe also does an excellent job of portraying the glass ceiling that women fought for so long (and are still fighting). Overall, a great read with strong, likable characters.Ms. Bagshawe is obviously an enormously bright woman with great storytelling talent, but her books would benefit from having a US editor take a look at them if she's telling things from an American's point of view; it's awkward having British slang or lingo coming from someone from the US. We just say some things differently: A firm ARE going to throw a Christmas party (British); a firm IS going to throw a Christmas party (US) -- and occasionally there will be words that we just don't use on this side of the pond."},{"Title":"Tall Poppies","review":"This title is the Austrian proverb for Tall Poppies, and what it is about, and what the book itself is about. I am a Tall Poppy, and I have been cut down to size. So I relate to this book (Thankfully my stalks have grown again to reach heavenward and my flower has once again bloomed a brilliant color). But back to the book: Louise Bagshawe is a sure thing. She is also rather impressive. Went to Oxford, became I believe a talent scout for Sony Music at a young age. Now she continues to write, although she is also a mom and involved with the Parliament and other UK politics. She is also a nice person with excelletn values. I highly recommend her books if you like stories of women who seriously make success stories of themselves, against all odds. I find her books enthralling and empowering. Buy them, why don't you?"},{"Title":"Tall Poppies","review":"I'm a huge fan of Louise Bagshawe and many of her books. I have to say - &quot;Tall Poppies&quot; is one of my favs. I really enjoyed the depth of character, interesting stories, and general pace of this book. Ms. Bagshawe's talent is clear - and I really love her English sense of humor. I found the interaction between Nina and Elizabeth really endearing and really empowering. I loved their spirit and strength.&quot;Tall Poppies&quot; is a great book and I loved every minute of it.Cheers!"},{"Title":"Tall Poppies","review":"I have read all Louise Bagshawe books and I have to say that Tall Poppies has to be the best. Yes there are many similariites between the books and the characters, but that didnt put me off in the slightest as Louise still manages to keep your attention to maximum levels throughout the book as you turn each page wondering what is going to happen next. She develops the characters Nina and Elizabeth so well describing them in such great detail that you can actually picture them so very clearly.I thought that the storyline was brilliant and she had me gripped when Elizabeth had the skiing accident. The way Louise portrays Elizabeth and Nina you can immediately sympathise in some cases, laugh at some of the situations they get themselves in and feel really emotional when they go through thier hardships.I felt great joy with them when they finally got one over the awful Tony! I also found thier characters developed really well throughout the book and cannot forget them and thats one of the main things about a book, that an author creates characters you will not be able to forget and a book that you cant put down and Louise has done both!. Well done Louise lets have some more now!!"},{"Title":"Tall Poppies","review":"'Tall Poppies'totally captures the reader with the story of two very powerful and stubborn women in a society ruled by men.

About 1 to 2 millions of today's SF teen fans could, and probably would have written this storyline better. What saves \\"Seed of Earth\\" from zero stars are the last 25 - 30 pages, where the story turns into an interesting psychological drama. Four persons, virtually strangers, are forced to live together in a cave.

Mind you, this is not a classic, nor is it deserving of any awards, nor is it extremely memorable. More so beyond anything, it leaves you with a sense of beauty, a grand feeling that calms you inside. The story centers around a military program in the near future and, because of mans prominent belief that we are alone in the universe with so much wasted space, the government sends out recruits chosen by a supercomputer to board a ship and fly to the destined planet to begin a brand new Earth colony. The novel centers around about 4 or 5 characters who are neatly written that are chosen to board the starship Gegenschein. Once at Osirus, their destination, the crew discovers a race of aliens that lead the 4 characters into a cave. I will let it take out from there. I do recommend this book, but not over say DOWNWARD TO THE EARTH or THE FACE OF THE WATERS by Silverberg.

The contrast between the gravitas of his chosen medium, in which he spent years as a church organist in several major national congregations, and the wild joie de vivre and flamboyance with which he embraced the world around him, are a marvelous ride from one extreme to another. I picked up this book on a whim, and was shortly completely unable to detach it from my hands. Fox was such a wild ride himself, and this book is a warm testament not only to the power of belief in oneself, but the devotion of friends even after they've seen their idol's feet of clay (and been charged a dollar for the privilege -- Fox nickeled and dimed his guests for refreshments at his house!).Delightfully unpretentious, honest and tender, &quot;The Dish&quot; is a mix of high and low culture, tasty and good for you. I am delighted to have learned about the organ community, but even more delighted -- at this safe remove -- to have met Virgil. &quot;Thanks, Honey!&quot;"},{"Title":"Virgil Fox (the dish): An irreverent biography of the great American organist","review":"\\"The Dish\\" is in many ways a sheep in Fox's clothing. This first biography of Virgil Fox is in reality a Ted Alan Worth (Fox's protegee) memoir of his time at the feet of the great organ virtuoso. It could also be described as the world's longest series of anecdotes with a healthy dose of inserted comments by Fox cohorts Richard Torrence, Marshall Yeager and many others As such it cannot be considered a true biography. That aside, it is the only large volume devoted to Fox, so for those interested in his life and loves (musically and otherwise) it is a must read. Worth was 14 when he first met Virgil in what must have been about 1946. The narrative starts at that point, omitting the first 34+ years of Fox's life. Why he learned to love the organ, his rise to prominence and early concert career before World War II are left out. Too bad. It would have been nice to have known the full story of his inspirations. \\"The Dish\\" sounds like it was dashed off in one long paragraph, which in fact it was.I found the stories relating to the organ companies themselves not too technical and full of the competitive spirit. Worth was on the forefront of both the Rodgers and Ruffatti organizations.The little background, personal stories are a nice People magazine style break from the concertizing minutiae and other more solemn parts of the chapters. Everything from Fox's sex life to his wardrobe are given plenty of amplification. Few stops stay in regarding his personal life. Pictures abound giving faces to the many voices in the text. There are also quite a few variations on the themes of grammar and spelling (lightening for lightning as an example) which detract from the airy prose.As a non-organist, I came to Fox through his \\"Heavy Organ\\" concerts that began in the 1970's. His magical way of introducing \\"us kids\\" to J.S. Bach with a pulsating light show behind him cannot be described and of course now cannot be experienced. It's been over 20 years since his death, so those who had the privilege will want to grab on to \\"Virgil Fox - The Dish\\" as a pleasant reminder of how great those mind-expanding nights at the theatre were, and how complex was the man who brought organ music to popular culture."},{"Title":"Virgil Fox (the dish): An irreverent biography of the great American organist","review":"I loved reading this book and couldn't wait to pick it up a couple times a day!

However, the book includes unfortunate gossip--statements made in private among friends that Virgil, and any other sane person, would not have expected to be written down for public consumption many years later. There are also some statements about Mr. Fox's private life that I didn't want nor care to know. The book even lapses into bad taste (chapter title using sexual reference, as one example). So much for my great hope that this book would be appropriate to give to young people in order to inspire them. I just do not feels this book honored the life of such a great artist.

His flamboyant personality and lifestyle matched his outsized playing style, and this book covers them both.Based on a memoir written by his student and friend, fellow organist Ted Alan Worth, the manuscript has been edited and amended by two other Fox associates, Richard Torrence, who served as the musician's manager, and Marshall Yaeger. They have added additional comments from others who knew and worked with Virgil Fox, both personally and professionally.Anyone familiar with the organ's repertoire and/or Virgil Fox will enjoy this personal, and highly subjective, account of his life on the concert circuit and as organist of Manhattan's majestic Riverside Church, interspersed with tales of his relationships with fellow organists, other musicians, and his two long-term live-in relationships. While author Worth was clearly an admirer of his subject, this \\"warts and all\\" biography includes some of Fox's foibles as well.Reviewed by Abigail Gary"},{"Title":"Virgil Fox (the dish): An irreverent biography of the great American organist","review":"It is a wonderful read for lovers of the pipe organ!

In the CDs, Dyer also gives you specific steps and tools for achieving a higher awareness and manifesting what you want in your life. The key, of course, is being willing to modify your belief system and put these things into practice.

Indeed those who accuse God for allowing evil certainly use false argumentation."},{"Title":"God, Freedom, & Evil","review":"The Problem of Evil is an insurmountable one for Christians (and all other theists who believe in a perfectly loving, all-powerful and all-knowing god). There have been intense and motivated efforts over the past two millennia to defend such a position rationally, and they have all failed. Miserably. Utterly. And in many cases, dishonestly.Some approached involve invoking an unknown \\"greater good\\" defense (which throws god's omnipotence under the bus. An omnipotent deity could simply actualise a desired goal without needing to use suffering as a \\"middle man\\"). Attempts to shift the problem by asserting that human happiness is not the goal of life (but knowing god is) removes the omnibenevolence and omnipotence of god (if you love someone, you don't want them to suffer. It really is that simple).Here, Plantinga takes the old canard of free will. Unfortunately, free will is meaningless unless everyone has an equal amount of it. This is undeniably NOT the case. Not everyone is given the same lifespan, physical strength, mental acuity, political clout, financial resources, and so on. Plantinga is pontificating from the luxurious confines of his residence, funded by conveniently gullible sheep. This has certainly damaged his ability to empathise with the billions who live on less than a dollar each day. And the thousands who starve to death every time the Earth completes a full rotation.Plantinga also, perhaps unwittingly, advocates a social Darwinism in which the rich and physically powerful are able to murder, rape and steal from weaker individuals (and are therefore less able to exercise their own free will to prevent their own suffering). Plantinga worships a cosmic pedophile who revels in granting freedom to abhorrent individuals while getting his jollies from seeing the most vulnerable suffer and die in agony (only to get thrown into even more torture in the Christian vision of hell).Lastly, a loving god would take away free will from those who would willingly surrender it in return for a life without suffering. Funnily enough, Plantinga seems to believe in a heaven without suffering but with all the bells and whistles of freedom. So why not create that universe from the get-go and stick with it? Why create a universe with even the possibility of corruption? It certainly is not something a perfect god would do. Then again, a perfect god would not blackmail beings he supposedly loves for eternal worship."},{"Title":"God, Freedom, & Evil","review":"Although intended for the layman, Plantinga's writing style is dreadfully confusing. The common reader will have to read and re-read sections to understand the concepts posited. Mr. Plantina does, however, refute the atheist's claim that a holy God is incompatible with present evil. His arguments are consistent but he utilizes hypothetical worlds to substantiate his claims. Rather, he would have been more consistent and straightforward to simply assert the revealed truths of Scripture in the heritage of God's prophets and apostles. In any case, it is a valuable and interesting read, but only one familiar with linear logic should attempt to read it."},{"Title":"God, Freedom, & Evil","review":"In this book, Alvin Plantinga attempts to safegaurd theism from the problem of evil by explaining why he believes God and evil are compatible, although his attempts fail. While claiming that God is not responsible for evil, Plantinga presents an analogy where two mountain climbers are stranded, and a rescuer can save only one climber (pg 20). Plantinga's analogy fails to apply to an omnipotent being, however, for the rescuer, a non-omnipotent being, is limited by external forces. When considering this flaw, Plantinga states, &quot;Perhaps so, but this is not the point&quot; (pg 21). What is the point then? To present a flawed analogy, recognize the flaw yourself, and then divert the reader's attention elsewhere without addressing the core objection?Reconciling freedom and evil, Plantinga asserts that moral good requires the ability to choose between good and evil (pg 30). Plantinga considers compatibalism but insists that it does not offer true freedom (pg 31). Plantinga's account fails to consider the role of moral knowledge in compatibalism. Plantinga, and other admirers of him, tend to define freedom exclusively in terms of action, although freedom also extends to choice. Compatibalism asserts that God could have created men where they always choose to do good freely, perhaps by instilling men with a stronger understanding of morals and the consequences of evil action. The example of Adam eating the forbidden apple illustrates this point. Genesis states that Adam was deceived by Satan into believing that the apple would make him like God. At that moment, God could have appeared before Adam and told him that if he eats of the apple, he in fact will not become like him but will suffer and have to leave paradise, although he is free to do as he pleases. Would this extention of moral knowledge have violated Adam's freedom? Absolutely not, for Adam merely would have gained knowledge to act upon. Adam probably would have rejected the apple freely, had God allowed him to know its true consequences and that Satan was deceiving him. Some persons might say that this extension of knowledge is coercive and manipulates Adam's choice by promising punishment. The coersion objection, however, contradicts most religious traditions; in Christianity, God places conditions upon man's free actions by asserting that if men freely choose to sin, then they shall suffer eternal damnation. That's like a waiter informing a customer that the evening's special leads to abdominal cramps and then telling him that he's free to order the special.The greatest weakness of Plantinga's book is in stating that demons with free will cause natural evil (pg 58). Explaining natural evil is detrimental to theism, for such explanations raise harmful questions. Why would a just God allow demons to harm humans who are not responsible for the demons' decisions and actions? Some theists assert that at times, God intervenes and prevents natural evil (aka performs miralces), although this claim also is detrimental. Why would God intervene to save some persons from natural evil but not other persons? If God has the ability to intervene and prevent natural evil, then isn't he responsible for not doing so? Some theists claim that natural evil needs no explanation, which is true in some cases but not in others. Some natural evil warrants explanation, for God could have created humans with a stronger immune system or without vestigal organs that cause infections and death. It appears that neither Plantinga nor his omniscient God thought of these possible preventions of natural evil that warrant explanation."},{"Title":"God, Freedom, & Evil","review":"There are two good reasons why I oppose the concept of a completely Good, Omniscient, and Omnipotent (GOO) God: 1) Acceptance of this God insists that the petty-minded cruelty of God as described in the Old Testament is actually love. If Christians refuse to acknowledge that Moses invented the tradition of ethnic cleansing, and that this was evil, it is too easy to justify applying this concept to native Americans, Jews, and Moslems, as has been done throughout history, and is being done at the present time. 2 Rejection of this God usually entails rejection of any notion of God, and acceptance of the doctrine that we are merely machines whose existence is accidental. So while I cannot pretend that I studied Plantinga's attempt to reconcile God and evil with an open mind, I tried to be at least fair. His argument not only fails, it is silly. I shall explain why as briefly as I can.The analogies that Plantinga chooses to support his case are odd to say the least. The fact that a theist does not know why God permits evil says nothing about the rationality of the belief. We also do not know how the desire to mow the lawn leads to the bodily motions of mowing the lawn, yet it is rational to suppose there is a connection. True, but if the desire mow the lawn led instead to sticking one's hands in the whirling blades and hacking them off, we would consider that irrational.Since God is GOO, he will eliminate all evil that he can that does not entail eliminating an outweighing good or bringing about a greater evil. Suppose I am deliriously happy, and my friend Paul has a sore knee. God cannot eliminate Paul's pain without also eliminating my happiness. It's impossible to imagine why God cannot do this, unless Paul's pain makes me happy. Admitting this example to be trivial, Plantinga suggests that heroism in the face of evil is inspirational, and this heroism would be eliminated by the absence of evil. Facing evil with heroism is good, but the absence of evil is clearly better.The good that prevents God from eliminating evil is free will. Since no argument can be better than its major premise, free will needs to be scrutinized. Inasmuch as nearly all atheists dismiss free will as a delusion, Plantinga's argument is obviously not meant for them. My conviction is that free will does exist, but only in the same way that the ability to do calculus exists; it requires a lot of hard work and few people ever develop it to any extent. At best, one's free will is confined within the limits of one's character, and Plantinga's claim that predictability has nothing to do with free will is clearly false. For instance, the average white man in 1850's Georgia insisted that slavery was completely consistent with Christian morality and no rational argument could have convinced him otherwise, while the opposite would have been true for his counterpart in Maine. People with free will do not permit their characters to be molded by arbitrary cultural circumstances. We might be free to do what we want, but is what we want really a free will choice? Christians acknowledge that wanting to sin is beyond their control. But only evil people want to do heinous things. How many men want to crush a woman's skull with a tire iron and rape the corpse, as Ted Bundy did? Was the desire to do this Bundy's free will choice? Plantinga acknowledges that God might interfere with Maurice's decision to have oatmeal for breakfast by inflicting him with an equine obsession that makes it psychologically impossible for him to refuse oats. I am by no means convinced that Bundy did not suffer from a more sinister obsession.At any rate, since God knows who will \\"choose\\" to become evil, why not NOT CREATE THOSE PEOPLE? Plantinga ignores this question. He says, \\"God could not have created any of the possible worlds containing just the persons who do in fact exist, and containing moral good but no moral evil\\" (p.48). He claims that God cannot create a world in which people do not have \\"transworld depravity.\\" I had to reread Plantinga's explanation of transworld depravity several times before I could convince myself that he actually says what he actually says. Stripped of the obfuscating logical symbols of which he is so fond it goes like this: There are two worlds identical in every way except in one Bundy kills the woman, and in the other he doesn't. But if the world in which he doesn't kill the woman is going to be as much like the actual world as possible, then if this world were actual, then he would have killed the woman. It says nothing except that if Bundy actually exists, and he has free will, he must kill the girl. It is a fatuous argument that never addresses why Bundy should be obsessed with evil in the first place.Plantinga argues that natural disasters that we typically refer to as \\"acts of God\\" are actually the free will acts of demons. Although earthquakes are explained quite well by plate tectonics, Plantinga insists it is not irrational to insist demons push the plates around. This is so inane I cannot even comment on it.(Peter Payne, author of CAPTAIN CALIFORNIA BATTLES THE BEELZEBUBIAN BEASTS OF THE BIBLE)"},{"Title":"God, Freedom, & Evil","review":"How do I rate a book that will bore most of you but titillate the rest? Half way between two stars and six stars, I guess.I'm secure in my status as a religion nerd, so I'll admit I loved it. This is an introduction to philosophical apologetics, a short little book that can be read in a couple hours, and understood in five or six hours. Philosophical reflection, Plantinga assures us, is not that different than just thinking hard. It's is an excursion into the joy of logic ... for the fun of it, not necessarily to reach any meaningful conclusions. He spends half the book discussing the problem of evil, and the other half on natural theology. Thus half of the book presents a case against God and half attempts to prove he exists. In the second half, Plantinga briefly introduces the Cosmological Argument and the Teleological Argument, and then spends the rest of the book on the Ontological Argument.Plantinga's argument against the problem of evil is fascinating yet unsatisfying, and his discussion of the ontological argument is equally fun but equally unconvincing ... like one of those puzzles where you know there's something wrong and can't quite place your finger on it.One note: Do not try to read an electronic version!

The scripture is clear that God will create a new heaven and earth, in which there will be no death, mourning, pain, or suffering. So the big question for theodicy is why we have this intermediate state in which pain and suffering are clear to everyone? The free will defence says that God allows his creatures to love Him, out of free will. For me the ultimate goal of God is to share Himself with His creatures for eternity. Why? Out of love. To enjoy God for eternity. God has within Himself, the source of life for all eternity. The free will defence does not have to answer the question, why God allows suffering in this an intermediate state, in which we all live.Unfortunately, no one seems to address this problem, but for me this is the big problem for theodicy. In other words, God is clearly capable of creating a universe without suffering, but instead He chose this intermediate state, in which suffering is possible, including Jesus, as our human representative. Plantinga does not address this issue."},{"Title":"God, Freedom, & Evil","review":"In this book, Alvin Plantinga takes the time to carefully analyze several theistic arguments for the existence of God.

This is a very condensed and less technical version of that book)In this book Plantinga is attempting to answer the *logical problem of evil* and nothing else. The logical problem, briefly stated and according to Mackie, is as follows:(1) God is omnipotent(2) God is wholly goodand(3) Evil existsThe main idea is that this set, taken as a whole, involves a contradiction.While this simple set of propositions might appear inconsequential, this was one the major problems in philosophy of religion for some time. And until Plantinga, this (often called \\"the logical problem of evil\\") was one of the main arguments used against the coherence of traditional theism. Plantinga's main argument details with rigor why this set is not a contradiction (e.g., free will, metaphysics of modality, etc).Because of this book (or the longer, more academic version \\"The Nature of Necessity\\") philosophers have all but stopped discussing the logical problem of evil. This rarely rarely happens in philosophy which is a testament to Plantinga and his book. Buy it, read it and spread the word.

While I don't find Plantinga's critique of Thomas Aquinas' tertia via a successful refutation of the third way (see Frederick Copleston's defense of it in \\"Aquinas\\"), the author does give a very helpful overview of the ontological argument. If the problem of evil does not provide a defeater for the possibility of God's existence, then we have prima facie reason to accept the first premise of Plantinga's modal ontological argument, which is the key premise of the proof.Whatever you think of the problem of evil and the ontological argument, this text is well worth the read!"},{"Title":"God, Freedom, & Evil","review":"\\"God, Freedom, and Evil\\" was the first primary text by Plantinga that I have read, and it lived up to my expectations.

I was mildly disappointed with his approaches to natural evil and to Kant's critique of the Anselmian ontological argument. On the whole, though, this essay was impressive and certainly stimulating."},{"Title":"God, Freedom, & Evil","review":"Unquestionably one of the hardest questions the Christian apologist faces is what is traditionally known as the problem of evil. The idea being presented usually goes something like this: If God were all loving He would want to stop the suffering in the world and if He were all powerful He would be able to stop it, and yet evil/suffering remains. Therefore, God is either loving and wants to stop suffering but can't, or He is all powerful and can stop suffering but He won't. Thus, God is either not all-powerful or not all-loving. Numerous treatments of this conundrum have been offered through the years.Enter Dr. Alvin Plantinga's \\"God, Freedom, and Evil.\\" Dr. Plantinga has been a driving force in the area of Christian philosophy for decades. He is considered by some to be the greatest Christian philosopher alive today. He has just recently retired from Notre Dame where he held a professorship in Philosophy for a number of years. His contribution to this problem is both deceptively brief (112 pp.) and quite heady, especially for the novice in philosophy and logic.Allow me to underline that last word \\"logic.\\" It is important to understand what this book is not. Plantinga does not present the more pressing arguments regarding the problem of evil and attempt to refute them. Nor does he address any of the more current theodicies being considered throughout the theological landscape. It is a treatment based on syllogistic logic as to why the more popular and pressing attempts to logically use the problem of evil to attack the nature and/or existence of God are fallacious in nature.Contrasting Natural Atheology and Natural Theology Plantinga builds his case premise by premise. Therefore, these arguments are based, not on airtight conclusions, but on rational possibilities. Natural Atheology is understood as \\"the attempt to prove that God does not exist or that at any rate it is unreasonable or irrational to believe that He does.\\" This is the place the author's attempted dismantling begins.Even though this will not be an easy read for many, it is still well worth the time for both the believer and the unconvinced. His treatment of the \\"Free Will Defense\\" is worth the price of the book. I will add there is a brief discussion of the classical arguments for God (Cosmological, Teleological, Ontological) in his Natural Theology conclusion.Be forewarned--even though this title can be purchased in e-book form that is something you will want to shy away from with this text. As the reader tracks with premises, sub-premises, new premises, and amended premises, which will necessitate a constant turning back and forth, attempting to do so with a digital format will be an exercise in both futility and frustration.I would certainly recommend this title, but I do so with the realization it will most likely appeal to a fairly limited audience. However, to be well-versed in the literature surrounding this vital subject, this is one title the student should avail himself of."},{"Title":"God, Freedom, & Evil","review":"Essential reading--one of the classics in modern philosophy of religion. Plantinga's presentation of the \\"free will defense\\" against the problem of evil takes up the first part of the book. Contra philosophers like J.L. Mackie and numerous others who have argued that the existence of evil is logically incompatible with the creation of the world by an omniscient, omnipotent, and omnibenevolent God, Plantinga forcefully argues for the logical possibility that such a God could not have created a world in which beings with significant moral freedom always choose the good, and that therefore, any world created by such a God will contain some degree of evil unless it be populated by beings lacking significant moral freedom. Since the good of moral freedom can be believed logically to outweigh the evil that results from exercise of that freedom, the existence of evil in the world is logically compatible with the existence of the posited God. Plantinga makes it very clear that this is not a theodicy--not an attempt to \\"justify\\" the actions of God re the evil in the world--but is rather merely an attempt to show that those who believe that belief in both God and evil is not inherently illogical. While some philosophers have raised issues with the particular model of free will advocated by Plantinga (an incompatibilist model, over against the \\"compatibilism\\" of thinkers like Mackie and Antony Flew), most have accepted that Plantinga's free will defense does provide a logically satisfactory response to the problem of evil.The second part of the book is Plantinga's presentation of the ontological argument for the existence of God. Here, Plantinga is (it seems to me) far less persuasive. His modal version of the argument is in some ways more refined than the classic version of St. Anselm, but I find it even more obviously tautological. Plantinga's, like all ontological arguments, boils down to an assertion that any being who exists necessarily, exists. But this is obvious. The modal ontological argument offers no additional evidence that there is such a thing as anecessary being."},{"Title":"God, Freedom, & Evil","review":"This of course, is a great work in the philosophy of religion. However, as a mere begginer in studying philosophy I found it to be a very difficult read. It is probably best if you have some knowledge in logic, which I do not, unfortunately. Though with a lot of re-reading and some internet help I have been able to decipher most of what Plantinga says. The idea of Transworld Depravity still eludes me to some extent. Overall I think this book is top notch, just on the difficult side."},{"Title":"God, Freedom, & Evil","review":"Alvin Plantinga, O'Brien Philosophy Professor at Notre Dame, shook the philosophy of religion world with this book when it was first published in 1978. His debunking of the atheistic evidential argument from evil is strictly a DEFENSE, not a THEODICY. A defense is merely a logical way out. A theodicy would attempt to give the specific reasons God allows evil. Plantinga does not claim to know the thoughts of God, so by offering a defense, he modestly shows that it is logically compatible for God to coexist with evil. His argument is NOT one by analogy (contra another reviewer), rather it is a strict application of the rules of logic.Even though the book is more accessible to the public than most of his others, I imagine that someone without any basic training in philosophy may struggle with the read (but a struggle is not a good excuse not to read a good book!). In addition to the defense against evil, his exposition of the Ontological argument is very interesting, and worthwhile for anyone who intends to properly understand that argument. Those in the field of philosophy have almost universally accepted it as the theistic solution to the problem of evil. If you are an atheist, I challenge you to study his arguments to understand the rational case he is making. This will definitely be an exciting and fun read for the philosopher, as well as to the thinking and outspoken theist and atheist.(By the way, if you are looking for a good THEODICY - try MAKING SENSE OUT OF SUFFERING by Peter Kreeft, philosophy professor at Boston College.)"},{"Title":"God, Freedom, & Evil","review":"God, Freedom and Evil is a short work, originally published in the mid-1970s, wherein Plantinga addresses issues pertaining to the existence of God. The book draws upon the author's prior works, \\"The Nature of Necessity\\" and \\"God and Other Minds\\". For readers new to this area of thought Plantinga is one of the most widely respected and read contemporary philosophers.A large part of the book is dedicated the so-called problem of evil. That is, the question of whether or not the existence of evil is compatible with the existence of an all-knowing all-powerful and wholly good God. In addressing this issue Plantinga focuses on the question of whether evil and God can logically co-exist - it is not a theodicy which seeks to explain the existence of evil. With regard the former more modest question the author is quite successful in proving that evil and God are not incompatible as had been previously argued - written nearly 30 years ago it has yet to be challenged in any significant way. Plantinga can rightfully take credit in helping this question largely disappear amongst serious thinkers. Arguments in this area now tend to be focused on the level of evil rather than its mere existence (i.e. is there too much evil to be consistent with the existence of God). As an earlier reader commented, I too find the author's argument about transworld depravity awkward - it removal, however, does not serious impact Plantinga position.In the remainder of the book Plantinga offers some brief thoughts on the classic arguments of natural theology - I found this part of the book less helpful. Plantinga indicates that he finds the ontological argument more compelling than either the argument from design or the cosmological argument. I tend to disagree with his views in this regard. Although with time I increasingly appreciate a certain force behind the ontological argument, it still strikes me somewhat as an artificial linguistic construct. On the other hand, I find the other two arguments more compelling than Plantinga does (I share his thought that, even if successful, the cosmological argument can offer little on the nature of God). To be fair to Plantinga, this work was composed prior to recent scientific developments that have strengthened the argument from design (particularly in the world of cosmology but, also to a limited degree in the biological sciences). A look at some of Plantinga's more recent work is also worthwhile.Overall a good short book by an outstanding philosopher who effectively altered the argument surrounding the existence of evil. I highly recommend this book to all students of philosophy and religion. J.L. Mackie's \\"The Miracle of Theism is also worth a look for a dissenting view."},{"Title":"God, Freedom, & Evil","review":"Some have called Alvin Plantinga this, and, whether you agree with him or not, the title is certainly warranted. In this book, 'God, Freedom, and Evil', Plantinga analyzes several mainline arguments of both natural theology and natural atheology. He finds all atheistic arguments wanting and most theistic arguments wanting. However, Plantinga eventually settles to the crux of the matter: the problem of evil. After showing that the problem of evil is obviously NOT a deductive problem--that is, from the existence of evil is does not necessarily follow that God doesn't exist--he utilizes the Free Will Defense to combat inductive arguments against theism. Plantinga ultimately concludes that the Free Will Defense, modified and elaborated to include considerations of possible worlds, successfully answers the problem of evil.The arguments in this book, especially Plantinga's account of Transworld Depravity and other complex issues regarding possible worlds, are quite cumbersome. Still, if one is willing to take to work to a quiet corner and faithfully think through its contents, he will not be disappointed.Adam Glover"},{"Title":"God, Freedom, & Evil","review":"The argument that destroyed the Logical problem of Evil...Leibniz's Lapse: Contrary to Leibniz, there are possible worlds that God cannot actualizeHere's an informal proof.Imagine a situation S in which Curley is free to take, or to refuse, a bribe. Suppose God wants Curley freely to refrain from taking the bribe in S. The most he could do to bring this about would be to make Curley free in S. Can God get what he wants? That depends on which of the following propositions is true. (Note that one of them must be true, and the other false,)(t) If Curley were free in S, then Curley would take the bribe.(r) If Curley were free in S, then Curley would not take the bribe.(Terminological note: (t) and (r) are among Curley's \\"counterfactuals of freedom.\\")If (t) is true and God makes Curley free in S, then Curley will take the bribe and God won't get what he wants. Only if (r) is true will Curley do what God wants him to do.Now let Wt be a possible world in which God makes Curley free in S and Curley freely takes the bribe. And let Wr be a world in which in which God makes Curley free in S and Curley freely refuses the bribe. If (t) is true, then God cannot actualize Wr. If, on the other hand, (r) is true, then God cannot actualize Wt. Since either (t) or (r) must be true, it follows that God can't actualize one or the other of these worlds--there is at least one possible world which he cannot actualize.TWD (\\"transworld depravity\\")For each possible person, and for each situation in which that person might exist and be free, there is a complete set of true conditional propositions (like (t) and (r)) about what that person would do if she were free in that situation. We will call these a person's \\"counterfactuals of freedom.\\"Now the sad truth about Curley may be this: His counterfactuals of freedom are such that in no matter what situation God places him, if God gives him morally significant freedom in that situation, he would freely do at least one wrong action. He doesn't have to. Curley is free, after all. But God knows that he would. Curley suffers from TWD.Of course, there are possible worlds in which Curley is significantly free and never goes wrong. But God can't actualize those worlds without Curley's help, and Curley's counterfactuals of freedom are such that God knows that such help is not going to be forthcoming. Paradoxically, it might be that only Curley can do what's required to actualize one of those worlds.How the FWD solves the logical problem of evilRemember? The problem was to show that the following propositions are logically consistent.(1) God exists--and is omnipotent, omniscient, and wholly good.(2) There is evil in the world.Plantinga supposes we can do this by finding a proposition implicit in the free will defense that is consistent with (1), and together with (1) entails (2). Now we can see what that proposition is. Here it is:(3) God actualized a world in which there are free creatures who produce some moral goodness; AND all possible persons suffer from TWD, so that God could not have actualized a world in which there were free creatures who produced moral goodness and no moral evil.It's possible that both (1) and (3) are true. Together they entail (2). it follows that (2) is consistent with (1). QED.So why doesn't God just make different counterfactuals of freedom true?Because then they wouldn't be counterfactuals of freedom. For God to fix your counteractuals of freedom for you would be tantamount to making do what he prefers.God is stuck with the counterfactuals of freedom that happen (as a matter of contingent fact) to be true.Does that mean that God isn't omnipotent?Not at all. If the counterfactuals of freedom have a truth value at all, then for each possible person some complete set of counterfactuals must be true. Whichever set that is, no one, no matter how powerful, can make a completely different set of counterfacutals of freedom true."},{"Title":"God, Freedom, & Evil","review":"Plantinga brings some of the best thought done recently in the philosophy of religion down to the level of anyman willing to think. His free will defense appears to refute the problem of evil on at the very least a strictly logical ground. The ontological argument is probably one of the most enjoyable and strange things for me to read about, and while I know Plantinga's treatment of it will not be the last word on it, the argument from Anselm to Plantinga comes close to convincing me. Another interesting benefit of the book is that I became familiar with thinking modally about subjects which has been surprisingly helpful.My only complaint might be is that some specific objections or perhaps the evidential problem of evil could have recieved a little more attention, but doing so would have made the book longer and its shortness is one of the reasons I enjoyed it so much.This book is not for emotional comfort or anything like that.

The theological arguments involved are the same as those in &quot;The Nature of Necessity&quot;, and they are presented with the same wit, rigor, and forceful clarity that characterizes that book. Those who are interested in Plantinga's inimitable brand of tough-minded philosophical theology will find it very useful."},{"Title":"God, Freedom, & Evil","review":"Alvin Plantinga is one of the foremost contemporary Christian philosophers. His extensive and groundbreaking work in analytic philosophy and the philosophy of religion has dealt with many arguments for and against the existence of God with precision and eloquence. This classic work in the philosophy of religion provided a sweeping critique of the argument from evil, but it also helped to initiate a paradigm shift among contemporary philosophers with regard to the problem of evil. Although this book is concerned primarily with the problem of evil, he also briefly examines several arguments in natural theology.With respect to the problem of evil, Plantinga advocates the Free Will Defense. The Free Will Defense contends that the existence of moral evil is so intricately intertwined with the existence of moral freedom that it may be impossible for God to create a world containing genuinely free beings without also permitting the existence of moral evil. It seems obvious that a world containing beings who possess freedom of the will (the ability to make decisions without any antecedent determining conditions) is a more valuable world than one that does not contain such beings, since only beings who act as free agents are capable of moral good and establishing valuable relationships. If this is indeed the case, it would seem that the existence of moral evil is a necessary byproduct of the existence of free beings who are capable of making morally significant decisions.J.L Mackie and other philosophers have claimed that a being with the essential properties of omnipotence, omniscience, and moral perfection could and necessarily would create a world containing free creatures who, despite possessing the capacity to do evil, always manage to do what is morally right. If this were true it would certainly undermine the Free Will Defense because the Free Will Defense is predicated on the assertion that such worlds would be impossible for God to create, and that therefore the existence of moral evil is an inevitable consequence of God's decision to create free beings. Now the question will be \\"does the Free Will defense fall short of satisfying this objection?\\"Alvin Plantinga was the first philosopher to apply the notion of possible worlds to the problem of evil in response to J. L. Mackie's claim that since a world where free creatures always choose to do what is right is an intrinsically possible world, it would seem that God, being omnibenevolent, would choose to actualize such a world. If God could have created a world containing free creatures who never go wrong, it would seem, (according to J.L Mackie) that God should have created that world instead of the world that actually does exist, which contains an extensive amount of gratuitous and unnecessary evil.Although this world is intrinsically possible, Plantinga makes the point that due to our limited knowledge, we are simply not capable of demonstrating that such a world could exist. It may not be feasible for God to create given the truth of certain counterfactuals. God knows how each person would react in response to any possible circumstances they could encounter, but he does not determine what those responses or actions will be. Now, of course, there are many possible outcomes, one of which will be realized given the way the circumstances actually unfold in the world. Now, which possibility becomes an actuality is far from being entirely out of God's control. God may still indirectly shape the course of human history by determining what circumstances people will face. By placing persons in just those circumstances that lead them to act (at least part of the time) in accordance with his will, he could arrange the world of free beings to his liking.God may have desired that a set of circumstances obtain in order to accomplish some goal through the actions of free agents. This means that individual predestination can exist without undermining free will, but it also has the consequence of restricting the number of possible worlds down to those which are compatible with all contingently true propositions involving free choices. For example, God knows that if a certain person S was in circumstance C, he would freely do X. So X would be the free action of the person. There are other possible actions other than X that the person could have committed, but it would be impossible for God to create a world where the same circumstances are encountered and yet a different action is freely committed. So what worlds are feasible for God depends on what actions free persons would perform given a specific state of affairs. So Mackie's claim that God could have created any world he pleased is simply false.Moreover, Plantinga contends that the very essence of man suffers from transworld depravity, which in effect would make it impossible for even an omnipotent God to create beings that simultaneously possess the properties \\"is significantly free\\" and \\"always does what is right.\\" Plantinga defines what he calls \\"transworld depravity\\" as depravity applied to essences rather than persons. In Plantinga's words \\"If E is a person's essence, then that person is the instantiation of E; he is the thing that has (or exemplifies) every property in E. To instantiate an essence, God creates a person who has that essence; and in creating a person He instantiates an essence.\\" He goes on to argue as follows:\\"An essence E suffers from transworld depravity if and only if for every world W such that E contains the properties is significantly free in W and always does what is right in W, there is an action A and a maximal world segment S' such that:(1) S' includes E's being instantiated and E's instantiations being free with respect to A, and A's being morally significant for E's instantiation.(2) S' is included in W but includes neither E's instantiations performing A nor E's instantiations refraining from A.(3) If S' were actual, then the instantiation of E would have gone wrong with respect to A.He then argues that God can only create persons capable of moral good by instantiating essences:(1) God can only create a world that contains moral good if it contains free creatures.(2) Every person is the instantiation of an essence.(3) Therefore, God can only create free persons capable of moral good by instantiated essences.If every essence that could be instantiated would suffer from transworld depravity then no matter what essences He decides to instantiate, the resulting person (if free with respect to A) would inevitably commit some wrong actions. So in this case, it would simply be impossible in principle for God to create a world containing moral good without containing moral evil, since any essence instantiated in a created person who possesses the property of moral freedom with respect to A will suffer from transworld depravity.This is not to say that it is logically impossible that human beings would always choose to do good, rather it is simply to say that human beings lack the inherent capacity to live infallibly. The property of moral perfection is a property that can only be attributed to God himself.Plantinga also deals with one final objection by philosophers James Cornman and Keith Lehrer. While conceding that there is no logical inconsistency with the existence of God and the amount of evil in the world, they make the argument that it is very improbable that God exists given the quantity of evil and suffering the world contains. They argue that if God is omnipotent, then he would be capable of creating all intrinsically possible worlds. If God is all good, then it should follow that He would desire to create the best out of all the intrinsically possible worlds. He would minimize suffering and evil as much as possible. However, it is unlikely that this is actually the best of all possible worlds, and therefore, it is improbable that God exists.The first problem with this argument is that again, it uses the premise that God could have created any possible world, which has been shown to be false. This argument also invokes a supposition that has been termed \\"Leibniz' Lapse.\\" The great philosopher and mathematician Gottfried Leibniz reasoned that an all good God would create the best world he could out of the whole range of possible worlds. Leibniz deduced from this that we must be living in the best of all possible worlds. The problem here seems to be that this argument just assumes without justification that there is such a thing as a \\"best of all possible worlds\\" that God could have created. Why think that such a world could even exist?Plantinga suggests that the range of possible worlds concerning the ratio of joy and goodness to suffering and evil may just continue indefinitely like the set of all natural numbers. In this case, there is no such world as \\"the best of all possible worlds\\" as Leibniz thought. There may be no maximally great world that serves as a limit for potential goodness in reality. So, while this argument is sound, the premises are at least dubious.It seems to me that these are very strong arguments for the compatibility of God and evil. The Free Will defender does not need to show that this is actually the case. The fact that there are possible solutions to the problem of evil shows that God and evil are at least not necessarily incompatible. In order for the atheist's claim that God's existence is incompatible with evil to succeed, the atheist would have to construct a set of premises that render the set of propositions (1.An omnipotent, omniscient, and morally perfect God exists), and (2.Evil exist), implicitly contradictory; but at least up until now, no atheist has been successful."},{"Title":"God, Freedom, & Evil","review":"(As note, much of the material in this book can also be found in \\"The Nature of Necessity\\"by Plantinga. This is a very condensed and less technical version of that book)In this book Plantinga is attempting to answer the *logical problem of evil* and nothing else. The logical problem, briefly stated and according to Mackie, is as follows:(1) God is omnipotent(2) God is wholly goodand(3) Evil existsThe main idea is that this set, taken as a whole, involves a contradiction.While this simple set of propositions might appear inconsequential, this was one the major problems in philosophy of religion for some time. And until Plantinga, this (often called \\"the logical problem of evil\\") was one of the main arguments used against the coherence of traditional theism. Plantinga's main argument details with rigor why this set is not a contradiction (e.g., free will, metaphysics of modality, etc).Because of this book (or the longer, more academic version \\"The Nature of Necessity\\") philosophers have all but stopped discussing the logical problem of evil. This rarely rarely happens in philosophy which is a testament to Plantinga and his book. Buy it, read it and spread the word. It is not logically inconsistent to believe that a good and all-knowing God would allow evil."},{"Title":"God, Freedom, & Evil","review":"I did not care for this book mostly because I do not care for the tedious style of symbolic logic and reasoning. For me it is a tiresome way of getting to the truth of ideas that strike me much more quickly and evidently. If you care for symbolic reasoning and are passionate about it, add a star to this review. If you are both a hard-core theist and fan of the philosophy of religion, perhaps add another star. I am by no means hostile to a religious viewpoint or the philosophy of religion, but I am hostile to the writing style of Alvin Plantinga. He has rare moments of lucidity surrounded by painstaking rambling and confusion. I will say the advantage of the book is that in a little over a hundred pages it introduces some very significant passages in the philosophy of religion, but it simply does not do them full justice. Plantinga seems to dismiss glibly points that are very relevant and dwell on others which hardly need great attention. I have read many books, and this is not one I would care to read twice."},{"Title":"God, Freedom, & Evil","review":"I've read this book but do not own it currently.Probably one of the best books on the free will-type argument. I'm not so sure an explanation for evil is needed, myself. It appears to me that if God does not exist then real evil does not exist. So if God doesn't exist then the argument from evil is useless, the premise that evil exists is invalidated. But if God does exist then obviously the argument is useless. This is the only thing I think presuppositionalism has right.The reviewer with the diatribe below misses important points and basically represents the bad argumentation of atheists perfectly. The biggest problem is that free will and determinism may, indeed, be compatible, but to program humans so they would freely choose only the non-evil choices would be to invalidate that freedom altogether. There's no real freedom in being told &quot;Jump off the cliff or get pushed off the cliff&quot;. This basically treats human beings as a means to an end, and it would seem that that is morally inferior to REAL freedom(i.e the ability to do both good and evil). The second problem is that the Cosmological argument NEVER says ALL things need a cause. The Kalam version says that all things that have a beginning need a cause, and the contingency variations say that all wholly contingent facts need a cause, mixed contingents and necessary facts don't need a cause, necessarily. For the writer to bring up Bertrand Russel is amusing because theists put his arguments away decades ago. The great thing is that Russel's argument admits the premises, things that begin need causes. He escapes by saying that theists say God is eternal and thus doesn't need a cause. So he says, why couldn't the universe be eternal and therefore be uncaused? It sure could be eternal! But it's not! It's funny that Russel should even suggest that it could be eternal when he was one of the earliest supporters of relativity theory, which had invalidated the idea that the universe was eternal a couple decades before he wrote &quot;Why I am not a Christian&quot;. Possibly our detracting friend could pull out the more sophisticated objections of Mackie in &quot;The Miracle of Theism&quot;. Quite frankly Mackie is the only objector that I take seriously. It's too bad he's no longer with us. Another thing is the absolutely weird idea of calling a natural disaster &quot;Evil&quot;. It would seem to me that evil is something that can only be actualized by a mind, something with intent. Does the universe have intentions!? It would seem not. Natural disasters, like earthquakes, hurricanes, all serve very good purposes. In fact, hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, etc, are all elements in your standard argument from Fine-Tuning. Earthquakes sifting minerals up from the earth's crust and the ocean floor allow for more diversity of the types of extant life. So basically you can only argue against the free will argument by invalidating your premises, setting up a straw man, etc. And argue against the Cosmological Argument by setting up a straw man as well. When atheists deal with the arguments as they appear, then we can take them seriously.On one good note, I would agree that we can't throw the blaim of evil on Satan or Demons, that would seem silly. On the one hand, Satan and Demons are never given that kind of power. Satan tempts, and that's basically the extent of his power, demons can &quot;possess&quot;(leaving aside the discussion of what that means, exactly) but they don't have absolute power over any individual.In conclusion, Plantinga's book is as strong as ever, and it appears that his detractors continue to desparately twist themselves into logical pretzels to try and skirt around his answers. Which is no surprise, something that's so obvious to most people as the existence of God would be hard to argue against, it's so intuitive that it's going to take alot better arguments from atheists to shake it than are currently available. I mean, come on, more people deny that there's anything you can call truth than there are that deny there is a God."},{"Title":"Not My Father's War","review":"David Martin is the only reason that I still watch the CBS Evening News.

The fatal decision made by an officer just getting his pass stamped by serving in Vietnam was repeated way too often during this monumental conflict. Unfortunately, I also witnessed similar events and saw first hand how just a simple errant directive got good men killed. It needs to be told over and over as this novel does, less we ever forget that brave men die for sometimes the most inane reasons and it never, ever will feel right as the years pass.

He is telling the story of a white southern man overcoming his racist surroundings and truly befriending a fellow black soldier in Vietnam. This touching message is often overshadowed by the unfortunate decision to render the speech of African American and Asian characters in almost unreadable stereotypical slang. The contrast with the narrator's dialogue, which is rendered in crisp grammatically correct sentences, contributes to the sense moral superiority and self-importance. Here is an example from the narrator meeting a Vietnamese scout: &quot;'Have a seat, and if it's all the same to you we'll call you 'Hip', easier for the troops to remember.' 'Hip, be very fine Lootentant.' 'Coke?' I asked him. 'Coke also very fine.'&quot; (pg. 115).

They do, however, show \\"what a big deal\\" numerical calculations were in the days before powerful computers became readily available.The tables in the book were computed using electromechanical calculators by a team of mathematicians (who typically were young women). Anyone interested, can now perform these faster and more accurate on a PC. (It might be of interest to check the calculations on a PC just to see how accurate such hand calculations were -- I suspect pretty accurate.)The title of the book refers to \\"rockets,\\" but except for a mention in the introduction, the book actually has very little to do with rockets per se. The main subject of the book is two-body trajectories whose eccentricities are near unity: that is, skinny ellipses or hyperbolas. I suppose these were intended to be used for vertical sounding rockets, or perhaps lunar probes. They are not applicable to near-earth satellites.The author, Samuel Herrick, was a pioneer of astrodynamics; in fact, he is credited with coining the name. His works were often considered solid but not especially \\"inspiring.\\""},{"Title":"Judo Heart and Soul","review":"Judo: Heart & Soul is such a good book.It is not technical in nature so you will not learn new techniques from it.What you will get from this book is the set of small wisdoms, tips and stories about Judo that we all live through, or that we will be going through.What I like about this book is that it fills the voidin what Judo books usually cover. Most of the books out there (and many of them are great) are Judo technical or reference books. That is all great, but what I always wanted wasthis kind of a practice and competition guide - full of wisdoms, tips, and mental guides. This book is exactly that- it is a group of essays that talk about common experiences in Judo that keep you going.What was the most helpful to me was the set of confirmations that I found in the book about how I approach Judo, how I practice it,what I do and think in competition ...In other words, I realize now that I am not crazy - we all (Judoka) are."},{"Title":"Judo Heart and Soul","review":"This is not a technical manual, but a motovational speech put to paper.

He is not only one of the best practitioners ever to compete in the sport but an excellent instructor and lecturer as well. I learned more during those few hours than I did in many of the preceding months.This excellent book reads very much like meeting him in person. His stories are interesting and inspirational. His training tips are solid and well illustrated. The first chapter is a collection of short vignettes. The second provides excellent technical advice, mostly about throws. The third chapter is strategic, focusing on competition and how to better your chances of becoming a champion. The final chapter is more vignettes and philosophy from this outstanding martial artist.

Any American Judo player would be proud to be half as accomplished as this author!Now, the first annoying flaw in this book is Mr. Nishioka's advocacy of the evolution in Judo, away from the traditional Japanese view, while at the same time quoting Japanese advice, wisdom, philosophy, adages, training tips, and his own Japanese training in Japan to validate his knowledge on the subject. His endorsement of Judo reform had already appeared prior to this book as early as January 1970 in his Black Belt magazine article entitled: 'Judo vs. Wrestling' in which Hayward Nishioka made it perfectly clear that he approved of wrestling technique, or anything that worked, being introduced into Judo, euphemistically calling it &quot;enrichment&quot;. Yet the undermining futuristic observation included in his own article was a Judo competitor's prophetic observation that a third type of sport may be born from the combination of wrestling and Judo; as all the while spectators were screaming: &quot;Boo, that's not Judo!&quot; to a shiai they paid to see.I feel the Japanese and the Kodokan are aware of this potential Judo hybrid disaster waiting to happen, and are taking steps to preserve the integrity of the art. Evolution is a natural process which contains both mutation and extinction. A small amount of mutation has already been observed in Judo from the introduction of wrestling and S.A.M.B.O. techniques into Olympic Judo of the 1980s and 90s and Mr. Nishioka should understand why the Japanese do not want Judo to evolve into extinction.The second major flaw in this book still revolves around the author's advocacy of change in Judo (p.110) while insisting that Judo rules remain fixed, for example his assertion &quot;Like it or not, koka is here to stay&quot; (p. 114). There is an inherent contradiction to promote change then invoke an absolute! If there is going to be evolution in Judo than both the koka rule and the inclusion of non-Judo technique (or hopefully, the baby blue gi) are subject to change; specifically: be removed! Again, compounding this fallacy is the author's promotion of koka Judo (p.114) while advocating &quot;Isho Kemei&quot; - Do the very best you can (p.31) which is quite the opposite of accepting and practicing koka Judo. Just as affirmative action programs have lowered standards in business and education within American society, koka Judo has similarly lowered standards in the international society of tournament Judo.The Japanese still have the best Judo in the world, and Mr. Hayward Nishioka of all people, having studied in Japan, should promote and not hinder this Japanese gift to the world.All-in-all, JUDO HEART &amp; SOUL is a good read for the intermediate Judo player because of its insight into what lies down the road for anyone who devotes himself to just winning Judo trophies and medals."},{"Title":"The First Stone: Some Questions About Sex and Power","review":"One of those books you can't put down, and thus read from early afternoon 'till 3 the next morning.A highly controversial Australian best seller, this is a personal account of the Author's attempt to discover the truth behind a claim of sexual harrassment. Two young, astute and attractive young women are the complainants, a quiet, genial (clumsy or innocent?) college warden approaching retirement the &quot;victim&quot;.Helen Garner, a feminist of the old school, questions the destructive bitterness the direction modern feminism has taken on this case, and further questions the portrayal of the young women in the case as &quot;powerless&quot; - the very opposite thing feminism should be doing, in her view.What I can't put in words is the beautiful writing; the sympathetic, transcendent portrayal of the human condition with all its foibles.You must read this book!"},{"Title":"The First Stone: Some Questions About Sex and Power","review":"This book brilliantly reveals the perversion of feminist ideals and the highly destructive nature of gender-ideological warfare on campuses in Australia in the 1990s. It is a lucid piece of investigative writing that explores the highly complex world of gender politics and its miserable downfall in a country where public opinion has been motivated by default to sympathise with the woman in cases of sexual harassment as a result of stereotypical imagery of male aggression and dominance in the sexual environment. Most importantly, the book describes how incorrect and false these stereotypes can be.The First Stone illustrates the destruction of one man's life; his profession, his family, his reputation as a respected member of the academic community, all this despite his acquittal, due to the relentless attacks on his person for being identified as a cultural outsider (in the College he ran with great success and enthusiasm) by feminist interest groups hell bent at \`getting back' at the class he is meant to represent. This is a highly recommended book by those who wish to understand the other side of the story."},{"Title":"The First Stone: Some Questions About Sex and Power","review":"As a university undergradute in the 1990s, i can identify with many of the issues that Garner writes about in this book. There was a culture in Australian universities that harrassment was a big issue, and it did occassionally go overboard (the veiwpoint 'that every man is a potential rapist'is one i heard myself more than once)though i think the pendulum is starting to swing the other way again.Garner is a good writer, and manages to take what could have been a very dry subject and bring it to life without making it a rant. There is enough of the personal in this to make it interesting, and the author is quite open in relating her biases. I do feel that occassionally she is a little too histrionic in her retelling of conversations with others, and the story does jump about a bit; but overall the reporting is top class.While things may have moved on in the gender wars in Australia to other battlefields, this book is still important, even if only as an exhibit in the history of Australian feminism. I know that there was a lot of debate generated when it was first published, and i know it made me think through many principles that i myself hold. I hope that other readers are also able to take away something from reading this well written book."},{"Title":"The First Stone: Some Questions About Sex and Power","review":"This was a really hard book to put down. my opinion was conflicted from page to page.

I would love to discuss this book in a room of women from different generations,, I think there would be a huge difference in it's perception."},{"Title":"The First Stone: Some Questions About Sex and Power","review":"I've now read three of Helen Garner's works and have been thoroughly enthralled by all of them. She is truly one of Australia's great writers and has an amazing knack for narrative non-fiction. This is a must-read for those who work in universities, university students, and anyone with an interest in Australian feminism."},{"Title":"The First Stone: Some Questions About Sex and Power","review":"Garner is one of Australia's finest writers, and she can take any subject and make it compelling, insightful reading.This is a very dense book, and several readings are needed to grasp all the issues that Garner raises.This book would be best described as Garner's thoughts and feeling about a sexual harrassment case at a University in Melbourne. A Master of a Melbourne university college was accused of harassing two students, ( originally 5 students brought claims against this man, but three dropped their complaints).There was strong criticism of this book from feminists, and indeed it was later revealed that Garner had obfuscated facts, to suit her viewpoint."},{"Title":"The First Stone: Some Questions About Sex and Power","review":"It was hard to read this book, because I had immensely enjoyed Garner's novels - and perhaps fiction is what she should stick with - but The First Stone revealed more about Garner's insecurities about aging, the rapid changes of political context, as well as a lack of grasp of what constitutes responsible journalism. It was simply unethical to \\"split\\" one actual person into multiple characters in a book (which lends more authenticity to one's book); likewise, it was also disturbing to read of her opinions about unwanted sexual advances from undesirable men (i.e. one should laugh it off and secretly feel flattered). And finally, there is just an eerie undercurrent resentment against younger women (which recurred again in Joe Cinque's Consolation). In recent times, there has been plenty of criticism about the vampire fiction series, Twilight, particularly with how the author infantilises and erotises power and domination. Well, if you have read Garner's \\"journalistic\\" account of the Ormond College sexual harassment case, then you will know where the whole history comes from: tire old twaddle of Jungian theory from the 1970s. Time to put them in their rightful place, which is in the history archive. I would advise reading this book along with Bodyjamming (ed by Jenna Mead), which was an excellent response to Garner. I would also recommend reading Doris Lessing's second autobiography, Walking in the Shade, for a no-nonsense intellectual dissection of psychoanalytic babble."},{"Title":"An American Seafarer in the Age of Sail: The Erotic Diaries of Philip C. Van Buskirk, 1851-1870","review":"Book stores are full of works that view history through the eyes of rich, famous people. But many times the unknowns have had front row seats, too, and their insights are fresh, new, and honest. Burg's Van Buskirk is perhaps the most quirky voice from history since Samuel Pepys. And Burg's witty, clean writing and meticulous attention to detail make him real -- and relavent. This book chronicles a fascinating time in history, and exposes an interesting bit-player, warts and all. The price probably means that only those interested in maritime, history, or gay-studies will end up stumbling across this book, but it is worthy of a wider audience. A fascinating read."},{"Title":"An American Seafarer in the Age of Sail: The Erotic Diaries of Philip C. Van Buskirk, 1851-1870","review":"(...)From a sociological standpoint, many parents with little means to support their families allowed their young children to leave their homes and seek out the life that may or may not have have been meant for them, many at a very young age. As a result, their sexual and socioligical attitudes were lacking.Another issue about Van Buskirk's diary is not what he wrote in his diary but what he failed to include in it. (...)What were the backgrounds of the other young sailors he shared his life with? He gave almost no insights into the other sailors' backgrounds and previous pasts. Was he so intent on his glorious crusade to stop them from their \\"evil\\" ways that he had no time to find out something about their \\"checkered\\" pasts? Of course, we will never know the answers to these and many other questions.All in all, this diary captures a rare view of one man's life as a sailor as well as his self sacrificing, moral crusade for those around him."},{"Title":"An American Seafarer in the Age of Sail: The Erotic Diaries of Philip C. Van Buskirk, 1851-1870","review":"Picking up this book, I expected it to contain an edition of Van Buskirk's diaries. Instead, it contains the events within them paraphrased and summarized by the editor. I'm not sure what the purpose was of presenting the texts in this way.&quot;Erotic&quot;, in the subtitle, is a misnomer. Van Buskirk was a pedophile, though he seems not to have acted much on his desires. He was attracted, according to his diaries, to both young boys and girls. At least based on what we're given by the editor, he gives little description of any sexual encounter.This book is fascinating in that it gives us a portrait of a disturbed individual. Despite the author's inexplicable attempts to portray Van Buskirk as normal, the diarist was not simply a product of his time. He was unable to keep a job and, on several occasions, absconded with others' money and possessions; when he joined the Confederate army, he deserted. He was obsessive, emotionally immature, and had sexual problems -- pedophilia, compulsive obsession and nocturnal emissions into his 30's. He was unable to maintain a meaningful relationship with any of the subjects of his quasi-sexual obsessions. Few memoirs give us such a window into the mind of a messed-up person.Van Buskirk's diaries also provide information on life aboard US Navy ships in the mid-19th century, which was apparently characterized by frequent homoerotic behavior (which the obsessive Van Buskirk disapproved of but was fascinated with)."},{"Title":"The Story of a Nobody, and the Pursuit to Become a Somebody","review":"You gotta get this book!

I have been a wrestling fan all my life, and I have read just about every book about wrestling. This was by far my favorite autobiography. No other comes close.Matt Murphy is more honest and fearless than any other autobiographer whose book I have read. He had a very tough life, and he didn't hold anything back from me as a reader. I could feel his pain when he talked about some of his struggles. When he talked about being on the verge of suicide and his brother saved his life with a phone call I called my own brother and told him I was thinking about him.The Story Of A Nobody And The Pursuit To Become A Somebody was not a sad book. I laughed through most of it. Nothing is off-limits as he writes about sex, drinking, using pain killers, the temptations of steroids, pornography, discrimination, and just about everything else imaginable in his own unique way.For non wrestling readers, the parts about wrestling are described very clearly and throughly so nobody gets confused.

As it is currently situated, education serves almost entirely an economic function, in preparing students to enter the workforce and become good consumers in a successful economy. Whatever social functions the school serves are relegated to the background, and in fact tend to be discouraged if they are ever considered to be possibly getting in the way of the true goals. Of course, Noddings is also right in that we seem to have even lost focus of our original economic aims. The need to compete with others in standardized testing has forced students to learn things that may be becoming increasingly less and less relevant - Noddings's point about how asking an algebra teacher says that the point of a lesson is always going to be related only to other algebra lessons is something that every student of the school system has been frustrated with at one point or another (75).Fortunately, Noddings does not fall into the trap that I envisioned as possible - that she would instead declare that the defined goal of education should be happiness. Such a lofty but ultimately nonsubstantive goal would be, to put it quite simply, silly, and ultimately even worse than the economic goals of the current arrangement. Fortunately, Noddings avoids the mistake of trying to make a singular definition of happiness and then working toward it. Instead, the final two thirds of the book are devoted to various different parts of life that Noddings would like to see become more prominent as aims of education. What makes the book so good is in how Noddings successfully weaves in the notion of happiness throughout all of these elements of life - which include raising a family, spirituality, participation in the democratic process, and, yes, in the workplace - together with the discussion of how education must be aimed toward these goals. It is almost as if the book is a collaboration of two distinct theses - how these parts of life are important to our happiness, and how education must serve these parts of life - and that seems to be the reason for how the book flows as well as it does when it is based on a topic like happiness that in lesser hands would be incredibly trite and quickly grow repetitive.Of the two theses, neither is easy to quibble with. In regard to the thesis about how schools need to refocus their aims toward more relevant applications, I certainly have no disagreement; I believe that we clearly have lost track of what schools should be about and that the U.S. educational system is slowly careening toward greater and greater irrelevance (although it probably isn't much of a new phenomenon after all; how much of what scholars studied in ancient times was really necessary for their life experiences?). The idea of how the various elements that Noddings discusses as being keys to personal happiness are somewhat more spurious, in that personal happiness is by definition personal, and what makes one person happy is going to be far different from what makes another person happy (traditional education does make many lifelong scholars happy, for one). But Noddings does allow for this, and so I have no quarrel with her desire to try to point out some elements that typically make people happy for the sake of the argument.Consider a sample sentence from the introduction to chapter 7; the introductions to all of the chapters in parts 2 and 3 of the book are structured quite similarly: \\"Possibly there is no human task more demanding, more rewarding, and more universal than parenting, and yet our schools apparently think that algebra and Shakespeare are more important\\" (138). The point of how schools are inadequate in their current aims is constantly reinforced. Here Noddings makes the argument that education needs to be reshaped such that students become more acquainted with concepts like child-rearing and how parents can play effective roles in their children's lives, \\"without preaching or direct instruction\\" (156). Noddings is right in having to address this final qualifier, since such nontraditional lessons might be controversial if they try to teach right and wrong answers in the same way that algebra might. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't try to go in that direction. After all, having an open discussion about the legitimacy of educational lessons is far from being the worst thing that could happen. The worst thing, rather, would be to maintain our current inertia."},{"Title":"Happiness and Education","review":"In Happiness And Education, author and academician Nel Noddings (Lee L. Jacks Professor of Education, Emerita, Standford University) draws upon her years of experience, expertise and research as a teacher, administrator, and curriculum developer in public schools to address the very specific issue of the relationship of happiness to that of the experience of education and why, although parental expectations are quite clear that happiness is a kind of byproduct of education, it is not normal mentioned as one of the principle aims of education. Professor Noddings explores what it means to be happy, and then goes on to address how educators can help children to understand what happiness is. Criticizing an almost exclusive focus on economic well-being as the approved outcome of educational accomplishment, Professor Noddings emphasizes the contributions education provides with respect to making a home, parenting, developing character and interpersonal growth, identifying and engaging in work that is satisfying, participating effectively in a political democracy, and ways in which we can make schools and classrooms happy places of learning and intellectual exploration. Happiness And Education is especially commended to the attention of public and private school teachers, and administrative policy makers as informed, thoughtful, and though-provoking reading."},{"Title":"Happiness and Education","review":"Even though I live in Norway where the educational system works differently than in the US, this book was a real eyeopener to me. In a time where the school focuses more and more on the student's achievements in basic subjects like math, reading and writing, and where there's been put more and more weight on testing the students in these skills, this book represent and alternative way of thinking. Do we all need an academic education? Why do we educate students in the thought that all of them should go on with their studies beyond a collegelevel? What about all those occupations where you don't need academic skills, those occupations where you need practical skills? (skills that you weren't taught in school because the weight was put on the teoretical subjects).

They do this using only the example those adults supply by speaking. While adults do simplify their speech when talking to very young children, we rarely have a formal program of language instruction in mind. Rather, we simplify our speech so that we can be understood. From this input children are able to learn to distinguish words, understand the meaning of words and combine them into sentences. In no time a child is speaking his language and speaking it correctly.How this process occurs is the topic of Steven Pinker's monograph &quot;Language Learnability and Language Development&quot;. He focuses on how a child can learn the grammar of his language. His approach is quite formal and technical, as is fitting for a professor of linguistics writing for an audience of professional researchers. The ultimate goal is to define a set of algorithms that processes the input (the sentences heard by the child) and creates a set of rules that define the grammar of the language the child is hearing.Pinker's description of this process begins with the question of word order. A child must determine in what order his language puts words. Should he put the subject before the verb (He runs. vs. Runs he.), should an adjective precede a noun (white house in English, casa blanca in Spanish)? Where should an indirect object go? This isn't easy work. All the child has to go on are the sentences she hears and some non-verbal signals (pointing, tone of voice, the context of the utterance). Actually, the child has a little bit more; Pinker argues, as do many linguists, that we are all born with a mental framework for grammar. This can be imagined as a series of rules with some blanks to be filled in. All of the world's grammars can be described by filling in the blanks differently. So the child is not without some guidance.Once the child has identified the basic meanings of some of the words this framework for grammar and the algorithms Pinker proposes work together to determine how sentences are constructed. As the child learns more words and more of the basic grammar rules, more difficult notions can be tackled. The text proceeds through topics such as noun-verb agreement, verb forms and irregular verbs, auxiliary verbs (including the troublesome word &quot;do&quot; in English) and the formation of passive constructions. For each issue Pinker describes a framework and a series of rules for filling the blanks.The fundamental constructs and the nature of the rules require the reader to have some understanding of formal grammars (the transformational grammars of Chomsky or the LFG that Pinker bases his arguments on). Your understanding doesn't have to be deep, but it would be difficult to work your way through the book without some familiarity with the subject. Further the algorithms are given reasonably formally (not purely mathematically, but certainly it requires some effort to piece them together). In some sections of the text you may be forced, as I was, to simply skim over the details in an attempt gain some understanding.This is an older text (1984 for the first edition) and Pinker was trying not only to present his results, but--and perhaps most interestingly--develop a method for analyzing any theory of language acquisition. He even uses these criteria to judge his own theories. He can tell us where his ideas on language acquisition succeed, admits where they fail, and hypothesizes how they can be improved. This methodology defined a successful research program that continues today Pinker makes his case through careful, clear, and compelling arguments. This discipline isn't easy. Most of the experiments one would need to run, in order to validate the theory, would be highly unethical (let's speak to a child only in the passive voice, let's never ask a child a question and see what happens). So the theories have to be verified by the sentences children speak and a few experiments, usually with made up words. Unfortunately, the sentences children speak do not unambiguously tell us the grammar they used to construct them.I am no expert in this subject matter. I picked up the book because I had enjoyed the books Steven Pinker has written for the interested layman, such as &quot;The Language Instinct&quot;, &quot;Words and Rules&quot; and &quot;How the Mind Works&quot;. I did have to work hard to try to understand the text and I am sure I didn't fully understand some of the more technical arguments. However, as a soon to be father of a new language learner, I will watch with heightened appreciation my child's fascinating ability to learn English."},{"Title":"Language Learnability and Language Development: First Edition (Cognitive Science Series)","review":"Well, maybe it is like wise mana from heaven to other linguists. But I am a parent in a trilingual household who was looking for some insights into how my 3 year old's language development was going on. I will now pull two phrases out of the book COMPLETELY AT RANDOM to show why I gave up:&quot;Braine concludes that in every instance in which a child frequently utters both possible orders of a pair of categories, either (a) both orders are found in the adult language, and the child has learned the two orders separately (evidence for this is the fact that one order typically predominates at first and then is supplemented by the alternative order; or (b) there is independent evidence that the utterances reflect a pregrammatical &quot;groping pattern&quot; in which the child wants to communicate a semantic relation, lacks the grammatical means to do so, and strings words together randomly in the hope of being understood.&quot;That one is not so bad, actually. How about,&quot;When a paradigm is split in response to a violation of the Unique Entry principle for a given cell, the child in effect &quot;expects&quot; to find alternative entries for each of his or her other existing affixes that do not already have alternatives with strong lexical entries&quot;.Having three post graduate degrees and learned to speak a second language fluently as an adult, so I actually know something about the subject of language acquisition and am not afraid of dense prose. But this book defeated me after a few pages.It is in my view supremely ironic that, given their field of study, linguistic scholars seem to be abominably poor at communication."},{"Title":"Language Learnability and Language Development: First Edition (Cognitive Science Series)","review":"At first glance, this appeared to be a more formidable effort than &quot;The Language Instinct&quot;, which seemed aimed at a very wide (and perhaps more credulous) audience.However, the argument seems fairly simple:1. A grammar can be abstracted from speech (in this case, English speech) based on observed regularities.2. We can observe a change in a child's speech as he/she moves from simpler to more complex grammatical forms. So we can identify each such change in terms of the starting and ending forms.3. For any such changes, we surmise the child has come up with one or more rules to enable him/her to acquire the more complex form.The focus seems to be predominantly on the lexical and syntactical forms. Semantics seemed to be mentioned but not much of a concern here. Behaviorists, on the other hand, tend to emphasize the function of speech (although not discounting the importance of syntax).So, as a probably very naive example, consider a child who can say &quot;Give me the apple&quot;. Pinker may have noted that the syntax is correct but omits the use of an adjective. Skinner may be wondering whether the child's statement will be reinforced by being given an apple. Now suppose at some later time there are two apples in sight, a red one and a green one. The child now says &quot;Give me the red apple.&quot; Pinker has never heard the child use an adjective before and notes that as a development in language acquisition. Skinner wonders if the child's statement will be reinforced by being given the red apple and may be pleased to see that child was able to request that red one.The child's syntax, for whatever reason, was correct but it happened in service of the child's request for an apple. It's wonderful he/she was able to say it in that way, but it also seems wonderful that he/she got an apple.In such a situation, one can really see the red apple. One can really hear the child ask for it and really see the child get it. One really heard the request. How real was the syntax? Well, it may not be explicit in the sense the child or listener are aware of it as syntax. But it may make a big difference if the syntax were wrong in that the child's request could fail. So perhaps we can say the syntax is real (and diagram it if we like). Now can we say that the rule is real that allowed the child to go from the request without the adjective to the request with the adjective. Maybe, but it seems less clear. It also seems less clear how the child made the step. Did he/she create the rule somehow using an innate langauge ability? Or did he/she imitate something he/she had heard? But what if the child had heard a request for a &quot;green apple&quot; and could tell what &quot;red&quot; was but had never heard of a &quot;red apple&quot;. Or what if the child had heard of a &quot;red apple&quot;.Now I've gotten myself into trouble. Do I turn to Pinker or Skinner for the answer? Is it an either/or? Does it matter that the child wants something to eat or only that he/she is demonstrating an innate capacity for grammar?So where did the syntax come from? Where did the rules come from? Who ate the apple?Grammarians find grammar. Cognitive scientists find mind. One way or another, the child got the apple. Which of these does natural selection seem to favor?"},{"Title":"Citrix Access Suite 4 for Windows Server 2003: the Official Guide, Third Edition","review":"I read the book cover to cover and was VERY disappointed.

Hopefully, we may catch up to its wisdom; hopefully, we may grow in understanding enough to learn from Our Holy Father thoughtful words and, most importantly, put them into practice, even as he preaches.For it is not enough simply to preach the Gospel and walk away, as the Pope reminds us here; we must also preach by our practice. As any good teacher knows, we must demonstrate, fearlessly and faithfully, that all-giving, self-sacrificing, total love Jesus Christ Himself taught and lived. Thus may our preaching have meaning for our world, wherever we find ourselves, especially among those poor and abandoned by this world. Thus may our preaching the Good News bear fruit in this time and place, by not only our preaching but our total living the Good News.Permit me to quote a few passages from this important later encyclical of Our Holy Father, ranking in importance for today with his Populorum Progressio, etc. Our Holy Father writes that the Church \\"has the duty to proclaim the liberation of millions of human beings, among whom are many of the Church's own children; the duty to help bring this liberation forth in the world, to bear witness to it and to make sure it is total. None of this is alien to evangelization.\\" (EN 30)The Pope furthers writes: \\"The Church is not willing to restrict its mission only to the religious field and dissociate itself from man's temporal problems.\\" (EN 34)The Holy Father also writes of the struggle for human liberation from oppression to salvation in Jesus Christ (EN 35). He further clearly states: \\"The Church strives always to insert the Christian struggle for liberation in the universal plan of salvation which it proclaims.\\" (EN 38)This pastoral Papal Exhortation, calling us not only to preach but to live the Gospel message of liberation of the poor and freedom for the captive (see Luke where Jesus reads Isaiah in his local synagogue, first announcing the themes of his ministry) needs to be studied and read and put into practice today, now more than ever, when we have so much to lead us astray and to confuse us. Turn off that television. Contemplate this message from Our Holy Father speaking to us clearly, concisely, intelligently, compassionately, challengingly, even now, today. Live this Good News of salvation and liberation, in our lives and in our world, despite all obstacles we meet from the powers and dominations of this world.Pacem in Terris."},{"Title":"The Chavez Code: Cracking U. S. Intervention in Venezuela","review":"The book is well researched and backed by official documents. The facts seem to irritate some people.The US was a shining example in the 50's, it has since become like a big locust, it reaches around the world consuming natural resources at an alarming rate, destroying the environment as it does so. Relegating the peoples of their own countries to second class status. Deposing democratically elected leaders. All for the purpose of capitalism, not democracy.This is not about the spread of Democracy or Socialism, particularly when the US is known to incite insurrection against a democratically elected leader and throw its support behind military dictators who commit human rights violations such as Marcos, Pinochet, Noriega, Franco, etc.Greed.This is all about control of world resources and the US companies are losing control around the globe. When they are not allowed to consume someone else's resources at will, the Govt. quickly moves to label that leader in an unfavorable manner, then tries to depose him or her. We would think in the year 2007 the US would have grown up to a point where it simply trades for goods instead of trying to control all goods.In South America, Hugo just happens to be the most outspoken of the various Presidents. Another problem for the US is that Chavez and the Iranian Pres both want to change selling their oil from the petrodollar (US dollar) to the Euro. (Btw, Saddam made that same threat.) All of a sudden these two have become the biggest threats to democracy? More like a huge threat to US dollar which has been backed by oil since the changeover from the gold standard in the 70's.I'd like to see your next book delve more into the oil situation and how its sale is tied to the US dollar.

S. Intervention in Venezuela","review":"This book proves clearly the involvement of the US government in the April 12, 2002 coup against President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela.As Saul Landau states in his excellent foreword: \`the US government acted in a premeditated conspiracy with the wealthy classes of Venezuela to undo a democratic process in a country with free and fair elections and a functioning legislative and legal system.'Before the coup, the US penetrated all sectors of the civil society, political parties and Armed Forces in Venezuela; the latter through control of those who had received training at the School of the Americas. During the PDVSA (Petroleos de Venezuela SA) strike against Hugo Chavez a US company with CIA ties intentionally sabotaged essential equipment.Despite the fact that coups against democratic governments are illegal, the US financed the plotters, which included representatives of the Catholic Church.During the failed coup (it lasted only 2 days), all of Venezuela's democratic institutions were dissolved. There were flagrant media manipulations (CNN) and the US press unanimously praised the Venezuelan president's undemocratic ouster.This shameful saga tells also the story of an assassination (Danilo Anderson) and a kidnapping (Luisa Ortega Diaz).Eva Golinger did magnificent research under the Freedom of Information Act. She points rightly her finger at the totally biased media monopolies (the Cisneros group controls 70 media outlets in 39 countries).This book sketches a terrible story of a totally undemocratic intervention in a foreign country by another \`democratic' state.A must read for all those who are fighting for a real democracy.I highly recommend the TV report made of this coup by Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Brien \`The Revolution will not be televized'."},{"Title":"The Chavez Code: Cracking U.

Intervention in Venezuela","review":"\\"The Chavez Code\\" is the most important book for Americans to read when wanting to know about Venezuela's revolution and the Bush regime's intense efforts to stop it. Eva Golinger here chronicles the impressive rise of Hugo Chavez and the Bolivarian Revolution and the amazing failed coup that was pulled off in 2002. Golinger educates the reader with great information and interesting insights, revealing here how Chavez has been dismissed by Washington since first enterting office in 1998, we find out that even in his first days as President the Clinton White House was pressuring him not to visit Cuba before hitting Washington because it would \\"look bad\\" (Chavez defied the bullying and still went to Havana first). But the most important and gripping chapters deal with the obvious American intervention taking place in Venezuela, why? Because Chavez has brought a socialist system to the country where the nation's oil wealth is not controlled by a small, white minority. This has of course ticked off the country's rich oligarchy and U.S. corporations which are scared stiff of nationalizations. Golinger provides damning, documented evidence of U.S. involvement and it's knowledge that a coup was in the works. In impressive detail she shows us how much of Venezuela's media has been manipulated to stir chaos and violence through obviously CIA-funded propaganda (think of Fox News times ten). The privately-owned networks have been used to spread false information and were used especially during the coup to shut the public from what was really happening. As Golinger informs us, these tactics are not new and were most famously used by the CIA in Chile during the elected, socialist government of Salvador Allende, who was overthrown by the cruel dictator Augusto Pinochet in a U.S.-backed coup. In \\"The Chavez Code\\" we learn the disturbing, documented lengths to which the fascists in Venezuela will go to try and starve their country in order to stir chaos, in on case one of the nation's richest food company barons ordered his workers to dump milk into rivers in order to help spark a shortage. During the coup the frightening attitudes of the coup leaders were displayed when the installed puppet president disassembled congress, shredded the constitution and said everything was fine. When the coup failed due to public outcry, Chavez was brought back by the people, and of course the private TV stations never covered it, they ran cartoons instead. \\"The Chavez Code\\" shows us that the age-old tactics of fascism are not dead at all but very well alive and supported by our government. It is a chronicle of a nation striving to better itself and find new means to change society, but the battle against tyranny is hard and here Golinger does a great service to the cause of spreading the truth, because in this day and age, the truth is the most important tool we have."},{"Title":"The Chavez Code: Cracking U. S. Intervention in Venezuela","review":"Eva Golinger, an American-Venezuelan lawyer and graduate of New York Law School, has produced a remarkable book based on documents obtained under the US Freedom of Information Act. They show how the US state has schemed incessantly to overthrow Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez.The USA funds opposition movements across Latin America, through its \`National Endowment for Democracy'. Since 2000, the US state has spent $34 million to \`promote democracy' in Venezuela. This would seem unnecessary, as Venezuela has held three elections and a referendum since 1998. In these open and fair elections, the people of Venezuela elected Chavez as their President three times. Each time he won about 60% of the vote.In January 2002, the Catholic Church came out against Chavez and backed the opposition. The National Endowment for Democracy increased its funding to the opposition just before the April 2002 coup. Documents prove that the US state knew all about the coup plot. On the day of the coup, the US state at once declared it legitimate and tried to get other governments to do so too. Coup leader Carmona announced that he was dissolving the National Assembly, the Supreme Court and the Constitution. After the coup failed, the State Department gave the NED another $1 million, which it promptly gave to the coup plotters!In December 2002, the US state called for \`early elections', which, just as in the USA, are not allowed under the Constitution. It backed the opposition's next ploy, a 64-day lockout, miscalled a \`general strike', which cost Venezuela $10 billion. On its second day, US Secretary of State Colin Powell met Carmona in Colombia.The US state claimed that Cuban troops and Colombian guerrillas were operating in Venezuela to support Chavez. Later it claimed that Al Qa'ida had terrorist training camps in Venezuela. Needless to say, both claims were outrageous lies: Brigadier General Mixon, the US Southern Command's director of operations, reported, \\"The Southern Command has no information about Venezuela supporting terrorists.\\"New US Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice accused Chavez of interfering in the internal affairs of other nations! In January 2005, she said that Venezuela belonged in Latin America's equivalent of the \`Axis of evil'. In October 2005, the US Army published its \`Doctrine for Asymmetric War against Venezuela'. Last year, the US Defense Department called Venezuela a \`growing threat'. The US state allows anti-Chavez Cuban and Venezuelan militia groups to run terrorist training camps in the Miami area.And, as with all the US state's aggressions and interventions, the British state is fully complicit. So the Labour government backs the US threat to Venezuela's sovereignty and independence. For example, Blair told Parliament on 8 February 2006, \\"It is rather important that the government of Venezuela realise that if they want to be respected members of the international community they should abide by the rules of the international community.\\" It is the US state, not the government of Venezuela, which continually breaks international law by interfering in the internal affairs of other nations."},{"Title":"The Chavez Code: Cracking U.

Both immigrant women and \\"Yankee\\" women migrating from eastern parts of the U. S. accomplished this by joining the men in practically any work that had to be done. But in addition, it was primarily the women who looked to education and health care for children, the development of community by establishing civic and religious organizations, and all kinds of personal and public commitments making for a lasting society which could be handed down to future generations. At the time the northern plains, particularly the area of the state of North Dakota, was being settled, the Indians had been mostly pacified and farm machinery and electricity were changing the work of farming. Nonetheless, the settlement of one of the last western frontiers called for all the determination, enterprise, imagination, and hope from the women as settlement in any other time or area. Handy-Marchello, a history professor at the U. of North Dakota, gives equal treatment to both the physical challenges (e. g., the weather, making fields for crops) and how these were faced and also the indefatigable pioneer spirit of the varied women. And in the course of doing this, the author notes how the pioneer women's spirit and contributions continue to shape the regional society."},{"Title":"Women of the Northern Plains: Gender and Settlement on the Homestead Frontier, 1870-1930","review":"Barbara Handy-Marchello's Women of the Northern Plains; Gender & Settlement on the Homestead Frontier, 1870-1930 is a new and refreshing inspection of the lives and roles of women in rural North Dakota. Destroying the myths and romance of the homestead life, she establishes with brutal clarity that women were not simply the homemakers historians have since portrayed them as; in fact, they led harsh lives as equals to men, worked in the fields as well as the home, and provided crucial income through butter and egg production. The failure of outsiders to recognize the centrality of women's labor ultimately led to the decline of the homesteading movement.In the majority of cases, women came to the frontier either as wives or as children. In the case of the latter, they remained single until about their mid-twenties, at which point they would join in a partnership with a man. This partnership, more often referred to as marriage, was rarely one of love, but instead a means of staying alive. For the woman, a man meant a partner equally dedicated to her survival as she, and someone with a strong back and a good work ethic in the wheat fields. For the man, a woman was dedicated to his survival as he to hers, and also was someone to have and raise his family, fix meals, and tend to the home. And, Handy-Marchello stresses, feeding, milking, and if necessary, slaughtering the cows, tending horses and chickens, churning butter, gathering eggs, repairing the barn, hauling water, toiling in the fields, and doing anything else of necessity to the family's survival.The lives of women, like the lives of any living being in the Northern plains, were hard. Besides having substantial wifely responsibilities, there were other factors. They were invariably pregnant, or if not pregnant, on the mend from pregnancy. Death or disability from accidents loomed large over them, claiming a number of victims. So did disease. Husbands were often physically or emotionally abusive to their wives, venting the frustrations of their own hard lives upon them. In the event of a mother's death, the eldest daughter filled the maternal role and adopted all of her mother's responsibilities. In short, womanhood was a tough existence. In response, women developed an attitude of perseverance, took pride in their work, and enjoyed the opportunities life and chance brought their way.Foremost of those characteristics was the development of friendships fostered over difficult times. For most, the community, however spread out it may have been, was an extension of the family. Women would often breast-feed a baby for a dry mother. They would make meals for a woman having recently given birth. They would help milk cows. Women also frequently joined common religious or ethnic groups. Church organizations, especially the Ladies' Aid societies, gave them opportunities to socialize as they ran fundraisers, prepared food for celebrations, and were generally communally active. In such fashions, they were able to have a life at least partly removed from their farm, rejuvenating them for the harshness of life on it.For fifty years, homesteading was a sustainable existence, even if it was not particularly profitable. In the 1920s, however, outside organizations like the Farmers' Institute began a campaign to reestablish gender roles on the farm. Specifically, they extolled the virtues of homemaking for women, and discouraged any activities outside the home, most notably milking the cows, gathering eggs, and assisting in the wheat fields. Those tasks were for men. They also advertised electric stoves and other new goods to women, promoting the lifestyle prevalent in the cities. During this time also, agriculture and dairy became industries, forcing out family farms yielding smaller quantities of wheat, eggs, and butter. Both movements together had a disastrous effect on the viability of the homestead life, eventually leading to its decline and a city migration.Handy-Marchello's monograph is an extremely important piece on the study of women in the Northern Plains. It is a significant departure from traditional historiography in that it emphasizes, rather than downplays, the value of women on the farm. There is substantial merit to such a text. That said, however, there are a few points where she might have improved her work.For one thing, she provides very little analysis of life on the plains. A scholarly reader might have wanted to see something of an interpretation of history, rather than simply a factual revision.For another, she consistently demonstrates a lack of depth in her historical recounting. On the subject of Ladies' Aid societies, for example, she states that each was a \\"highly significant organization that gave women a stronger voice in the community affairs and allowed them to expand their interests and influence...\\" (p. 99). Yet, she fails to provide sufficient information to demonstrate that point. One gets the impression that such a \\"highly significant organization\\" would require more than the handful of pages she devotes to it. For another example, although she states \\"my research... [will examine] ... how women from so many different cultures carried out their roles\\" (p. 11), she does not explore those cultures, other than to state that they existed, were diverse, and generally did not intermingle. These examples underlie a critical point - she treats six pivotal decades of plains women in just 166 pages, including the introduction and conclusion.In regards to her sources, she draws upon a wide variety of primary and secondary documents. Despite that, however, she has a tendency to draw most of her anecdotes from just a few of those sources, using multiple anecdotes per person. One must wonder then whether the anecdotes are in fact representative of the plains people in general, and if so, why she did not employ anecdotes from others.Although she does not say specifically one way or the other, the nature of Handy-Marchello's text suggests that this is a prelude to a more in-depth analysis yet to come. If that is the case, it will be most heartily welcome. She has demonstrated her considerable talent as both an author and a scholar. If in fact it is to be a beginning point for another scholar, that would be acceptable as well, for certainly it provides an excellent introduction to the complex and as-yet under-explored subject of women on the Northern plains. As such, I thoroughly recommend this text for anyone interested in plains history, Dakotan history, or the history of women at large."},{"Title":"Philosophy of the Buddha","review":"This book was a welcome addition to my collection of Buddhist literature.

He wrote many books, such asThe World's Living Religions,Metaphysics: An Introduction,Yoga for business executives and professional people, etc.He wrote in the Preface to this 1958 book, \\"The purpose of this book is to state the philosophy of Gotama, the man himself, by means of quotations from the Pitakas themselves. This book does not concern itself with the various other Buddhist philosophies constituting the long, devious, profound, and fascinating history of Buddhism, except to challenge their conclusions as attributable to Gotama.\\"Here are some quotations from the book:\\"Gotama's philosophy may be summed up in a simple, clear and obvious principle, which immediately compels belief once it is understood. The principle: Desire for what will not be attained ends in frustration; therefore, to avoid frustration, avoid desiring what will not be obtained.\\" (Pg. 15)\\"If... Gotama's philosophy consists in a single psychological principle, what about the numerous claims that he held such-and-such views relative to varous metaphysical problems? Regarding each question put to him, he replied, typically, as follows. Is there, for example, a next life? That, he would say, is not an important issue. Consider the possibilities: If you desire a next life and there is a next life, you have no problem. If you desire a next life and there is no next life, you will be frustrated. If you desire no next life and there is no next life, you have no problem. If you desire no next life and there is a next life, you will be frustrated. In either case... the important issue is not whether there is or is not a next life, but whether or not you are willing to accept things as they will be, however they will be.\\" (Pg. 19)\\"A shorter list of ten questions which Gotama refused to settle appears several times in the suttas... To each he replied ... 'This question is not calculated to profit, is not concerned with the dhamma ... nor to Nirvana. Therefore is it that I express no opinion upon it.'\\" (Pg. 113)"},{"Title":"Philosophy of the Buddha","review":"This is an old treatment of Buddhist philosophy, but still the best one I have read. Dr. Bahm knows what he is talking about as he did his doctoral work in Thailand with Buddhists. He is a well recognized scholar and father of the philosophy known as Organicism."},{"Title":"Philosophy of the Buddha","review":"Archie Bahm was a very hip philosophy professor. He is a fine scholar, and his talent was in creating accessibility, and pleasant understandability for the modern layman, without market pretense. So you get the best of both worlds.His Tao Te King translation is recommended in the Last Whole Earth Catalog, from the 1960's (and I consider it the finest I've read), and I would bet it informed that generation as much as, say, Alan Watts, and the Yogi Richard Hittleman.His translations lack the far-fetched guru-esque sort of mystique and pretense that many translations exhibit. I would also recommend his translations of Patanjali's sutras. Again, I'm no expert, but I've read several of translations of these texts. Archie is a clear, concise, interpreter."},{"Title":"Philosophy of the Buddha","review":"A.J. Bahm was a professor of comparative philosophies teaching at the University of New Mexico when he wrote and published his book _The Philosophy of The Buddha_. Published in 1958, and using the only existing translated texts available at that time as his guide -- which turned out to be the Rhys Davids', I. B. Horner, F.L. Woodward, and E.M. Hare translations, all of whom were not practicing Buddhists but rather Western enthusiasts and academics, and therefore lacking in the extensive background that a practitioner like Bhikkhu Bodhi, a contemporary translator of the Pali Canon, has -- Bahm forged as good a book as he was able considering the sources he had available.It is uncertain whether or not, had he had better translations available, he would have been able to make much more of his study than the one he presents us with in this book. Being a professor of philosophy, Bahm was more interested in uncovering the unique ideas that Gotama expressed through his Dhamma rather than the elegant empiricism wrought on the ground of a rigorous contemplative practice. He therefore missed some of the more intuitive insights and wisdom which are amply present in the teachings themselves while at the same time capturing as much of the essence of the teachings as he was privy to understanding. This latter is present in a statement he makes toward the end of the book when he says: \\"It is not stilling of existence, but stilling of craving, which is the goal.\\"To his credit, Bahm does reproduce for the reader significant passages translated from the Nikayas (the main scriptures of the Discourses of the Buddha) which gives the astute reader an opportunity see and taste for himself the elegance and wisdom of the discourses. Yet, his utter lack of understanding of the Dhamma's ultimate grandeur shows through in statements like the following: \\"That the middle way is Gotama's most significant contribution to philosophy is a fundamental part of this book.\\"Without taking anything away from the Buddha's wisdom to travel a middle pathway through the dualities of existence without adhering to any of the extremes of the phenomenal world, this is far from a comprehensive view of the depth and utter genius that was Gotama's want to display. Within his teaching of paticcasamuppada or Dependent Co-Arising (which was, through lack of understanding, mis-translated during that time period of the 1950s and 60s as \\"the teaching on cause and effect\\") there comes to be understood the great subtlety of profundity that composes the Dhamma. Yet this most profound of the Buddha's teachings is conspicuously missing from Bahm's exposition, while the teaching on one of the other great insights Gotama had -- that of Anatta or the \\"without self\\" doctrine of reality -- is rather poorly covered in an amazingly short nine pages!To be fair, though, the book does pretty much stay true to is original purpose which was to uncover and expose the philosophy of Gotama. It is just disappointing that it could not have presented a more accurate and indepth report of that philosophy."},{"Title":"Detoxification and Healing: The Key to Optimal Health","review":"I really like this book. It is not too big but and not too hard to understand. I met this wonderful doctor and he knows his subject very well."},{"Title":"Detoxification and Healing: The Key to Optimal Health","review":"I thought this book was going to be more about detoxification through nutrition. Instead, it's about supplements you can take to alleviate nutritional deficencies. Baker does do a super job of showing the food/body/ health connection. He also clearly illustrates how all the body's systems and functions are connected and dependent on one another. This book is much more open minded and thoughtful in the art of healing than modern medicine, which refuses to admit that diet affects your health. It's a pretty good book but I wish he spent more time on actual foods than supplements."},{"Title":"Detoxification and Healing: The Key to Optimal Health","review":"Dr. Sidney Baker has written a remarkable book. This thin volume packs in so much useful information, it's hard to believe it is only 200 pages. Perhaps this has something to do with his integrative approach to chronic health problems. According to most mainstream doctors, each specific health condition has its own specific cause, and its own specific treatment, which would make for a tome of a book covering so many individual symptoms, causes, and treatments. However, as Baker shows, this approach is flawed, and those with chronic health problems like adrenal fatigue, fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, severe allergies, or IBS know it. The systems of our body work together, and a successful treatment means treating the body as a system. This means different symptoms can have the same cause, and a single problem can cause very different symptoms. Baker repeats two important ideas throughout the book: the body's systems work together, and each individual is unique in their make-up.Detoxification and Healing describes body chemistry and detoxification in simple, engaging language, using case studies from his vast experience in treating patients with cancer, diabetes, autism, among countless other epidemic disorders plaguing large numbers of people today. He identifies several well known and some little known toxins and deficiencies that contribute to these diseases: from hidden gluten sensitivities and mercury and aluminum poisoning to dairy allergies and fatty acid deficiencies. In fact, many people are allergic to gluten (found in grains like wheat, barley, and hidden in a host of processed foods) and do not even know it. The possible symptoms range from headaches, fatigue and depression to IBS, epilepsy, osteoporosis, diabetes, schizophrenia and autism.When you start looking at disease in terms of the individual, you see that recovery often does happen as a result change in diet, determining which substances are lacking (nutrients, vitamins, minerals, etc.) and which are present but harmful (toxins). Many substances, like mercury, are more toxic to some than others, and scientific tests aren't always developed to the point where this can be determined. Often the only thing that works is to first test (by eliminating certain foods from your diet, for example) and then see if a change for the better has occurred. Dr. Baker has found that many of his autistic patients experience recoveries after eliminating wheat and other gluten-containing foods from their diet for a period of weeks, as well as controlling yeast overgrowth like Candida in the gut by implementing a the use of an antifungal like Nystatin as well as taking a good probiotic.Following Baker's approach, it makes sense for each person to make sure their body is efficiently detoxifying unwanted substances, and Dr. Baker provides several detox protocols to get started. Mercury build up is perhaps one of the worst problems we face today, as it is a highly toxic substance which is found not only in large fish like tuna and salmon, but in Mercury amalgam fillings in our teeth. Replacing our fillings and following the Mercury detox protocol developed by Baker can go a long way in ridding our bodies of this harmful material. A healthy diet, proper supplementation, and a good detoxification schedule all go far in optimizing health and effectively treating and managing disease.Dr. Baker also recommends learning diaphragmatic breathing to help with good health. By stimulating the vagus nerve, breathing techniques like those taught in the Eiriu Eolas breathing and meditation program are scientifically proven to provide immediate and effective relief of stress, a large contributor to autoimmune diseases. Over all Detoxification and Healing is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Detoxification and Healing: The Key to Optimal Health","review":"I wish every mainstream doctor would read this book. I've read a half dozen books on detoxification, and this is the best! His presentation is clear, concise, and backed by science. The case history examples he is able to present to testify to his claims, come from his 30 plus years in medical practice. I'd much rather read the instruction from a person so well versed in biochemestry than some of the other books that offer only the testimonials of lay-persons as proof that their ideas are sound."},{"Title":"Detoxification and Healing: The Key to Optimal Health","review":"This is a book written by an Orthomolecular doctor at his best. What you get here is much more than \\"how toos\\". Detoxification is about working from the fundamentals of a system and out from there. Dr. Baker, in speaking about this subject, gives a great example of how balance and imbalance, in healing, has always made perfect sense. This is a very enlightening and informative set of ideas that can help open new ways of thinking. Not, &quot;way out - new age&quot; concepts, but common sense connections about how our choices effect us and how we can be empowered to make changes to heal. I recommend this highly and also for anyone that wants to get a very good glimpse at how a good Orthomolecular doctor thinks about things."},{"Title":"Detoxification and Healing: The Key to Optimal Health","review":"This is one of the better books to start your way toward learning about health, the environment and how both interact. This is a must read book along with Sherry Rogers' 'Detoxify or Die' to understand why we need to supplement our daily diet that needs to change. I'm in the process of following Dr. Baker's recommendation for an oil change (cod liver oil and flax seed oil), having my mercury fillings removed and then mercury detoxifiction, and changing my diet to avoid all the foods that are bad. I've ordered I number of books to follow up on what he says to include his book on Folic Acid, which I knew nothing about before reading the book. I found out that I have an allergy to gluten, dairy and soy through a functional medicine provider, so if you are having problems with health I suggest seeking a doctor or provider that treats people in alternative methods to mainstream medicine. Overall this is great book to start to learn the truth about health and healing."},{"Title":"Detoxification and Healing: The Key to Optimal Health","review":"This book is truly one of the best health books I've ever read, highly recommended. I absolutely loved his way of explaining things. It takes a lot of knowledge and experience to explain several subjects so effortlessly and easy as he does, but also, he comes across as a very wise \\"mother.\\" In standard textbooks, many of the basics of biochemistry and immunology are explained in a very dried and complicated fashion, which leaves a bitter taste to the subjects. But in this book, that is definitely not the case. His explanations are very clear and enjoyable, sharing his experiences with patients, which gives a lot of food for thought. Also, basic understanding of immunology and biochemistry is a key for understanding the body's detoxification system in order to make wiser choices for our health and well being. This book should really be a must read for everybody."},{"Title":"Detoxification and Healing: The Key to Optimal Health","review":"I enjoyed this book, very informative, backed by research. Not as much of a how-to as it is more of a physiology lesson. I very much enjoyed Dr. Baker's use of humor (there's an anecdote about eating some bad oysters that's worth reading twice :) and also appreciated his use of metaphors to help the reader understand some complex concepts. This is a great first book to start with if you're interested in detoxification, you'll understand the how's and why's."},{"Title":"Detoxification and Healing: The Key to Optimal Health","review":"especially Dr. Baker's explanation of 2 cell types that last a lifetime and how to keep them healthy--lymphocytes and brain cells--key to healing."},{"Title":"Detoxification and Healing: The Key to Optimal Health","review":"I love that this book clearly explains the physical processes of detoxification in an easy to understand way.

Born the daughter of the powerful Powhatan, it's almost as though she were placed by providence at the juncture of the English and the eastern woodlands Indians.Just ten when the Jamestown settlers arrived in 1607, she became early known for her cheer and joy in seeking friends amongst the colonists. But clashes came, and her aging father sought to expel the settlers, and almost succeeded, with the help the colonists' starvation and disease. Three years after their arrival, the colony was abandoned, the departing ships at the mouth of the James waiting for the morning tide to carry them to England.The relief ships pulled into view at that instant, a miraculous event, and Jamestown survived, and in time established a firm foothold in Virginia. Clashes with the Powhatans continued, however, and the colonists captured Pocahontas as a hostage against the relief of the Indian-held English captives. In her captivity, which seems to have been a friendly one, she was converted to Christianity-- the stories of her memorizing the various church liturgies are dear-- and married the young colonist John Rolfe. Her father agreed to abandon his war against the settlers, and indeed touchingly sent a string of fresh water pearls for her wedding and deeded land to Rolfe. There were to be eight years of peace following their union.The Virginia Company saw advantage to her traveling to London with her new husband, and by then young Thomas Rolfe, their child. They arrived in England in 1616, and she was received as royalty by King James and Queen Ann, and met many of the English notables of the day. But the climate took its toll, and she succumbed to tuberculosis or smallpox on the very eve of their departure for Virginia. She died in Gravesend in Kent County, and lies today in the little St. George's Churchyard there.Her monument is the peace which allowed the English the final foothold in Virginia, in spite of its eventual price on the Indians. Barely twenty when she died, she is recalled as a sprightly girl, an evocation of an America long gone.Woodward's book is filled with details and documentation, and well worth a five-star read! What she omits, however, is that Pocahontas is survived by thousands of American descendants today, each carrying her memory in their blood as the 400th anniversary of that first north American colony nears."},{"Title":"Pocahontas","review":"I purchased this book after viewing the movie &#34;The New World&#34; as the movie had spurred my interest inPocahontas.

Portfolio Investment in Latin America, 1900-1986 (Studies in International Political Economy)","review":"This is a superb introduction to the financial history of Latin America in the years 1914-1976. As such, it has many virtues which cause it to stand out:(a) Ms. Stallings is not determined to write an expos&eacute;; she is also not writing, by any means, a defense of what happened. This is one of the most objective, calm accounts of the region I've ever seen.(b) Her treatment of the period enables one to get a grasp of general trends that came before and which persist today. This can be used to prepare for additional research on other periods.Ms. Stallings pays the greatest attention to Peru's experience. However, a student researching the impact of US financial institutions could easily use this as a template for examining other nations or subsequent periods. She outlines the basic economic principles and controversies associated with FDI, while pointing to competing views on the matter.My chief reason for appreciating this book is that that she introduces J.A. Hobson's &quot;Imperialism&quot; (see recommendations above). The book is a bit dated, and one wishes she'd updated this work with another edition. But it is hard to encounter this sort of rigor, objectivity, and clarity in any work on such a controversial subject."},{"Title":"Abstract Algebra: A First Course","review":"I used this text for a one semester course on Group Theory in the spring of 2007. It's a great text for reference, but time is required to really grasp the concepts. I wouldn't recommend it as a book to teach yourself with, but with a good professor on your side it's a valuable asset. Another interesting (I'm not sure if I would consider it positive or negative) thing about this book is that problems are not merely examples of material covered in the text, but important theorems are also assigned for the students to prove on their own."},{"Title":"Abstract Algebra: A First Course","review":"This is a very clear and concise introduction to group theory. The author is interesting without digressing or talking down.

It is fairly cheap and lightweight, to the relief of my wallet and my spine. It manages to express the subject in a way that is concise and thorough. It does require you to think: It gives you definitions and a few, disparate examples so you can get a feeling for the scope of the concept, but it doesn't spoon feed you anything.

After his first work with Steve Woolgar, &quot;Laboratory life&quot;, this is his second major work in which he generalises on various topics that he only touched in a very preliminary way in the above work. Latour adopts a very original way of following scientists in their struggle to &quot;produce&quot; scientific truth. He studies them as if they were a tribe (Latour is originally an ethnographer).His conclusion is that scientific truth and the designing of succesful technological artefacts is not so much a &quot;unveiling of some hidden truth behind things&quot; or a logical construction, but a very heterogeneous project in which money, resources, statements, objects, people and numerous other things are linked in such a way that a strong chain is formed. Something is true if the chains is strong enough to withstand &quot;trials of strength&quot;. Latour does away with metaphysical ideas of &quot;The Truth&quot; but insist in stead that truth is very much a stage in a process of negotiation between human and non-human actors. The idea that truth is the result of a logical process in which an abstract &quot;reality&quot; is discovered is, according to Latour, a story that is told afterwards to defend the theory itself and not something that is inherent in the forming of the theory itself.In a very easy-to-read way Latour guides his readers through the work of science and technology &quot;in the making&quot;. A must for any student in science and technology as well as for any scholar in social sciences and philosophy."},{"Title":"Science in Action","review":"In 20 years in higher ed. in the social sciences, I am hard pressed to think of a book that immediately and permanently transformed the way I understand the world more than this one. It opens up hundreds of questions and is a delight to read. Probably the best starting point for a newcomer to Latour's ouevre, too."},{"Title":"Science in Action","review":"I'm an electrical and electronics engineer, working for a governmental R&amp;D Institution. I also study on Science and Technology Policy Studies for an M.S. degree. I found the book quite useful, especially in its aspect of analyzing the scientist and engineer in his own time, his own context, his own psychology... It is a well organized, fluent, clear book. It may not be a complete guide or a definitive study, but it is a good point to start. Recommended..."},{"Title":"Science in Action","review":"One can sympathize with the engineer who wanted to throw the Latour's book at the wall. \\"Engineers do, while scientists discover and write\\". Latour is not about coming to firm conclusions, identifying and clarifying problems, and providing cogent summaries of scientists' activities. One could perhaps describe him in terms of a hypothetical analogy involving a disinterested sportscaster at a university. The sportscaster does not identify with or root for a given team. He doesn't provide statistics on comparative performance of players. Rather, he makes eclectic observations about sports, like comparing the weight range for football players with that of championship tennis players; racial breakdowns by sport, critical skills involved in different sports, characterizing audiences and fans of each sport, and perhaps tracing typical histories of players as they rise to high achievement in their sports.Latour is an observer (and also a writer) of sophistication. However, France can perhaps afford his kind of detached exploration better at the present time than can the U.S. We have current crises that are less serious in France. These include domestic conflict over global climate change policy; and lack of communication between interest groups, and consequences of longstanding avoidance of political policy problems like systems for sustainable support of major social services. My my own preference is that our scientific and conceptual talent move more from the Latour model to that of the engineer!"},{"Title":"Science in Action","review":"The introduction was so promising, but the first chapter made me want to hurl the book at the wall (I didn't because I was on a plane, and that probably violates some security restriction.) I think he describes many of the *behaviors* of scientists correctly, but he seems to completely miss the *meaning* that they attribute to these behaviors. He's like an anthropologist studying Catholics who describes all the weird details of what goes on at Mass but never mentions Jesus.What I got out of the first chapter is that scientists try to prove themselves right by citing other people, and they need other people to cite them for their ideas to live on and be taken seriously. This is certainly true, but he makes it seem like this is the main activity of science. Maybe I'm naive, but I still think the main activity of science is to figure something out about the world. The reason you cite all those other people is because you think they figured something out correctly, and the reason people cite you is because they think you figured something out.Unfortunately, I can't say anything about the rest of the book because I never made it past the first chapter."},{"Title":"Science in Action","review":"Cover to cover, this book has flaws. A personal take on the area of scientific arguments, I feel that many of the statements are speculative or misjudged. This book pales in comparison to a revered work on the topic such as The Structure of Scientific Revolutions by Thomas Kuhn. A far better recommendation for its historical content and expertise. Science In Action could be dismissed as unnecessary aside from a few valid points and revelations. The content and diagrams offer little useful information to the reader. Better a qualified point of view for an objective examination of Science."},{"Title":"Science in Action","review":"Latour again demonstrates trivial insights and egregious errors. He simply does not know his subject (allegedly science) well enough - he makes conceptual and factual blunders. I am glad this book is still in print because it is a useful aid in teaching humanity students about science - but not in the way Latour had envisioned! By understanding his misinterpretations, we can learn how laypeople get confused."},{"Title":"Diagrams: A Visual Survey of Graphs, Maps, Charts and Diagrams for the Graphic Designer","review":"Perfectly fine book overall, but I didn't notice the publication date of 1969.

Stormrider is a thought provoking finale. As always his characters leap from the pages - particularly the dark and deadly Moidart, and the grimly powerful Huntsekker.Other reviewers have criticised the similarity of themes previously used in past novels like Lion of Macedon, and the Druss series. I think this misses the point. Gemmell has written more than thirty novels, and themes of love, courage and heroism are bound to re-occur in what are, at base, action driven novels. Gemmell's literary hero, after all, is Louis Lamour, who wrote more than 200 short novels of the Old West, many of them with identical story lines.Gemmell's best work - Waylander, Lion of Macedon, Ravenheart, Echoes of the Great Song, Knights of Dark Renown, and Legend - are all Five star quality. Stormrider comes close.For me it misses only because of the large cast, which slows the narrative, and the lack of a sustained central character with the power of Druss or Jaim Grymauch from Ravenheart."},{"Title":"Stormrider","review":"Stormrider focuses on Gaise Macon and Kaelin Ring who face an impending war against Winter Kay and the armies of a dead king. The enemy is fueled by an ancient evil, embodied in a skull known only as the Orb of Kranos, bent on the destruction of all mankind. The Black Rigante joins with the forces of the Moidart in a twist of fate against their common foe. Although a conquered people and against insurmountable odds, the Rigante fight with courage and integrity, serving as shining examples in a war that will bring bloodshed, death and destruction to the people.Gemmell in Stormrider has done it again. He has an amazing talent for developing his characters and unfolding a storyline that is exciting, sad and gripping at the same time. He describes the events through the eyes of his main characters and offers contrasting viewpoints as events unfold. His characters are very real and their reactions are believable.From the very first page to the last, Stormrider fails to disappoint. Gemmell has shown his mastery over the heroic fantasy genre. I can't wait for his next installment."},{"Title":"Stormrider","review":"Yet another great story from Gemmell, my favorite author of all time. The Rigante stories are always intriguing, and while not the best in the series this is another solid performance."},{"Title":"Stormrider","review":"A great book following on from ravenheart .

It deals more with magic than any of the other 3 books, which is more about the lives of the main characters. This book really shows how fate and fortune can change in inexplicable ways, when your greatest enemy can end up being your allies. In this book the main characters have to, among other things, deal with an ancient evil god, who wishes nothing more than rid the world of all humans because they are destroying all the magic. Often violent, it also shows the strength of those willing to stand, even against impossible odds."},{"Title":"Stormrider","review":"As always, David Gemmel creates colorful characters with an amazing story surrounding them. While the first two books in this series were my favorite, this last one was no slouch either."},{"Title":"Stormrider","review":"I can't say enough about this book and the Rigante series. I'm a picky reader and this is up there among my favorite series of all times. I was very sad to hear Gemmell passed recently as his ability to tell gripping tales and even more characters full of humanity is remarkable. If you enjoy fantasy books or even historical fiction I strongly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Stormrider","review":"This is the fourth and final book in David Gemmell's \\"Rigante\\" series. It started out sort of slow, but, like all the other books in the series, it hooked me in deep. His characters are great, grand and wonderful. His heroes have a human side that is compelling and his villians evoke strong feelings of loathing. Gemmell is sometimes predictable, but often suprises you with how emotional these transitions are. I was moved to tears in almost every novel, and \\"Stormrider\\" is no different. There are few other authors who write as well as this author and his style is very original. If you want a book, or rather a series of books, that can move you as well as carry you to some fantastic, while remaining believable, adventures, the \\"Tales of the Rigante\\" are a must."},{"Title":"Stormrider","review":"these books are captivating. and what else is there to say about a book besides that... well, let's also say that if you are reading eat pray love or whatever, this might not be for you."},{"Title":"Stormrider","review":"This would have to be an average book for Gemmell. His older books were by far better. Stormrider is also kinda corny."},{"Title":"Stormrider","review":"After the huge disappointment of Ravenheart, I expected Gemmell to do what he did in The Hawk Eternal - create a sequel that would make the first book something great and more importantly, tie up all its loose ends.Stormrider (and Ravenheart) had many great ideas and concepts, it laid similar foundations to Sword in the Storm and Midnight Falcon, and had the seeds of greatness within it.Whilst the book was heroic, it went from nowhere, to someplace worse and became lost in the void. I am one of the biggest fans of David Gemmell, and it disappoints me to state that this book is by far, the worst David Gemmell book, I have ever read.It is almost as if he ran out of ideas and gave up half way and tried to end the book as quickly as possible.Avoid this book, don't even borrow it from the library.However, I gave it 2 stars as I cannot bear the thought of david gemmell receiving the lowest rating available."},{"Title":"Stormrider","review":"As a matter of fact the worst of it. Compared to Ravenheart the book is an utter disapoinment. It is the book Gemmell had to write because Ravenheart was just so damned good. The whole thing drags on through. I had a hard time getting attached to any of the characters with the exception of the Moidart. That's right the unspeakable villian from Ravenheart is the most likeable character in this book believe it or not. He was the only character that I found myself chuckling at whenever his point of view would come up. The end is OK at best. All in all you can't stop yourself from reading it just because Ravenheart was so good but be prepared to just sit down and get through it. Besides bringing closure to the series it won't do much else for you."},{"Title":"Stormrider","review":"This is the last (4th) book in Gemmel's Rigante series. It is also the fourth Gemmel book that I have read. It sticks pretty much to his style and delivers the same emotions and action that his others do. I was not bored by any means, but it was also not a stand-out work.It's hard to find anything bad to say about the book. If you're looking for a light read while laying around the house, then pick this one up from the library."},{"Title":"Stormrider","review":"This is the 4th book I've read by Gemmel and the first three were amongst the most rip-roaring heoric fantasy I've ever read.This one was too slow, too convoluted and had too many different story threads with wildly unrelated characters to easily keep track of what was going on. Based on my past experiences with Gemmel, I expected something much crisper. The writing and characterisation are still great, but the plot and size and pace are deader than a really dead thing that's been killed, twice."},{"Title":"Stormrider","review":"This is the only book written by David Gemmel that on the first time reading it I put it down and read another book before I finished it. What a boring book. I really like Gemmel as a writer so much that I bought several books that are not available in the US and bought them from the UK. This book is terrible."},{"Title":"Stormrider","review":"Eight hundred years after Connavar and Bane defeated the Stone (see SWORD IN THE STONE) freeing the Rigante, the clan needs a hero to end their current oppression. That champion appears to be Kaelin Ring, better known as Ravenheart, who becomes the leader of the still proud but slaved Rigante clan. He leads the demand for freedom from the Varlish and their Lord Moidart.Ravenheart takes his revolution to the north where Moidart's son Gaise Macon, the Stormrider, awaits the confrontation. As the war comes closer, the Knights of the Sacrifice obtain a skull said to contain the evil of the Orb. If true, an evil artifact owned by unconscionable individuals who slaughter innocents for fun will spin the war-wracked lands into deeper dismay and chaos. Then there is the anticipated impact of preadolescent Feargol who as the Ghost Walker might prove to be the ultimate savior or destroyer of all.STORMRIDER is an exciting sword and sorcery fantasy that never slows down for a moment. The keys to this exciting, action-packed tale are the prime characters. Ravenheart and Stormrider, in spite of their respective positions, seem real and will remind the audience of Harold and William. The two rival stars are giants whose persona overwhelm the support cast, even the evil orb; yet they entice readers to refuse to put David Gemmell's latest fantasy down until the novel is complete to see how the final battle between these giants ends.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Stormrider","review":"A robest, profound unstopable highlander chan comes to life with high adventure, riveting action, interwoven with magic lore.

A force to be reckoned with, that is Rigante. Honor, courage, nobility of spirit-- that is Rigante. Read about them and judge for yourself."},{"Title":"Stormrider","review":"Stormrider is Book 4 of 4 of the Rigante Series.It takes place a few years after Ravenheart, Book 3 and is a true sequel to that book.The Series:The Rigante Series parallels the struggle of the Highlanders as other nations attempt to conquer them. The entire series spans about 800 years as war heroes defend their civilization against invading armies lusting for power. The Rigante enemies are similar to the Roman and British Empires.As a fantasy fan, I was unpleasantly surprised to see gunpowder (pistols, muskets, cannons) introduced in Book 3. But Gemmell's larger than life characters, great dialogue, and exciting battles made it work. In Book 4, there are more guns, but a powerful ancient artifact is also introduced.The Story:The atrocities committed in the previous book lead to a civil war among the Varlish. The corrupt church and their bloodthirsty knights empowered with dark magic attempt to overthrow the king. As a result, the entire nation is plunged into chaos. There's political intrigue, battles, brawls, betrayal, and prophecies. The story is epic, the action is violent, and the characters are entertaining.Writing Style:Overall, this is a very good book, but it is one of the weakest of the Gemmell books. There is plenty of action and a ton of characters, but the book is missing a human element / charm. In Gemmell's other books, the characterization is strong throughout the entire book, where in this one, it seems like the characters are seasoned with bits of personality. The pacing is also a bit off. At times, the story feels like it is being told in a roundabout way and occasionally drifts from the main characters. Despite these minor criticisms, this is still a good book and a solid end to the Rigante Series.Maturity:Gemmell's books are for adult readers because they're gritty and violent.Overall:If you haven't read any of the Rigante Books, 1-2 are outstanding! 3 and 4 are good, but may turn off fantasy fans with the muskets and cannons. You can stop at book 2 if the guns really bother you.If you want to find out how the Rigante Series ends, you really need to pick this up. It's the weakest of the Rigante Books, but it's still good."},{"Title":"Stormrider","review":"Stormrider is a great addition to the series. Having read the previous reviews, I was not expecting much and was pleasantly surprised."},{"Title":"Stormrider","review":"David Gemmell, in Stormrider, has written another fun piece of fantasy and concluded the Rigante series quite nicely. It is packed with action, intrigue, and magic. I can't stop reading Gemmell's books and hope that he will write forever.Kaelin has found the love of his life and fought for her, and the Rigante, to live free from the rule of the Varlish. But there is another evil lurking in the land and stealing the magic from it. Will the Rigante have to unite with the one person they hate in order to rid the lands of this new evil?Gaise Macon has been training to become a leader in the Varlish military, but he always has to watch his back from people he thinks are on his side. He will make many tough decisions but their will be one that could lead to the death of many or the salvation of the Rigante.Both the Drenai and the Rigante series by David Gemmell are excellent. Every novel stands on its own, but they come together to create some great reading. The Rigante series finishes with interestingly and leaves the reader satisfied but at the same time wanting more. Keep writing David Gemmell and I and everyone else will keep reading. Everyone enjoy the last book of the Rigante series!"},{"Title":"Stormrider","review":"The Ravenheart, or Kaelin Ring, rides toward the conclusion of his destiny in STORMRIDER, Gemmell's sequel to his RAVENHEART. The whirlwind of Rigante revolution and independence widen as they carve a niche of freedom for themselves in the loosely held northern lands of Lord Moidart's rule. More troubles are on the way to the lands of Rigante heritage, however. The Varlish Empire itself churns with internal turmoil as the ancient, though newly awakened dark powers of the Knights of Sacrifice drive daggers into the very head of the Varlish Empire before turning malicious eyes to the northern lands of the Moidart and the Rigante.Soon, if Lord Moidart and Gaise Macon, the Stormrider, would seek to protect their lands and life from the subverted Varlish Knights of Sacrifice and their allies, they must seek out unlikely allies among the Rigante themselves. If the Rigante and their land are to survive, Kaelin Ring must seek out his own destiny and cast aside ancient enmities in order to accept his new allies in a battle against a power older than time, a power that hates the Rigante more than even Kaelin Ring could hate the Varlish.The action-based, heroic themes that fans of Gemmell have come to expect do not scan as well in this novel as they do in many of his other novels. The book seems to chop in a few places as the intertwined destinies of Ravenheart and the flip side to his coin, Stormrider, come to fruition. Those destinies also seem somewhat hackneyed and rushed as the book draws to a close. The self-sacrificing death scene in this book does not ring as true and heartfelt as that of Jaime Grymauch.When all is said and done, STORMRIDER, while still a passable action fantasy, is not the phenomenal sequel I would have hoped for the beautifully heartrending tale found in RAVENHEART."},{"Title":"Stormrider","review":"Stormrider is the fourth book in Gemmell's Rigante series (and I think there's also one that has yet to make it across the Atlantic). It, along with Ravenheart, continues the story of the Rigante some 800 years after the conclusion of the previous novel, Midnight Falcon. Althought it can stand alone, Stormrider is the conclusion of the story that began in book three, Ravenheart.Gaise Macon is a young nobleman of undetermined parentage because of his mother's infidelity with a local clansman. A General in the King's army, he's been striving all his life to win the approval of his father (or at least the man who raised him) the cruel Lord Moidart. What is initially a struggle against rebel forces suddenly becomes much more critical as Macon's nemesis, Winter Kay, acting on a prophecy, turns against Macon in an attempt to kill him. Macon and his father abruptly find themselves branded as enemies by the forces they've been fighting alongside and are forced to aline with rebels and local clansmen. There's much more to Winter Kay than simple ambition, however, as a secret relic the knight possesses begins to exert more and more influence over him. Macon ultimately finds himself to be the lynchpin in a battle that could save or condemn humanity.Gemmell's strong style and fast-paced books are definitely more appealing to fans of 'action' fantasy as opposed to fans of fantasy like Lord of the Rings or Wheel of Time. The majority of major characters in his books are men, and in this case it's even more true. In Stormrider women are no more than motivating factors for male behavior, usually by way of the death of an unrequited love that drives one of the male characters on a revenge spree. It's unfortunate the female characters are so shallowly developed. The book's an enjoyable read, but it could have been more appealing and more enjoyable with some stronger female charcters.Despite the level of violence in the narrative, Gemmell actually puts forth a fairly apparent antiwar and pro-ecology platform, that, fortunately, never interferes with the story (though it does come across as heavy-handed sometimes). I also like how he plays with the concept of history, that circumstances can redeem even the most condemned. History, after all, is written by the victor.Gemmell characters are drawn with a broad stroke, but they typify the myth of the hero--they posses strength, courage and hardiness as well as a willingness to sacrifice all for the greater good. They are good at heart and true to themselves and the world around them. Don't confuse this with nobility, however. The characters are common men, drinkers and brawlers, seemingly selfish and boorish, but who never fail to rise to the occasion when required.I've talked before about Gemmell's books and this one stays true to the type. I like the anti-war, pro-environment, redemption message, but don't get the impression that this is a book that inspires deep thought or introspection. It's fast-paced, male-oriented, action fantasy to the core.If you've read any of Gemmell's other books and liked them, you'll like this too. If you're a fan of action-style fantasy (a la Cook's The Black Company or Duncan's King's Blades) and haven't tried Gemmell before, you ought to. Although this book can easily stand alone, I recommend reading Ravenheart first as a minimum (and Sword in the Storm and Midnight Falcon too if you're prepared for a four book commitment). I don't think you'll be disappointed.Read more reviews, as well as articles, interviews and more, at www.SFReader.com."},{"Title":"Stormrider","review":"Same basic story every time right? Flawed hero overcomes big odds and eventually wins the day. Does that mean the story is not good? Of course not but the approach does get old at times.This particular installment shifts focus from Calin Ring ward or Jam Grimothe to Gaise Macon son of the &quot;evil&quot; Moidart. Some people have not liked this book because of the transformation of this charecter from a bad guy to a good guy. Now I was fine with what almost ruined the experiance for me was the supposed conflict between good and evil it just came across to me as rushed and unfinished like something Gemmell thought of at the last minute.Overall-A tad weak but still very solid all round a good read"},{"Title":"Stormrider","review":"Something about Gemmel grabs hold when you enter his worlds. I have read most that have shown up in the U.S. He keeps it simple but somehow adds a depth to his characters that entices real emotional responses to their life / love / adventures / etc.Stormrider is set in pretty much the same &quot;world&quot; as his other novels. His hero is Gaise.

Don't get me wrong, Stormrider is still MILES above most other fantasy books, but it doesnt compare to Gemmell's other works, which all happen to be masterpeices. Perhaps my expecations were too high, but after reading this i felt that it just didnt have the same awe-inspiring effect that ALL of Gemmell's other books have had on me. Something seemed to be missing from this one, and i cant put my finger on what it is...Still, Stormrider was a worthwhile and mostly entertaining conclusion to an epic saga...."},{"Title":"Stormrider","review":"As a stalwart Gemmell fan over the many years, one has to admit disappointance with this work. Its a rehash of themes present in various previous works(Dark Prince, Morningstar, Druss:Chronicles I etc.) suggesting that our author is losing his steam. There are elements throughout the work which makes one cringe with embarrassment, the swearing is one, along with the dialogue where the &quot;Rigante&quot; are descibed as:'the best of the best!'. The ending also just screams out to the reader that Gemmell became scared at how he was going to conclude this novel, and subsequently took the easy option, which just left one feeling, frankly disappointed.Yet there are good points to this book. His ecological stance is admirable, the pace is enough to keep one reading and rarely flags and its always interesting to see what has influenced the author from his subject matter(in this instance Gemmell would appear to have been reading authors such as Bernard Cornwell,author of the 'Sharpe' series). Yet these pale in comparison to the price I paid for the hardback, and I felt cheated at paying the fullprice. Save your pennies, wait for the paperback, or just borrow it from your library."},{"Title":"Stormrider","review":"I must admit that the first 50 pages were not up to Gemmell's standard.

Kennedy. A true and bizarre story told by a reporter covering the daily happenings of the trial. Although the author's bias is evident due to his personal liking for the defendant, nonetheless, his insightfulness into the legal wranglings is incredibly interesting. This book may have limited appeal to only those keenly interested in the details and history of the Kennedy assassination. If that is the case, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"American Grotesque: An Account of the Clay Shaw-Jim Garrison-Kennedy Assassination Trial in New Orleans","review":"This book should be considered a novel of fiction rather than non-fiction. It is a very interesting book if one has never done a full study of the Garrison investigation. Much of the information contained in this book is inaccurate, and when reading at the very beginning, he tells which side he is on, and rather than bring about the truth, he only brings forth evidence in which will side with the defense, leaving out very pertinent information. This book is in the category of &quot;plot or Politics&quot; By Rosemary James, and &quot;False Witness&quot; By Patricia Lambert, whom all attack Jim Garrison. One must look at the sources in which they use, and when you look, you see that the sources in which they use is reworded to fit their account of the investigation.

His \\"case\\" has been completely and totally discredited by every JFK historian who has looked into it. The case, in a word, was meritless.This is a book about that case and the trial of Clay Shaw. Yes it is written by a Shaw admirer who was a writer based in New York. He was totally disgusted and angered by the abuses of power shown by the extremely reckless and mentally unbalenced District Attorney. It's all here: the PSYCH discharge that Garrison got from the Armed Services, his attempts to bribe, intimidate, harrass, pay-off and strong-arm witnesses, possible witness, and even disserters from his office when they realized what a pack of lies the whole thing was and jumped ship. Even the fact that Garrison rarely attended the trial, this after show-boating his \\"assassination theory\\" before the entire world!I thought I knew a thing or two about sick and twisted politicians in the state of LA but this book adds a huge log to that fire......unbelievable."},{"Title":"Ghost Stories of California (Ghost Stories (Lone Pine))","review":"I must admit that I am weak for books like this one.

It would have been nice to have addresses of these haunted locations so we could go check them out for our selves if we wanted to.

So, I was pleasantly surprised at how much useful information I got from this book. I think the title is a bit misleading. FireWire has nothing to do with film making, IMHO. After all, that is like saying that I can become a better writer if I have DSL at home instead of a dial-up connection. (I do have DSL, and believe me, it did not make me a better writer ;-) ).So, it is more appropriate to say that is is an excellent book for people planning to use FireWire ENABLED devices to get into the art, business or hobby of making movies. (Interesting that we still call it Film making when in fact most of the stuff we do on these technologies will never see a frame of film).The book simplifies many of the mysteries that novice moviemakers may face as they not only try to learn how to use things like Final Cut Pro (or iMovie/iDVD etc. from Apple {... is a great resource)) but also figuring out what and how FireWire can do for them. This book simplifies that part quite a bit. I do most of my moviemaking with a decent consumer FireWire equipped Panasonic DV-701 and found this book helpful in deciding what level of camera to buy, for example, and why some day I will want to buy a 3-CCD camera instead of the one this camera is based on. It helped me understand what kind of techniques I could use in making movies with my equipment. It helped me understand some of the issues I would face if I wanted to make movies that would play in non-US parts of the world that use a different standard, etc. In short, I found the book extremely useful, extremely easy to read, detailed enough to be useful, not so detailed as to be boring and left unread or put on a shelf and forgotten.If you are looking into making movies, ideally with a FireWire equipped set of tools, this is a great book, but even for people not ready to invest in all that FireWire equipment yet, the book will be a useful addition to their toolset."},{"Title":"Firewire Filmmaking (With CD-ROM)","review":"This is overall a good book, although I did not find it toouseful for myself or my son (he is 12 and into moviemaking).Not useful for two major reasons:- mostly (if not exclusevely) oriented towards Mac hardwareand software (and higher end software),- is for more advanced users, since it discusses semi-pro andpro video equipment, and more than trivial editing tricksand effects.Nevertheless it is entertaining and educational to read andincludes a DVD ..."},{"Title":"Firewire Filmmaking (With CD-ROM)","review":"If you use the Macintrash and has tons of money for high-end software, this may be for you.

The book claims to reveal how people and society should conduct themselves for the good of everyone and everything, which is a very noble goal of course. The late author had this theory that there is a cosmic force that guides the evolution of the universe and living things towards producing intelligent life so that the cosmic force can have a mind. The author calls living things, \\"energy forms\\" and has a whole vocabulary of made up terms that he uses in place of the regular words that the rest of us use. Special made up terminology is a classic mark of a crank (nut). The author while well meaning, his theory is clearly half-baked, poorly though out and entirely unworkable. The book contains quite a bit of nonsense, such as;\\"Healing through thought . . . The patient forms a clear, vivid image of certain recovery, which firmly \\"imprints\\", or \\"forms\\", the corresponding regulating structures. And these in turn automatically effect a cure; they make the idea, the mental picture, real.\\"Perhaps the author should have formed a more vivid image of writing a better book.\\"Hunting ritual; Before a hunt; the pygmies draw an antelope in the sand . . . Shoot an arrow at it. . . . And come home with an antelope . . .an arrow in the same place as in the drawing. . . . the image-regulating structure are imprinted which \\"trigger\\" the actual shooting of the antelope.\\"Sounds like the secret to the perfect golf game, just draw a small circle on the ground and toss a golf ball into it, like maybe this is how Tiger Woods does it.\\"People who think and act in anti-evo ways are inadequately conscious - the result either of deficient intellectual capacity or of never having been enlightened about the energy unity and its evolution.\\"The author is apparently naive enough to believe that if you simply explained his theory to the convicts in the local prison they would all suddenly reform and become model citizens.\\"the effect of thoughts on plants has been scientifically investigated for several decades\\"As a gardener I just haven\`t been able to get this one to work, if it did certain weeds would have suddenly dropped dead, while the weeds are always seeming to grow better than my plants, may this one works in reverse. That could explain my gardening results.\\"When laws and orders are not heeded by mentally healthy people with normal intelligence, the these laws or orders are either anti-evo or have been insufficiently explained.\\"The author has apparently never driven a car in rush hour and just how hard does he think it is to explain a speed limit? On the other hand, sub-normal intelligence would explain much of the driving skills observed on the roads these days.The whole thrust of the book can be summed up by the following quote from it.\\"If a person thinks and acts in a pro-evo way, if his behavior is life-promoting . . .a harmonic \\"field\\" arise in him, producing a feeling of joy\\"Pro-Evo sounds like if was written by a moron who liked science fiction who was trying to write his own version of The Sermon on the Mound. Imbued with the same depth of wisdom found in Bill's & Ted's words of \\"Be excellent to each other!\\" Pro-Evo apparently is intended as a moral life guide for dimwitted atheists or free thinkers who felt education was too confining.

It is, on the one hand, an account of the sailing craft still surviving in the early '70's in the Lesser Antilles, complete with lines drawings and many B&W photos, and on the other hand, a story of the search up and down the island chain for these craft and the cultural influences they showed, as well as the building of one of them, in which the author took part, on the tiny Grenadine island of Bequia. The writing is excellent, the story is well worth reading."},{"Title":"An Execution in the Family: One Son's Journey","review":"This is a wonderful, inspiring, truth-telling account of the Rosenbergs' younger son's life and growth into a most impressive survivor of the loss of both parents, neglect, and serious mistreatment by the government that executed his parents. Meeropol's view of their innocence is so balanced, so comprehensive, so sane. His commitment to continue their work and ethic is very convincing. The writing is superb--unvarnished and in his own voice, whether as a 5 year-old child or a 56 year-old fully developed social activist."},{"Title":"An Execution in the Family: One Son's Journey","review":"Robert Meeropol's memoir of life as one of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg's two sons, with its sardonic title echoing James Agee's novel \\"A Death in the Family\\" (although strictly speaking it's incomplete, since Meeropol had *two* executions in his family), is a powerful and moving account of growing up under the shadow of the legalized murder of both his parents by the United States government.Having a parent in prison is not easy for a child. Having a parent executed is even worse. But having had *both* your parents executed for crimes they almost certainly did not commit, and having them become for a time the most vilified couple in America is a huge psychic burden, one which Meeropol repressed for a long time. In many ways, as he points out, he was fortunate -- he was adopted by a loving couple who raised both him and his older brother well. He received a good education, married and began a career and a family. But underneath it all was a secret he told to almost no one until he was in late twenties: that his parents had been sent to the electric chair for conspiracy to commit espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union.Not all of Meeropol's book is about the Rosenberg Case. He has had an interesting life on his own merits, and much of it makes for engrossing reading. If I have any reservations at all about the book it's because, maybe due to his being dyslexic, possibly because he's worked with children for many years, Meeropol's prose style is a little simplistic. To put it mildly. He uses commas so sparingly that I began to suspect he'd read way too much Hemingway.

I'm not saying that he should have necessarily imitated the later Henry James, but the unintentionally faux-Hemingway prose style does get a little monotonous at times.The most gripping part of the book for me was Meeropol's growing realization that, while his parents were almost certainly not guilty of the charges for which they were executed, he was forced \\"to accept the possibility that my father had participated in an illegal and covert effort to help the Soviet Union defeat the Nazis\\" by supplying them with technical military information not related to the atomic bomb. Reading his son's account of how he came to grips with the fact that Julius Rosenberg allowed his devotion to the Communist ideology to enable him to give military secrets to the Russians (who, it should be pointed out, were our allies at the time) in spite of the disaster that it brought to his family, you are impressed with Robert Meeropol's desire to find out the truth about his parents, no matter what it might be.Meeropol makes a strong case that, not only was his father not guilty of providing the Russians with the secret of the atomic bomb, he was executed along with his wife as the result of a criminal conspiracy between the attorney general of the United States and a Supreme Court Justice, who worked together to obstruct justice with the intent of placing them in the electric chair. Further, it is quite possible that Ethel Rosenberg may have been completely innocent of any wrongdoing at all. Meeropol's parents, he writes, \\"were killed not for any crime they may have committed, but because they were Communists who would not cooperate with the FBI.\\"I can't recommend this book too highly. It depicts one of the most important and tragic stories in American history as seen through the eyes of one of its victims who refused to be victimized. Today Meeropol is a staunch opponent of the death penalty and runs the Rosenberg Fund for Children, a charity that aids the children of political prisoners -- a very appropriate way of honoring his parents' memory. You owe it to yourself to read this book. You may not agree with everything he says, but what he has to say should be heard."},{"Title":"An Execution in the Family: One Son's Journey","review":"There is no doubt that Meeropol went through the most wrenching of traumas, and yet he grew up to be a caring, loving, thoughtful and good person. This book is a piece of history, and a testimony to how the caring and attention of some wonderful people allowed the children of Ethel & Julius Rosenberg build on the foundation laid for them as very young children. This was a heartbreak of a case--and a thoughtful fair presentation by Robert Meeropol."},{"Title":"An Execution in the Family: One Son's Journey","review":"An important latest chapter in the saga of the \\"Rosenberg Spy Case\\" by the older son of Julius and Ethel. Like \\"Watergate\\" the controversy will never end."},{"Title":"An Execution in the Family: One Son's Journey","review":"I never knew that the Rosenberg children were basically forced to assume a different last name so they wouldn't be persecuted by children and adults throughout their lives. Instead of understandably seeking revenge against those that did wrong by his parents (and our democracy), Robert Meeropol has adopted a philosophy of the highest order, to create something constructive out of something terribly heinous. His argument against the death penalty in Chapter 9 is so eloquently convincing that it should be read by every citizen of the free world. I don't believe this to be an understatement. If you read this review, don't just sit there... get the book and read that chapter!!The author also describes his support of Mumia Abu Jamal and how the Fraternal Order of Police stance for execution is more vengeance than truth-oriented. It's a controversial stance, and he doesn't belabor the point.On top of it all, he even suggests that he isn't quite convinced that his father wasn't guilty of something, just that there was no evidence to support the government's case against him, and even moreso with his mother. It seems that had the Rosenbergs admitted some guilt, their lives would be spared, Because they refused to lie, they chose death instead. Turns out they were brave, and their executioners cowards. Not a great moment for the USA.Written simply and with a voice free of self righteousness, Meeropol suggests the proper way our species should think, without moral relativism, and without the hysterics of today's political talking heads. This book makes places like Fox News obsolete."},{"Title":"An Execution in the Family: One Son's Journey","review":"Robert Meeropol manages to write a book about what must be an intensely painful subject for him -- his parents' execution -- with few traces of bitterness or rancor. He also deals honestly with the anger he does have, most of which is reserved for his uncle, David Greenglass. His approach to the question of their guilt or innocence is remarkably evenhanded, which makes the book all the more credible. Although he and his brother have lived their lives in the shadow of their parents' executions, both seem to have carved out productive, happy lives for themselves, which gives a glimmer of hope to this tragic story, well told."},{"Title":"An Execution in the Family: One Son's Journey","review":"I read this book because I have known of Robert and his brother Michael since the 1970s and I have always admired his parents and what they did. However, the book had an interest in its own, not just as the saga of a child of Ethel and Julius, but a saga of people of our generation (Robby is 15 days older than I am) especially as a number of the names of his peers and associates are faces and names I knew or still know.Many people live with a secret, that dad or mom is an alcoholic or a drug addict, that physical or even sexual abuse is going on in the house, that the bills are not being paid, that they are adopted, but Robby grew up with the secret of his identity. It was not all the hatred the witch hunt set up for his parents, but also the helpless feeling he recounts he felt when strangers who \\"knew who he was\\" would acost him on the streets with hugs and kisses and dotting.I think a lot more people will identify with this portion of his life, and how this difficulty gave him emotional problems and was even a block to his first attempts at a relationship with the woman who became his life.The book also gives a picture of the life and struggle of college student radicals at one of the centers of the radicalization at Ann Arbor, but also about Robby's continued commitment which reached a point of emotional and physical crisis when he became a corporate lawyer. He jsut could not do that, he needed to confront \\"them,\\" the system that had murdered his parents and set up the Rosenberg Fund for Children, a foundation that provides support and life enrichment for children of political prisoners and other victims of the repressive arms of American capitalism.The point of interest for me is how he deals with recent allegations from the \\"Verona\\" files released by the government and various claims made by a former KGB agent that Julius Rosenberg had given technical information about aeronautic and electronic devices to the USSR, though not the \\"secrets of theA-Bomb.\\" To me his father was a heroic figure, whose work helped strengthen the USSR which, with all the criminal deficiencies of its stalinized leadership, was the only thing that stopped the USA from launching the nuclear war it planned it the late 1940s.Even if one takes this evidence with full coin, the evidence is that Ethel never did anything. While she was dedicated to the cause, at the time she was in poor health, dealing with her infant Micahel who was a difficult child, and such a devoted mother that she took university courses in child pyschology and other issues to learn to give her son the best care.This information shows that Julius Rosenberg had nothing to do with the atomic bomb (both the Verona tapes and the KGB officer indicate the one time the bomb was discussed with David Greenglass, his brother-in-law, Julius was waiting outside the car because he knew nothing about this.)Moreover, Greenglass's information that was touted as \\"the secret of the atomic bomb\\" was useless. He was a machinist who made parts, and had no knowledge of the actual workings of the bomb.The Rosenbergs were framed because they refused to knucle under to the lies and the hysteria that the US government was orchestrating under Truman and then under Eisenhower. The real system of it was to get people to break under the pressure and fear, to lie about what they did, to implicate others, and to spread the hysteria.It had nothing to do with gathering information, for the FBI had extensive real knowledge of what was going on that would have refuted some of the lies and slanders that emerged under the witch hunt, a good example of this being the Hollywood Ten prosecution that was supposed to be about finding out who was in the Community party in the Hollywood film industry. Of course at the time, the person who maintained CP membership records for Southern California was an FBI agent and no such inquiry was needed. It had to do with breaking people down.Julius and Ethel held strong because as their letters to the world and their children and their last words said, they believed in fighting for a better future than the world they lived in.Their son follows this fight.One thing I felt deficient in this book, and perhaps this is just my own personal interst as I met both men in the 1970s, is that in the last section of the book what became of his brother Michael disappears from the narrative."},{"Title":"An Execution in the Family: One Son's Journey","review":"This book is an inspiring read that speaks to all of us. Not only has he given us a mvoing personal account of his own life, but Robert Meeropol challenges us all, as he challenges himself, to lead a life of purpose and humanity.As a child of his generation, I could not help but see bits of myself and the inner conflicts of my life throughout the book. I laughed and read passages aloud to my spouse, but also shed more than a few tears. But in the end, this is a story of triumph and struggle. Not to be missed."},{"Title":"An Execution in the Family: One Son's Journey","review":"The book arrived within the listed estimated delivery range and in the condition listed.

It looks like a good read and I'm looking forward to reading it for the class."},{"Title":"An Execution in the Family: One Son's Journey","review":"Alas! I see the hostile reviews to this book, and I think, \\"Who are you to tell this man what he should believe and what his life should be?\\" I find this to be a great American story of growth and acceptance. It's honest, and Meeropol has earned the right to choose his life and his values of decency and holding authority accountable. If you want to reinforce your own conservative agenda, find something else to read. There's plenty out there. If, however, you're interested in a real look at the cold war and Viet Nam era as they were felt by real people of conscience in America, enjoy this read."},{"Title":"An Execution in the Family: One Son's Journey","review":"This book is so much more than just a recounting of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg. It is their son Robert's life journey which is directly a result of his parent's execution. Robert mentions that moral arguments are problematic because they are not necessarily rational. He is right, but that being said, all of his arguments against the \\"establishment\\" being wrong have no more credibility than his own opinion of being right. Robert's loyalty to the left and his concern with fighting the \\"them,\\" who executed his parents almost 50 years ago, has blinded him. We see how the movement is like leaf that just blows in the wind according to the political current. He is so concerned with remaining on the \\"left,\\" his parent's party, that his own ideologies evolve with the movement. He moves from communism to SDS, to progressive, etc. Robert has no absolute standard for right and wrong. Who can blame him? In a Godless world, there is no absolute standard.I can't even begin to articulate how this story saddened me though. It saddens me to admit that I had never heard of the Rosenbergs, although I went to an Ivy League University and was familiar with the McCarthy era. I learned about the Rosenbergs from an HBO documentary by Michael's daughter. I also hate to admit that most of my peers have never heard of the Rosenbergs. I was so upset to learn about of all of the Jews who were involved in the execution of Ethel and Julius. Although Robert's recount is very pragmatic, there is such an underlying pain and sadness between the words. What saddened me most is the torn Rosenberg/Greenglass family. As a Jew myself, I can honestly say, their pain is my pain. Family not taking them in; it is not Jewish! Where were those Jewish values and ethics? Robert's story confirms that those ethics and values, which are the religious platform of those founding fathers, which he staunchly tries to uphold, were absent. Ethel and Julius were typical secular Jews whose \\"ism\\" was communism not Judaism; as were my grandparents in NYC. The secularism of his parents explains their loyalty to communism which explains his currant loyalty to \\"Leftism.\\"Robert is now years older than his parents and with age comes wisdom. Robert briefly mentions a \\"spiritual or even religious experience;\\" his foolishness was not exploring that! What Robert fails to see is what makes him like his parents is NOT his vehement loyalty to the left but his pursuit in making the world a better place."},{"Title":"An Execution in the Family: One Son's Journey","review":"There is no doubt that this book is both a heart-wrenching and triumph for Robert Meeropol. What a terrible tragedy he suffered through as a young child as result of the acts of his completely irresponsible parents Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. It is a well-know fact via the Venona cables that Joe McCarthy was 100% percent right about Soviet inflitration into the U.S. Government. This is no longer up for debate. Furthermore there is no longer any debate that the Soviet Union under Stalin - the very dictator and system that the Rosenbergs and their allied communist friends here in the US supported so blindly, was a terror-filled, murdering, raping, pillaging government. Seventy million people perished in the Soviet Union under Stalin due to starvation, poverty, political views and many ended in the gulags of Russia. I wonder if Robert and his brother have ever given any thought to the families and relatives of the people who Stalin and The Soviet Union murdered. Their parents Julius and Ethel Rosenberg and Company have the blood of these people on their hands too as they were dedicated enough to subvert their own country in support of the murderous Joseph Stalin and the government of the Soviet Union. Lucky for both Robert and Michael Rosenberg that they were citizens of the Very country that their parents opted to destroy and were protected and nutured and raised in this Great Country. If they had been in the Soviet Union they would have been thrown into the gulag - children or not. If I was either of them I would hit my knees every night and thank God that my parents and their associates did not destroy this country."},{"Title":"An Execution in the Family: One Son's Journey","review":"I am certain that if my parents were executed for being traitors to their country, that I would feel some degree of guilt, even if by association, but would want to know the truth. This book is not that journey; it is a complete work of fiction. The Meeropol boys (the name given to them with their adoption by leftist activists) Robert and Michael, plus others in the family such as their offspring Ivy and Rachel, have all become prominent leftists, continuing their attacks on capitalism and the United States. The problem that Robert has in writing this book is that even the Soviet Union has seen the light and disappeared, but in so doing, it opened up its vaults and revealed their ugly contents. Those contents were also verified by the release of the Venona Project papers a few years ago, which proved beyond any reasonable doubt that the Rosenbergs were traitors to the United States. I would feel sorry for the Meeropols, except that they have decided to continue in the path of their parents, supporting extremist left-wing organizations, attacking their country at every turn, and otherwise proving that apples, especially bad ones, don't fall very far from the tree. It is unfortunate that they have decided to live a life of denial instead of reflection on what motivated their parents to support this nation's enemies. Perhaps they would have taken different journeys themselves. It is ironic that the Meeropol clan now writes books, engages in leftist workshops, and work for organizations that undermine the liberties that they take for granted, just like their parents did. One of the saddest sections deals with Meeropol's attacks on the prosecutors of his parents' crimes, in effect blaming them for his parents preference to go to the chair, leaving him an orphan, rather than reveal the names of their fellow collaborators. Their love for communism obviously greater than their love for their sons.The errors and omissions in this book are so numerous and outrageous that it would take a book twice the length of this one to detail them all. Suffice it to say that if you are looking for anything that resembles the truth regarding what despicable scum the Rosenberg traitors really were, you won't find it in here. But thankfully there are several books which are available now to expose this piece of fiction for what it is."},{"Title":"Lucky Street Chronicles: A Novel","review":"I was very anxious about to recieve this book because a couple of friends told me that it was good.

As part of the new Warren Bennis Management series, it provides the framework for the new Organizational Democracy and how it can (and should!) replace the outdated, ineffective heirarchical forms of management most common today. If you manage or lead a team, department or organization and desire to manage less and produce more, this is the book for you. I felt the same excitement in reading this book as I did when I read Drucker's classic many years ago.The chapter entitled &quot;A Brief History of Management&quot; is worth the price of the book -- and its just 10 pages. In the rest of the book you will be given step-by-step guidance for implementing a new way of managing. Among the many practical applications of this book, you will learn:How to shape ValuesHow to create Webs of AssociationHow to develop Self-managing TeamsHow to implement Effective Processand How to produce Self-correcting Systems.Management (Drucker) is dead, long live management (Cloke).Nelson Searcy, Chief Innovation Officer, Smartleadership.com"},{"Title":"The End of Management and the Rise of Organizational Democracy","review":"This review is a shorter one I wrote for the journal Personnel Psychology.I couldn't resist reviewing this book. Its title is beguilingly ambiguous. I had to see what it really meant. Are the authors describing a reality I have yet to discover? Or are they prophesying? Or writing a manifesto? Or wishfully thinking? The authors, both organizational consultants who \\"have drawn on over thirty years experience with hundreds of organizations,\\" raise and dismiss in the same sentence the fourth interpretation. But can it be so confidently dismissed?The book was written \\"as a tool to help build more collaborative, democratic, self-managing organizations.\\" Note the use of multiple qualifiers. Done occasionally would be tolerable, but the authors' habit of frequently tacking three and four onto nouns and of also running trains of verbs and nouns in a single sentence annoyed me a bit (e.g., \\"---we have separated, disengaged, detached, distinguished, and divided---in order to clarify, categorize, and recommend---.\\").Part One is devoted to \\"making a case for the end of management\\" through a review and a critique of hierarchies and their management. In tracing the evolution of management, three of the influences posited by the authors had never occurred to me before yet seem quite plausible. They are slavery, then serfdom, and much later on, increasing governmental regulations that the regulated have to increasingly manage. Nor was I aware that the French novelist, Honore de Balzac, and I share the same sentiment, namely, that bureaucracy is \\"a gigantic power set in motion by dwarfs.\\" I also learned that \\"hierarchy\\" stems from the Greek word hieros, which means holy, implying sacred power at the top, and that a contrasting word, \\"heterarchy,\\" stems from heteros, meaning neighbors.The authors dust off and briefly examine Taylorism, scientific management, and Theory X rationales. I wish they had gone further in their review to present and debate more recent and starkly opposite arguments, including those that are unabashed paeans to hierarchies and bureaucracies (e.g., du Gay, 2000; Jaques, 1990).Making their case includes presenting, each in a separate chapter, the familiar arguments that management \\"reduces communication, morale, and motivation,\\" \\"constricts quality,\\" and is intransigent, resisting change and innovation. While I think a separate chapter should also have been given to the moral inferiority of hierarchies, it's very clear throughout the book that the authors recognize such organizations foster unethical conduct by their members, and a separate chapter in Part Two is devoted to suggestions on how to \\"shape a context of values, ethics, and integrity.\\"The authors argue that hierarchies are the source of bureaucracy, the formal mechanisms that support the organizational structure and provide a \\"safe haven\\" where managers can escape accountability and exercise autocratic power. Each of these elements reinforces the other. They also violate, the authors contend, four \\"value-based propositions\\" about all people in organizations. One, everyone is a human being, not merely an employee or a human resource. Two, everyone is fully capable of acting responsibly and thriving on challenges. Three, the only natural relationships of any worth aren't hierarchical. And fourth, human beings deserve all of the different dimensions of freedom that should be available to them in an organization, such as the horizontal dimension of cross-functional teams and the \\"hyperdimension\\" of community. Regarding this latter observation, the authors' argument most appealing to me affectively is that it's incongruous for people to live in a democracy where they can vote for their country's leaders, yet work in hierarchies where they aren't free to select their organizations' leaders.Time and again the authors remind us that their case is being made against management as a system rather than against management as a class of people. But the authors often contradict themselves (e.g., \\"Managers who hold these assumptions---micromanage---restrict----and institute---.\\"), and I wonder if they aren't being a bit disingenuous, for as consultants they do feed off the hands of that class of people. Furthermore, not all management processes or systems are dysfunctional. Performance management, for one, is both inevitable and essential as a process. It couldn't end if you tried, and you wouldn't want to try. It can be done well or poorly, but it will be done. I think all species instinctively manage their own performance.My assessment of Part One is that the authors make a better case against management on rational than on empirical grounds. What supporting evidence is offered is mostly piecemeal and largely anecdotal. Further, no footnote citations are provided for the few surveys and research studies briefly mentioned, and numerous assertions are made (e.g., \\"many managers report,\\" \\"many organizations seek,\\" etc.) with no corroborating evidence given. Even so, the evidence that is provided and all of assertions made do seem relevant and plausible, and I have no reason to doubt the authors \\"who have been inside enough organizations to know how dysfunctional most of them are.\\"In Part Two, the authors explain how to use their book as \\"a practical guide to organizational democracy.\\" It does indeed seem practical, but a caveat is necessary. Almost all of their consulting experiences appear to be with limited interventions in hierarchies, not heterarchies. I found only one instance where the authors' intervention, in this particular case the design of a conflict resolution system, was for a large corporation they say had already been reorganized into self-managing teams. Their guide would thus appear to be untested for making the wholesale, even revolutionary changes they believe are required but apparently have not fully tried anywhere.I don't mean to be dismissive of the second part, however. To the contrary, I would guess that any business organization that followed the \\"seven key strategies\\" the authors describe, each in a separate chapter, would \\"shift from management to self-management,\\" \\"hierarchy to heterarchy,\\" and \\"autocracy to democracy.\\" The authors begin, logically and necessarily I believe, with a strategy for transforming the values of the organization's culture. Then there's a strategy for forming \\"evolving webs of association\\" (in contrast, say, to rigid functional departments in a hierarchy), for developing leadership skills throughout the organization, for building self-managing teams, for implementing \\"streamlined, open, collaborative processes\\" (e.g., teamwork as opposed to the adversarial processes common to hierarchies), and for creating \\"complex, self-correcting systems\\" (i.e. the kind of feedback you won't find in hierarchies). The seventh is having an overall strategy to ensure that all changes are integrated together.The book ends with a final chapter on \\"the consequences of organizational democracy.\\" The authors argue that greater organizational democracy is bound to have positive effects not only on members of the organization but also on society and politics.While I basically agree with the distinguished business professor, Ian I. Mitroff, who endorses the book very favorably as \\"bristling with wisdom and practical advice,\\" I don't want to conclude without mentioning two more significant faults I find with the book.Nowhere in the book do I get a sense of whether heterarchies are gaining in number over hierarchies. I don't think the authors know or even tried to know, yet I would have expected them to know or try to know given the book's title and their treatment of the subject. They waffle on the matter, too. They say, for instance, that \\"---management continues, with few exceptions, to manage autocratically---.\\" Then they turn around and say, \\"We have reached---the end of management---.\\" Perhaps their waffling simply reflects what may be an accurate observation during a transitional period, for when I read the research literature on organizations, some findings suggest a shift towards heterarchies, (e.g., Purser & Cabana, 1998), some don't (e.g., Koch & Godden, 1996), and some are totally silent on the matter (e.g., Collins, 2001; Collins & Porras, 1994).Secondly, the authors fail to differentiate sufficiently between business and government organizations. The latter have an endless lifeline to taxpayer pockets and no market incentive whatsoever to undertake the seven strategies toward heterarchies, no matter how strong of a case is made for making the shift. It will be the 12th of Never, I say, when heterarchies prevail in government.In closing, if you are simply interested in the subject of if you do consulting in the subject area and regardless of whether you already appreciate arguments for heterarchies, I would recommend you read this book. If you are also empirically bent, then this book alone won't totally satisfy you unless you already know what's happening out there.ReferencesCollins, JC. (2001). Good to great.

While &quot;Full Stop&quot; is not the strongest entry (its USA location isn't that enthralling) Joan Smith is an interesting writer, and the series is well worth reading, especially if you are involved in any way with academia and literary criticism."},{"Title":"Full Stop","review":"While the premise of this book is interesting, I found the protagonist, Loretta Lawson, unappealing and character-less, and was confused by the anti-American sentiment and blatant stereotyping displayed throughout the book. The various plots within the book seem disconnected, as though one has had to read previous Loretta Lawson mysteries to know what is going on. An odd tie-in at the end to a previous love affair left me confused. Intellectual snobbism seems to run through the book. References to obscure authors and their work have little to do with the plot, and come across as an excuse to self-aggrandize, rather than adding to the reader's interest. I was very disappointed with this book, as the plot description seemed intriguing, but the characterizations bordered on actively unpleasant."},{"Title":"Full Stop","review":"I loved the heroine of the book, and I loved the references to art and culture. I found the ending to be a bit sketchy and unrelated to the beginning of the book. I will be reading her again, however. She created a smart character and detective."},{"Title":"Full Stop","review":"Loretta Lawson must be the most annoying, bigoted and idiotic main character I've come across in my entire life as an avid reader!!!! I had to force myself to finish this book. The majority of Americans were depicted as poorly dressed, stupid, evil or rude (and sometimes all at once. The author attempts to portray Americans, and New Yorkers in particular, as ignorant and rude, not just a few times, but throughout the entire book ad nauseum. In doing so, the British main character comes off seeming petty and critical. No wonder she's alone in the world--who can stand her?? The main plot was paper thin. Even a child would be able to pick up immediately on the fact that Donnelly and Michael are the same person!!! Additionally, I don't know how the author can be a feminist and yet she creates a female character who is an absolute moron who keeps slipping up and giving her stalker useful information about herself. Loretta is not at all assertive and prone to acting hysterically. What an unlikeable main character! She might be bookish, but she can't behave like a competent adult. She can't even tell off the annoying imposing friend (an American, of course) or the condescending ex-husband (what nationality WAS he??? His diction is so mixed-up). I can honestly say that this is the dullest and most annoying book I have read in my life. There were no appealing characters, no compelling relationships and no semblance of plausibility. And don't get me started on how some of the American characters' dialogue is peppered with British language structure and parlance. The only good news to all aspiring authors out there: If Joan Smith can get published, anybody can."},{"Title":"Sources of Conflict in the 21st Century: Strategic Flashpoints and U.S. Strategy","review":"There are no doubt a few nuggets of wisdom in this book, but they are buried too deeply in bureaucratic gibberish to be worth digging up. This book has no bibliography, no index, mediocre footnotes, no serious useful conclusions or strategic summary, and a disturbing combination of American-centrism (on page 71: &quot;In the Asian continent....(t)he first driver will be the future U.S. role in Asia.&quot;) with a lack of intelligent presentation. There are exactly three figures and seven tables in this 336 page book, when there should have been at least 30 tables and figures illustrating specific sources of conflict in relation to specific countries. The World Conflict and Human Rights Map (8 pages of graphics and 8 pages of fine print) out of Leiden University does vastly more to inform than does this book. This book should never, ever have been published in its present form--I venture to say that if it were condensed to 150 pages and properly edited, with graphics and good synthesis, it might be worthy of a second look. Time is the most precious commodity in the world--RAND managers and editors need to get serious about how they present possibly useful information to experts who want to know what RAND thinks, but cannot spare the time to get past cumbersome undisiplined--even lazy--preparations. The topic of this book is extremely important--those who would invest their scarce time and money in doing research in this area deserve better from those who put together this book."},{"Title":"The Longs Peak experience and trail guide","review":"Mike Donahue was much more a mind guide than a climbing guide. His book is about the experience, the mindshifts that climbing Longs Peak creates, not the climb. His words are literally step-by-step coaching of how to mentally (physically) prepare and plan your climb... In a casually informal but powerful story-telling sort of way. I climbed Longs with Mike twice, the first time with my wife and 8-year old daughter Amy, and my two partners. And Mike's father, Warren Donahue, accompanied us as far as the Boulder Field. We didn't summit... 350 feet from the top the weather shift, hail and lightning hit us, and we descended as rapidly as we could. Then i read Mike's book. Mike and I ended up as partners in leading corporate groups on Thinking Expeditions for a number of years. Some 10 years later I again climbed Longs with Mike, this time with my oldest daughter and her husband. We summited. And this time I had \\"The longs Peak Experience\\" in my head. What an amazing difference it made. Read the book. Pay attention. Make the climb in honor of Mike who will be your mindguide all the way up, and more importantly, on the descent. PowerfuL life-changing stuff!"},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"Anna Corbett is a strong woman who in turns mee a man who is just as strong and caring as she is. The conflicts that haunts the Corbetts, the sheriff and Jack, all relate to the Herbold boys and their past and present experiences. The raw and evil mind of the younger Herbold boy (Carl) and how the past meets the present. Overall I found the book exciting and easy to read, it held my attention throughout the book. It is not the romance you might have expected but there is a love interest."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"I'm disappointed and sickened. The story was very good, the secret was kept until the end. But...I can't believe Sandra Brown would write such graphically expicit violent sex. This is unlike all her other books. I admit I have read every book she has written and I enjoy her sensual love stories. Sandra Brown does not need to resort to violent sex to sell her books. I was very uncomfortable reading the book, and it makes me uncomfortable recommending it to any one...the graphic descriptions sickened me."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"As someone owns virtually every book Sandra Brown has written, I am always eager to read her new novels. But, this one was very disappointing. The plot was seriously lacking. And the ending left me feeling very dissatisfied. It definitely was not one of her best efforts. If you are interested in a good Sandra Brown suspense book, read &quot;Mirror Image.&quot;"},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"Not her very best but I was intrigued. Not for the die hard romance reader as Sandra Brown has catered to in the past. I personally enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"This book was not worthy of Sandra Brown. It was very unbelievable &amp; not suspensful at all, as the jacket leads you to believe. Also, the language and violence was senseless. Instead of it helping us to understand the character, it was offensive and tedious. Sandra Brown, can do so much better than this. If you're a big fan skip this one, you'll be dissappointed."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"I've read all of Sandra Brown's books and Unspeakable is not one of her best. I found that the relationship between Anna and Jack lacked the powerful sexual tension that is the trademark of Ms. Brown's other books, such as French Silk, Silken Web and Best Kept Secrets. Though the story was very interesting, I found much of the violence depicted in the book to be excessive and unnecessary. Unspeakable was a nice diversion, but unlike Ms. Brown's other books, I will read this one only once."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"I admit it. Sometimes I just like to pick up a book and read without really thinking. I spent one rainy Saturday on the couch reading Unspeakable. It was a real page turner, but more for simple language than compelling plot. It was pretty much your cookie-cutter mystery/love story. The ending was a little bit predictable. But I don't regret reading it. It was fun while it lasted."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"My 2nd Sandra Brown novel was another wonderful read. I loved everything about this book. The characters were remarkably well written. There wasn't much romance, mostly action packed suspense, which I like. I finished Unspeakable in 2 days and enjoyed every minute of it. My favorite novels by Mrs. Brown are Unspeakable and The Alibi, both in paperback. It is great that Sandra Brown has changed from writing romance novels to mystery novels. I can't wait for The Switch!"},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"This is a sorry story with sorry, unbelievable characters. They're separated into good guys and bad guys.The bad guys, well, they're the most fun, but they're not realistic. Carl Herbold is a psychopath or sociopath or something, but he's not believable. Emory Lomax, the same thing. These two fellows have no altruistic motives, as the author admits, but even sociopaths fear God, don't they? These guys don't. They're caricatures of evil, not real people.If you like caricatures, you find them here, and that's all you find. It makes for simple reading, because there are no complex characters who have a mixture of some good traits and some bad. Carl is worse than Satan, if you can imagine that. Emory, too. They are Satan's little helpers in Blewert County, or wherever it is.Jack, on the other hand, is a righteous free spirit, another old Western caricature. He likes little children and falls in love with the heroine, Anna, who is deaf. Jack is almost totally on the good-guy side, except he's so lusty. Righteous and lusty, is that a Western good guy, or what?Delray Corbett is in denial: he helped raise the two screw-up stepsons but wants to deny responsibility. He's a tough old coot, another caricature.Cecil Herbold, you can almost feel sorry for. His girlfriend, Connie Skaggs, is unbelievable. She works in a bank? And then kills someone in a bank robbery on goes the lam with this lunatic squad? Didn't she forget her toothbrush? Don't women need clothes when they're fleeing with four males? Not Connie, I guess. Seems like she has a death wish, and she gets her wish, of course. Are there really women like that? Bonnie Parker?Well, you will learn that American Sign Language differs from Signed English. And East Texas has tornadoes. Otherwise, you can look forward to having your emotions titillated, because that's what Brown's writing is all about, I guess. A sorry soap opera, and that's what some folks love. She's so prolific and successful, it must be that. This is my first book I've read by her, and I did get titillated, I can't deny it. But is it worth it? Well, you decide, this is what I found. Diximus."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"This is my first Sandra Brown novel, it will probably be my last. I do not like the filthy talk, some of the talk made me sick to my stomach. I know Sandra Brown is suppose to be one of the best, but I guess that is just not my kind of reading."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"I bought the unabridged book on tape, as I heard many good things said about this authors past novels. The book was without depth, full of gratuitous and inappropriately place sex and was entirely predictable. Like another review before me, I read on wishing the book would come to a merciful and swift ending for the reader. Rather than pumping out so many novels, this talented writer would do better to slow down and truly &quot;work&quot; on a novel fitting her name and reputation."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"Sandra Brown is making the jump Tami Hoag has already done, replacing romance and character development with graphic voilence and murder mystery that should not sell under Romance. Sandra Brown has a rich history of characters who break your heart and make you laugh, this story has none. She does not develop any character but the evil brothers. It is a shame."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"I usually like Sandra Brown's books, alot. But this book has so much killing. just..bang you're dead..who cares...Go back to romance."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"I have been a big fan of Sandra Brown's since my first book - Texas Trilogy. Up until this latest release I had always been a satisfied reader. I will admit that not all of her books have been on a scale of 10 (true 10's) but I've liked her humour and style of writing. This latest book was unnecessarily violent and at times crude which did not bring much to the story. Being a true fan I have not yet abandoned my favorite writer, but please note Sandra, that I don't care to purchase and read an other type of book like &quot;Unspeakable&quot; soon."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"Authors don't need to write the same books over and over again and that is exactly why I am pleased to add Unspeakable to my Brown collection. This is a more mainstream book, true, than her previous romantic suspense; and perhaps, in one part, especially, too graphically violent (hey, okay I hate the bad guys Sandra, let's leave the &quot;kidnapping&quot; and its results out next time). The characters were intriguing, and I didn't solve the murder (I usually do). Though the book was unexpectedly complex I believe it to be one of Brown's best. So much so that after buying the hardback, I am now enjoying the unabridged tape during ride time."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"I have been a fan of Ms Brown forever. I should have known her latest, Unspeakable, was a departure, when my father-in-law asked to borrow it after reading the flap. Ms. Brown has become more &quot;mainstream&quot; over the years but she now seems to be actively seeking male readers with more hardcore sadomasochism and violence. There are so few authors who really do romantic suspense well - Sandra Brown is one of them. Let's hope that Nora Roberts doesn't decide to take a turn writing in this hardcore genre, too."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"Why are some of the top authors changing to suspense/romance instead of sticking to the kind of writing that got them where they are now? Sandra Brown's &quot;Unspeakable &quot; seems just that kind of book. I was glad to see she came out with a new one, it's been awhile. But I was very disappointed after reading it. At the end, it seems she couldn't make up her mind on how to end it so she came up with a lot of different senarios and lets the reader decide if they like it . Are they all trying to keep up with Mary Higgens Clark or Danielle Steel who crank out these kind of books once or twice a year.. Maybe money talks, which is a shame, since she should have put more thought into this one before she sent this to the publisher. Sorry Sandra, better luck next time. Stick to books like Adam's Fall and Texas Sage/Lucky/Chase, and Tidings of Great Joy which your readers have come to love and leave the suspense novels to others."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"Sandra Brown's previous 3 novels (&quot;The Witness,&quot; &quot;Exclusive&quot; and &quot;Fat Tuesday&quot;) have all been intelligent, well-crafted stories of suspense while also employing a sophisticated usuage of prose. It is with great shock that Ms. Brown has come up with this new novel which is, quite frankly, an embarrassment both to the author and reader. The writing here, immature at best, is appalling. To reduce one's intelligence by using adjetives such as &quot;doofus&quot; to describe a character is inexcusable. Added to poor prose is a worse story - one that holds as much interest as a leaky faucet. Everything combined makes &quot;Unspeakable&quot; virtually unreadable. We are all allowed to make mistakes and to learn from them. Let's hope Ms. Brown has learned from this unfortunate endeavor."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"Considering that this book is over 3 years old, I just ran across it about a week ago. I will say that the character's are written very well in good vivid detail. The first half of it is actually pretty good, but the second half gets very predictable. It read like a bad Meg Ryan or Julia Roberts film, really bad ones. I predicted almost everything that happened in the second half. I was somewhat surprised at the very fowl and disgusting language used by Sandra Brown. The book starts out with the intent to solve the druesome murder of a young girl over 20 years ago. The book then veers off in several different directions, with the murder being mentioned occasionally. There is an obvious attempt to make this the perfect love story. The two lovers played by Jack and Anna are rarely depicted in a bad light, while everyone else are depicted as fools, cowards, or mean-spirited. Anna is a widow who stays on a ranch with her little son and her step-father Delray. Her husband Dean died at home 6 years ago after returning home from War. Anna and Delray have a &quot;complicated&quot; relationship that wasn't well defined for me. Delray is written like a mean-spirited man, with like a heart of gold. He's in love with Anna, but she's not in love with him. This goes unspoken between the two of them thoughtout the book, even up until his eventual predictable death. I thought that the Author Sandra Brown contradicted their relationship throughout the whole story. It just seemed like she took the easy way out by killing him, instead of dealing with their dilemma honestly. Considering not telling Anna how he felt about her seemed to be the main thing that killed him, even if he knew she didn't feel the same, I found his eventual death kind of cowardly actually. There was a concerted effort to diminish other people in Anna's life, alive or dead, to save the perfect love story of Anna and Jack. To diminish the relationship Anna had with her dead husband Dean, who she clearly had to be in love with, so Jack could be viewed as her perfect lover, was very cowardly I thought. Love is love, why the need to make him a better lover or more thoughtful man than the first. Especially since the husband died over 6 years ago. I just thought it was uncalled for. There appeared to be contradictions thought the book. Everyone from escaped convict Carl, his ex-con brother Cecil, Carl's stupid partner Myron, Cecil's &quot;slutty&quot; girlfriend Connie are written with contradictions. Carl is written out to be a very smart criminal, though he's clearly an idiot, and dies like one. I predicted how the sleazy bank manager Emory Lomax would die down to the last letter. I won't give out the very neat ending. But I didn't find it believable, even a little bit. The unsolved murder part could have been left out, because it clearly wasn't needed. It actually seemed like an afterthought after the first few chapters. I don't know if this was ever made into a movie, but it has that feel to it. A very bad movie."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"UNSPEAKABLE is the story about Anna Corbett, a deaf widow with a young son. Her son's inheritance is the ranch where they live with Anna's father-in-law. Carl Herbold is the bad guy who enjoys being bad and excels at it! Carl was serving a life sentence in an Arkansas prison, but escapes with another inmate and vows to carry out his revenge. He's on the way to Texas, and Anna Corbett is in the center of Carl's plans. Along comes Jack Sawyer, an easygoing cowboy who keeps his past a mystery and hires on to help on the ranch. His real intentions are to protect Anna and her son. What he didn't know is that he'd fall in love with Anna and her son, and protecting them both became more important than life itself!UNSPEAKABLE is a great book! One of Sandra Brown's best stories yet! Again Brown mixes romance and mystery with the perfect blend. If you've never read any of Sandra Brown's work, this would be an excellent one from which to start! UNSPEAKABLE has many twists and turns to leave you wondering what will happen next. Filled with interesting sidelines, this book is one that you won't want to put down!"},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"Brown has really done it this time. Nothing like her previous novels, &quot;Unspeakable&quot; is an excellent step in a new direction if she chooses to follow it. I'm a widely read individual, and Brown has tactfully mixed violence and romance together in a way I haven't seen before. If you're accustomed to Brown's usual writing style, I personally wouldn't recommend this book...but if you're up to reading something new, &quot;Unspeakable&quot; is the book for you. Readers should beware, however, of the language and violence - and that is tame compared to other authors I've read. Keep up the good work Sandra, it's good to see you trying something new!"},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"I almost read all books of Sandra Brown so being a best seller I bought this book. What a great great disappointment. Already her last books got somewhat cruel ( Fat Tuesday , Witness, French Silk ....) but this is topping it. There is no balance, the story is just woven around a string of cruel past AND present. The love scenes might be interesting for those, who haven't read much of SB.I recommend all three TEXAS, Where there is Smoke, Charade if you like a bit action and thrill For those who can live without it atall : Fanta C (my first SB book), Adams Fall, Breakfast in Bed For historic romancers don't miss Another Dawnwell the next time I won't buy SB just for her name only..... arancha"},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"Whilst I am a big fan of Sandra Brown I found this book easier to put down than the rest. The violence was rather sickening at times and I found I couldn't look forward to picking it up again. Although at the end it was of course well worth reading I'm not sure I'd choose it for a second reading (and I've read several of her books more than 4 times!)."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"Unspeakable was a wonderful book. It started out with a bang in the beginning. In the middle it kind of got more into the romance and since I am not a romance reader it kind of drug for me. I almost fell out of my seat the last 100 pages! Carl Herbold and Myron Hutts are a villianous pair! This is one book to pick up if you are looking for suspense. WARNING: If you have a week stomach or hate violence I would NOT read this. But if you're not then read it! It's good for people who like suspoense and people who like romance. It's just that GREAT! This has been my first Brown book and it will NOT be my last!"},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"'Unspeakable' is not that bad, although it is not nearly as good as her earlier mainstream novels. Ever since 'Charade' (my personal favorite, along with 'Mirror Image') her books have lost the 'touch' that made Ms. Brown unique. I look forward to the release of 'The Alibi' in paperback, the sneak preview I read looks very promising - steamy and entertaining, which 'Unspeakable', alas, is not."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"For readers who are expecting a &quot;romance novel,&quot; you will be terribly disappointed. This book is more like a James Patterson (Kiss the Girls) type book than a knight in shining armor saves the heroine! It is almost masculine in writing style. Nevertheless, the story line kept my attention and this is a decent &quot;thriller&quot; if you like violence and suspense."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"First let me say that I love Sandra Brown; I have read all her romances, and I loved &quot;Fat Tuesday,&quot; the first of her mysteries that I happened to pick up.But I could not, no matter how hard I tried, stick with &quot;Unspeakable,&quot; even though I read more than half the book. I had to force myself to pick it up; finally I gave up. This is a demented &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; on a drug trip gone bad. I am not squeamish when it comes to graphic descriptions in a murder novel, but there is something about the descriptions in this book that turned my stomach, starting in the first pages with the description of a disembowling of a mouse. I simply could not go on; I felt sick.I skipped to the end, because I did have some curiosity about what finally happened, so I guess Brown had me hooked on some level. But not enough to keep me going."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"I am an avid reader of romantic-suspence... BUT how anyone would want to spend hours reading such terrible language... needless rape ,betrayel of family as well as horrendous visuael immages of depravity...IT is beyond me. I have read several Brown books and they just seem to get worse. After this one I could NEVER read her again. I look to a book for escape and not to see the world as a bitter cruel place. Sorry Sandra..."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"I loved this book. Next to \\"Chill Factor\\" this is the best of the four books I've read so far by Sandra Brown. This book was evenly paced and believable. The good characters were lovable and the romance between Jack and Anna was electrifying. I suggest listening to it on audio to get the full effects of the tension and emotions between the two of them. This is more a love story than anything, but there are plenty of grisly details and intrigue surrounding the criminality in the story."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"This is a departure from Sandra's usual style of story. The trademark writing is still there however far more violent and more chiller/thriller than romance. This is the novel which started my highly picky husband reading her books after considerable convincing on my behalf that women can write the type of thrillers men like to read. He hasn't looked back since and I do believe that in the direction she is heading with novels such as this and The Alibi&quot; she is appealing to a wider mainstream audience. There is still an element of romance in this novel and whilst there were parts that were uncomfortable to read, this book is very well rounded and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"I've read every one of Sandra Brown's books, going back to when she was Erin St. Claire for Silhouette Books. I've never been as disappointed as I was after reading this one. The gratuitous violence and sickening characters were just too much. I thought this also lacked romance which she's been so good at writing in the past. I can only hope the next book will be more like her usual."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"To be honest I could not get past the first chapter.

I found it very difficult to get through...the language foul and the characters lacking. The love story wasn't even interesting. I was determined to make it to the end, and reaching that goal. I had no sympathy for any of the characters save the little boy, David.

So much for summer trashy novels."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"A friend loaned me this book. I'm glad I didn't buy it. I quit reading it after 60 pages.

A 14-year old girl being brutally sodomized and killed? Believe me, that's just the tip of the iceberg. This is supposed to be entertainment? To me this was the literary equivalent of a snuff film. Often while reading this book I found myself thinking less about the plot than about what kind of sick puppy could sit down and write this garbage. It honestly, truly disturbs me that this sadistic trash is what's being peddled to the reading public. I threw the book out because I couldn't stand the thought of having it under the same roof with me. I hope Browne has at least considered trying therapy. I would not want to meet her in person."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"I have read almost every book she has written and this was absolutely horrible! How can she call that a romance novel...it was disgusting and gruesome. The little bit of romance came around page 380. I wanted to quit reading it many times, but I kept thinking it would get better. It was so choppy...changing characters way too often. If this is Sandra's new trend in writing she has made a big mistake! Or, she needs to just call herself a mystery writer now. I agree with others that I would like to toss this book in the trash and never see it again!"},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"In this book SB tried to teach us about the living of a deaf person. How she feels, how she communicates or work with other people among other things. But she missed the point by far. If this is your first book about this theme maybe you'll be amazed at how deaf people make her living but even so I don't think so.The plot is good enough to read it but is not really thrilling.

I invested time in reading it and felt let down by the last chapter and Jack's speech at the end."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"I have read nearly all of Sandra Brown's books but this is the worst one she has written as far as being too graphic. The love story was good but the killing and preverted sex were not anything I care to read about."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"It was hard for me to get worked up about Unspeakable. It is not a bad book, really. Nor is it great. In fact, it is kind of...boring. Brown has definitely made strides in creating multidimensional secondary characters. You can see the effort she put into fleshing out the characters of the sherriff and the heroine's father-in-law. But the book just never grabbed my interest.I didn't feel any spark between the hero and heroine. Zippo. Nada. In fact, they felt very one-dimensional to me. So lacklustre was their chemistry that the love scenes seemed somehow inappropriate and forced. Perhaps trying to rescue the heroine from being a dull, paperboard cut-out, Brown makes her a gifted amateur photographer. But it feels like something she just threw in there to try to give the woman some depth. There is the obligatory rediscovery of her artistic passion, brought about by the entrance of the hero. Then the trip to the conveniently well-stocked photo store which just opened up in the heroine's small hometown (how such a store could survive in the small town it's located in is a mystery). It is all very pat.Neither the heroine nor the hero ever come alive. I was particularly disappointed in the hero, because usually Brown does a good job of creating interesting, compelling, attractive heroes. Jack Sawyer just seems boring. In fact the whole book feels tired and flat. There was a sense of buoyancy and energy in Brown's earlier work (her books for Candlelight, Silhouette, etc.) that has been lacking in some of her later efforts.Knowing the intense debate that rages in the deaf community about the use of cochlear implants, which are helping many deaf people hear, I expected Brown to touch on this in her book, since the heroine is deaf. But she never does. This struck me as a grave oversight for a novel that features a deaf person as the main character.A lot of people complained about the graphic violence in the novel. It was unpleasant, but, like the heroine's photography, it seemed like something Brown just threw in to try to add interest to the story. The gratuitous violence really just ended up adding to the book's overall boring-ness. The villains were stock characters; it was like Brown didn't even try to come up with anything new where the Herbold brothers and their accomplices were concerned. Snore.If you must read this book, get it at the library or, wait for the paperback edition and get it at the used book store. Though her previous novel, Fat Tuesday, was a shameful rip-off of the Richard Gere-Kim Basinger movie, No Mercy, I think readers would get more satisfaction from reading that book than Unspeakable."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"It has been a while since the last book. The plot is interesting, the characters sufficiently developed. But I didn't like the ending where Jack told his story. I guess this shows the characters are flawed, and not altogether 'heros', but his story was just too horrific. Whatever happened, it seemed like he is a murderer. I prefer Sandra's past novels - more romance please!"},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"I admit that this is my first time to read a book by Sandra Brown, and I can promise that it won't be my last. It takes real skill to make each and every character on the printed page so unique that you can practically visualize him/her each time that character's name is mentioned, but Brown does it here. And the plots and sub-plots mingle and flow together in truly believable and artistic fashion.Romance and violence are meshed together in a story that works well. Carl and Myron made me cringe. However, there were scenes in which my heart broke for Myron who seemed, when all was said and done, to be exactly what you would expect from a profoundly retarded adult whose only role models and friends (?) had been violent, hateful psychopaths.Somebody is going to do a screenplay with this book one day. I plan to attend the movie when it happens."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I would group it into 'one of my favorites by Ms Brown'. Although I thought the sections about the retired Sheriff could have been left out all together."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"UNSPEAKABLE is a story filled with mystery, murder, violence, and tragedy revolving around a man with a troubled past seeking redemption, a widowed mother who is deaf and mute and afraid to love again, an aging sheriff determined to solve a mystery from long ago and about the two vicious killers who are hunting them as prey killing anyone in their way.UNSPEAKABLE is definitely not a story for the weak at heart or stomach. The violence is realistically detailed. The truthfullness- the reality check instilled this story makes this book quite unique among Brown's previous works. It is suspenseful yet passionate keeping you on the alert ready to hide under the covers or so hot you're aching for a shower. I definitely recommend it. You'll love it. Trust me!"},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"What a wonderful love story between Jack &amp; Anna. As the story skipped from Jack &amp; Anna to Carl &amp; Cecil Herbold I could not wait to get back to Jack &amp; Anna. This is the best book I have ever read. Great story line. Sandra Brown is a wonderful author. I would like to read more of her work."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"The plot, characterization and flow were all mediocre, but the overall impression was good. It didn't make me stay up all night to finish it, but it was worth spending the time. -Rachel Sparks"},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"I read the mixed reviews of this book and figured, what the heck, I'd try it out myself. As my rating indicates, I found the book satisfactory but not Ms. Brown's best. I can't really pinpoint what I didn't like, but I do know that after her love interest revealed his true character at the end of the book, I wondered why she didn't just walk out of his life..."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"I was really surprised to see that people were disappointed in this book. I thought it was fantastic. Once started, I couldn't put it down.I started it on a Saturday night and had to force myself to go to sleep. On Sunday I finished it. I found it fascinating that she would create a female main character who was not &quot;perfect&quot;. That in itself was a refreshing change. I thought the book was very suspenseful. You wanted to keep reading just to find out how everyone was connected. I definitely highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"As an avid Sandra Brown reader I pounced upon her latest - as usual I wasn't disappointed. No one expects her books to be literary masterpieces they are simply great trashy novels that are difficult to put down. There was plenty of action in this book and the greater number of characters gave a lot more interest. Ezzy the retired sheriff was a great diversion, struggling with his own marriage whilst everything else was going on! As usual the scruffy cowboy character was a great hit with me( let me know if these types exist in the U.S because I'll be right there!!) Anna Corbett wasn't the usual Sandra Brown heroine - they usually have more of an attitude then she did. This book was brought from the USA as a present for me and I read it whilst on holiday. I found myself constantly wanting to find time to read it and when I finished it I found that my holiday was over and I had missed most of it!! A sign of a good book. Read it and forget everything else!"},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"This is the first book of Sandra Brown's that I have read--and it made a great impact! I read this book in only four days (every spare minute I had was spent reading)! This book hooks you in the first chapter and keeps you wanting more. I love how descriptive Brown makes her characters and how she puts you right into each scene. Some scenes are a little gory, but well written all-around. Welcome to my library collection!!"},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"Well, I have to admit that I'm a biased in my review since the only reason I bought the audio version of this novel was for the narrator, actor Gary Cole. I first became a fan of his work when I saw the dark (and since cancelled) show American Gothic, and was pleased to hear his hypnotic, southern drawl again in this book. He really is an incredable, versitile actor, but the novel itself was so-so. The intrigue and fear (and even the violence) came alive with Cole's spoken words, but I was dissapointed with the ending. After four-and-a-half hours of building excitement, the final scenes were a bit too tidy to fit in with the tone of the novel. Still, if anyone out there would like to hear a great southern drawl by a veteran actor, I'd highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"I was enjoying the book until I came to a place where all the power was out at this rural farm and the characters took long hot showers and baths. Water may be possible during a power outage in the city, but does not happen in rural areas. This distracted me from the story, making me feel that the author hadn't done her homework."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"I've never listened to an audiobook read by Gary Cole, and I was very impressed by his performance. However, I have to agree with many other reviewers and say that, beyond Cole, this book is nothing special. Yes, it's violent, but that didn't surprise or upset me. Characters like Cecil, Carl and Myron are violent and ugly. It wasn't the sex that bothered me, either. Instead, it was the ending. I didn't believe a single word pertaining to Jack's &quot;real identity.&quot; I wish Brown had taken greater care in crafting a finish to her book."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"This is a good suspense-filled book; however, for my taste it had too much violence. The graphic violence reminded me of watching the T.V. news. Personally, I prefer to read for entertainment and enjoyment and although the story itself was very good, I dreaded the chapters filled with blood and killing. I love contemporary romance, but for me the romance was overpowered by the murder."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"This book was good. MUCH better than Exclusive and Fat Tuesday. Jack and Anna are fabulous in this book as are the other characters. I recommend this to people who don't like Heavy romance novels. It was part romance, part mystery. A perfect book in my eyes. I read it in 3 days!!!!!"},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"I enjoyed reading this book, unlike many others who have commented. Ms. Brown's books are usually good &quot;beach reads&quot; but one can forecast how the tale will end after the first chapter if not sooner. I think Unspeakable shows growth in her style and in the fact that life is not so predictible nor are people always so beautiful, perfect,kind, friendly nor goals as easily attainable as a book's heroes seem to find."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"The plot could have been interesting but I found myself wishing the book would end....it was boring and poorly written. I am not a fan of Romance books and perhaps this is why I find Ms. Brown's style so dull. Most romance novels are rubbish, in my humble opinion. Ms. Brown is trying to break away from romance novels. Let's hope her writing style improves."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"UNSPEAKABLE turned out to a good book that provided a romance different from SANDRA BROWN'S other novels. Some reviews almost kept me from buying the book. But I was surprised to find that it was hard to put down, once the mystery character, JACK SAWYER, enters the story. The violence of the HERBOLD brothers wasn't too graphic, but was realistic to show the forthcoming danger for ANNA CORBETT. The story builds to a showdown that proves to be an excitng climax, which some surprising twists."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"This is a unique and engrossing story, which combines a heartfelt love story with the mystery of an old murder and the impending arrival of a killer. While the story is told alternately from several points of view, it is really Jack who becomes the central character. His hidden connection to all the stories which are playing themselves out holds the tale together. Jack's romance with Anna is touching. They are two very wounded people who heal themselves by loving each other, and who find that words aren't necessary. Their attraction is immediately apparent, but their relationship develops slowly enough to be believable and absorbing. Meanwhile, Ezzy continues this theme of searching and healing in his obsession with solving an old crime. He feels guilt for not having given Patsy justice, and can find redemption only in knowing the truth about her death. Carl is a truly chilling villain, whose blood lust and complete disregard for human life makes him unpredictable. When! he arrives in Blewer, he brings to the surface all of the fear and guilt which the characters have lived with for so many years. It forces everything to a head, and brings about the salvation of all the main characters. This tale has many strong dramatic elements, and has a highly stylized sense of place. It is propelled by strong, interesting characters who create absorbing stories within the larger plot. So it isn't great literature... but it is still compelling and enjoyable."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"As a newcomer to Sandra Brown (having read Fat Tuesday and Exclusive) I had high hopes for this new release. Unfortunately, I was sadly disappointed. It took forever to &quot;set the stage&quot; and the thrill and excitement I had seen in her previous books was lacking here. Character development could have been better or at least more pointed.If this had been my first Sandra Brown I probably would not have gone back for more."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"After reading the reviews, I thaught I would give it a shot, and I just finished it and most of the reviews didn't even compare to the book. A lot say its disgusting and boring, its definetly not boring, theres all sorts of surprises exspecially at the ending, the ending is great, its where most of the book comes to gether. I'll admit the biggening is a little slow, but after 100 pages your into the book, its like you got to keep reading to see what happens, and it worth it. So if your worried its to gory, I'll say this much, you probably see worse stuff on TV. As for the rape and murder, that stuffs notr even detailed, its just like some one died and thats that. No details about it. Thats what I was curiuse about from the beginng, I was expecting more details after reading the reviews, but there weren't hardly any. So if you think this is gory, I dont suggest Breath Of Scadel."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"I had a good time reading this book and especially enjoyed the surprise ending. I thought the character development was well-done also, especially considering how many characters there were in the story. Not for those with a weak stomach, though, as some of the details are a bit graphic!"},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"A good looking drifter,Jack Sawyer comes looking for work at the ranch of Delray Corbett and his deaf-mute, widowed daughter-in-law, Anna.Delray is stepfather to two psycopathic killers,Carl and Cecil, one of whom has just escaped from prison and is bent on revenge for Delrays refusal to shield him from the law. The crimes committed by these brothers and Myron,Carls fellow prison escapee, are as the title of the book says-unspeakably cruel and sadistic. After a series of shocking murders, the killers set their sights on the Corbetts and eventually hold them captive.A retired sheriff who has been obsessed by a horrific sex murder arrributed to Carl, becomes closely involved and together with Jack Sawyer, Manages to prevent the murder of Anna and her small son.This is a gripping story peopled by some truly terrifying and totally vile people that one would like to think couldn't exist but unfortunately do !!!"},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"While I remain a devoted fan of Sandra Brown's, I was hoping for 'UNSPEAKABLE' to concentrate more on Anna and Jack, than I was about the twisted, and perverse highjinks of the Herbold brothers. Still, the story was a deep and powerful one, and Ms. Brown painted for her readers, very clear and concise pictures of her characters. Her villianous siblings were two low-life's you just could'nt help wishing evil things on! And of course she has us rooting all the while , that true love will conquer all. While it may not be her best or most romantic book, it's well worth the read ; as are all Sandra Brown novels."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"Having read all of Sandra Brown's books and enjoying them, I was total disappointed with Unspeakable. I can't believe Sandra Brown wrote this trash. After reading the first twenty pages I knew this book was not for me. I forced myself to read 75 pages thinking it would get better. . .WRONG! I gave the book away just to get it out of my house, that's how bad it was. It was on the edge of being porno material. Don't waste your time and money!"},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"I love Sandra Brown. I can't wait until her next book comes out. This story was boring. Hardly any romance. I was more interested in the bad guys than the good guys. I hated the way she had the retired sherriff in the story. He could have been left out. It could have been a great story if she wrote it different. I didn't like how the story ended. Very disapointed . It won't stop me from reading another book from her. She is one of the best romance writers out there."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"I have never thrown a book out before, but with this one, I felt the only thing to do it justice was the garbage can. I have read every one of Sandra Brown's books and was very disappointed in the subject matter and disgusted with the darkness in this novel. I thought better of her. I may not ever read another book by her."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"I agree with the reviewer from Texas..I have read ALL of Sandra Brown's books and this one was a real disappointment. I found as I read more and more about Carl, Cecil, and the gang, I did not even want to pick it up because I knew I would read in detail how they killed their next victims. This was a very dark and violent book and nothing like what I am used to by Sandra Brown. All I can say is that had I not waited for the paperbook version to come out, I would have been very irked at spending that much money on such a disappointing book from my favorite author."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"I have read almost all of Sandra Brown's books (this is not an exaggeration!), and I was really disappointed with this one. I realize that she is evolving as a writer, and I'm guessing that she is trying to expand her horizons above and beyond the usual romance novel for which she is so well known. However, this book left this reader glad that many of her earlier works are coming out in paperback at the grocery store! I am not saying that the book was terrible. I was entertained, which is pretty important, but there was something missing. I usually can't put her books down, but this one was more of a chore to read. For the die-hard romance reader, I don't think there was enough romance. I know it's possible for her to write a romance novel with some substance. She's done it before with books like Exclusive and French Silk. Those may not be the best examples, but I think they get the point across. After reading Fat Tuesday and Unspeakable, I get the feeling that Sandra Brown is trying to get away from the romance element that made her so popular. I hope her next one is better, or she may be losing a lot of readers!"},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"Unspeakable was my first read of author, Sandra Brown. Her writing skill is definitely fine and well crafted. The characters, deaf widow, Anna Corbett, the ranch hand hero, Jack Sawyer and the nasty cruel killer Carl Herbold are well developed as are other minor characters. I could see and hear them. My uncertainty was the story itself. It is a suspenseful murder (most not easy to read in detail) while it is a love/romance story, which was a surprise to me. There are quite descriptive sex scenes, another surprise. I thought the story was \\"fluffed\\" with too many details about Anna and also her son, six-year-old David and Jack's growing relationship. That part took over the detective work and then the detective work interrupted the budding romance between Anna and Jack. As I started the review with a praise for Ms. Brown's writing skill, I will end it with the same and will try another of her books because of it."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"This was my first Sandra Brown novel. The first few chapters were s-l-o-w. This book did not hold my interest and I found myself reading this book only when I was using the bathroom."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"I have read many of her books and really liked them. But this book really surprised me. It was really sad in a way it was also really violent and I have never read any books of hers where they were that violent and had that much bad language. But I did like the love story that went along with it. And the villan of the book was also very good but it was to violent for my liking."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"When Delray Corbett discovers that his stepson Carol Herbold has escaped from prison, he's concerned that he might venture back to Texas. He reluctantly hires drifter Jack Sawyer, who has his own agenda, as further protection for his deaf daughter-in-law Anna and grandson David. Newly retired sheriff Ezzy is trying to solve the decades old murder of town harlot Patsy. Everyone in town assumes it was the Herbold brothers - he was just never able to prove it. His obsession with the case wreaks havoc on his marriage. As Jack spends more time with the Corbett family, he feels a sense of family that he has never had as well as a deep attraction to Anna. When tragedy strikes the family, Jack is there to help Anna cope, learning her language and providing a strong shoulder. As the Herbold brothers venture south to Mexico, a side trip to the East Texas town for retribution with Delray on the agenda. Will Jack be able to protect his new \\"family?\\"Brown manages to give a voice to Anna, and provides plenty of chemistry between her leads, but the story is told in excruciating detail; she could easily peel away 100pages and it still would be far too long. Carl is one of her more menacing and unredeemable characters. He is evil incarnate, and not above proving it from chapter to chapter. \\"Unspeakable\\" is a pretty average novel (and a little disappointing for fans of Browns later novels); recommended only for true Brown fans that want to read her full library of offerings."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"This is my first book by Sandra Brown, I picked it up after reading the synopsis on the back cover. I became immediately enthralled in the book and enjoyed it until the very end, wondering who the killer was. I'll admit though, about 3/4ths of the way through I had a guess, and it was correct. That's kind of cool though.Ok, I've read several reviews on this book that I am very disappointed with. I don't know if they are coming from people who have weak stomach's or what, but their comments are a little off base to me. I did not feel that this book was too gory or that it was overboard in the scenes. Sure the descriptions were down the tee, but isn't that what you want when you're reading a book? Do you honestly think that when you pick up a murder mystery book that some blood and gore are out of place? Isn't that what murder is? I just think it's unfair for those comments to deter people from reading this book that I thought was a great read."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"I gave it 2 stars because it kept my interest right up to the end. However, I'm starting to think the people who write these thrillers have a contest going to see who can come up with the most nauseatingly sadistic killers. I'm not exactly a wimp, but I had to skip over large chunks of the book to avoid reading the hidiously detailed rape and murder scenes. I cannot believe a woman could write about a 14-year old girl getting raped and sodomized just to &quot;jazz up&quot; her book. That's really low. It made me think, &quot;Anything for a buck, I guess.&quot; Anyhow, it did keep me reading to the end but the disgusting language and violence made me wonder what kind of person Sandra Brown is."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"When Jack Sawyer showed up at her family's Brewer County, Texas ranch looking for work, Anna Corbett didn't know what to think about him. From the moment they met, he didn't treat her like everyone else did. She was used to the treatment she received as a hearing impaired woman. She was also a widow with a young son living with her father in law, Delray. She was unused to a man like Jack. He enjoyed being around her son David acting like a father figure, and even went so far as to start learning sign language so they could communicate more effectively. While Anna suspected he was at the ranch to provide protection from Cecil and Carl Herbold, she found his presence comforting.Jack was a man on a mission. He sought out Delray looking for a job as soon as he heard Carl Herbold had escaped from prison. Since he blamed Delray for his incarceration, and promised retribution, it was only a matter of time until he came calling. Jack planned to be there when he did. He hadn't planned on liking David, or the intense attraction between he and Anna. He owed Delray, and would do whatever it took to ensure the safety of them all.This was a good exciting story. I always appreciate the detailed intricacies and the complicated characters SB creates. Carl Herbold is the devil incarnate! I couldn't find a redeemable quality to him at all. Jack has not led a perfect life, but he becomes devoted to Anna and David, putting their safety and happiness before his own. We also get a glimpse into the life Anna has led, and into the world she lives in. Enjoyable read!"},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"I just finished Unspeakable. Let me just say that I love Sandra Brown. I think she writes the best books I have ever written. In fact, I think she's brilliant! With that said, let me also say that I loved Unspeakable. But please be warned - this book is very violent. The good part and people of this story are very, very good, very loving and wonderful. I loved it so much that I couldn't stop reading for a second. However, the bad people in this story - are very, very bad and very violent. It's hard to take. Again though, I loved this story and would recommend it.I usually share all my books with my 85 year old mother and a 35 year old friend. I will let me 35 year old friend read it and I think she will love it too. However, I will not be passing this one on to my 85 year old mother. Even though she also adores Sandra Brown books. I think the violent parts of this book will be too much for her.Sandra Brown books that I, my 35 year old friend and my 85 year old mother have loved and adored:EnvyMirror ImageThe WitnessBreath of ScandalFrench SilkCharadeFat TuesdaySlow Heat in HeavenThe SwitchActually, they're hasn't been one Sandra Brown Book that I haven't loved.Sandra Brown - you go girl and keep them coming!"},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"Good because it's Sandra Brown, but gory, vulgar and it vaguely reminded me of the movie starring Jane Wyman: \\"Johnny Belinda\\".Sandra's written some really great books, but this one was too violent and descriptive of the rape scenes for me. As a woman author, she could've toned it down a little. We get the idea; no need to elaborate."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"This is her second I have read and I really enjoy Mrs. Brown's writing. She has an amazing talent for including crime, passion, betrayal, and so much more. Her attention to detail is wonderful, I felt like I could actually see the whole book as a movie."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"I'm a fan of Sandra Brown's, believe it or not. I've probably given her as man one-star or two-star ratings as anyone else. For sure, she tells it like it is, and although some of her detail description gets to be too much, one has to back up and think about it. Hey, that's the way it is in the real world and that's the way most hardened criminals talk and think. I found no offense in this because once I got to the theme of where she was going, it was what I expected. I think SB has written some really wonderful books, this just isn't one of her best. BUT, on the other hand, it isn't one of her worst either. The characters are strong and well-defined and I kept wondering how in the world she would ever tie Jack Sawyer to all of this as to why he came back to protect Anna Corbett from the Herbold brothers. And the mystery surrounding Patsy McCorkle's death had me wondering what in the world too. I gave this book a three because that's what I thought it was...average."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"I have been a Sandra Brown fan and have read quite a few of her books. But I have to say \\"Unspeakable\\" really is not good and not worth the time to read it. The first 1/3 of the book developed slowly and lacked the building of suspense to keep me engaged. The whole plot in general was boring and disjointed. I really liked that she created a main character that was deaf but strong, caring, and intelligent. However, the whole book was just not an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"This is anexcellent book. It gives the reader insight into the world of a deaf individual. The plot moves along swiftly and is a real page turner."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"While i was reading the book The Unspeakable, i couldn't put it down. The book grabbed my attention, and it kept it. As soon as I finished one pagei couldn't wait to rad the next. Unspeakable is a major page turner. The only thing that really bugged me about this book was the way that intead of focusing on Jack and Anna, it kept going back to the Herbold brothers and the policeman. I really wish that it would have focused on one main person at a time. After a while of reading i got a little confused as to what chapter was about who until it showed someone talking, and who it was that was talking at the time."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"During the past 2 months, I have read 6 of Sandra Brown's romantic/thrillers and have become a big fan. This is the first time I have written a review. Unspeakable was harder for me to get through than Witness, French Silk, etc. It's a little darker and the character development is often slow. Carl was really evil and some of the crimes were pretty gross. The romance between Anna and Jack developed slowly and sweetly and finally reached a great crescendo! I appreciate that SB gave us some insight into the challenges of the hearing impaired and I loved the way that Anna and Jack communicated. This book is still worth reading, but not as satisfying as most of her other novels in the same genre."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"Very excellent read! Was on the edge of my seat! I love all of Sandra Brown's books and this work really proves that she is a great author with the ability to make you want to keep on reading until the very end. I will admit that some parts were a bit graphic, but that just shows that she is not afraid to overstep a few boundaries and try something different. I admire her talents for writing suspense/thriller/romance works. This really makes her worthy of the &quot;bestseller&quot; title."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"I have read most of Sandra Brown's books and this is one of her better ones. The plot continues to twist and turn until the end. Although the story line is a bit far fetched,it's a good summer beach read!"},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"Sandra Brown writes suspenceful books that interweive romance and mystry.

This truffle is great escape. No, it's not high literature, but the story is interesting.

He did it very well!Whew, I don't know if listening to this title was wise, especially at bedtime. I was expecting a suspenseful romance, but what I heard was a violent, intense-filled tale of cruelty, revenge and murder with two evil prison escapees named Carl and Myron. I cringed each time the narrator, Mr. Cole, read their parts. Carl is seeking revenge on a family and on his way he leaves a trail of terror, sorrow and murder. A father, a (deaf) daughter-in-law and her son know they may be in danger; their choice is to face it head on, but not without some losses along the way. A drifter finds himself drawn to the family ranch and the deaf daughter-in-law. A retired Sheriff, Ezzy, who wife just left him due to his obsession of a twenty-year old murder, decides to help out. Both Ezzy and the reader will find the old murder following them throughout the present day story.An Un-abridged version of this story is available. I found the abridge version left out some of the points explaining the deaf character's deafness."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"Hats off to Sandra Brown!

I was not disappointed. I found the book to be very morbid and sadistic, with a good story line. As one reader stated &quot;Very sick Characters&quot;. However, the ending left a lot to be desired. The ending really makes the difference between a good story, and a story that has the potential to be good."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"This is my first Sandra Brown book so the people that say this is her worst book I am definitily have to read more of hers.

Most folks figure that Carl probably killed other people besides the one he was convicted for, including that of a young woman over two decades ago. Fear grips the entire region because where Carl goes, blood flows.Drifter Jack Sawyer arrives looking for work at an East Texas cattle ranch. Living on the spread is a deaf widow, Anna Corbett, and her five year old son and father-in-law. Even though Jack and Anna are attracted to one another, Jack has an agenda of his own. He just did not drift into East Texas by coincidence. Could there be a tie-in between Jack and the arrival of Carl and is that tie somehow through Anna?UNSPEAKABLE is typical Sandra Brown: solar heat mixed with bursting levels of tension and suspense. The lead protagonists are an intriguing couple struggling with both the demons of the past and the horrors of the present. The villain and his moronic partner are amoral caricatures of evil, who are so bad they become more of a joke than the personification of fear.. Still, in spite of this flaw, Ms. Brown's latest romantic suspense will please her myriad of fans and anyone who enjoys a hot Texas intrigue.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"I've never read Sandra Brown before this book and never will again.

Still grieving for her deceased husband, Anna lives on an ailing farm with her step-father and young son. The community accepts her for doing the right thing by her family, but aren't entirely comfortable with her deafness or her living arrangements. Her family is a living reminder of old crimes and of evil that was born and raised in the town.Delray Corbett always knew that his two stepsons, Cecil and Carl, would look him up one day. It has been enough for this stern man that he can provide for his grandson and the woman he has grown to love despite himself. Delray always thought the two men had managed to get away with a more serious crime than the one that they were put inside for, armed robbery. The unsolved murder of a local girl stirred up talk at the time, and it still does. Retiring police chief Ezzy Hardge is still unable to let it go. It was the one case that stayed with him, and it has finally caused the end of his marriage too. He suspects immediately the new hired hand that Delray has taken on, the mysterious Jack Sawyer. Maybe old Delray is just a cautious man. Carl and Cecil are now both on the loose, and it's a pretty sure thing that they are headed right home to exact a little familial revenge.\\"Unspeakable\\" is a book at odds. The odd, startling snippets of graphic violence and sex don't seem to fit in with the rest of the novel. There's a whole host of characters, all of which are sadly stereotypical, with their own little agendas but none of them are explored in sufficient depth for the curious reader. The heroine is plucked straight out of a women's romantic drama along with her man and the tragic plight she finds herself in. There's little mystery and the action only hots up in the very last pages of this reasonably hefty novel. Sandra Brown is a best selling author of suspense thrillers but from this read, her market aim would seem to be way off. No one objects to a plot worthy romance, but the saccharine sweet offerings in \\"Unspeakable\\" are pretty well summed up in the title. Amiable reading but nothing to get excited about."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"I have read some of the other reviews and I noticethat a lot of those people really need to get out.Just because there are maybe 2 or 3 graphic parts doesn't mean you should just give up on a wonderful book.

I'm sure she had her doubts and it doesn't really helpto have people be disgusted on someone elses pointof view. This will definately go on my shelf amongmy other favorite books."},{"Title":"Unspeakable","review":"I too Love Sandra Brown.

There are so many stories to follow and so many characters to keep straight. It was very dry and very bla. I did not enjoy it AT ALL. The end is meant to throw you off, but it only left me flat.

I'm glad I bought the paperback version. And I will have to agree with the reader from Rochester Minnesota, this book goes in the garbage.

She returns home to Maraville, Mississippi to visit her former foster mother, Maddie Oglethorpe. Both good and bad memories fill her mind and heart - when she was last home, she and her foster sisters, Eliza and Jo, were split up without explanations and told never to contact each other again. In the previous book, Eliza found her foster sister April in Paris, and asked her to return home because Maddie had suffered a major stroke and needed their help.April never expected to come home again, and didn't expect to discover she had missed being there. She does have an agenda - she wants to find her biological parents. While Eliza and Jo were from broken homes, April had been given up as a baby and was never told who her parents were. She believes she was born in Maraville. Jack Palmer, a CNN reporter on medical leave, helps her trace where she was born. Slowly but surely, they unravel the mystery of her birth mother.Jack's career as a CNN reporter may be over. He was injured in Iraq, and is recuperating in Maraville.

LoftonI enjoyed this book as much as I enjoyed the first in the series.

I am looking forward to the final in the trilogy."},{"Title":"Quick As a Cricket","review":"This book, \\"Quick as a Cricket\\" is a MUST, along withThe Little Mouse, The Red Ripe Strawberry, and The Big Hungry Bearalso by Don & Audrey Woods. These titles have been in my library since my children were toddlers (now in their late 20's), and I buy them as a baby gift anytime a friend is having their first baby or grand baby. Both titles absolutely captivate the children, from as early as 10 mos on. (You have to get the hard copy, the pictures are GORGEOUS, so you'll want the full effect). Without fail I have heard back from everyone that these are their child's favorite books (with \\"The Little Mouse, the Red Ripe Strawberry and the Big Hungry Bear\\" coming in first). These even stop my now 13 1/2 mos old grand son in his tracks (who stops for nothing and has been on the RUN ever since he started walking at 9mos) - He even gets these books out himself and plops down in mom's lap to read - my daughter, even though these were her favorites too, is absolutely AMAZED at the effect they have on her little Hurricane! You can't go wrong with either of these books! Remember to get the hard copies, not the board books or paperbacks."},{"Title":"Quick As a Cricket","review":"I used to read this to my kids.

I used the book with Visual Cafe 3.0 and found the examples would not compile and all the examples incorrect for the versions 2.5 and 3.0 of Visual Cafe. The book is now a source for Java but almost useless for Visual Cafe. I think it is imperative that the publishers list the version of Visual Cafe the book was written for.

The smarts I got from this book primarily with several others as references allowed me to use VCJDDE 2.5 to do prototypes that totally impressed the powers that be at my job. Sure there's some problems and errors, but most of them are because I was using 2.5 and the book was written for 2.0. But hey, it makes you explore the code and flex your problem-solving muscles. Bottom line: Take a cheapie class at the community college, buy the software (hopefully you can expense it), and BUY THIS BOOK!! Just make sure your shop's on an NT platform, because all the database middleware doo-dads don't go anyplace else. A bit of advice: The software has a 30-day moneyback deal going, so you can buy it, learn it, demo it, and expense it. So suggest putting some of your existing processes that rely upon MS Access or Excel for record keeping on the Intranet. This tool can create a basic &quot;look at the data&quot; interface for about any database in about 10 minutes, which you demo to whoever's in charge of the ISO900x/SEICMM effort, and that is that.

From the comments in the source code, most examples seem to have been tested on VC2.0 even though the publication date is as recent as Feb or March 98. I think anyone who's contemplating spending close-to-thirty-five bucks on this book should be warned that Symantec came out with version 2.5 of the DDE in March, which has some signifiant changes in the database aspect, especially the fact that Symantec's own high-level JDBC API can be used besides the DBAnywhere API for RAD DB Development. This is significant since it doesn't tie one down to the WIN32 platform by being forced to use DBAnywhere. Besides this unforgivable deception, the book is well written with some good discussion of inter-applet communication, applet distribution, testing on a LAN etc. HOWEVER, for version 2.0, I strongly recommend the Teach Yourself in 21 Days book by Cohn over this one because it's database discussion, though not as lengthy, is very well constructed.

Jim wonders when he will learn to read. His holistic teacher points out to him that he is already reading many things such as familiar books, classroom signs and so on. As young children enjoy reading (or listening) about Jim's exploration, they also are learning about reading and what it means to be a reader. This book helps children understand that reading is developmental and depends on the social context. A great book for Pre-K to 1st graders. I use it with a unit called &quot;I Can Read&quot; that helps children appreciate their early reading abilities. Also a good choice for older children who are working with young readers as reading buddies or partners. This book is also a good choice for open house or parent meetings- to help anxious first grade parents to relax. If you haven't read any of the other books in this series, check them out too!"},{"Title":"When Will I Read?","review":"There is one section of this book that makes it not appropriate for any age. There is a part where a child's doll \\"baby would not be quiet\\". And the child said \\"Oh, this is a bad baby. He needs to be washed.\\" It continues with \\"And she began to wash her baby very hard\\". OMG! What is that about???? This book is now in the shredder and should be removed from circulation...unless it can be re-released without this atricous part. How can anyone recommend a book that puts those kinds of thoughts in a child's head? Was this really OK in 1977 (when the book was released)?

John wrote this classic while in prison. He went to prison for preaching the gospel."},{"Title":"Grace abounding to the chief of sinners & The life & death of Mr. Badman, (Everyman's library. Theology & philosophy)","review":"One of my favorite books is \\"Pilgrim's Progress\\" by John Bunyan. I just finished reading Bunyan's autobiography called \\"Grace Abounding To The Chief Of Sinners,\\" so now I cannot wait to read Pilgrim's Progress again!John Bunyan's autobiography is almost solely focused around how he became a Christian, and then how he defended himself against the Church of England after he became a follower of Jesus Christ.At times Bunyan's account of his struggle with his self-doubts about whether God would ever receive a sinner such as himself are absolutely heart-wrenching. He clung so desperately to the Scriptures that said God wanted to forgive him, and yet beat himself up with other Scriptures that talked about the vileness of sin. He felt that his sin had so wounded God, that he was unsure if he could ever be forgiven.In a way, I found this quite refreshing. It reminded me of Dietrich Bonhoeffer's warning against \\"cheap grace,\\" where far too many people trivialize the high price Christ paid on the Cross. But John Bunyan acutely felt his sin.So once he finally received God's forgiveness, he was a changed man who wanted to tell the world about his Savior. Unfortunately for the time in which he lived, his message of salvation wasn't \\"sanctioned\\" by the Church of England, which landed him in jail for over a decade. The second-half of his autobiography is a play-by-play account of his interaction with the judges who tried and sentenced him. In this account, we read the words of a man who thoroughly knew Scripture, and knew how to use it!It's a fascinating biography, which I think any reader will enjoy."},{"Title":"Grace abounding to the chief of sinners & The life & death of Mr. Badman, (Everyman's library. Theology & philosophy)","review":"What a profound revelation is encapsulated in this autobiographical account! Like so many millions, I had read Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress and been captivated by the allegory, chock full of theology delivered in a pleasing form, and could not forget Evangelist, Mr. Worldly Wisdom, the Interpreter, Hypocrisy, Watchful, Faithful, Talkative, Hopeful, and Ignorance even after one reading. The driving force behind this classic work, however, is Bunyan's faith, tested, true, and God-given. But Bunyan's own journey from a restless faith to one which which found safe harbor in grace is beautifully told in this small book.Here he tells us how he came to see himself not just in the light of the Law but the Gospel and this realization of \\"grace abounding\\" sets him free to live for Christ. Here is the man behind the tale, and both are well worth the attention."},{"Title":"Grace abounding to the chief of sinners & The life & death of Mr. Badman, (Everyman's library.

Theology & philosophy)","review":"A roller-coaster of belief and doubt surges through this fascinating little work. The book serves as a unique spiritual and autobiographical window into the soul of one of history's most fascinating saints. Throughout the work, Bunyan shows the reader how a little doubt, once entertained, will drag the believer into a spiral of unbelief. Bunyan's doubt came from brash comments and thoughts (finding their source in a life of profanity prior to coming to Christ), and the seed, once planted, grew into a giant tree of doubt and despair that overshadowed his life for months and years. Like \\"Christian\\" in Pilgrim's Progress, the reader follows Bunyan's journey out of Doubting Castle and out of the hands of Giant Despair. Only through the key of Promise (the promise of salvation by faith apart from works through the propitiation of Jesus Christ) given to him from the beginning of his Christian journey, is Bunyan able to secure release from his cell. The amazing journey is nonetheless frustrating to the reader, but it is that frustration, that journey, that progress, which shaped the writer, and the Pilgrim, ofThe Pilgrim's Progress."},{"Title":"Grace abounding to the chief of sinners & The life & death of Mr. Badman, (Everyman's library. Theology & philosophy)","review":"Amazing book.

Theology & philosophy)","review":"I could scarcely imagine why this book turned up first on my page of recommendations from amazon. I checked the reasoning, using the convenient little clicker, and found that Bunyan was expected to appeal to me because I had reviewed \\"Gosta Berling's Saga.\\" That, my friends, is firm evidence that computers are still short on intuition.Fascinated, however, I read the eight reviews of this fairly obscure title, and found that they were all written by sincere believers in the strict Calvinist theology preached by John Bunyan in his lifetime, according to which we are all \\"sinners in the hands of an angry God\\" whose judgment passes our apprehension. According the Calvin and Bunyan, our 'works' and even our eagerness to be 'saved' is of no fundamnetal importance; as one reviewer writes, \\"we do not choose God; God chooses us.\\" That's not a system of belief I find appealing, though I ought to be consoled by the idea that God might 'choose' me whether I like it or not.Bunyan was a cogent writer, though his style takes acclimatization. This biography is a major document of English history, as sure a way to get a feel for bookish English Puritanism as the masques of Henry Purcell are for the other side, the party of the theater-loving Cavaliers. As such, it belongs on the shelf with other profound self-exposures - Augustine's, Cellini's, Rousseau's - but don't expect the man to be any more attractive than his fanatical faith.

The message itself is excellent but you really have to struggle to hang in there as it's not so much the verbiage that it's written in (I sorta like it), it's how he expounds deeply on every single time he realizes something. I would recommend making sure you have time to read and absorb it."},{"Title":"Grace abounding to the chief of sinners & The life & death of Mr. Badman, (Everyman's library.

What I was not prepared for was the depth he described his struggles with sin and the time that led up to his actual conversion. Yet, even after his conversion, his struggles did not end. He even goes into detail over his encounter with his judges and jailors who imprisoned him for what the crown deemed to be illegal meetings that were being conducted outside of the established state church (and his abject refusal to comply with the Book of Common Prayer). There is even an account of his wife trying to secure his release from prison along with a postscript from editors who attested to his character and the fruits of the Spirit that were evident in him.I would definitely recommend this book. Readers should be able to relate to what Bunyan went through. We are all born in original sin, and Bunyan is certainly no exception to this."},{"Title":"Grace abounding to the chief of sinners & The life & death of Mr. Badman, (Everyman's library. Theology & philosophy)","review":"A lot of us are familiar with John Bunyan as the author of The Pilgrim's Progress, whose influence in Christendom is second to the Bible. Bunyan was a preacher, a prolific writer and a shining saint for God. However when we read this book we find out that he was an atheist and infidel in his youth, enjoying sin and rebellious towards God. Inwardly he suffered from tormented nightmares of demons and judgment, but outwardly he went on pretty much as any other sinner, taking delight in sin and being the ringleader of mischief. Several times he nearly lost his life, and even though there were several close calls, still he did not turn to God. After his marriage, he participated in religious activities, went through the motions of attending church and generally lived as he pleased, each time successfully shrugging off pangs of guilt. One day, after church, while playing a sport, a voice seemed to call out to him from heaven to his soul, which said, &quot;Wilt thou leave thy sins and go to heaven, or have thy sins and go to hell?&quot; Bunyan was convinced it was the Lord Jesus looking down on him in displeasure. What follows details his sinking into despair, his desparate attempts at working his way into God's good graces, and his struggles with temptation and doubt. In a strange sort of way, it is comforting to read about Bunyan's struggles and identify with them because you can see how he turned out so greatly used by God. He rationalized, made excuses and tried every way to justify himself. Bunyan did not try to gloss over his motivations but gave an honest account of his struggles from avowed sinner, to religious hypocrite before he was finally converted. He describes in great detail his doubts and despair, his yearning to be converted to Jesus Christ, and then being assured of his salvation by reading the Bible and praying. Reading this book will help you realize how God's grace can abound and save even the most wretched of sinners and gives us abounding hope."},{"Title":"Grace abounding to the chief of sinners & The life & death of Mr. Badman, (Everyman's library.

When I first read his story, I grabbed a pen and filled the margins, and all the while my heart whispered, &quot;Comrade!&quot; At once, I was comforted by the realization that though Bunyan was long gone, there had been another human being who had known the same fearsome battles waged on our behalf by the God who never relinquishes what belongs to Him. Those years when I had felt strange and apart from other believers, suddenly became &quot;safe&quot; to recall. For anyone who is still holding on to the arrogant belief that a person chooses God, rather than the other way around, Bunyan's story is for you. It puts all arguments to rest, leaving only humility and worship in its wake."},{"Title":"Grace abounding to the chief of sinners & The life & death of Mr. Badman, (Everyman's library.

Theology & philosophy)","review":"I've been looking forward to reading this book for years ever since I read Bunyan's classis Pilgrim's Progress, I've wanted to read Grace Abounding to learn more about his incredible man of faith. I also recently read The Hidden Smile of God by John Piper who introduces the reader to three incredible men of God including Bunyan. So actually reading the journey of Bunyan himself in his own words was thrilled...but difficult at the same time. Bunyan struggled greatly with the concept of grace; he wrestled with understanding how God's grace could be sufficient to save a sinner as great as he. Grace Abounding is a peering into the soul of Bunyan as he goes through this deep personal battle wanting to believe that God was able to cleanse him of all unrighteousness, but constantly confronted with the holiness of the divine.Just over half way through the book, Bunyan surrenders to the will of God in his life. He finally and fully grasp that the grace of God was truly sufficient. Then his heart is set aflame to share this grace with others and he becomes one of the great preachers and writers of all time, even though he goes on to spend a dozen years confined to prison for preaching contrary to the teachings of the Catholic Church. Personally, it was interesting to see the cultural battle Bunyan faced at the time looking back from my vantage 500 years later to see that America is the beneficiary of his great struggles with the prevailing church of the day. As Bunyan sat in prison, he wrote about the great journey from a metal worker to a pastor of the gospel of Christ - in allegory form for the Pilgrim's Progress and in autobiographical form in Grace Abounding.I can understand why many believe this book is a classic - the thoughts and insights that Bunyan has into the Word of God were profound and significant. It was amazing to read how Scripture flowed through his mind irrigating every thought so that his life bore much fruit. I wouldn't recommend the book to a younger reader, it is a difficult read, but well worth the effort."},{"Title":"Grace abounding to the chief of sinners & The life & death of Mr. Badman, (Everyman's library. Theology & philosophy)","review":"If Bunyan were alive today and examined by a psychiatrist, they would say he was struggling with Obsessive Compulsive disorder. This book chronicles his wrestling with his own mind, his own fears, his own anxieties. This is not to say that his battle is not also spiritual, for indeed it is that.His fear is that he has lost his chance at salvation by cursing Jesus, somehow committing an unpardonable sin. No matter how many times he comforts himself with the truth, it seems to be pulled away from him by other fears.Ultimately he determines that even if he is thrown into hell, he will still honor Jesus. Eventually, he is freed from this mental torment after a couple of years.I was helped greatly by this book when in a period of intense anxiety in my own life. It was a great help to know that someone else went through similar things. I have also recommended this book to many who are currently struggling with anxiety.It is said that before using a man greatly, God breaks him. Bunyan's dark night of the soul is here recorded. God would bring him to great weakness and then later use him greatly. This book is worth your money and time.One side note: the book is written in a style of English that is dated. You can still follow it, but it takes a little work."},{"Title":"Grace abounding to the chief of sinners & The life & death of Mr. Badman, (Everyman's library.

OK, I've been able to get it for years, but never for this cheap. $3.50 at a used bookstore in Royal Oak, MI. There it was, just sitting quietly on the shelf. So innocent, so unassuming. Lime green cover fading from either over use or neglect. I picked up the 10 books on top of it and pulled it out carefully. A modern English version too?! Score!So far it's both what I expected and filled with surprises. Because I love Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress I've heard a lot of folks make mention of his autobiography and highly recommend it. They were right. It is good. It's an amazing chronicle of Bunyan's struggle and vacillation between trusting God's promises and believing Satan's accusations. It sheds some great light on his upbringing and life before being drawn to Christ. It speaks about his marriage, his exposure to other Christians and his favorite hobbies as a young man. What I did not expect to read was how long his struggle to believe and be assured he was in Christ actually drug on. He went back and forth between great hope and utter despair for almost 87 pages (in my copy). He reflects on this struggle and is encouraged by how the Lord used it to teach him great things that would stay with him the rest of his journey toward the heavenly city. I am also pleasantly surprised to find out how much of his personal experience was drawn upon to write the worlds most famous allegory, Pilgrim's Progress.The book was great, I finished it a few days ago.

Recommended to anyone who may be facing the same struggle with this question. Each paragraph of the text is numbered and, thus, it is easy to put the book down at any point and pick it back up later without losing train of thought.

Bunyan believes, early in the book, that he has lost his salvation and is surely doomed. Which one of us has not questioned this at one time or another? I have found his experiances, in more than one case, exactly mirror my own. Its encouraging to hear that a Christian of his calibre is struggling with the same things I am. Its been easy for me to think about the apostles and other Christian giants of the past, C.S. Lewis, John Bunyan, etc, to have realized the truth early and just cruised through life due to thier incredible morale courage. The truth is they struggled just as hard as we have and had to rely on God just as much as we do. This book demonstrates that fact well, at the same time giving encouragement to those of us who are struggling with the battle for our souls. This book is fairly dificult to read due to it s 17th century script, but taken slowly makes perfect sense.

This masterwork was written while Bunyan (1628-1688) was imprisoned for holding unlicensed church services and was published in 1666.Bunyan's eyes were opened to the wonder God's grace and Christ's imputed righteousness when he mused: \\"But one day, as I was passing in the field, and that too with some dashes on my conscience, fearing lest yet all was not right, suddenly this sentence fell upon my soul, Thy righteousness is in heaven; and methought withal, I saw, with the eyes of my soul, Jesus Christ at God's right hand; there, I say, as my righteousness; ..

I got the book &quot;Sight Without Glasses&quot; and followed the instructions for eye exercises. In 1940 I passed sthe eye exam with 20-20 vision and have never worn glasses. I still practice some of the exercises recommended by the author."},{"Title":"Sight without Glasses","review":"The author, Dr. Harold M. Peppeard makes it clear that strain, not genetics, is the cause for poor eyesight.The book gets right to the point without beating around the bush.I have the 1940 printing of this fine book (copyrighted in 1936 by Eye Health, Inc.). The author, Dr. Harold M. Peppard worked with Dr. Bates for several years before opening his own practice. The book takes the Bates method for improving vision and turns it into an easy to follow, understandable method for anyone to use.I first acquired the book as a teenager may years ago and tried to use it. However, as with anything else, it requires self-discipline to follow through with it, which I lacked at the time, and the distractions of life lured me away from following through with it completely.I have recently reread the book and am committed to using it until my eyesight is perfect again. Already after experimenting with the exercises, and more importantly the 3 habits for perfect sight, I have experienced improvement and only wear my corrective lenses when I absolutely have to. I've had corrective lenses for about 44 years now and yet there is still hope. According to Dr. Peppard's book it could take me 6-12 months to achieve my goal of perfect sight. This, however would be far better than continuing on having to wear corrective lenses the rest of my life.On thing I picked up from the book which I missed as a teenager were his brief references to the importance of getting the mind and eyes in sync with each other when it comes to practicing central fixation. We try to see everything at once instead of focusing on a small area at a time, which is how the eye is designed to see. Central fixation is one of the 3 habits of good eyesight which he discusses - blinking, shifting, and central fixation. These can be done throughout the day at any time.Unlike one method available on the internet (largely based on Bates) which claims you only need 15 minutes per day of eye exercises to improve your vision, Dr. Peppard seems to be more realistic in stating that the more you do the exercises, the more quickly you will recover your vision. He even recommends up to an hour per day of practicing the methods. That may seem hard for some people to find the time for that, but it does seem more honest to state that the amount of time you spend with it does matter. In this case, more is better.Dr. Peppard gives specific treatment regimens for specific eye problems including near-sightedness, far-sightedness, middle age sight, simple eye strain, astigmatism, cross-eyes, cataract, glaucoma, and inflamed eyes."},{"Title":"Sight without Glasses","review":"Great book.

Kinda a hard read but I like that sorta thing."},{"Title":"The Colonizer's Model of the World: Geographical Diffusionism and Eurocentric History","review":"James Blaut, a geographer at the University of Illinois at Chicago, is particularly known for his excellent refutations and polemics against Eurocentrism in economic history. This book, \\"The Colonizer's Model of the World\\", is the pinnacle of that oeuvre, together with its companion workEight Eurocentric Historians.The first and largest part of the book is devoted to refuting the mythology and mistakes of Eurocentric diffusionism, a body of theories and statements which purport to show that Europe or Europeans were in some way, whether mentally or physically or economically or environmentally or culturally, superior to Asians, Africans and other non-Europeans before the 'discovery' of America. Blaut does this by analyzing systematically the works of many recent and past popularizers of these theories, from the 'hydraulic societies' of Karl Wittfogel to the contemporary racist historiography of Eric L. Jones, and subjecting them to an unsparing criticism for their erroneous assumptions and ignorance of the non-European world. As Blaut shows, China, India, Southeast Asia and even Africa were not lagging behind Europe in any respect before 1492, including but not limited to technology, individual freedom (or lack thereof), and demographics. He also makes many essential geographic points, such as refuting the theories that tropical conditions are inherently unsuited for working or thinking, or that tropical soil is necessarily less fertile, or that Europe relied on rainfall agriculture unlike Asia. The book \\"Eight Eurocentric Historians\\" builds upon this part and goes into more detail about it.The second part of the book is a discussion of the state of feudalism in Europe and elsewhere (about the same level of development except for the Americas, as Blaut shows) before 1492, and the immensely rapid growth, change, and development Western and Southern Europe underwent in the period roughly from 1492 to 1700. Blaut persuasively argues that only the colonization of the Americas, with the enormous influx of wealth and capitalistic production relations resulting from gold and silver mining and plantation work (particularly sugar), can adequately explain this phenomenon. He also explains why it was Europe that conquered America rather than the opposite, the answer being disease, and why it was Europe as opposed to Asia or Africa that did this, the answer being geographical location and advantageous wind patterns for sailing.Blaut is unsparing and polemic in his writing, occasionally getting preachy, but his case is strong and aims home. He even criticizes otherwise radical authors for their failing in this regard, often legitimately, such as Marx and to a lesser extent Engels, Robert Brenner, Perry Anderson, and others. I do not endorse or support all his critiques on this field, as Blaut occasionally goes overboard, and his endorsement of Martin Bernal's \\"Black Athena\\" theory, now discredited, does not aid his case. (It must be noted that this book was written in 1993, and the refutation of this theory in \\"Black Athena Revisited\\" (Black Athena Revisited) was published in 1996.) Blaut nonetheless gives good cause also for the radical historians to revise and change the substance of some of the classic Marxist historical view - his book is yet more confirmation that the concept of the \\"Asiatic mode of production\\" is untenable and must be discarded, and it also gives more argument for introducting \\"protocapitalism\\" as a separate mode of production in between feudalism and Industrial Revolution capitalism, although Blaut himself is not yet willing to do so.What is most important about this book however is not its historiographical import, but the essential corrective it is to much of the still popular view of world history and the development of Europe and its superior position. From Tarzan to Tintin and from Kipling to the popular view of American Indians, the entire picture of the interactions between Europe and the rest of the world are for many people still unwittingly based on completely incorrect Victorian prejudices and assumptions. This goes not just for the average guy, but even for intellectuals, in fact even for professional historians. And if Blaut's book could make a dent in this vision, it will have made a major contribution to international understanding and historical sense."},{"Title":"The Colonizer's Model of the World: Geographical Diffusionism and Eurocentric History","review":"It is difficult to critique Blaut's book without falling into the trap of expounding the \`Eurocentric diffusion' theory oneself. If he was making the point that many historical thinkers at many points in time were guilty of over-estimating the uniqueness and impact of any \`European miracle', then I would have some sympathy with his argument. However, his aims are much grander. He wishes to prove that the success of \`Western' civilisation was a geographical happenstance, and that the whole canon of European historiography is built on the basis of \`Eurocentric diffusion', and he, of course, is the only person to have spotted this.Of course, Edward Said's Orientalism of 1979 had preceded Blaut's work by some 14 years, but despite the similarity of tone and approach, Blaut disregards Said's work in one sentence with a quick nod of approval - colonial activity in the Orient obviously being unimportant to his central thesis of the importance of the Americas in European growth. This is typical of Blaut's lack of interest in Asian, African or Middle-Eastern colonialism - for example, colonial India does not figure in his exposition at all. Blaut may not have been aware of the historical academic community's attacks on Said's thesis - these seem to me even more apparent in Blaut's thesis than in Said's. John MacKenzie's incisive critique of Said's Orientalism resonates with flaws I perceive in Blaut's book.Firstly Blaut does not provide any evidence of linkage between \`representation' of the \`outside' world, as he calls it, in the \`Colonizer's Model of the World' and the application of that \`representation' in the colonialisation \`project'. So what philosophical and historical texts existed in the critical 16th and 17th centuries that exhibited this Euro-chauvinism, and how were they harnessed by the colonisers in their supposed domination of the world? He only provides a brief survey of books from 1850 onwards in an extended footnote. Secondly, he creates a form of Euro-centrism himself in his argument painting a caricature of \\"the imperial mugger and unresisting victim\\" Thirdly, he essentialises \`european intellectual history' as if it is one body of consistent opinion. An example of his writing shows this: \\"All scholarship is diffusionist insofar as it axiomatically accepts the Inside-Outside world\\". Also, he is highly selective about the examples he cites, and those that he cites as examples of \`current thinking' are often archaic. An example can be seen in his argument against the \`Malthusian Theory' of overcrowding \\"being propagated today\\", where he attacks books by Lawrence Stone and Robert Brenner, both published in 1977. He only admits in a footnote that an extensive exegesis criticising these works was penned in the 1980s. His selectivity also extends to his bold statement that all world regions were using the sea as effectively as each other prior to 1492. However, he cannot ignore the evidence of the prowess of the Portuguese in sailing techniques, but he hides this in another footnote. What of Bartolomeu Dias's rounding of the Cape of Good Hope which predated Columbus's voyage by four years? Surely the epic voyage of Da Gama's to Kenya and India in 1497/8 shows that Columbus's route was not a one-off freak happenstance?John Thornton's book published the previous year gives a much more convincing historical and geographic explanation of European maritime Atlantic successes over the riverine African sailors, arguing that Europe (and the Middle-East) did have world-beating technical advantages in sailing technology and know-how by the mid 15th century.The final \`Saidian' streak in the book is its ahistoricism. Like Said, Blaut is not a historian. He is a geography professor. But how is this book ahistorical? Firstly, it ignores specific causality. What exactly was the flow of precious metals when they arrived back in Europe? Many historians believe that much of the bullion was respent on purchasing china, silk and tea. Surely this would have enriched Asia not Europe, and especially encouraged Asian industrialisation? Also, the countries which reaped the bullion rewards of South America (Spain and Portugal) patently did not defeudalise at the same rate as Britain and the Low Countries. And some areas, such as Italy and Germany did not gain directly from such colonies - and yet they lie within Blaut's uniform definition of \`Europe'.To conclude, Blaut fails to harness his idea of a \`Coloniser's Model' to any practical instances of colonialist hegemony, or instances of underdevelopment in the colonies. William Coffey describes Blaut's approach as \\"spending a great deal of effort constructing a \`straw man' which he heroically topples...but his approach may be more properly likened to an attack of (German) panzer divisions.\\" He fails to convince that there is one unitary Europe with one Colonial Model of exploitation for capitalist development. Some analysis of the divisions within Europe is surely required to understand how capitalism developed, and where it found nourishment. The book argues against Weber's ideas of the \`oriental despot', the cyclical rather than modernising nature of Asian societies and Weber's racist undertones. But it fails to address Weber's ideas on the famous \`Protestant Work Ethic' and the Marx's and Weber's \`spirit of the true man'. One year after the publication of Blaut's book. Francis Fukuyama published the highly successful and controversial End of History and the Last Man which investigated these issues - coming to very different conclusions from Blaut.It is worth noting that Blaut's final book, entitled Eight Eurocentric historians was published in 2000, in the year of his death. It may be that this new edition may address some of the criticisms I level at his 1993 work."},{"Title":"The Colonizer's Model of the World: Geographical Diffusionism and Eurocentric History","review":"In this book, the late James Blaut attempted to demonstrate the existence of a theory of Eurocentric diffusionism among mainstream scholars and the general public, as well as reasons for its falsity and the veracity of a competing theory.Eurocentric diffusionism is defined as the concept that the internal qualities of Europe led to the modernization of non-European countries after colonialism, rather than utilization of the resources of those continents themselves, which is the idea that Blaut supports. The concept of an \\"Inside\\" versus an \\"Outside\\" is repeatedly mentioned, with Europe or \\"Greater Europe\\" said to be conceptualized as a focal point that gradually spreads its inventions and discoveries outward to the non-producers of the world in other continents.Colonialism is legitimized by depicting non-European regions of the world as empty both physically and culturally. The exploitation of non-Europeans through dispossession, slavery, and theft of their mineral wealth is therefore justified because Europe contributed cultural wealth to those regions. While the importation of material products from non-Europe to Europe is regarded as acceptable, the importation of cultural or intellectual products is not, since non-Europeans are regarded as primitive and backwards.While the author accurately describes a historic academic model that is likely still accepted in part by segments of the public, he provides rather limited evidence that this framework was still widely adopted by scholars in 1993, the year of this book's publication.His own selected definitions of Europe and non-Europe are problematic. Blaut states that, \\"In this book, the word 'Europe' refers to the continent of Europe and to regions dominated by European culture elsewhere, regions like the United States and \\"Canada.\\" He does not mention Latin America, dominated primarily by European culture from Iberia, likely because Americans have been conditioned to regard Latin Americans as non-white or non-European, despite the fact that several countries (such as Argentina) are predominantly ethnically European and all are predominantly culturally European, though those with higher traditionalist Indian populations (i.e. Guatemala, Peru, Bolivia) have important Native influences.More significantly, the most persistent and critical error is likely the author's tendency to essentially promise more than he actually delivers in terms of demonstrating that the alleged disparities between Europe and non-Europe were nonexistent before the Age of Exploration, or to establish that there were parities between selected parts of non-Europe and Europe, but not the universal equality (or even the lesser standard of equity), that his wording implies existed.In the beginning of chapter 2, Blaut states, \\"My task in this chapter and in Chapter 3 ('Before 1492') is to show that Europeans had no superiority over non-Europeans at any time prior to 1492: they were not more advanced, not more modern, not more progressive.\\" However, in the beginning of chapter 3, he modifies his purpose somewhat, stating, \\"Prior to 1492, the progress toward modernization and capitalism which was taking place in parts of Europe was also taking place in parts of Asia and Africa.\\" This fails to address the disparities between Europe and America, Australia, and various islands that were colonized by Europeans. He thus states an intent to only partially support his claim of parity between Europe and non-Europe.Yet he then goes on to only partially support this partial support. The general pattern that he follows is to first make a rather strong claim, such as, \\"The protocapitalist port cities of Europe were not more highly developed than those of Africa and Asia in the fifteenth century.\\"He then proceeds to provide evidence for only part of this claim: \\"This holds true regardless of the kinds of criteria chosen as measures. European cities, first, were not larger in absolute or relative population. In fact, urbanization in Europe was probably less advanced than urbanization in China, India, the Arab region, and no doubt many other non-European areas. The urban population in early Ming China was perhaps 10% of the total population. In the Vijayanagar Empire of southern India it must have been at least as high: the inland capital alone held about 3% of the population - comparable centers in Europe, such as Paris, may have had half that percentage - and the coastal port cities were both numerous and large.\\"The examples of Ming China and Vijayanagar Empire may serve to prove that there was Asian urbanization comparable or superior to European urbanization, but the author does not cite any specific examples of African urbanization, such as Timbuktu. While the \\"Arab region\\" includes substantial portions of North Africa, the most persistent Eurocentric criticism is typically directed at sub-Saharan Africa, by genetic determinists because of their beliefs about the inferiority of the population and by those he terms environmental determinists because of their beliefs about the Saharan desert blocking diffusion to the south. To reference the most recent advocacy of environmental determinism in a popular science book, Jared Diamond (who is addressed in Blaut's bookEight Eurocentric Historians), writes inGuns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societiesthat, \\"my use of the term 'Eurasia' includes in several cases North Africa, which biogeographically and in many aspect of human culture is more closely related to Eurasia than to sub-Saharan Africa.\\"Worse than the partial argument is the bald assertion, such as that expressed in his discussion of military disparities between Europeans and Amerindians: \\"Moreover, the superiority of the Spaniards' primitive guns was not really very great when compared with the Americans' bows and arrows.\\"In comparison, inSeven Myths of the Spanish Conquest, Matthew Restall explains that guns were of limited use to the earliest Europeans in America artillery pieces such as cannons and firearms such as harquebuses were in short supply and difficult to transport, tropical and sub-tropical humidity dampened powder, rendering guns inoperable, and that more effective weapons such as the musket and more effective battle techniques such as volley-firing had yet to be developed. In1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus, Charles Mann explains that the pistols owned by Jamestown colonists were inferior to arrows in range and penetration. InThe Mystic Warriors of the Plains, Thomas E. Mails explains that quickly drawn and discharged arrows can be fired more rapidly than a historic revolver, and at short range can penetrate further than the ball of a historic Colt's navy pistol and that the bow and arrow was not abandoned to a very great extent by Plains warriors until they acquired repeaters such as the Winchester 66 and the Sharps .50 caliber carbines.Blaut, by contrast, provides an (unsourced) assertion in a single sentence. There is evidence of this statement being true, in the form of the arguments provided by the aforementioned authors, but Blaut does not summarize these arguments himself or even reference these sources in an endnote.Returning to the issue of disparities between continents, of particular significance was the complete absence of any discussion of Australia from the book, and (according to the index), only one brief mention of the smallest continent, in an endnotes section. The likely reason is that Australian history strongly evidences the fact that there were technological disparities between continents based on the presence or absence of domesticable flora and fauna, and Blaut insistently rejects this as an explanation. In pre-colonial Australia, both domesticated plants and animals were fundamentally absent, and the consequence was that the indigenous population were nomadic hunter-gatherers.To this day, the principal rural productive activity in Australia is not crop cultivation but livestock ranching (mainly of sheep and cattle), with wheat, sugar cane, and cotton. Cultivation is primarily practiced in relatively small pockets in the southern and eastern regions of the continent (with the highest human populations concentrated in Melbourne and Sydney) that enjoy the combined benefits of moderate to high soil fertility, annual precipitation, and temperate climate. Even twenty-first century technology cannot produce an irrigation system that converts the massive interior deserts into fertile regions, demonstrating the extent of environmental influence that the author repeatedly denies.If we can accept the fact that there is a correlation between domesticated flora and fauna and technological sophistication, and it is sufficiently evident that a continent without the former also lacked the latter that the author omits it from his book, can we not also accept that high levels of such flora and fauna are present in certain regions of the world, low or nonexistent levels are present elsewhere, and intermediate levels in still others, with technology approximately commensurate to these levels? The author apparently cannot.Yet remarkably, after much criticism of environmental determinism (which he describes as \\"the theory that the natural environment strongly influences human affairs and human history\\"), Blaut emerges as a reluctant partial advocate of it in his explanation as to why America was colonized by Europeans rather than Africans or Asians, arguing that it was due to lesser distance and better sailing conditions.As a response to expected charges of environmental determinism, he writes, \\"Is this environmental determinism? There is no more environmentalism here than there is in, say, some statement about the effect of oilfields on societies of the Middle East. I am asserting only the environmental conditions that support and hinder long-distance oceanic travel. In any case, if the choice were between an environmentalistic explanation and one that claimed superiority of one group over all others, as Eurocentric diffusionism does, we would certainly settle for environmentalism.\\"The effects of distance and sailing conditions and the effects of oilfields both illustrate the same axiom, expressed by Diamond: \\"History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among peoples' environments.\\" Blaut adheres to this axiom mainly when differences between peoples are more clearly involuntary Moreover, his wording in the concluding sentence implies that selection between competing theories is merely a matter of personal preference rather than following the evidence to a logical conclusion.Blaut states that the role of disease was, \\"of paramount importance and probably constitutes a sufficient cause in and of itself.\\" Diamond concurs, writing that, \\"Throughout the Americas, diseases introduced with Europeans spread from tribe to tribe far in advance of the Europeans themselves, killing an estimated 95 percent of the pre-Columbian Native American population.\\"The two authors also agree on the origin of major infectious diseases. Blaut writes that, \\"Many diseases originated or became epidemiologically significant during or after the Agricultural Revolution, and have ecological connections to agriculture, to urbanization, to zoological and botanical changes in he ecosystems strongly modified by human land use, and so on.\\" Diamond echoes him, writing, \\"That [disease] buildup began with the rise of agriculture starting about 10,000 years ago and then accelerated with the rise of cities starting several thousand years ago.\\"Far from being a consistent opponent of so-called environmental determinism (which, again, he describes as \\"the theory that the natural environment strongly influences human affairs and human history\\"), Blaut finds himself in agreement with its most prominent recent advocate on determining the most significant cause of success for permanent European colonialism in America. Since he argues that the divergence between Europe and non-Europe occurred, \\"because of Europe's location near America and because of the immense wealth obtained by Europeans in America and later in Asia and Africa,\\" it would certainly stand to reason that the natural environment strongly influenced human affairs and human history if this theory is correct.His partial environmental determinism ironically produces a self-condemnation, through his statement that, \\"One finds each Eurocentric historian adding one or a number of environmentalist arguments or factors to the mix, which, as a whole, explains the superiority of Europe.\\"Ultimately, though the crux of Blaut's argument seems logical and persuasive, these cited instances are unfortunately characteristic of his general approach, which can be broadly described as prone to assertions without sufficient evidence, substantial inconsistency in the specific case of environmental determinism, and repetitive pontification of some points and overly brief mention of others, regardless of their respective significance.While this book may serve as a supplement to Guns, Germs, and Steel (which provides little explanation for the Great Divergence), much of the same information is provided in the far more succinct bookIn the Wake of Columbus: The Impact of the New World on Europe, 1492-1650 (European History Series), orThe Columbian Exchange, Biological and Cultural Consequences of 1492, both of which also expand beyond discussion of the effects of precious metals on Europe's economy to focus on the advantages provided by the exchange of cultivated crops from both continents and domesticated animals from Europe. Better yet, a synthesis of the main ideas of both Guns, Germs, and Steel and A Colonizer's Model of the World is provided inA Concise Economic History of the World: From Paleolithic Times to the Present."},{"Title":"The Colonizer's Model of the World: Geographical Diffusionism and Eurocentric History","review":"The author contends that prior to 1492 most of the sea-faring cultures of the &quot;Old World&quot; (Europe, Africa &amp; Asia) were, for the most part, equal in technological, political and economic status. It was only geographic proximity (and luck) that allowed the Europeans to &quot;discover&quot; America, which had advanced cultures, too. This &quot;discovery&quot; allowed the Europeans to be the first to exploit the natural and human resources of America and therefore position itself as the world powerhouse, that still exists today. Colonization and capitalism followed from the silver trade, then eventually the fur, rum and slave trades. The rest is history. Along the way, Mr. Blaut easily dismisses the notion that it was European culture or character (either good or evil) that led to their &quot;advancements.&quot; But it is that main point that really opened my eyes: that other cultures, in all hemispheres, were equally advanced as Europe in 1492, and that Europe's colonization of America was just luck and their &quot;advancement&quot; truly sprung from just that. It is a good complement to &quot;Indian Givers,&quot; by Jack Weatherford."},{"Title":"The Colonizer's Model of the World: Geographical Diffusionism and Eurocentric History","review":"Anyone familiar with academic professor-style writing will understand the structural weakness of this book. There are four very long chapters related to Blaut's theoretical argument, and they almost certainly originated as separate research projects written at different times for different audiences. Blaut has tied things together with occasional transitional paragraphs, surrounded by a shell of a general argument. Some knowledgeable reviewers here have found problems with Blaut's general history, and that's legitimate, but the fundamental problem with this book's construction makes such matters of detail a moot point.Blaut's major contention is very strong, if not exactly groundbreaking. He wishes to debunk the body of historical theory called diffusionism &#8211; the dubious Eurocentric view that all the advancements of civilization, from agriculture to cities to capitalism, originated amongst genius Europeans and then were disseminated to ignorant peoples around the world. At the start of the book, Blaut promises to explore the intellectual processes that make mainstream and elite historians continue to believe such theories even after they have long since been disproved. That would have made this book a winner, but the promise never comes to fruition, leaving us instead with a tedious exercise in theorization.After an exasperating opening chapter in which Blaut keeps telling us what he's going to cover later, this book collapses in the disastrous second chapter. Here he ceaselessly nitpicks the arguments of selected history books. This includes dozens of pages obsessing over the works of some historian named Eric L. Jones, which reeks of professional sour grapes. Unfortunately for Blaut, simply finding errors in other theories does not prove your own theory by default. Chapters 3 and 4 incomprehensibly descend into reductionist historical research on the development of feudalism outside of Europe and the influence of colonial riches on England's Glorious Revolution of 1688. Now what do these have to do with the attempted high-level theoretical insights of the rest of the book? Extremely little &#8211; although Blaut throws in occasional reminders that he's still leading up to great findings about his initial thesis. Well, he never does give us any real insights into why historians still believe in Eurocentric diffusionism. We only learn that Blaut really disagrees with it. Most would say he's correct given the realities of history, if only he could say it in a way that makes sense.

Blaut systematically dismantles idea after idea, many of which have been taken for granted by historians and laymen alike for years. For example, the idea that Europe's climate and soils are inherently better suited for agriculture than elsewhere. In the end, however, Blaut still has to explain Europe's rise, so his answer is that since Europe was geographically closer to the Americas and had the benefit of favorable winds and currents, these factors made the &quot;discovery&quot; of America possible. The resulting flood of bullion from America into Europe allowed the Europeans to eventually pull ahead of the rest of the world. Blaut is surely on to something, but his explanation is a little thin. Why didn't Africans discover Brazil? Nonetheless, this is an excellent book that will challenge your thinking and shake your Eurocentrism (if you suffer from it) to the foundations. If you want a more detailed critique of individual historians such as Jared Diamond and David Landes, check out Blaut's &quot;Eight Eurocentric Historians.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Colonizer's Model of the World: Geographical Diffusionism and Eurocentric History","review":"This is a good critique of the assumptions made by Eurocentric historians over the years about the superiority of Europe as compared to the inferiority of the rest of the world. Blaut effectively examines and explodes each theory dispassionately but thoroughly. Finally he comes up with his own explanation for European success since 1492: America. Europe's &quot;discovery&quot; of and exploitation of North and South America gave it the wherewithall it needed to overtake and surpass the rest of the world. A well written, well documented assessment which deserves a place beside The Great Divergence and ReOrient, among others."},{"Title":"The Colonizer's Model of the World: Geographical Diffusionism and Eurocentric History","review":"A book is a book.

While Blaut makes some excellent arguments about Europe's lack of credit to other cultures, especially during it's early expansion, in the end the facts don't stand up to his argument.He overlooks that overwhelming riches did little to stop Spain's rapid decline as a power (it may have even accelerated it to some extent). Blaut seems to have discounted the fall of Constantinople and the subsequent fleeing of teachers and artists to the West as a factor.What subsequent events does Blaut either overlook or underevaluate? For starters there are the beginnings of the scientific method in the West. Then there are things that muck up his argument like the advancement of western medicine (so much that even the Chinese would ask for western doctors in the 16th century, military improvements and numerous advancements in technology.And so on and so on. I'm all for the remembering of contributions and influences from non-european societies, civilizations and cultures, but this \\"mea culpa\\" Western guilt has reached a bit of a height in Blaut's work. It also seems to reflect an emotional analysis rather than any unbiased academic approach.In addition to technical, scientific, medical, and management advancement, he leaves out the social/philisophical advancement of the West.The basic concept of the freedom and dignity of the individual, while not perfectly practised were almost unique in being applied to Western society. In fact the West is the first to look at itself and realize to this day it's failings vis a vis slavery, sexism, etc., in a sustained and critical way that other societies have yet to approach...Read this, but keep your wits about you as you do."},{"Title":"The Colonizer's Model of the World: Geographical Diffusionism and Eurocentric History","review":"... and I believe I am a seeker of engrossing, intellectual reading!With strong, stimulating, engrossing, logical and brilliantly vivid arguments, this book deserves to be a recommended study at all schools wishing to nurture a socially analytical intellect. (But you do not have to go to school to read it... I didn't!)The book does not assume prior social studies from the reader, in fact one of the main plus points of the book is that it takes pains to explain (in an extremely engrossing style) any complex concepts that are required for the analyses the author presents. The book is worth many times the money/ time spent on it just for the social science concepts illustrated.One of the rare books that helps you broaden your vision and understanding of this world via a huge, well directed beam of light.Though the book is an argument against a belief system (of European superiority and &quot;priority&quot;), Blaut takes care not to make it an argument against people holding those beliefs. Instead he delves deep into social and psychological theories to explain how the beliefs came about. It illustrates human-nature more than argue against the views held by a section.I could go on trying to express the plus points of the book, but indeed, the material, handling and subject of the book are so well dealt with that I prefer to just suggest that you go out and read it.

His best books were made in his prime, which ended maybe 7-8 years ago, and include: Others See Us, Oddballs, House of Stairs, Interstellar Pig, The Green Futures of Tycho and, of course, Singularity. In these books he treated the audience intelligently and dealt with science fiction problems in new ways, while keeping the reader sympathizing with the main character.I'll summarize the plot quickly. Barry and Harry are twins, but Barry is strong and popular, and he bullies Harry, who is weak. Harry, eventually getting fed up, locks himself inside a room that holds a singularity, where time flies inside the room while time slows to a crawl outside. He keeps himself in the room for a year while a night passes on the outside world.The best part of Singularity was not the psychological rivalry between the twins, but how Harry managed to keep himself sane through a regimented routine of diet, exercise, meditation and reading. I found it very interesting how someone could find inner peace, and grow up to be a man, through such a regimented, solitary program."},{"Title":"Singularity","review":"Singularity was my favorite book in middle school. I just read it again for a class in college and I still really enjoy it! Below is a review that I wrote for my class about Singularity that may be helpful. **Just a warning - it gives away the ending!William Sleator writes of Harry and Barry Krasner, twin brothers who could not be more opposite. Harry, the narrator of the story, is the scientific, mathematical, timid brother, while Barry is athletic, out-going, and domineering. When the two are sent to their late great uncle Ambrose's farm to house-sit, they come across a very strange playhouse in the backyard. The brothers find out from Lucy, an attractive female neighbor, that the Krasner's Uncle Ambrose was a very creepy man who could make his neighbor's cows dry up and grow feeble over night.As a team, Harry, Barry, and Lucy find the keys for the playhouse and being exploring. They soon find that time goes faster within the house, and that there is a portal to another universe that they can see reflected in water in the playhouse's sink. From the portal, strange things arrive such as a small blinking device that Harry realizes must be a clock for another life form. Other things also arrive like a green hairball and a purple furry fruit peel, but the three truly begin to worry when they see a large set of jaws coming through the portal. However, by now, they realize that it will take many days for it to arrive in their world.In the meantime, Harry and Barry's relationship grows increasingly competitive, and Harry begins to worry that Barry will go into the playhouse at night and stay in there until he ages enough that they are no longer twins. Harry, who's character by now is getting a little annoying because he is so whiny and insecure, does something startling to both the reader, himself, and, later, Barry: Harry goes into the playhouse. He spends a year in \\"playhouse time\\" within the confines of the little shed, but in real time it is only a few hours. During this time, Harry develops a regimented schedule to keep himself from going crazy. This part is more interesting than one would expect. Through journal entries, Harry shares his deepest concerns and theories about his brother, the monster coming through the portal, and about life in general. As Harry ages, he truly becomes more wise and confident in himself, and this mini bildungs roman is exciting to view, as a reader, in such a short time.When the playhouse year is finally over, Harry confronts his brother, which is actually only the next morning. Barry's reaction is satisfying for both Harry and the reader. Unlike many readers might expect, however, the brothers actually get along better when Harry is a year older. Sleator does a good job of emphasizing that Barry's new behavior is not just because Harry is now the older brother, but also because Harry has more confidence in himself and is more controlled in his reactions toward his brother.That same morning, the monster arrives. As soon as Harry opens the door to the playhouse, the monster violently jumps out, destroying the playhouse and the portal, and consumes itself. Harry explains to Barry and Lucy that it was probably a robot sent to destroy the portal on purpose because it was a danger or an annoyance to have an exposed portal to another universe. Older readers may connect the end of the playhouse's power to the end of Harry's childhood, however, even if they do not fully understand the deeper intentions of this story, it is still an exciting sci-fi journey for readers ages 12 and up."},{"Title":"Singularity","review":"The last time I read this book was probably about 10 years ago, and plausible or not, the sci-fi time warp aspect of it is not what has stuck with me all these years. What I remember most (and loved best) was the development of the relationship between the brothers and how the picked-on brother became a mature, thoughtful human being through self-discipline, meditation, physical strengthening and intense study. It was a wonderful message about what is possible for the dedicated under-dog, and how very simple and accessible the tools for self-improvement are."},{"Title":"Singularity","review":"Every book has something good about it;however,this book has three good things about it.

Mrs. Krasner gets a letter telling her that her Uncle Ambrose died and he left everything to her. She and her husband has planned a vacation so they sent their sixteen year old twin sons, Harry and Barry, to go check the place out. When the boys get there, they find a playhouse behind the house. They try to open it and find it's locked. A girl named Lucy, that's about their age, comes over and tells them some stuff about their great uncle. They go inside and Barry finds a key that has PLAY written on it, but when they try that one in the lock to the playhouse, it doesn't work either. Barry ends up finding a key that has HOUSE written on it, but that key doesn't work either. Then, Barry tries using both key (by putting one in after another) and it works. The playhouse is full of spider webs and the floor is coated in dead insects. When they go back outside, Fred, Harry and Barry's dog, is still in the exact same place as he was when they went into the playhouse a few minutes before. They don't really think anything of this and go inside the house. The next day, Harry and Barry decide to clean out the playhouse. After cleaning for a while, Harry goes outside to get the trash bags and the door shuts behind him. When he opens it up a second later, he finds Barry asleep on the bed that's inside the playhouse and the playhouse completely clean. Barry wakes up and yells at Barry for leaving him in there al night, but Harry had only been outside a few seconds. Harry later figures out that the playhouse is a singularity, or a black hole, and that for every second outside the playhouse, a hour goes by inside the playhouse. Barry keeps making Harry mad, so Harry decides that he wants to be the one in command and the only way to do that would be to be older than Barry. Harry figures out that two and a half hours outside the play house equals a year inside it. Harry stays in the playhouse for two and half hours (in Barry's time) while Barry is asleep. This makes him a year older than Barry. When Barry wakes up, he finds that Harry is different. Harry tells him what he did and Barry freaked out. Then, the thing that they have been waiting for to come through the singularity finally comes through. It ends up eating itself. After this, Barry, Harry, and Lucy go inside the playhouse and find a broken stone on the floor. They look outside and find that everything is moving as normal the time zone is no longer there. Lucy leaves and Harry and Barry try to figure out how they are going to tell their parents that Harry is now seventeen. This book has a lot of adventure type stuff, weird stuff, and suspense in it.Harry has most of the adventure, but some other people do to. Barry and Harry get to go check out their great uncle's house. Their parents go to California. Barry, Harry, and Lucy discover what the playhouse can do. Harry stays in the playhouse for a year.There are many weird things in this book. The playhouse is weird and that it has a different time zone inside of it. It's also weird because it can transport items from a different universe. It was kind of weird that Harry decide to age himself.This book is crazy with suspense. It was suspenseful when they were trying to figure out what was going on with the playhouse. The different things to come through the singularity was suspenseful. It was suspenseful while Harry was waiting a year inside the playhouse.With all of the adventuristic stuff, weird stuff, and suspense, this book was jam packed. It was really good and different from anything I've ever read. I really liked the Sci-Fi stuff, even thought it was a little weirder than I'm used to. I would recommend this book to anyone who like really cool Sci-Fi books."},{"Title":"Singularity","review":"William Sleator is a newly emerging author into the world of sciencefiction.

It is about two boys, Harry and Barry, who go to their dead uncle's house expecting to just find an old run down house,but when they get there they walk into a playhouse of terror. I have read two other books by William Sleator, The Boxes and Marco's Millions, and I would definitely say that Singularity is the best. Sleator's mix of science fiction and real life is strange in a scary and funny kind of way. His style of writing keeps the reader on tenterhooks waiting to see what will happen next. When I am getting tired I say to myself, \\"I will stop reading after this chapter,\\" but then at the end of the chapter Sleator will write something like, \\"but then the creature came.\\" So you just want to keep reading the book. Singularity is very suspenseful and once you start reading it, you don't want to put it down.I would rate this book 9/10, however, because although it is a good book it is kind of slow in some parts. Overall though, I would definitely recommend this book to middle school students who like stories about aliens and who enjoy mystery and suspense.A few months ago I had the opportunity to meet William Sleator when he visited my school.

It's probably the most stable of all his scifi books, because it deals more with people than with aliens or physics.

This book has is just typically meant for sci-fi readers because this has all the requirements for it being a successful sci-fi book. The book is simply just an awesome book to read because the author, William Sleator is cool guy. He is very clever in making different sci-fi books. I mean he as actually created theories that make sense. Like in this book he has actually created a theory of some sort of abandoned shack or shed that speeds up time, when inside of it. The reason behind this \\"time warp\\" is because that shed lies on some sort of black hole.Another aspect that Sleator Created are the feelings and personalities of the main characters of the book of this book is the feelings and personalities of the main characters in this book. The two main characters are twins, Harry and Barry. Their personalities are completely opposite. Barry is the strong, athletic, and bossy one while Harry is the smart, weak and sensitive one. Barry being the stronger always bosses and bullies Harry around. This makes you feel sympathetic towards Harry because of the way he feels about his brother. For example he is sick of being the weaker one or he wishes that he wants them to be more like brothers than rivals. BUT all of this changes when Harry decides to hide/stay in that mysterious shed over night. I recommend all readers especially sci-fi readers to read this book because throughout the book there are many twists and the ending is quite surprising. Also I recommend read other books done by Sleator because them too are just as good as this book"},{"Title":"Singularity","review":"A Review by ColtonTwo identical twins Barry and Harry krasner, Harry is a rough kind of guy who is athletic and in the story he makes a suggestion to watch over there uncles empty farm. Harry who is very different he is gentle and sensitive he thinks, sure why not hoping that they would become close more like brothers instead of rivaling friends or enemies. The people who live near the farm house stay away because there is something scary and chilling about that old abandoned farm house. There is a shed that is locked on there property and they think all these creepy feelings are coming from there what they find in side is crazy andI love the phrase on the front \\"it's not just a play house it is a portal into terror.\\"And it's not a play house it is a shed I hate that when people do dumb things like that.And it was really interesting.You should read this book and find out what is in that locked shed it will surprise you"},{"Title":"Singularity","review":"This book is a bit slower and has a less quirky tone to it. It is still definitely Sleator through and through, but it is a bit more serious. I didn't like it as much as &quot;Tycho&quot; or &quot;Interstellar Pig,&quot; but it is still a good read. Note that it is quite short, so the quantity of book per dollar is a bit small, but it is excellent for children who like quirky fiction. It is also suitable for interesting fluff for thos adults who want light reading."},{"Title":"Singularity","review":"Singularity is great because it is really mysterious.

I cannot ever in my wildest imaginations understand why people would think Sleator's writing especially his good stuff like this one is &quot;slow&quot; or &quot;not realistic&quot;. These people don't know what they are talking about. Because 1st the Theoretical Physics in all of his books are well published and reputed theories and facts. And 2nd he is just an amazing author.As for this book...I cannot explain how important it is that you read this book. &quot;Singularity&quot; is one of the first I read and to this day one of if not the Best of all of Sleators works. You really feel what Harry is going through with his brother and his motivations. When Harry goes through his schedule you are there with him and, it's amazing, it made me want to go improve myself like that the change that takes place is so great. If you don't read anything else by this author then read this book.

To each his own, I guess.The sequel to \\"Graverobbers Needed, No Experience Necessary\\", this picks up right where the first one left off and continues the fun. In fact, I liked this one even better for the rather elaborate plot that struck me as a sort of homage to James Bond movies with its numerous deadly games that our heroes must conquer.As I mentioned above, this is the second in the Andrew Mayhem series and I plan on reading them all.

Andrew apparently didn't learn his lesson the first time around and once again he finds himself in an impossible situation surrounded by psychopaths. This time the psychopath killers that have a created a mansion in the Alaska wilderness for the sole purpose of torturing, disfiguring, and murdering helpless prisoners.If you enjoyed Graverobbers Wanted: No Experience Necessary then you'll enjoy Single White Psychopath Seeks Same. It has the same tone and hilarious dialogue all mixed in with a decent amount of blood, gore and sadism. However, if the tongue and cheek type of dialogue is not your type of humor than you will absolutely hate this book.Here is a brief excerpt to help one decide if this author is for them: \\"Sometimes you wake up in the morning and you just know it's going to be the kind of day where you end up tied to a chair in a filthy garage while a pair of tooth-deprived lunatics torment you with a chainsaw.

It's true. The funny lines intersperse rather gory, over the top horror, creating a farcical romp that's over before you know it. I laughed out loud within paragraphs of going, \\"Ewwww...\\" and had to put it down once or twice when the horror aspect got a little intense. Not for long, mind you. Just a few minutes while I let the \\"Oh, my god, I can't believe Andrew has to suffer through that\\" feelings subside. I did find the ending a little abrupt, however, especially considering the intensity of the action preceding it.

SWPSS contains everything Graverobbers had but more of it -- more laughs, more frights, some particularly nasty dart weapons and more blood than the Overlook Hotel. Strand's dialogue remains as excellent as ever and keeps you turning the page even as Mayhem finds himself in one seemingly dead-end scenario after another (with an emphasis on &quot;dead&quot;). A must-read for anyone who loves good writing or who plans on being buried alive anytime soon."},{"Title":"Single White Psychopath Seeks Same","review":"The second entry in author Jeff Strand's highly popular humorous horror series from Mundania Press starring Andrew Mayhem, Single White Psychopath Seeks Same, takes up Andrew's adventures eighteen months following the events of Graverobbers Wanted (No Experience Necessary), with his agreeing to do another favor for another strange woman he meets in the local coffee shop (will he never learn?). Word has gotten around about his exploits, which led to the previous book, which, in turn, made him rich and famous (the former of which was quickly turned around by a bad investment strategy), so $600 for playing bodyguard for a night sounds pretty good (at least when compared to getting a real job).After his ineptness makes that career path moot, and while trying to improve his marriage with a little parking-lot nostalgia, Andrew and his wife Helen find themselves face-to-face with a serial killer known as The Headhunter and his scimitar. During the struggle, Helen shows herself to be quite a hand with a car jack.The Headhunter's eventual defeat brings Andrew in contact with Craig Burgin, whose wife is missing. He wants Andrew to accompany the private detective hired to pose as The Headhunter to New York. When Andrew bring Roger along for the trip, Roger gets to play hostage when a last minute mix-up forces Andrew to pretend to be The Headhunter.Things really get going when Andrew and Roger arrive at the Alaskan mansion of Daniel Rankin, independently wealthy homicidal maniac and entertainer. Rankin's home has been designed as a hedonistic center of slaughter, where he and his friends can kill with impunity, and Andrew is expected to join the fun -- unless he wants to be part of the show. Andrew Mayhem gets to be quite a bit more heroic, and somewhat less bumbling, in this one. Single White Psychopath Seeks Same is slightly less funny, but considerably more horrific than Graverobbers Wanted (No Experience Necessary). The tension is always high, as Andrew is determined to save the hostages even while he is trying to stay on the good sides of a group of bloodthirsty pleasure-seekers. I think it's actually a better novel all around.I can see why it took Strand three years to follow the first Mayhem book with this one. There is an amazing amount of detailed planning and imagination present in Single White Psychopath Seeks Same, most of it involving the setup at Rankin's house -- if you can call a structure that has forty-eight bedrooms and is surrounded by a twenty-foot-high electrified fence a \\"house.\\" Everything from a gladiator arena to a theme park is present here, and each one is described to the last detail, even the ones that are not yet complete (an extra bit of inspiration). While I was reading, I really believed that such a place could possibly exist. On the negative side, some of the situations were less believable than others, and the choice to shift to Roger's POV occasionally breaks up the flow and doesn't offer much of interest, but these are minor complaints of a book that I read in a single twenty-four-hour period. Now I just have to get my hands on a copy of the third volume, Casket For Sale (Used Only Once) -- I guess fans balked at the lack of parentheses in the second book's title -- and hope that Strand continues to write more books about this incredibly likeable and surprisingly relatable character."},{"Title":"Single White Psychopath Seeks Same","review":"&quot;Strand performs an incredible balancing act between humor and horror.

Though it bothered some readers, I did not mind the jumping to Roger's point of view every once in a while.It took me quite a while to read this, as I was not much in the reading mode when I started, but I am glad I finished it.

It is superb. Easy to read, clear-cut concepts, well-defined chapter order, and above all, solid gold thinking.As someone who specializes in fostering effective public intelligence and reducing wasteful ineffective secret intelligence, I could not help but marvel at how useful this book is in evaluating two completely opposite approaches to decision-support: Google, and the U.S. Intelligence Community.The author's chapters run logically from developing a framework to setting goals to improving personal information proficiency and then organizational learning, and thence to managing information as a resource to help make better decisions that yield profit, cut costs, and result in mission accomplishment.This is a book that should be read by every leader of any type of organization, large and small. What I like most about the book, even though the author is partial to maximizing investments in information technology, is his dual understanding that 1) the point is to make better decisions not buy more technology; and 2) information and information technology that are considered out of context and in isolation from other relevant information, are inherently flawed.Wow. Google fails this test, and so does the CIA. Google gives you a million hits on \\"Colombia,\\" without any visualization, synthesis, etc., while CIA tells you either that they don't know, or what they know is too secret to tell you.The heart of the book is about actually measuring information proficiency along multiple scales. I will not belabor the point, and will only stress this once that on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being ignorant incompetence, 2 being ad hoc isolated processes, and 5 being fully integrated and optimized data collection (including historical and parallel data), processing, analysis, decision, AND implementation, both Google and the CIA got an average of 2. That's a 40%, folks, a failing grade in any school district. Now, since the U.S. Intelligence Community costs $70 billion a year and serves only the President, and Google costs nothing to the end-user and serves hundreds of millions, we give them the advantage. We're betting Google will grow faster than CIA and the IC can reform.It merits comment, in passing, that this book is a very elegant recycling of earlier work by the author within the U.S. Government, subsequently published in earlier versions. This version is the best, and potentially revolutionary. I recommend that it be read in conjunction with Robert Buckman'sBuilding a Knowledge-Driven Organizationand if you really want to get into it, Margaret Wheatley'sLeadership and the New Science: Discovering Order in a Chaotic World; Thomas Stewart'sThe Wealth of Knowledge: Intellectual Capital and the Twenty-first Century OrganizationBarry Carter'sInfinite Wealth: A New World of Collaboration and Abundance in the Knowledge Eramy ownInformation Operations: All Information, All Languages, All the Timeas well as Alvin and Heidi Toffler's new book,Revolutionary Wealth: How it will be created and how it will change our lives, and the work praised by Lawrence Lessig among others, Yochai Benkler'sThe Wealth of Networks: How Social Production Transforms Markets and Freedom."},{"Title":"Transformers: City of Fear (Transformers (Titan Books Paperback))","review":"I consider myself a huge fan of the Simon Furman, and his run on the Marvel UK Transformers book is legendary. However, the stories collected in \\"City of Fear\\" are more filler material and do not really have a coherent theme. Even worse, this book features a lot of artwork by Dan Reed, who I consider to be the worst artist to have worked with Furman and an awful artist in his own right. The stories themselves are not bad, but they unfortunately are not particularly memorable.

It's why I'm giving four stars.I thought the others would be lite and funny stories in England at the same time. Nope. Instead they were dark and depressing, with no humor.

Certainly, those with an Italian American background will be especially moved by the poems that directly address that experience, but Gillan's work succeeds in transcending any single identity category and explores instead the multiple ways in which each of us learns to identify him or herself. Addressing the intricacies of class and ethnicity that determine one's relationship to what is considered &quot;mainstream&quot; American culture, these poems derive their power from the genuine experience of growing up poor in an Italian American neigborhood in a city of factories, rowhouses, and vacant lots. Reflecting a complex attitude toward this space, as well as to the close-knit community that both nourished and stifled her talents, these poems speak to anyone who as a child secretly wished to be a member of a &quot;normal&quot; made-for-television family, only to appreciate as an adult the freedom and imagninative possibility that result from embracing one's personal past and cultural origins."},{"Title":"Where I Come From (Essential Poets Series 64)","review":"The previous reader seems to be wearing blinders that allow a look only at this ethnic aspect of Gillan's poems. Too bad. There is much more here about motherhood, heritage, city life, growing up and yes, about all those things in a frame of Italian- American Culture. Read &quot;Arturo&quot; &amp; &quot;Public School #18&quot; and see if you don't agree. Gillan has worked hard, in her anthologies, poems and work as an editor and teacher to promote the cause of poetry and the dropping of ethnic &amp; racial barriers. Take a closer look."},{"Title":"Where I Come From (Essential Poets Series 64)","review":"Maria Mazziotti Gillan is one of the most influential living Italian-American poets. She is also active in the field of multi-ethnic poetry, and is the editor of the prestigious &quot;Paterson Literary Review.&quot; Her poetry has been compared to the poetry of the great William Carlos Williams, who came from the same area in New Jersey. And from William Carlos Williams (whom she loves), she has learned that great poetry comes from &quot;the cup that runneth over&quot;, that is, from emotion, from intuition, and from the genuine wonder at the marvel of life. Hers is poetry that is deceptively simple and that is based on content, images, and recollections, rather than semantic funamnbolism. Her poetry also pivots around recollection, in that she follows Wordsworth's tenet that poetry is &quot;life recollected in tranquility.&quot;Although Mazziotti Gillan's poetry deals essentially with her experience as an Italian-American, it transcends her own ethnic origins to reach a reality that encompasses all shades and shapes of American faces and the many ways to be American.Maria Mazziotti Gillan is the founder and director of the Poetry Center at Passaic County Community College in Paterson, New Jersey, and editor of the &quot;Paterson Literary Review&quot;. With her daughter Jennifer Gillan, she coedited the acclaimed 1994 anthology &quot;Unsettling America: An Anthology of Contemporary Multicultural Poetry and Identity Lessons: Contemporary Writing About Learning to Be American&quot;, published by Penguin in 1999. She is also the author of seven books of poetry, including &quot;Where I Come From: Selected and New Poems&quot; (Guernica), &quot;The Weather of Old Seasons&quot;, Cross Cultural Communications), and &quot;Winter Light&quot;, an American Literary Translator's Award winner. She has had several poems published in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Christian Science Monito&quot;r, and &quot;Poetry Ireland&quot;, as well as in numerous other journals. Awards for her work include the 1998 May Sarton Award, two New Jersey State Council on the Arts fellowships, and a Chester H. Jones Foundation Award. In addition, she was a finalist in the PEN Syndicated Fiction competition. She has appeared on National Public Radio's All Things Considered, Leonard Lopate's Books and Co., and Garrision Keillor's Writer's Almanac. Her poetry book, &quot;Things My Mother Told Me&quot;, was published by Guernica in 1999. Currently, she is at work on a memoir entitled &quot;My Mother's Stoop.&quot;Maria Mazziotti Gillan's poetry is bold and gutsy, and deals directly and unflinchingly with the complicated terrain of race and ethnicity in the United States. It also boldly deals with feeling, family, and expectations, with love and longing, with childhood and old age. Mazziotti Gillan is a courageous, risk-taking poet, who does not hesitate to bare her soul. She reveals the most intimate details of her life, her family relations, her experiences as a child, as a lover, as a wife, as a mother. These experiences, far from being only Italian-American, belong to the universal realm and reflect the destiny of &quot;Every Woman&quot;.I have personally seen and heard Maria recite her poetry at many of her well-attended poetry readings. Having broken, a long time ago, her silence, Mazziotti Gillan speaks, in her poetry as well as in person, with an assertive, inspiring voice that at times takes on prophetic, ieratic tones. She is not, however, devoid of humor.Maria Mazziotti's poetry, in simple and direct language, explores the universal experiences of all humans, from childhood, to adulthood, to old age. Some of the poet's strongest poems, in this good-looking book by Guernica Press, reveal her own poetic itinerary in the world of men and in the magic Kingdom of Words.This is a book I highly recommend-a fresh, moving, inspiring book.A Reader in California"},{"Title":"Where I Come From (Essential Poets Series 64)","review":"The poet's mother is the unifying spirit in this collection of heartfelt poems ablout family life. The mother is the vehicle through which Gillan's Italian ancestory comes alive and by which hope against all odds is maintained. Through these poems we come to understand how a family--any family-survives the hardships of the present through its links with the past and dreams for a future. The poems in this collection are written in everyday language aout everyday experiences. They speak in clear, cirect language about what it means to be human. They also remind us of the importance of place in shaping our lives. This book is a gem, and I think it would appeal to a wide cross-section of people. It will make you laugh and cry.

Generally I enjoy &quot;ethnic poetry,&quot; but not this. This author whom I've never read before, seems to be faking sincerity in order to join in the chorus. Felix Stefanile, Daniela Gioseffi and Diane DiPrima do a much better job on these themes. They have the craft to lift our spirits and tell their stories, too. Check them out on Amazon.com. They are better writers from the Italian American culture. Much finer crafters of poetic art. I wanted to like this book, but couldn't. Too stale and dull."},{"Title":"Where I Come From (Essential Poets Series 64)","review":"Gillan who fiercely took back her Italian name only when multiculturalism became fashionable, is bascially a sentamentalist. Her poetry does not rise to the truly poetic. She needs to go back to square one and study the really good Italian American poets like Felix Stefanile, Diane DiPrima, John Ciardi, Daniela Gioseffi, Donna Masini, Joseph Parisi, Dana Gioia, Maria Fama, so many others, who can write with more than old-fashioned violin strings. I had a real desire to like the book, but I was disappointed. These other authors are highly recommended reading, evenif this Italian American poet falls rather flat. There are really norisks here. The language is pedestrian. Nothing original. Que piccata! What a pity!"},{"Title":"On The Roads Of War: A Soviet Cavalryman On The Eastern Front","review":"This is an unusual book, one that only two or three years ago I would not have dreamed of being able to read: a personal memoir by a Soviet subaltern in a Guards Cavalry Division. Personal memoirs of low-ranking WW2 Red Army soldiers are hard to come by in English - personal memoirs of Soviet anti-tank cavalrymen must be about as rare as rocking-horse poo in English if not in Russian, and in fact I think this is the only one. Great thanks go to the publisher Pen & Sword in the UK for taking on this very unusual and interesting subject matter.Ivan Yakushin's book can be divided in three sections - the start of the war when he lived in Leningrad, where he had to endure the siege and consequent famine in the city. This is a very interesting testimony in itself. The second section deals with his training as an artillery officer and initial posting to command a heavy mortar platoon in an infantry regiment during the defense against German operation ZITADELLE at Kursk where he is wounded. The third section begins when he is posted to 5th Guards Cavalry Division following recovery. Here he takes command of a 45mm ATG platoon (later 57mm), and enters combat during operation BAGRATION. He then fights on through Poland and to the north of Berlin.The book contains vivid descriptions of the live in a cavalry regiment, the importance of horses, the way the Red Army dealt with disciplinary issues at the lowest level, combat, fear, and death. It is a great source of information for those wanting to find out a bit more about how the Red Army worked from the position of a lieutenant and platoon commander.Comparing it to Sydney Jary's famous '18 Platoon' makes clear that this book was not so much written with the military, but with the general reader in mind. While it is a shame that we had to wait for so long to see this book, it is of benefit that the author wrote it after the fall of the Communist regime, and after emigrating to Germany, thus sparing us the odes to the party and the important work of the commissar that make earlier Red War memoirs such a drag to read.The book contains some pictures of Yakushin and his friends and family. It would greatly have benefited from some maps. Hence only 4 out of 5.Anyone who seriously would like to find out something more about the working of the Red Army, and especially how its elite cavalry formations saw themselves, should get this book.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"On The Roads Of War: A Soviet Cavalryman On The Eastern Front","review":"This fascinating story, well written and wonderfully told, is one worth reading. It is one in a series of new memoirs by Red Army soldiers, which provide unparalleled insights into the Red Army's war against the Germans.Horses and cavalry played a huge role in the Second World War, especially on the Eastern Front. On the eve of Hitler's invasion of Soviet Russia, in June 1941, the Red Army order of battle included four cavalry corps and 13 cavalry divisions, numbering some 80,000 men. Each division was authorized almost 20,000 men and more than 16,000 horses, along with hundreds of light tanks, armored cars, artillery pieces and mortars and thousands of vehicles and tractors.The beginning of the war on the Eastern Front, however, found most of Stalin's cavalry formations understrength and the vast majority were annihilated in the opening months of the war. The Soviet High Command created 82 new cavalry divisions between July and December 1941 and by year's end many of these had been combined into new cavalry corps. This resurrected Red Cavalry proved invaluable in the fighting that followed, especially at the Battle of Moscow and during the Red Army's winter offensive of 1941-42. The Soviet High Command used its mounted horse formations to spearhead offensive operations and conduct deep exploitations into the Wehrmacht's rear areas.The number of Red Army cavalry formations peaked in February 1942 at 17 cavalry corps, 87 divisions and two separate cavalry regiments. A year later this had been reduced to ten cavalry corps, 30 divisions and three regiments. This was about the time that Ivan Yakushin, a young Russian from Leningrad, joined the cavalry.\\"We had a saying that dated back to the times of the Tsarist Army,\\" writes Yakushin: \\"A dandy serves in the cavalry; An idler - in the artillery; A drunkard serves in the Navy; An idiot - in the infantry.\\" Having survived the Siege of Leningrad, the young artillery officer found himself serving in the III Guards Cavalry Corps, 5th Guards Cavalry Division. The author, who learned to ride and master his mount after a painful experience, fought with his cavalry division at Kursk and pursued the retreating German army through Russia, Belorussia, Poland and into Germany. Throughout the book Yakushin not only records his unit's actions, but also ponders on the nature of the war. Coming upon a Russian soldier, who had been crushed into the surface of the road so that his remains were no thicker than a sheet of paper, the author wonders: \\"What had happened to this man? Was he a tank rider who got wounded and fell off his tank? Or was he killed?\\" The author concludes: \\"The only answer was to fight even harder, take revenge on the Germans for all the grief and misery they had brought to our longsuffering Motherland. We had to avenge the fallen of this holy war.\\"Yakushin describes a Red cavalry regiment in the attack, sabers drawn, against massed German infantry: \\"The riders were slashing at the fleeing Germans right and left. The experienced riders were doing this very professionally, cleaving heads in half. The younger men, mounted on smaller Mongolian ponies, were not so effective, but still I saw Germans fall from their blows as well. Fewer and fewer Fritzes were left standing on the field. Those slashed and slitted by sabers never again rose from the wet boggy earth.\\" Later, the author's regiment surprised an enemy tank formation in the forest, the Germans dismounted as they refueled their panzers. Those not killed or wounded were captured.Entering Eastern Prussia, the commanding officer of the 24th Guards Cavalry Regiment informed his officers that any Red Army soldier wishing to take his revenge upon the Germans should be allowed to do so without interference. \\"The Germans had brought such grief, death and destruction to our land - there were men in our regiment whose entire families had been killed - that many wanted to take revenge,\\" admits Yakushin. \\"Thus when we entered East Prussia, atrocities were committed by Red Army troops - cases of revenge. But this did not last long, as official orders came to treat the local population well.\\"Yakushin's homecoming is something out of \\"The Forgotten Soldier\\": \\"I walked up to my home, climbed the stairs, and rang the doorbell. A strange woman opened the door and asked me: 'who are you?' She was our new neighbor, who did not know me. I heard the familiar steps of my mother behind her back. my brother also walked up to the door. It was an indescribable meeting. We all wept with joy, hugged and kissed each other. All the neighbors ran to the hall to see a living frontovik [front line soldier].Wounded three times and decorated for his actions in Germany in April and May 1945, Ivan Yakusin returned to Leningrad after the war, retiring in 1992. He now lives in Germany."},{"Title":"On The Roads Of War: A Soviet Cavalryman On The Eastern Front","review":"This book was a good memoir and indeed everything I look for in such a book. Ivan Yakushin lived an interesting life during WW2, there are horrors and triumphs, the greatest when he tells how he managed to get to his home with his mother and younger brother after Barbarossa - the German invasion of Russia. His home was in Leningrad and his horrors had just begun. Then there is a very interesting part about how he was sent from Leningrad over Lake Lagoda in winter and how many young men died from their greatest enemy at the time - to much food after starving for so many months. From there he goes to officer school and after being wounded is drafted into the Guards Cavalry. Here to book shines as well for this is the only book I have found that describes this kind of warfare in WW2 but the Russians relied heavily on horse cavalry for breakthrough in this mechanised age.Recommended reading."},{"Title":"On The Roads Of War: A Soviet Cavalryman On The Eastern Front","review":"A very informative recounting of life in one of the lesser known but very important components of the Red Army --- The Cavalry.Life in the Cavalry, which made up a considerable portion of the strength of the Red Army is reviewed at great length.From the attempts at mastering horsemanship, by a raw recruit from Officer School who had never been astride a horse before, to long overnight movements, upto 100 kilometres in strict silence and darkness, that were part of what is known as 'regrouping prior to an offensive' the author takes us through cavalry life from the mundane care of one's mount to the very exciting cavalry charge into the very teeth of enemy positions.Very informative account by 'one who was there'."},{"Title":"On The Roads Of War: A Soviet Cavalryman On The Eastern Front","review":"This is an honest and convincingly objective record of, improbably, living through a hideous nightmare. Yakushin is no Tolstoy, nor even a Grossman, and this memoir is a far cry from \\"literature\\", great or otherwise.But, the reader cannot help gaining a realistic picture of what it was like to be a small man helping with and surviving a great achievement--defeating, with inferior resources and a less than stellar organization, the greatest military machine ever assembled, itself committed to fighting to the death for perhaps the most evil cause in human history.If for no other reason than to provide counterpoint to the many German writings on this struggle that emphasize Nazi heroics and betrayals and their bravery in slaughtering the \\"Asiatic hordes\\", this is a valuable record. At least the reader doesn't finish the book wondering who won."},{"Title":"Hitler's U-Boat War: Vol 2","review":"This second volume of this definitive work is also the second installment of the work that is the intellectual monument to Clay Blair.People have accused Mr. Blair of lacking a human face, yet the sparse prose describing life and death battles between grim, determined men is eloquent in its terse and relentless depiction of the brutality, courage and fear of war. Anyone who has been down to sea in ships needs no more stimulating of the imagination that Mr. Blair provides to understand and wonder at the courage of the men in the U-Boats and men who defeated them.The only failing in the book is a strangely discordant and increasingly strident reactionary and anti-British tone that creeps into his work. Since I do not know of the personal details of Mr. Blair's life it is only speculation, but I do feel I detect failing health in his later pages of this volume.It is a pity that while Mr. Blair was so generous of his praise of Britain in Volume 1 he suddenly loses empathy with his British allies and fails to understand the British psyche and the multitudinous problems faced by the war-weary British as they struggled with lack of resources, over worked ships and under trained crews and all the time against a backdrop of fading strength and dying empire. This failure, most manifest in the latter half of volume two, is jarring. At the same time as his anti-British sentiments become more and more unreasonable, so does his extreme support of a pro-US Navy establishment view on the actions of Admiral King in 1942 and 1943.But this two-volume work is the stuff that us mere consumers of naval history can only gawp at admiration. The reader has a brain and is capable of agreeing or disagreeing with the tone of a volume and to adjudge if the author has or has not been unduly harsh. The breadth of knowledge, the grasp of Naval warfare, the obvious majesty of these two volumes means you just have to unreservedly recommend them as the best general history on the subject available."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"I first read the Emily of New Moon series years and years ago when my mother gave me the copies she'd received for Christmas 1942! The Anne of Green Gables books are wonderful but after Anne and Gilbert are married they lose something.

M. Montgomery. I became a devoted fan of hers since I have read the 'Anne' books. I really love them a great deal and Emily of New Moon is just as tempting as them. I didn't think I could love it as much as I do with the 'Anne' books. I spot the difference and similarity between Emily and Anne. Anne is more mature while Emily more childlike. They both adore writing but Emily loves it better. Anne is more stubborn and fanciful. Anne led a happier existence in Green Gables. Emily was contented to live in New Moon, though, but in a way different from Anne. She had a stern Aunt Elizabeth, who loved her but just locked the love for her niece up inside. Her adventures were very very funny and amusing too. L. M. Montgomery made the other characters in the story very lovable. And each of them had their own characteristics. The story gets more and more gripping towards the end. I could't help reading it till I finished the whole story. It is a story which makes you feel delighted and young and energetic. And I am going to read the rest of this series---Emily climbs and Emily's quest and other books written by L. M. Montgomery"},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"And yes, like others have said, it's better than Anne.The Emily series( New Moon, Emily Climbs, Emily's Quest) trace Emily Starr's voyage through adolescence to early adulthood.It's probably best for older readers as it contains references to sexuality and the supernatural that may be inappropriate for kids or just not appreciated by the younger reader.I've read almost everything by Montgomery that's published(except for two books), and this is, in my opinion, the best series. Anne of Green Gables is a tour de force of a book, but the series as a whole isn't that great. The Emily series is a sheer masterpiece that's not to be missed, especially for older readers. I read it when I was twelve and read the entire series every year.. it's better every time.

All through the story, Emily meets new people and friends. Some will help her on her way to becoming a writer, \\"a painter that uses words\\". Others will shoot her dreams down, as if they were nothing but mere dust. Just watch her take on all the distressing incidents that she overcomes with an intellect beyond her years.She's always on a new enchanting romp, that'll keep you guessing. From giving up her beloved cat, to clashing with Miss Brownell (her unjust schoolteacher), to unraveling an age-old puzzle with her whimsical mind, you'll stay right by Emily's side the whole time.Here's a small excerpt that I especially enjoyed:\\"But there is a destiny which shapes the ends of young misses who are born with the itch for writing tingling in their baby fingertips, and in the fullness of time this destiny gave to Emily the desire of her heart---gave it to her, too, on the very day when she most needed it.\\"Personally, I have to state that this book is very inspirational for anyone endeavoring a priceless dream.

In fact, I spent my entire 10 year old savings on LM Montgomery books after reading Emily of New Moon.The Emily books are darker, more grown up, than the Anne books, and a year never goes by that I don't reread Emily. The heartbreaks (losing her dad, having to choose which cat to leave behind), the fears, and the triumphs that Emily goes through felt true when I was a young girl, and still feel true nearly two decades later.It breaks my heart that LM Montgomery books periodically go out of print. I encourage anyone who wants to own her books to get them when they see them, or they may have to wait a long time for them to come back into print."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"As a child, Emily of New Moon was, quite literally, my favorite book. Somehow, years later, it manages to still be up there with The Picture of Dorian Gray, Lolita, and Vanity Fair on my \\"favorites\\" shelf.It is, truth be told, a classic, and a sorely underrated one to boot. While the Anne series seems to be omnipresent, I know very few people who have heard of Emily, let alone read the books.As a character, Emily is brilliantly drawn and realistic; she is never portrayed with condescension. Quite the opposite, even when she is entirely in the wrong, the reader manages to sympathize and understand her. The plot itself, though interesting, is mostly enjoyable because of Emily's perspective. Other characters, such as Dean Priest (my personal favorite), Teddy, and Ilse manage to avoid being stereotypes or Emily's \\"backup band\\" and become full-fleshed characters in their own right.Whether you are an adult with a child or wishing you were a child, or even an adult just looking for a relatively light read that has actual quality (various romance novel queens, I'm glaring at YOU), pick up a copy of Emily, make some tea, curl up, and enjoy this strange little girl."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"\\"Emily of New Moon\\" is about a girl named Emily Byrd Starr.

For those lookign for the effervesence of Anne would be disappointed. But there is something deeper to Emily than Anne. Something which reaches out to the readers. She is not one who would immediately capture hearts like Anne, but she is one who you would remember longer. I loved Anne - and it was with a lot of &quot;she-cant-be-that-good&quot; feeling taht I started on Emily - and I couldnt stop the read. I jumped to Emily Climbs the next morning and hunted high and low for the next day (the search ending in success) for Emiy's quest. This is a magnificent series - much better than the Anne series. My sole disappointment is that there are only three in the series where Anne had a huge full series to herself. I think Emily touches you more because she is a more real person than Anne. She suffers and cries as we all do - her pride is somethign which is understandable - her hidden desires and fantasies are all so magnificently protrayed by LMMontgomery. There can be no better read for anyone than these books."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"This is a delightful book! In some ways, it is like Anne of Green Gables--Emily is a orphan who goes to live with strict guardian--but it has its own special charm. The characters are more developed, though I LOVED Marilla, Matthew, and the rest of Avonlea, Cousin Jimmy, Aunt Nancy, Aunt Elizabeth, Dr.Burnley, and Mrs.Kent(Teddy's mother) is even more interesting. The Murray clan is absolutely hilarious! And Emily's friends are pretty special too. They are all unique--hot-tempered Ilse, crude but lovable Perry, and Teddy(my favorite!) Each episode is a work of art--and the adventures are even more delightful looking through Emily's eyes in her letters to her Father. Emily gives a special tang to everything--she isn't as sweet as Anne or as lovable as Pat, but there is something about her--mysterious, passionate, ambitious--which makes her just as delightful, or even more so."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"Anne of Green Gables may be L.M. Montgomery's best-known book, but it doesn't deserve to be. While Anne is somewhat superficial and Pollyanna-ish, Montgomery gave Emily all the light and darkness of a living being. Emily's character is developed through her own eyes as she writes in her journal, but a hillarious, pathetic, wise, and unforgettable supporting cast prevent the books from being to introspective.Montgomery does occasionally fall into her besetting sin of over-flowery descriptions, but they in no way detract from the haunting beauty of this series."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"Emily of New Moon is starry, poignant, and captivating. Orphaned Emily Byrd Starr comes to New Moon lonely and friendless, to live with her Mother's relations, the Murrays.The Murrays are not willing to take her in, but are proud and consider it their duty to bring Emily up, as she is a member of their clan. Her Aunt Elizabeth brings her the New Moon, and is cold and harsh and stern. But her sweet Aunt Laura, and kindly Cousin Jimmy provide Emily with support.In Emily's imagination, loyal friends Ilse Burnley, Teddy Kent and Perry Miller, as well as her passionate love of writing, Emily finds hope and friendliness in her new World.Emily is often compared to Anne of Green Gables, but they hold their differances. Anne is all liveliness and hot temper and sweetness; Emily is vivid, both light and dark, with enough mystery in her to allure.This book is beautifully written and delicate, full of subtle wit and humour, and wonderful complexity as it describes Emily's adventures while living at New Moon. Emily is spirited and charming and ambitious, and the Emily series portray a unique child developing into womanhood."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"It always bothers me that I have to find all of L.M. Montgomery's books in the children's section at bookstores. I always feel vaguely silly looking at books that are placed in the same category with the Goosebumps series. I must admit though, even though I am male, I find every single one of Montgomery's books to be full of humor, poignancy, and just plain joy de vivre.The Emily series is no exception. I actually enjoy this series better than the Anne series, with the possible exception of Rilla of Ingleside. Emily is my favorite of all of Montgomery's heroines, and I find her supporting characters to be absolutely irresistable, especially Isme. The whole series made me laugh, cry, the whole sentimental cycle.Often I am amazed at the subtlety of Montgomery's humor and the little insights into life that are peppered throughout her books. I have never considered them to be children's books. Merely because kids will enjoy a book does not make it suddenly a sophmoric work. The literary world has long ignored this Canadian Sunday school teacher, and I hope that one day Lucy Maude Montgomery will be recognized for her astounding achievements in her chosen field."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"Sheltered by her loving father, 10-year-old Emily Byrd Starr has never minded her isolated life. What child notices poverty and a lack of playmates when her intelligence and imagination make each day special and exciting?Then one terrible day, Emily finds herself an orphan. A mass of never-before-met aunts and uncles descend upon Emily, criticizing and making plain the fact that whoever takes the child is only doing so out of their sense of duty.Still reeling from the loss of her father, Emily must also leave her beloved little home and pets for New Moon, her mother's childhood home, where unmarried aunts Elizabeth and Laura currently reside. It is with stern matriarch Elizabeth, gentle, loving Laura and \\"simple-minded\\" Cousin Jimmy that Emily must now learn to form a family.Despite the hardships, Emily's new life is quickly filled with many joys, as she makes friends at the village school and develops her interest for writing. Emily also experiences -- at the most unexpected moments -- \\"the flash,\\" her word for the brief startling glimpses of other-worldliness, which has the power to change both her life and the lives of others around her.Ask most people what they associate with L.M. Montgomery, and they'll likely say Anne of Green Gables. Yet despite the fame of Montgomery's \\"other orphan,\\" the Emily books are quite possibly even more memorable and beautifully written. Like Anne, Emily is thrust into an unfamiliar world, where she must make the best of circumstances; but unlike Anne, Emily is possessed of a strangely adult maturity even at the tender age of ten, a glimpse of darkness which will accompany her through the years. This streak makes readers both more concerned for her well-being and perhaps more able to relate, as she is not nearly as happy-go-lucky and childlike as Anne in her early years.If you enjoy this book, be sure to read \\"Emily Climbs\\" and \\"Emily's Quest,\\" which follow the girl through her years at high school, through romantic relationships and her writing career as a young woman."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"Although Emily has a lot of things in common with Anne--both eleven-year-old orphans who live on Prince Edward Island in the nineteenth century--she is a different kind of girl, and hers is a different kind of story. It's great from beginning to end, and the mystery of Ilse's mother had me on the edge of my seat--great suspense. The only thing I didn't like about the story was that it said mean, untrue things about atheists. But I suppose it was a product of its time."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"At the beginning of &quot;Emily of New Moon&quot;, Emily Byrd Starr is orphaned when her father dies from a long-drawn-out heart problem that resulted from his wife's death five years ago. Consequently, Emily is sent to live with her mother's family: the Murrays (Aunt Elizabeth, Aunt Laura, and Cousin Jimmy) from Blair Water on New Moon Farm (in Prince Edward Island, Canada). The head of the family, Aunt Elizabeth, remains Emily's biggest obstacle to overcome. She refuses Emily to wear bangs, associate with certain friends, or trespass in Lofty John's orchard. But the worst rule is that Emily is not allowed to read or write fiction, including poetry. Emily, of course, gets away with the other three things (not without consequences, of course), but when Aunt Elizabeth reads her journal, especially the bit about herself, Emily is certain her aunt will send her away for good.Emily's other two relatives are much more agreeable though, particularly Cousin Jimmy who understands her need to create stories. He, too, loves poetry and strongly encourages her to continue writing, which, Emily believes, is her lot in life.In addition, she makes friends with three neighbors (Teddy, Perry, and Ilse), but her friendship with Ilse is the strongest. Despite their hot-and-cold relationship, Emily is fiercely loyal to her best friend. So, when Emily hears a rumor from two of her gossipy aunts about the scandalous disappearance of Ilse's mother, Emily vows to uncover the truth, even while she's deliriously ill with measles.This is a great book for 11+ year-old girls, as are all of L.

These books have a dark, starry and mysterious beauty all their own. The series reflects the maturity and mastery which LMM attained near the end of her life in the artistic, sometimes flowery, portrayal of very special people growing in mind, spirit and body. In the Emily-Series, she describes not only Emily's own story, but also the influence her life has on the persons in her environment.Emily is destined, no, she is fore-ordained, to become a writer. And she must suffer all the heights and depths which such a sensitive soul must suffer to attain her calling in life. Lucy Montgomery does a wonderful job of describing this very special child and her struggles, leading to the moment in which Emily passes the threshold between childhood and womanhood.Interesting is also Lucy Montgomery's autobiographic influence in these novels. Interesting also, that Emily is psychic, her recurring &quot;flashes&quot; allowing her for short periods to penetrate the veil between this world and the spiritual world around us. Lucy Montgomery would never have had the liberty to write such things in the Anne-Series, also reflecting her growing maturity and self-assuredness as a writer. The pain involved in Emily's growth is sometimes so intense, that the novels even effected me personally. I have read all three books several times, so I warn anybody who wants to take up the challenge: once you start, you won't be able to put them down, so make sure you have enough free time available."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"I first got to know LMM after watching the entire Anne of green Gables movies.

I remember loving and identifying with Emily, and thinking Aunt Elizabeth was as cruel and tyranical as ever a woman could be. Now, eight years later, I am maturing, and can see Aunt Elizabth's viewpoint in more than a few of the squabbles she and Emily have. Also, I am more than a little conservative, and Emily, more so than what I remember, is a spoiled brat; at least, at the outset of the novel. Her poetry, I suspected, was quite good, although, obviously, very childish and verbosely overdrawn. I have to agree with what another reviewer wrote about \\"Emily Climbs\\". The family situations and home lives of all four main characters, Emily and her friends, are rather remarkable, and would make for a fascinating psychological case, if they were described in more detail. I have yet to read the other two books, but I think they will appeal more to me than this one has, because Emily is maturing, and becoming less impulsive, melodramatic, and emotionally intense, the way I was when a child. She is behaving more responsibly, and seems to have more of a regard for others' feelings as the books progress, another good sign, since self-absorption is never appreciated."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"As an avid Anne fan, I found myself disappointed with the first Emily book.

For some reason, I found the events of her life to be uninteresting and nearly didn't finish the book because it was such a drag to read. Perhaps this book is more suitable for younger readers around Emily's age, while Anne's is a more timeless saga that will enchant even the older set. All in all, I found Emily and her story to be extremely childish and boring, although L.M. Montgomery's fine writing skill still shined through, which is why I gave the book 3 stars."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"I find this book to be a manifestation of LM's homosexual desires. I think that I am the only one to see this because I am gay myself.I am especially pleased to hear about the *friendship* between Emily and Laura, which they play down in order to not be found out by their other family members. To me, they seem to be more than &quot;just friends&quot;.On the brighter side, I enjoy reading LMs description of cousin Jimmy. I've been having dreams about Jimmy and I in the park.I recommend this book for all gays. I just don't think that straights can appreciate it."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"Of all the Montgomery novels I have read, I find the &quot;Emily&quot;-Series the best. These books have a dark, starry and mysterious beauty all their own. The series reflects the maturity and mastery which LMM attained near the end of her life in the artistic, sometimes flowery, portrayal of very special people growing in mind, spirit and body. In the Emily-Series, she describes not only Emily's own story, but also the influence her life has on the persons in her environment.Emily is destined, no, she is fore-ordained, to become a writer. And she must suffer all the heights and depths which such a sensitive soul must suffer to attain her calling in life. Lucy Montgomery does a wonderful job of describing this very special child and her struggles, leading to the moment in which Emily passes the threshold between childhood and womanhood.Interesting is also Lucy Montgomery's autobiographic influence in these novels. Interesting also, that Emily is psychic, her recurring &quot;flashes&quot; allowing her for short periods to penetrate the veil between this world and the spiritual world around us. Lucy Montgomery would never have had the liberty to write such things in the Anne-Series, also reflecting her growing maturity and self-assuredness as a writer. The pain involved in Emily's growth is sometimes so intense, that the novels even effected me personally. I have read all three books several times, so I warn anybody who wants to take up the challenge: once you start, you won't be able to put them down, so make sure you have enough free time available."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"This book is a must read for Anne of Green Gables fans. It isso beautifully done. It has a wonderful, thrilling surprise ending.There are similarities between Anne and Emily. They both want to be authors, they are both orphans.

You are really missing out if you think this book is only for 9-12 year olds."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"I loved these book as an adult and I gave my four 4-H members in baking the first in this series for finishing theirprojects.

I highly recommend this for reading."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"Written by the same author who wrote \\"Anne of Green Gables\\", the story of Emily who comes to live at New Moon on Prince Edward Island is just as good. Emily, like Anne, is an orphan and is taken in by her mother's wealthy relatives. Being 11 yrs. old when the story begins, she has many things to learn about life and her place in the world. Not only is the book entertaining, but Emily solves an old mystery which affects the lives of some of her best friends. I would recommend it for ages 11-12 and up."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"\\"Emily didn't know that was being pitied.\\"This observation is made by Lucy Maud Montgomery in describing her favorite character of mine: Emily of New Moon. Emily lives with her father and caretaker Ellen Greene in a house in the hollow, which is situated in a grassy dale. Emily doesn't much care for Ellen, but she loves her father. She also has the company of her cats, the wind whom she calls Wind Woman, and the trees for whom she also has names. In the opening chapter, her father is sick. Once he drifts off to sleep, Emily slips away for a twilight walk.\\"Do you know that your pa has only a week or two more to live?\\"These words of Ellen greet Emily upon her return from her glorious walk. When her father awakes later, he berates Ellen for having revealed this truth to Emily in such a hurtful way.Then he shares memories with Emily of her mother and of the Murray clan.When he dies, Ellen still doesn't offer Emily comfort. She informs Emily that her relatives are coming to the house to decide who will raise her. Emily expresses the wish that her relatives will love her. Ellen denies her even this hope, calling Emily a strange child because she lives in her imagination as well as advising Emily that people don't love strange children.Upon their arrival, the relatives pick Emily apart in her presence, meaning they argue about who she looks and acts like down to whose forehead she has. Emily declares to their faces that they make her feel like \\"scraps and patches\\". Her relatives order her to leave, but Emily hides under the table to hear her fate. When the relatives begin to criticize her father, Emily gives herself away by rushing out and yelling at them in her father's defense. Tired of her outbursts, the relatives draw straws to determine who should take her. The rest of the book is about her life with the \\"winners\\".Although I love Anne of Green Gables, Emily of New Moon is my favorite creation of Lucy Maud Montgomery. Both girls are imaginative, outspoken, and passionate. Yet unlike Anne, Emily is more introverted with darker moods and less social grace. Perhaps for these reasons, Emily is often rejected for her differences, rather than embraced and loved like Anne. Therefore, I feel more akin to Emily."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"\\"Emily of New Moon\\" is the initial entry of famed author Lucy Maud Montgomery's trilogy about a young girl growing up on Prince Edward Island, Canada. The dark-haired, gray-eyed Emily Byrd Starr is stubborn and imaginative, and has a gift for writing. The death of her beloved father leaves her dependent on the charity of her proud Murray relatives at the family farm of New Moon. Her maiden Aunt Elizabeth takes up the duty of raising Emily by the strictest of rules; she and Emily will do repeated battle over Emily's need to express herself.\\"Emily of New Moon\\" is an absolutely engaging story. Author Lucy Maud Montgomery adroitly introduces Emily to new relatives, playmates, life lessons, and adult mentors who provide varying degrees of encouragement (or discouragement) for her writing talents. Along the way, Montgomery prepares the ground for the follow-on books. She cleverly sets up future romantic dynamics among Emily and her playmates, and a problematic mentorship relationship with an older man whose motivatation might be suspect. The most significant plot resolution of \\"Emily of New Moon\\" is an incident which appears to demonstrate that Emily is \\"fey\\", that she has the ability to see \\"beyond the curtain\\" of everyday reality.Lucy Maud Montgomery's \\"Emily\\" trilogy is thought to reflect the famed author's emotionally starved childhood and difficult apprenticeship as a writer in a way the happier \\"Anne of Green Gables\\" series never did. \\"Emily of New Moon\\" has a darker tone than the \\"Anne\\" series, but is every bit as entertaining, and is highly recommended to Montgomery's fans."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"Famed Canadian author Lucy Maud Montgomery began her \\"Emily\\" trilogy shortly after completing what she thought would be her last \\"Anne of Green Gables\\" novel. \\"Emily of New Moon\\" is thought to more closely capture the difficult, emotionally starved childhood of the young Montgomery than the happier \\"Anne\\" stories.As \\"Emily of New Moon\\" opens, the young Emily Byrd Starr is orphaned by the death of her father. Her Murray relatives draw lots to determine who shall have the duty of raising her. Emily ends up with her austere maiden Aunt Elizabeth at New Moon Farm. Aunt Elizabeth is strict in her ways, and feels duty-bound to repress Emily's imagination and her gifts as a writer. Emily will be driven to conceal her talents.On the positive side, New Moon brings Emily more sympathetic relatives in Aunt Laura and Cousin Jimmy; new playmates Teddy Kent, Perry Miller, and Ilsa Burnley; and the opportunity to go to school.\\"Emily of New Moon\\" is an engaging story, taking Emily up through the age of twelve, but the novel is clearly devoted to laying the groundwork for its two sequels. Emily will absorb the usual childhood lessons in life. Along the way, she will receive just enough positive feedback to enable her to persist in her writing, while coping with the rather frightening gift of \\"fey\\" from her Scottish ancestors that enables her to solve a poignant family mystery.\\"Emily of New Moon\\" is very highly recommended to fans of L.M.

These books are fabulous nothing like the awful tv show they made of it."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"Years ago, when I was about 8, my uncle gave me all three of these books for Christmas. I immediately fell in love! I have read all three multiple times, whereas I have only read two of the Anne of Green Gables books, they simply never held my interest the way Emily does! The only sad part is, when I went to college, I packed up most of my \\"little girl\\" books, such as these three and the Laura Ingalls Wilder series and put them in the attic to save for my little girl (someday). I was estatic to see that they are available in a Kindle version, so there is no need to go home to Texas (from WV) and dig out my old favorites!

It's not like other teen books, and that's one of the reasons it's so good. Emily doesn't really have a boyfriend, she doesn't go to a big high school where she's the most popular and pretty girl, she never says &quot;as if,&quot; and she doesn't wear clothes her parents would be ashamed of...in fact, the book is set a long time ago in a place called Prince Edward Island, the author's favorite place in the whole world.Anyone who has not read this book is missing out on making a new friend -- Emily seems so much like a &quot;real&quot; person, and is explained so well, that you will feel like you have made a new buddy in the process of reading this book. By the author of Anne of Green Gables."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"It is difficult for me to write an objective review about this beloved classic. Emily is like a childhood friend to me. Created by the author of Anne of Green Gables, she is a more complex character than Anne - introspective, determined, and deeply sensitive to life's joys and shadows. Her love for writing, or her need to write, defines her; indeed, much of the story is told through her writing. And yet this first book of the Emily trilogy is mostly lighthearted, though not without its passages of intense experience. Emily is orphaned in the beginning of the book, and moves to the farm of New Moon to live with two estranged aunts and one uncle, their brother. She thrives and flourishes in the beautifully prosaic, quaint world of New Moon and Blair Water on Prince Edward Island. Though she is a private and secretive person, she gives lavishly of herself in her closest friendships.Montgomery's writing is at times indulgently over-descriptive, but not without vividity, wryness, feeling, and rich character development. Perhaps the most eloquent aspect of Emily of New Moon is its flavorful honesty about life both light and dark. Emily is a complex character, full of both faults and virtues, neither of which are expressed simplistically. The reader's sympathies are always with her. Montgomery's indirect insights into the writing life are also very valuable. Emily has writing in her blood, sees it as something intrinsically personal and sacred but wants to share it, does it with abandon yet later throws it away, and yearns to climb the ladder of fame. In this sense, I feel more kinship with her than with her more popular sister Anne Shirley."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"From the opening pages the reader is submerged in Emily's world.In my mind Emily of New Moon is the begining of one of the best book trilogies ever written. A story about the courage it takes to be true to ones self no matter the opposition, the power of real determination and true friendship. One cannot help but be moved by the powerful truths, and innocent loveliness contained in this book. EONM is quite simply a multi faceted masterwork that could hardly be improved upon in any way. A deeply moving and relavent novel who's beauty only grows with time. Mothers, sisters, daughters, aunts, read this book then gift it to someone you love."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"Like many others, I came to this book as a child after exhausting the Anne series and still craving more of the world L.M. Montgomery created. Anne was my favorite as a child, which you can tell by comparing my beat-up copy of Anne of Green Gables and the nearly-pristine copy of Emily of New Moon. I still have a special place in my grownup heart for Anne, but in recently rereading Emily of New Moon, I discovered so many similarities between me and that poetic little girl who gets \\"the flash.\\"I love all Montgomery's books because it's fascinating to read about a time when children were expected to behave so differently from today in a place that seems lovely and peaceful compared to today's busy world of computers, video games and television. It's nice to read about a child who so strongly relied on her imagination; I hope to teach my future children to do the same."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"Ten-year-old Emily Starr always felt that she had the most wonderful life. She never felt lonely, as she was blessed enough to live with her beloved Father, her adored cats, Saucy Sal, and Mike, and a collection of fine books for her to read at anytime. It didn't even bother her to have Ellen, her somewhat wicked housekeeper around. But in one quick instant Emily's life is suddenly turned upside down. After having a fine life she receives the news that her Father is dying, and when he does finally pass, 10-year-old Emily is left an orphan, and is suddenly forced to move to New Moon Farm with her mean Aunt Elizabeth, who makes her choose only one of her beloved cats to accompany her during the move. Emily's only solace from her depression of her Father's death, and dealing with her stern Aunt are the new friends she makes: Ilse, a tomboy with an extreme temper; Teddy, a fantastic artist; and Perry, also a newcomer to school, who has sailed all over the world with his Father. Soon, thanks to her new adventures and friends, Emily realizes that New Moon isn't that bad at all, and maybe, just maybe, she'll be able to think of herself as Emily of New Moon.This is my second L.M. Montgomery novel, and I was very pleased by the outcome of it. Emily is a strong-willed, hard-headed character, with a sense of adventure, whom stands up for everything, and everyone, that she believes in. Her Aunt is an exciting character, even though she is a bit cruel, and her friends are three people whom the reader longs to know and be friends with in reality. The descriptions are so vivid, realistic, and beautiful that you actually feel as if you are with Emily, running along the trails and through the gardens of New Moon. A must-have book for all fans of novels with a bit of history tucked into them.Erika Sorocco"},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"I know a lot of people are saying that the \\"Emily\\" books are better than the \\"Anne\\" books, but I will always remain a true-blue Anne fan. That said, I have to admit that there is something special about Emily and the Emily series as a whole that is lacking in the Anne books. I think it reflects more on the fact that LMM was already an established and mature writer when she wrote the Emily books (whereas \\"Anne of Green Gables\\" was her first full-length novel), than on the characters of the two series. Also, the differences reflect on the different time-periods they were written in: the first two Anne books were written well before the outbreak of the First World War, and reflect some of the priggishness and smugness of the Victorian world-view still prevalent then; the Emily books are entirely a product of the more free-thinking 1920s (though they are set pre-WWI). Anne is a child in many ways - even after marriage; Emily is a woman even at the age of eleven. Anne's vivacious personality is genuinely appealing, but Emily's intensity has its place too. Emily is a lot more realistic than Anne ever is - both as a character and a person. And I identify far more with Emily than with Anne - e.g. I experience something similar to Emily's flash, and my inner world has many similarities to hers.I thought the best part about \\"Emily of New Moon\\" was the last chapter, where Emily's teacher evaluates her work. When I read the title of the chapter - \\"Emily's great moment\\" - I thought that it would be a stereotypical ending, where the heroine takes the world by storm and retires heaped with laurels - in other words, completely unbelievable! But the low-key ending was superb. I loved the fact that Emily was vindicated in her own eyes and the only others that mattered, i.e. Mr. Carpenter's. In short, being a chart-topper is not *the* (or even *a*) criterion for being a good writer.The only thing I disliked about this book is the supernatural element, not being a believer in the paranormal myself. Oh, and I cannot stand Teddy Kent - what does Emily see in him?!To conclude - a good book, though the sequel \\"Emily Climbs\\" is better (I have yet to read \\"Emily's Quest\\"). Read it if you like LMM, and whether you like Anne or not."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"When I was a child, I found the story of Emily after reading most of the Anne of Green Gables series. I remember LOVING Emily for the brave heroine she seemed to be. I recently bought the books again and just finished the first book. I didn't realize how much Emily has declined in my admiration over the years.After her father dies of consumption, Emily's mother's siblings gather to decide who she will live with. When her sour Aunt Elizabeth wins responsibility, Emily is taken to the family farm, New Moon, where tradition and pride are the hallmarks (or hindrances). Aunt Elizabeth's sternness is tempered by Aunt Laura's kindness; Cousin Jimmy, the lone male on the place, provides a sympathetic ear to Emily's spirit, much like Matthew did in the Anne books. When Emily starts school, she makes friends with Teddy, Ilse, and Perry, three neighborhood children. As a group, they negotiate the next two years with most of the action centering around Emily getting into trouble; not only does she have to be rescued when she falls over a cliff, she cuts a bang after being forbidden to do that, and then cuts off the rest of her hair to try to hide what she had done. Emily charms most of the people she meets and wins their heart, but can she win over the heart of Aunt Elizabeth?This was an OK book, but it wasn't as good as I remember. Aunt Elizabeth is far too un-relenting; we only get momentary glimpses of her real concern for her niece til the end, when she gets mad at Emily for writing the truth about her. What does the woman expect after how she has treated her and they spend the whole book arguing? I found Emily's psychic episode a little unbelievable, coming out of the blue; their explanation is a little too pat, that the great-granmdother had the second sight. And, it may just be my adult nature, but what human being gets into this many \\"scrapes\\"? I was klutzy, but the child falls over a cliff picking flowers!And that brings me to a slightly troubling topic. It's fairly obvious Dean Priest is romantically interested in Emily. This would be fine, except he's old enough to be her father, he knew her father in college, and she's 12! He tells her he will be the one to teach her the romantic talk, he visits her when she is sick there are several other things he does that set off my creepy meter. I couldn't understand how her family didn't question his intentions. Even setting aside the fact that young girls married older men in those days and it was more acceptable, there is a 20-something year age difference that is unappealing.I am going to read the other two books in the series, but I'm not sure if I want to share these books with my child. Til I decide, I'll stick with Anne of Green Gables."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"Emily isn't as easy to love as the amiable Anne, it's true. Emily is a much more trouble young girl with deep passions and strange ways that few in her world can understand. Her world is not all sunshine and happiness, and she had neither the desire nor the abilities to make it so. Emily goes to live with her aunts at New Moon after the death of her father. There is not much love between Aunt Elizabeth and her new charge, and frankly thinks Emily a weird little alien creature. Emily takes solace in writing unintentionally hilarious epistles to her father, pouring out her childish heart. Many adventures and interesting characters are met along the way, making the world of Emily an interesting one, if at times a little dark.The first in the series, \\"Emily of New Moon\\" is a much darker story than Anne. Emily still has a lot of her childish ways throughout the book, but we get the chance to see her grow by the time the book ends. The second and third books are better than the first, but \\"Emily of New Moon\\" is a welcome addition to realistic children's literature, but it will enchant older readers as well."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"Since I was a little girl, I have been a devoted fan of Lucy Maud Montgomery and all she has written. I read Anne of Green Gables with enthuasiasm, and gratefully snatched up Emily of New Moon when it was offered. Emily of New Moon is a wonderful book for certain people of all ages. This is so because the book is chocked full of everything wonderful from the world as viewed by a child of one hundred years ago--if your reading style does not allow for whimsy and delight, I do not suggest it. However, I, as have many other little girls of past and present, slowly grew up right along with Emily, and part of what I am is thanks to Montgomery and her wonderful and inspiring characters. Even now, far past the &quot;reading level&quot; posted in Montgomery's books, and especially the Emily books, I read them over and over; each time, finding something new and wonderful to read back on!"},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"It's difficult to do justice to this book through simple words, yet it is part because of Emily that I can do as well as I can. I had always wanted to write, but no book series was as inspiring to me as Emily. Although I usually read fantasy books, my battered, dog-eared, falling apart copies of the Emily books are the only books I read again and again-every year. I've owned them since I was ten, and I'm sixteen at the time of this review, and their charms have only grown. Every time I open them, I greet again my friends at New Moon farm, I hear the Wind Woman in the trees, I'm petting Daffy and Saucy Sal. I remember the first time I read them, I was reading in public somewhere, and I burst into tears as I read about Emily's father's death. Now that's good stuff. These books are utter perfection."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"On the surface, Emily of New Moon is very much a copy of Anne of Green Gables. Emily and Anne are both orphans; they both go to live on a farm; they're both writers; the similarities go on and on. But if you look deeper, you'll notice that Emily is different than Anne. Anne is a more surface type of person: Emily is more mysterious, more withdrawn. The best way I can think of explaining it is that Emily is a shadowy type of person: certainly not in a evil way, but it a dreamy, more than meets the eye, way. She always seems to have dreams and ideas and hopes fluttering around her. If you'd like to read about a character who has a wonderfully developed personality, a characer whom the author obviously loved, read Emily of New Moon. It's a great book."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"This book has stuck with me since I was nine years old...I am twenty one now, and a major in creative writing.

The Emily books are something that I am thinking of buying now (I am only eighteen) so that in the future my own children can read them. Emily is brave, artistic and real - her friends and family are not perfect, but are loveablein their own way. What seems to set this apart from the other Mongomery books is the references to underlying sexuality and Emily's own psychic ability and spirituality. Every time I read the novels I discover something else about myself - personal beauty within the soul is something that shines through the character of Emily. Her love for herself and for others is inspirational and uplifting.Incidently, the first time I read these books (nearly ten years ago) I didn't realise that Jimmy was mentally retarded. I thought he was just artistic and creative. I was upset when I realised that Jimmy was handicapped, because it meant that he wouldn't be taken seriously and that, in real life, people would take longer to see his inner beauty."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"Reading Emily of New Moon always makes me start picking up my pen and trying to write poems.

He was an interesting character. Maybe it's just I'm sorry for him."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"I read the Anne books first and I thought nothing could be better than them, but Emily is. What I like about her (better than Anne) is that she's an oddball. She isn't popular, and has only a few points of beauty, she always says whatever she feels like, and she has ESP. The book is great and so are the rest of the Emily novels and all of L.M. Montgomery's other books.

I believe I would even have to say that I loved the Emily series even more than Anne."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"L. M. Montgomery's books featuring Anne Shirley (especially the first installment, \\"Anne of Green Gables\\") are without question the most famous and beloved series by this gifted author. But many of her fans consider the \\"New Moon\\" trilogy starring Emily Byrd Starr Montgomery's best work, partly because of its autobiographical nature. Like Emily, Montgomery herself struggled for recognition in the literary world.When the sequels to \\"Anne of Green Gables\\" were written (after the popularity of the first book made publishers urge Montgomery to write sequels) they were done without any \`master-plan' in place to chronicle Anne's life experiences. As such, they read more as an ongoing serial in which the role of Anne gradually peters out as her she is replaced by her daughter Rilla as the protagonist of the series. Although the books are beautifully written, there is a sense that (with a few obvious exceptions, such as Anne's romance and subsequent marriage to Gilbert Blythe) Montgomery simply made them up as she went along.That is clearly not the case with the \\"New Moon\\" trilogy, in which each book is built on the previous installment, and several plot points such as Emily's familial ties, romances, friendships, education, physic gifts, and - most importantly - her ambitions as a writer are developed throughout the three books into a coherent whole. Anne's story trails along, Emily's has a structured arc.This leads to the next big difference between the two heroines: like Emily, Anne had the desire and skills to follow a literary career, one she eventually gives up in order to become a wife and mother. There is none of this for Emily Starr - she was born to be a writer, and every other subplot of the book (even her romantic entanglements) are secondary in the story to her desire to become an author. Anne's goodness and cheerfulness make her a great role model, but Emily's ambitions in what was still predominantly a man's world are truly inspirational.Emily lives an idyllic existence with her beloved father in the country, when she is cruelly told by the family housekeeper that her father has only a few more weeks to live. By chapter three she is an orphan, and to be adopted out to her mother's people, the stern and powerful Murray clan. After an awkward family reunion, Emily is taken in by her Aunt Elizabeth, a strict and somewhat unkind woman who has no idea how to deal with the young girl now in her care. The two quickly form a distrust and dislike of each other, despite Emily's repore with Aunt Laura and Cousin Jimmy who also live with Elizabeth at New Moon. At her new home there is plenty to keep her occupied: new friends to make, new countryside to explore and thousands of stories to hear and tell. Emily soon realises that her calling in life is to be a writer, and here we see her take the first steps (and missteps) toward her lofty goal.Furthermore, she soon makes three dear friends: the quiet and artistic Teddy, the mischievous Perry and the tomboy Ilse. These three friends are Emily's companions throughout the three books, though even here there is trouble brewing; romantic entanglements will inevitably arise in later books. Emily is also accorded unique physic abilities that manifest themselves once in every book; and I won't say anymore about that considering discovery the secret to the terrible mystery at the heart of Ilse's story is one of the best parts of the book. There is a spirituality and mysticism present in the \\"Emily\\" books that is somewhat missing from the domesticity of the Anne books: discussions on the nature of God, the legitimacy of other belief structures, and a palpable sense of the other-world. And - as is Montgomery's way - the story is littered with family anecdotes and letters/diary entries by Emily herself.Even those who do consider the Emily books Montgomery's greater achievement (including myself) will often still look upon the Anne books as more *enjoyable*. Compared to Anne, Emily's ongoing story is darker, grimmer, and at times even downright creepy. Unlike Anne who is orphaned as a baby, Emily must bear the full brunt of the grief that comes from a beloved parent dying and the abandonment issues that follow. Furthermore, Emily is surrounded by cast of characters who are considerably darker than Anne's extended family and friends. The stern but loving Marilla is replaced by the severe and strict Elizabeth and Emily has a much more difficult time at school, what with a sadistic schoolteacher and a betrayal from a false friend. Other associates also have darker sides to them; the otherworldly Cousin Jimmy who is hinted as having a mental disorder (due to the fact Elizabeth accidentally pushed him down the well in a fit of temper - yikes!), the intelligent but secretive Dean Priest whose hold over Emily will become more pronounced as the series continues, and Emily's proud and autocratic Murray family. There is only one truly \\"safe\\" character, and that is Aunt Laura. But despite her kindness and gentleness, she and Emily are not kindred spirits, for as Emily herself says at one point: \\"You can love someone without understanding them.\\" (And toward the end of the book there is a lovely moment in which Elizabeth comes through for Emily in a way that Laura does not).You can never get quite comfortable in the Emily books, especially not in the way you do with Anne. The Anne stories are too rich to be passed off as escapist flights of fancy - but when compared to Emily, they come rather close. Anne had a temper, but was otherwise the picture of perfection: generous, warm, golden-hearted. Emily on the other hand is a much more rounded character, with plenty of flaws to balance out her virtues. She is much more standoffish than Anne, and makes friends less easily (though once made she is the most devoted companion one could wish for). Where Anne was hot-tempered, Emily is haughty, where Anne was talkative, Emily is thoughtful, where Anne was easy-going, Emily is somewhat prideful. Some have complained it is easier to like Anne than it is to like Emily. To them I say: \\"Duh!\\" Montgomery is not looking to create another Anne, but a character that is completely different from her most famous orphan.I come to the end of this review and find that it is simply a comparison between \\"New Moon\\" and \\"Green Gables\\". I didn't set out to do that, but I think that in doing so one might be better prepared to approach Emily and her story. Anne Shirley came from L. M. Montgomery's heart, Emily Byrd Starr came from her soul."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"First, I would like to state that Emily of New Moon is one of my all time favorite books (and series). However, this particular edition has been abridged -- great stuff has been edited to make it shorter for younger readers. While this edition will give you an idea of Emily, please read the full unshortened version! I read the original when I was about 11, and I certainly would have enjoyed it read aloud to me years earlier. If you want to introduce your child to to L.M. Montgomery, go for the real thing, not the shortened version!"},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"One day, while skimming the shelves of the Young Adult section of the Library, I ran across 3 books. I noticed that they were from the same Author of &quot;Anne of GreenGables&quot; and I had truly loved those books, so I decided to get these new, mysterious books that I had never heard of. &quot;Emily of NewMoon&quot; &quot;Emily Climbs&quot; and &quot;Emily's Quest&quot;. I got home, jumped on my bed, and began reading. Looking up, I noticed I had finished 1/2 the book, and that a couple of hours had passed. I bought all 3 of them here, and I am SO happy that I did. I really don't know what more I can say, I just LOVE these books more than ANY possesion that I have. And that isn't a joke! They inspired me, and I have read EVERY other book of LLM's, but still, my favorites are the &quot;Emily&quot; series. I really hope that you buy this book, it's SO worth it. I read them over and over and over. and when I open the book, I know exactly where I am, and then I can't put it down! I LOVE LOVE LOVE THEM!"},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"I fell in love with the Emily books as a child, and have read them many times over the past fifteen years. Along with the Anne series and The Story Girl, they represent the best of LM Montgomery's fiction. Emily is similar in many ways to Anne (and to many of Montgomery's characters) - highly imaginative, sensitive, smart, a little different, an orphan, ambitious. She also has a darker side that Anne never displays; where Anne is impulsive and quick to forgive, Emily is intense and proud and holds grudges, sometimes for years. In some ways, her story is more developed than Anne's, and certainly at least as engaging.As a child, I identified strongly with Emily; now, as an adult, I still find her one of the most interesting and complex characters Montgomery has written. (Although the poetry makes one cringe at times.) I highly recommend this book to girls of all ages, but especially to those in the 10-14-year-old set who may think about \\"deeper\\" things than the silly crushes and dramas that enthrall their peers."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"This is the best book ever written by LM in my opinion. It is, in many ways, very different from her other books. It contains elements of horror and deep emotion not introduced in her other novels. Emily herself is the most unique, thoroughly developed character and is by far the most inspirational character I can think of. This book makes you want to get up and do wonderful things, but you can't because you won't put the book down! My own copy is yellowed and dog-eared from years of reading and re-reading it, and each time I do I discover something else new and wonderful about the plot, the many sub-plots, and the characters. This book has incredible depth, and is clean of any filth or meaningless words. It is a treasure in paper and ink, and I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys beautiful, captivating, suspence-filled literature. I'm 15 now and have read it about twice a year since I got it, and twice a year have been overwhelmed with the power and joy that fills it's pages. I also recommend the other sequels to this book. They are just as great as the first! P.S. I sure would have loved to see that TV series!"},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"The Emily of New Moon series is hands down, my favourite piece of children's literature. I first read them at age 9 or 10 when my brother gave them to me as a Christmas present and I've read them dozens of times since.It's unfortunate that so many times when we talk about Emily, it's to compare her to Anne. She can certainly stand on her own. But lots of the plot elements are the same: strong-willed orphan girl finds her way into the heart of confirmed bachelor and old maid(s). However, Emily is a more sophisticated character (and as an avid Anne addict, it pains me to say that.) She's is not the delightful Pollyanna that Anne was - she has some character flaws. Sometimes she's overly stubborn or overly proud. She has a lot of the characteristics I had as an eleven year old; perhaps that's why she's become such a favourite of mine.There are some darker aspects in this book too that readers of Montgomery's short stories will recognize: a near-death experience and an element of the supernatural.I found Emily's relationships more realistic too. She is taunted at school on the first day; she wonders if her Aunt Elizabeth loves her. Most children have the relationships that Emily had, ones that are passionate and loving, but often frustrating as well.The second and third books are even better prove as Emily's complicated love life evolves and her dreams of being a writer continue to elude her.If you're a parent I urge you to give these books to your children. I feel so glad I read them when I was young because Emily had a bit of a harder time of life, but still managed to be incredibly happy. For children who haven't yet met their real-life Diana Barrys or Gilbert Blythes, I highly recommend that they meet the fictional Emily Starr of New Moon.If you're an adult, you might find these books highly comforting too. I know I still like to read them on rainy days when the world is feeling a little harder than usual. The familiar style and the picturesque atmosphere are sure to comfort."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"I first read Emily of New Moon 17 years ago, when I was ten years old. I have never gotten her out of my head. In fact, I have even visited Prince Edward Island to see the place that was the setting for so many of LMM's stories. I would recommend this book to women of all ages."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"I read the &quot;Emily&quot; series for the first time when I was 12. It touched something deep inside of me. My father had just died, and I too wanted more than anything to be a writer. Emily spoke to me; her girlish wisdom echoed, so eloquently, the struggles I was going through at that time. It was the first time I ever felt kin to a character in a book, instead of admiring them from the sidelines. I've re-read this series countless times; whenever I'm depressed or feel as if I've lost touch with my self. Each time I read it, it's like visiting old friends and family, and I'm still finding insight and comfort within the dog eared pages. I'm going on 23 years old now, and I'm in the process of having my first novel published. Lucy Maud Montgomery has been a constant source of inspiration to me, a mother figure to my literary aspirations. She has given me a beautiful gift, and I hope you find as much joy in her stories as I have. Always; Emily"},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"After finishing Anne of Green Gables, I decided to pick up another L. M. Montgomery book. I was all set to pick up another Anne book, but then I found Emily of New Moon. I decided to try this book, to see if L. M. Montgomery could capture the beauty of words in another novel. She did.Emily of New Moon tells the story of young Emily Byrd Starr, who is left an orphan at the tender age of eleven. Her mother's family draws lots to decide who should take Emily in, and the lot fell to the Murrays of New Moon. Stern Aunt Elizabeth, loving Aunt Laura, and simple Cousin Jimmy brought Emily to New Moon Farm, where she had all sorts of adventures and basically just learned the lessons of life. Emily is a young heroine who many can relate to.L. M. Montgomery has written another beautiful novel. Emily's character is well-developed and lifelike, and New Moon seemed just like a real place to me. For anyone who is looking for a real piece of literature, Emily of New Moon or any of L. M. Montgomery's other works are the books for you!"},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"After the beloved \\"Anne of Green Gables\\" books the next longest series penned by L. M. Montgomery would be the \\"Emily of New Moon\\" Trilogy. This first volume was written in 1923, with \\"Emily Climbs\\" being published in 1925 and \\"Emily's Quest\\" in 1927. These works were all written after Montgomery had finished her initial run of the \\"Anne\\" books, which ended with \\"Rilla of Ingleside\\" in 1920 (Montgomery would not expand that series until years later, writing \\"Anne of Windy Poplars\\" in 1936 and \\"Anne of Ingleside\\" in 1939). Consequently, Montgomery was able to focus on the Emily books, with only \\"The Blue Castle,\\" her one \\"adult\\" romance, written in 1926, intervening.Although the major thread of the three books is how Emily Starr learns to become a successful writer, that element is a minor one in this first book. Once again, Montgomery presents us with a spirited orphan who has to live with her mother's relatives after her father dies (although Emily is young and less mature than Anne Shirley). But the twist here is that nobody wants Emily and it is only out a sense of duty that they make the young girl draw lots to see where she will live. Emily ends up with Elizabeth Murray, her mother's sister, at New Moon Farm on Prince Edward Island. Aunt Elizabeth disapproves of Emily's father and the way she was raised, and has no trouble communicating that to the child. Fortunately, while Aunt Elizabeth is the boss of New Moon, Aunt Laura treats Emily more kindly and Cousin Jimmy Murray \\"ain't quite all there,\\" but is a gentle soul as well.At the heart of \\"Emily of New Moon\\" are the heated confrontations between Emily and Aunt Elizabeth over matters ranging from the little girl's bangs to her love of writing and the letters she writes to her father \\"On the Road to Heaven.\\" Apparently Emily has enough of the Murray blood to affect the look of her grandfather when her dander is up, so she does not lose all of these battles. The most notable is when Aunt Elizabeth discovers the letters Emily has been secretly writing to her father. When she confronts her neice, expecting Emily to show dismay, shame, or fear over what she has done, Elizabeth is stunned by the righteous indignation from Emily that turns the tables with a vengeance.There is also a touch of mysticism in each of these books, for Emily has the second sight, which sets up the moving climax of this first book when Emily is taken ill. In her fevered imagination the curtain is lifted and she sees what happened to the mother of her friend, Isla Burnley. The worried adults say whatever they think Emily wants to here, but she knows they are lying. When Aunt Elizabeth agrees to go and get Isle's mother out of the old well, Emily calms down. \\"I know you'll keep your word,\\" she says. \\"You are very hard--but you never lie, Aunt Elizabeth.\\" Emily's second sight comes into play in each of the three novels, but never to as great effect as it does in this first one.Because they deal with the art of writing, the three Emily books are seen as being the most autobiographical of Montgomery's works. Certainly if anyone reading the Anne books or any of Montgomery's works is interested in pursuing a career as a writer, they should read the Emily books to get a real feel for how hard it is to be a good writer. But the stories can be enjoyed on their own even if you have decided you are going to be a reader and not a writer. Once young readers have gone through the Anne and Emily books, there is still \\"The Story Girl,\\" \\"Magic for Marigold\\" and many other L. M. Montgomery novels (and short story collections) for them to enjoy. I did not read any of them until I was in my thirties, so I can assure you it is never too late to start."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"If you have read the &quot;Anne&quot; books, this book is for you! Like Anne, Emily becomes an orphan and lives with her aunts and her uncle. She has many &quot;adventures.&quot; Even if you haven't read the Anne books, if you love good writing, you will love this book!"},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"When I finished reading &quot;Rilla of Ingleside&quot; I thought to myself &quot;I wish L.M. Montgomery wrote more novels about orphans like Anne&quot; To my pleasure and surprise, I was looking around Amazon.com and I came across the Emily series. My heart stopped beating for that second. I immediatly asked my parents if I could order them.My mom herself was and is and Anne of Green Gables fan. We ordered it and my goodness, I adore it more than Anne! In my opinion it is more touching.The tragic story of Emily Starr,losing her beloved father, not being invited to Rhoda's birthday party. Emily has so many talents. It's a pitty she had to burn the account book. In this book I laughed, my mom cried and oh, I just love this book!"},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"In Emily of New Moon I thought the first three chapters weren't as good as the rest of the book but it makes up for it. I think most everyone would enjoy it."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"I have loved the Emily books ever since I first read tehm about ten years ago (I am 19). At first I thought that nothing could be better than the Anne books but this is. I think it appeals to me because it is darker than the Anne series. I love Emily, to me she is a very real character and I want to know more about her. I think this is because of her super-natural abilities. I always wnated to find out what happend to her after the end of the last book."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"This is one of the best books written by L.M. Montgomery. I really enjoyed Emily's thoughts- some were quite funny, and the letters to her Father. Emily has a lot of guts,the things she thinks, says, and does! Ilse, Teddy, and Perry are a bunch of very unique people, I couldn't help not liking them!"},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"This book is like a time machine, when you read it you feel like you're right there with Emily. All of L.M. Montgomery's books are fantastic, but the Emily books are exsqusite. As I was reading the book, I felt as though Ilse, Perry, and Teddy were my friends, instead of Emily's. This book is sure to be one that I will read over and over again. I'm sure you will too."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"Emily of New Moon, and the rest of the Emily series in general should not be missed. I first got addicted while watching the Emily of New Moon series on Canadian TV (I live in Detroit, MI - so I get a couple Canadian TV stations on cable). It really is a shame that the US does not support excellent shows like the Emily TV series. Anyhow, getting back on point, I picked up the Emily books and was equally (if not more) hooked. I would only add that I think the series will appeal to both men and women of all ages alike. It is just one of those types of series that is a good read for the whole family (not just girls). I loved the Anne of Green Gables series very much, but I think Emily of New Moon is even better than those classics. I rate all three books in the series must reads."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"anne and emily books are all written with humour and understanding of human nature. allthough they are written 90 years ago they are still fresh and they give you a sweet moment in a beautiful world of the past."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"I have treasured my &quot;Emily&quot; series of books ever since my memaw brought them to me from P.E.I. when I was about 12 years old. I have never &quot;met&quot; a more real character in a story. Emily of New Moon, Emily Climbs, and Emily's Quest are a series of books no girl should ever miss out on reading. I could relate so well to Emily's feelings. I can still remember so much about Emily. I kind of &quot;adopted&quot; her into my soul and she became a part of me. I have read the series several times since I was twelve (12 years ago), and I will enjoy reading it again and again. I am looking forward to having my girls read &quot;Emily&quot; when they are older"},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"First, I'd like to point out that the second novel is better by leaps and bounds. Now, back to this one. I'll put it shortly: last year, I loved it, laughed and cried, felt that Emily was a genius and that her aunt was a witch, etc., etc.; but this year I can relate more with her aunt than Emily, get pretty irritated at E's childish thinking and feel she's a little spoiled. The only thing I like at age 13 about this book is the character set alone--they're amazing. However, I don't think the situations live up to them. Anyway, at age 11-12 it will likely be the best book you'll read, and nourishing food for the imagination. After that, you grow out of it."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"After having read and enjoyed the Anne of Green Gables series as well as a few of L.M. Montgomery's other books, I was eager to start this book. It's hard for me to say who I like better - Anne, or Emily. But Emily is closer to my heart in the fact that we both love writing and cats.Emily's different - not as spunky as Anne, but she is a lovable character nonetheless. I found myself enjoying Emily's spirit and defiance, and loved the rest of the Emily series as well."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"This is just another of Montgomery's wonderful creations that brings comfort and peace from the world around you. It is a story that keeps you wanting more...which you get in the other two books! I found myself hoping for Emily's happiness in overcoming her grief, and I hope you will too."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"I adore Anne, but Emily is a Kindred Spirit. I've read all of L.M. Montgomery's books, and this one is, without doubt, the very best. And yes - it IS better than Anne of Green Gables.Emily of New Moon has all the elements of a well-written novel. It has tragic scenes that aren't overly dramatic: the quiet death of her father makes me cry no matter how many times I've read it. It's inspiring: even as a young girl, she struggles with ambition. It's endearing: who could forget the happy, childish adventures of Emily and Ilse? Most of all, it has a sense of humor! (Though, I must point out, LMM's funniest scene ever is in Emily's Quest, where she reads the reviews of her first novel.)People love Anne because of her sweetness. Emily isn't sweet--she's real. As the narrator writes (I'm paraphrasing) \\"Many people liked her, many disliked her; no one was ever wholly indifferent to her.\\" My very favorite book."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"This is the remarkable story of Emily, a young girl who is sent to live with her Aunt Elizabeth after her father dies. The story is all about how Emily adapts to her new surroundings and her new friends. As the book progresses, gradually you see that Emily has grown as a person, and as a writer. You care about Emily and want to know what happens to her. Emily is such an enjoyable person that it is difficult to put the book down! Emily is a very real person and I really felt that I knew her."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"I have read alot of Montgomerys novels and by far this is best one yet!

Montgomery was one of the Anne series. But I like Emily a lot better - she seems like a real person, somehow, unlike Anne, which was nice in her own way, but never seemed like a real person. I think this is the best book in the series, because the author hadn't been committed to a certain set of characters yet, and can develop them freely."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"Emily of New Moon is a book that starts a whole new adventure for me! I would say that Emily is my favorite character, for she is the one you get to know the best. She is in many ways like Anne of Green Gables. But she has a different personality. The setting in which this story takes place is realistic and you get a taste of what life was like around the turn of the century living in a town like the one Emily lives in. The way in which each character speaks lets you know what their personality is like. Emily has her hopes, ambitions and dreams for the future. She copes with her new life after losing both of her beloved parents, finds understanding from her new family and happiness from three new close friends. Above all, Emily discovers a wonderful hidden talent within her!"},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"I first read the Emily of New Moon series when I was about 12 and then read it again and again.

A must read for anyone who has a young daughter or for anyone who is still a young daughter at heart!"},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"It's a shame that most people like either Anne or Emily; I've avoided the whole question by loving them both. The Emily books give a picture of a girl with lights and darks, reacting naturally (and therefore not always cheerfully) to the events of her life. She is far from perfect, but as L.M. Montgomery says about her, you may like her, you may hate her, but you'll never forget her.If what you love about Anne is the sparkling, bubbly world she creates around herself, then you probably won't like Emily. But if you like L.M. Montgomery and would like to see her go a different route, the Emily trilogy is a great read!!"},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"I loved Emily of New Moon and its sequels just as well as I did the Anne books; contrary to what other people seem to think, I felt that both were quite believable characters. I didn't think Anne was superficial or less interesting than Emily. The fact is, when I read these books, I wished both girls were real so I could know them and be their friend. But Emily is quite interesting and very intelligent, overall a wonderful character, and the book is very well-written."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"I love books by L.M Montgomery, especially the Emily series.

Emily's adventures are so descriptive that you feel as if you are experiancing them as she is. It is a great book that I reccommend to everyone who loves the Anne series.

A lot of the recipes call for cheese, fat, and sugars. Although, I don't think our birds, especially the smaller ones, should have much of this, the recipes could be modified so you are comfortable with them and otherwise might be great as a sometimes treat. Other recipe sections include &quot;Breads and Pastries,&quot; &quot;Vegetable and Fruit Dishes,&quot; &quot;Potatoes and Eggs,&quot; the entrees section, and &quot;Treats.&quot;Sprinkled (pun intended) throughout are a few birdie stories, each of which you will need to have a box of tissues close by to read. An index in the back allows you to look up recipes by main ingredients or recipe title.The authors have no veterinary background. In fact, all of them are partners in a CPA firm. But they have a love for parrots, especially those in need, and I think have done a good job of putting together a variety of recipes for our birdies with discriminating palates."},{"Title":"The widening stain,","review":"Mystery writing used the be beneath academics, so when a Cornell professor of romance literature by the name of Morris Bishop wrote his one and only mystery under a pseudonym, the future provost hid behind his fake name. He published under Dashiell Hammett's and Raymond Chandler's publisher, and eventually became Provost of Cornell. Even as he denied authorship, Bishop scribbled a limerick establishing his guilt and remorse as author of THE WIDENING STAIN, to be found in Cornell's Olin library for posterity.With librarian Gilda Gorman, chief cataloger at the University library in the role of female sleuth, this fanciful mystery begins with a build-up to the boring President's reception, which is attended by reluctant faculty. Gilda and her would-be fiance, the tall, blond, and handsome Francis Perry, are discussing the merits of a possible marriage. Gilda has determined that she really doesn't know much about Perry, and seems to be throwing obstacles at his proposal:\\"'I would tell you anything you want to know, Gilda.' Parry's voice was low.'Well now, for example - last year, as you probably know, your name and that of Lucie Coindreau were, in that nice phrase, coupled. Was there anything serious between you?''Would it make any difference?''I don't know. I think it might.''Well, then - no.'\\"With that conversation and the subsequent discovery of the 'dark-hair Frenchwoman who arouses the beast in men,' the suave Perry in fact loses his love. As far as Gilda is concerned, she is the curious sort who only wants to find Mademoiselle Coindreau's murderer, even if it means putting herself at risk. The stain widens as more are pulled into the initial murder.Morris Bishop incorporates his love of limericks into this tantalizing mystery, which is defined as a verse with an \\"a-a-b-b-a\\" style with five anapestic lines (two short, followed by a long line). Although THE WIDENING STAIN was, no doubt, meant as an intellectual exercise allowing the author to stretch, it accomplishes its mission as a comedic mystery. Characterization is fitting for an academic atmosphere, with love acting as its main high jinx.Shelley GlodowskiSenior Reviewer"},{"Title":"The widening stain,","review":"As a former univ library cataloger, I just adored this book whose \\"sleuth\\" is such a one and cute too. I particularly enjoyed the scenes set in the stacks which reminded me of the old U of Minnesota library or the old U of Chicago library. The humor didn't seem all that humorous to me but the romantic exchanges were fine and the characters seemed pretty realistic for the time: 1942. If you enjoy slightly older mysteries definitely search for this one."},{"Title":"The widening stain,","review":"Mirris Bishop, a.k.a. Bolingbroke Johnson, is the limerick guy. His murder mystery pokes fun at academia, and I kike that, but the book is most fun for the limericks, which are funny, often showing the benefits of a very large vocabulary, and never vulgar. Je can do a wonderful other verse form too, and I first heard of him when a freind sent me a couple of his verses clipped from the New Yorker. Rue Morgue Press is to be congratulated for publishing The Widening Stain and Tom and Enid Shantz write a fascinating introduction. Unforunately, there will be no more limericks from the Limerick Guy.

So I don't really know if the book felt childish because of the large print or not. Maybe, I was too close to the work to see it from the distance.I was expecting much more from the writer. It seems that the writer concentrated a lot on developing a few characters, but the writer forgot to create settings. It's like watching the actor's emotions and listening to the actor's spoken words without any background. Emotions and words can create a lot of images, but you feel cheated if there isn't any background. I have felt like zooming in to the characters' souls and staying very close there by not having the option of zooming out to see the surroundings. The writer did create some settings but not enough.Also, the author tried a bit too hard with the dialogues. She quoted psalms and bible lessons through dialogues that did not feel natural.I was expecting an epic, but the story was written for elementary students."},{"Title":"The Strength of His Hand (Chronicles of the Kings #3)","review":"King Hezekiah has returned his people to worshipping only Yahweh after the brutal paganism that highlighted the reign of his sire. With the return to praying to the One God, Judah has seen prosperity. Perhaps the only thing that has not gone right for the monarch is the lack of an heir; this especially disturbs his beloved wife Hephzibah.Desperate to bear a male child, Hephzibah visits a pagan shrine worshiping the fertility goddess Asherahl and offers a deal to this false deity. Stunned when he learns what his wife did that broke the Commandant and the key principle to his reign, an irate Hezekiah devastates the pagan shrine. However, he is severely injured because of his berserker ranting. Once calm he knows his country's future is at stake so he turns to God for help and forgiveness for him, his wife, and their people. God answers through the prophet Isaiah who provides direction to clean his house and to select his heir.The third tome of the fabulous Chronicles of the Kings series, THE STRENGTH OF HIS HAND, offers a terrific look at King Hezekiah's reign at a time of moral and religious crisis that threatens to destroy all he believed in and worked to achieve. Interestingly, the transgression of worshipping the false god by Hephzibah was done out of love for her spouse (good intentions can be an express way to hell). As Lynn Austin did with the insightful SONG OF REDEMPTION and GODS AND KINGS, fans will learn much about ancient Judah while cherishing this excellent work of biblical fiction.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Strength of His Hand (Chronicles of the Kings #3)","review":"Wow! That's the only word that comes to mind after reading Lynn Austin. I picked this up with one lingering doubt in my mind, \\"Will this even match books 1 and 2?\\" They were THAT good, and Lynn Austin did her homework to the nth degree, and I'm sitting here astounded! I was wondering if she'd include Sannacherib, Hezekiah's fierce, taunting rival! Oh, she did all right, and had me sweating a time or two! She did an amazing work, and if you have yet to read this, you really are missing out. I really don't feel like putting the book down when I'm on my lunch break at work, or potty training the 2 year old, and it made me all the more crazy to get back to reading!! Yeah, now read on, right? I still have my review to do!The theme in this would ultimately have to be trust. And for that matter, not trusting in ourselves. To me that is a gut wrenching matter. Especially when I think I need something, and it just ain't happening! When you look back on the times when you haven't trusted God, please don't feel so bad. It is called crisis, and we all go through it. King Hezekiah went through it, and he HAD to trust God. The question is, would he? If you know the story, well then you already know the answer. But let's not make it so obvious. What about Hezekiah's wife, Hephzibah, who has yet to birth a future king? She thought she was promised, yet no baby, not yet anyway! What about other people in this that we've grown to love... like Eliakim? The Assyrians are planning to attack Judah. Eliakim's wife, Jerusha knows about how beastly ONE of them can be. Will God protect them? Will they rely on God's strength, or will they lean to their own understanding? Isaiah, the prophet is still alive and well in this whole mess, and he plays a big part!This also gives a better understanding of Passover. With a portrait more real than life, the passover is displayed to me in great awe. It really drives home the point, like for instance with the parsley dipped in salt water. Just an example, and you might really appreciate what an awesome God we serve after this. There is a lot of scripture, yet when you see it come alive, WOW!All God asks sometimes is to simply trust Him. To put aside our strength, and to simply trust Him. Is it always easy? No way. Is it worth it? Yes it is, because I know from some tough experiences. Outstanding once again, Lynn Austin! I'm ready for more."},{"Title":"The Strength of His Hand (Chronicles of the Kings #3)","review":"You will mostly enjoy this book if you love biblical history or if you would like to understand it better.First, the writting is not as smooth as more experienced authors I've read. In some places its even a bit jarring. BUT Ms Austin is certainly one thing.....a storyteller!!!I found myself reading this book and really understanding human nature versus obeying God. It made me repent of some of my own thickheadedness and at other points it made me pray not to fall into the traps that I saw the characters fall into.Ms Austin has worked good cause and effect into her plotting of this book. Keep up the good work Ms Austin. All in all it was a good read that makes you look introspectively at yourself and hey....thats what every author wants to accomplish...right? 8-)"},{"Title":"The Strength of His Hand (Chronicles of the Kings #3)","review":"After surviving the threat of Assyrian invasion, Hezekiah has seen the kingdom of Judah blessed with extraordinary peace and prosperity. Life seems almost perfect, except Hezekiah lacks an heir. Desperate to retain her husband's affections and secure his succession, Hephzibah vows to sacrifice her firstborn to the pagan goddess Asherah. When Hezekiah discovers her idolatry, he flies into a rage and is critically injured in the resulting fire. Deeply and bitterly wounded by his beloved wife's betrayal, Hezekiah wavers between life and death with nothing less than the future of the kingdom and his people at stake. When God grants Hezekiah a reprieve, the broken king sets about attempting to solidify his legacy, risking everything for a chance at personal glory by signing alliances with neighboring -- pagan -- nations, alliances that bring Assyria once again to Jerusalem's gates. Will Hezekiah find the strength to return to the faith of his youth and once again trust in the never-changing God of Israel to redeem the results of his sinful pride and save his people from annihilation?The Strength of His Hand is the third volume in Austin's Chronicles of the Kings series to cover a portion of Hezekiah's reign. Taking 2 Kings 18-20, 2 Chronicles 32, and Isaiah 36-39 as her basis, Austin explores Hezekiah's reign at its critical midpoint -- facing death and the systematic dismantling of all the religious and political reforms he'd overseen since his coronation, the Hezekiah we meet at this point is a more vulnerable, almost desperate, man than the assured, faith-filled ruler we were introduced to in the first two volumes of this series. One of the main reasons I love biblical fiction is how it can flesh-out and humanize the individuals forever immortalized in the pages of scripture, reclaiming them from character status and reminding us that they were once living and breathing human beings, ever bit as fallible as we are today. The first two novels in this series sketched a fascinating, compelling portrait of Hezekiah -- but Hezekiah at this point in history, at least as brought to life by Austin -- is frankly unlikable. There is so much time spent on Hezekiah's illness, his regrets, his penchant for making decisions that go against every belief he's professed to hold dear up to this point. But the portion of Hezekiah's life covered in this novel is presented in too repetitive and redundant a manner to make for a truly compelling read. Hezekiah faces some truly appalling prophecies as a result of his decisions -- i.e., when Isaiah prophesies the Babylonian exile (2 Kings 20: 16-19), and the best reaction Hezekiah can muster is relief that this won't happen in his lifetime. One never really gets a clear sense of Hezekiah's remorse until the novel is nearly over, and given the far-flung repercussions of his actions, it is to my view a missed dramatic opportunity.The strongest characters in this novel are members of the supporting cast -- Eliakim, the man responsible for overseeing the construction of Hezekiah's tunnel in Song of Redemption (and now the Secretary of State), his wife Jerusha, the former Assyrian captive, and Hephzibah, the disgraced queen. In many respects Eliakim as a hero figure foreshadows the leading men of Austin's later works -- atypical, sincere, intelligent, bookish types. I loved Austin's exploration of how the pressure of Eliakim's new government position forced a new set of societal expectations on him -- expectations that clash with the grace-filled tenets of his faith. It is his wife Jerusha, the once-broken and bitter Assyrian slave who reminds Eliakim of the need for grace and forgiveness when she is compelled to reach out to the shunned queen. I love how Austin has developed Jerusha's story, particularly in how she doesn't shy away from the ever-present traumatic impact of Jerusha's years in captivity. I found Hephzibah's battle with guilt and unforgiveness extremely well-drawn and realistically presented, and Jerusha's unexpected friendship with Hephzibah is a lovely portrait of grace and redemption at work in the lives of believers.Lacking some of the spark that made the first two volumes in this series so fascinating, The Strength of His Hand is nevertheless a competently presented final chapter in Austin's exploration of Hezekiah's life and reign. I look forward to the fourth book in the series, covering the reign of Hezekiah's son -- I think perhaps a new generation's challenges will interject a much-needed infusion of life into the series."},{"Title":"The Strength of His Hand (Chronicles of the Kings #3)","review":"I love this series, as well as every Lynn Austin book I have ever read.

Adventure, romance, heart break and joy - it's all here. I really appreciate how Lynn provides the scripture she based the story on at the front of the book, because after reading the story, I want to jump in and read my bible. I'm sure Lynn would be happy to know that.

But Ms. Austin pulled it off, and I was intrigued. Her method of storytelling was an inspiration to go back and re-read the various books of the Old Testament.To be honest I did read all 5 of Lynn's books. I was engrossed with the first one and it was free.

If you like old testament history and literature you will love these books. Lynn Austin brings alive the history of biblical times with real emotion that theBible doesn't always provide. Her fictionalization of trueBiblical events helps you understand what it was like to live in an age of idolatry, and how difficult it would be to keep all of God's laws.

In desperation, his beloved wife takes forbidden measures to ensure fertility. With all that is going on in his kingdom - and with the Assyrians approaching - Hezekiah does not discover his wife's idolatry until it's almost too late. betrayal cuts to the very core of his being and belief in God. Will his faith sustain him in the face of this deceit, and against an overwhelming enemy?My Review:King Hezekiah and his wife, Hephzibah, were very much in love but she remained barren. Unable to provide her husband, the king, with an heir she turns to worshipping the fertility goddess which is strictly against Hezekiah's rule. This king only worships one God - Yahweh. When the king discovers Hephzibah's blasphemous behaviour he divorces her and banishes her to a life alone.Coping with his insurmountable grief over the loss of his beautiful wife, King Hezekiah listens to the wrong advice and becomes embroiled in what he thinks is \\"making allies\\" with other kingdoms.

They got together and became booksellers on the most fragile of bases - the stationery was printed a year before they ever sold a book - but their friendship was firm, their enthusiasm vast and their knowledge immense.They started off with a tiny stock, superbly described in their first catalogue, and built up their initial success, fuelling it with trips to postwar Europe where they happily trawled through centuries of printed rummage to unearth treasures for resale.Every year they booked a trip, at first aboard ex-troopships, more latterly on airliners, and explored the labyrinthine world of booksellers and their wares. From the third floor of Marks and Co in Charing Cross Road to a secluded chateau outside Paris and all points in between they met and described in their diaries the amazingly colourful booksellers and their shops. A stack of Renaissance folios in the toilet, a rat in the basement, an ex-movie star, Russian emigres - I can hardly begin to describe the experiences they had and the people they met and charmed.From the very first pages I can understand why they found their way into so many hearts. The excitement at finding a rare book for a song is genuine, the affection they feel for each other and their annual friends warming, and the language in which they describe it all is witty and engaging. One can almost smell the dusty, musty bookshops, the tottering stacks, the ricketty ladders, the clutter, calfskin and cellars of old world bookshops.If you love books at all, then go forth and hunt down this one. It is a rare treasure in itself, an authentic feelgood odyssey through the world of booksellers, their wares and their curious habitats. A tag-team effort of both partners, it is a delight from beginning to end."},{"Title":"Baby Read-Aloud Basics: Fun and Interactive Ways to Help Your Little One Discover the World of Words","review":"When I purchased Baby Read-Aloud basics, I had already read Reading with Babies, Toddlers and Twos and was hoping to complement my reading on the subject of baby books and read-alouds. I personally thought this book was not as helpful or complete, nor did it have as many book suggestions as the first one mentionned above. Still, this book is pretty good. It gives a few suggestions of books for every baby stage, what to do with that book, reading techniques, literacy games, and contains some interviews with parents who went through the read-aloud from birth experience. It is kind of repetitive but easy to read and well organized."},{"Title":"Baby Read-Aloud Basics: Fun and Interactive Ways to Help Your Little One Discover the World of Words","review":"I originally purchased this book for a gift for my son and daughter-in-law expecting their first child. I am a Kindergarten teacher and have now purchased two extra copies...one for my personal and professional growth and one to have on my parent resource shelf at school.This is broken down into six stages of reading aloud to your baby and the benefits this will give for a lifetime. Photos are included to illustrate what the authors are expressing. Broken down into expectations of listening, verbal, visual and motor skills.

I knew it made a difference but to see the results of the numerous studies on the topic was shocking. I did not know it made that much of a difference. You owe it to your child to spend some time reading to them. In my opinion, if you want to make an impact on the life of your child, buy this book and read to your child! The book is a quick read and you do not even have to read the whole thing at once. Read the beginning and then read about the different stages as you are going through them. There are a ton of baby books out there (I know because I have bought them) but this one proves that by doing something as simple as reading can make a world of difference in the life of your child.

After the first time I read it, I found that I loved checking it out to reread at least a few times a year. After I moved from that school, I found it difficult to find the book once again, and I'm so glad that I now have! It is a beautiful, funny, touching book that is a perfect read for children as well as adults who still love to read books like &quot;Black Beauty,&quot; The &quot;Black Stallion&quot; Series, &quot;101 Dalmations,&quot; etc. I am one such adult, as I work with children, and I would recommend this book to absolutely everyone that likes animals or wants to foster the love of animals in their young friends or children. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Beautiful Joe (Fiction Treasures)","review":"This is a charming, heartwarming story by Beautiful Joe himself. He tells of the cruel mistreatment by his first owner, Mr. Jenkins, and how he was rescued and came to live with the Morris's - the most loving family on earth! His adventures with the other animals in the Morris family will make you laugh and his love for Miss Laura will warm your heart! Some might say this book is just propaganda for the American Humane Society, but I am loving it all over again 45 years after I first read it! Treat yourself"},{"Title":"Beautiful Joe (Fiction Treasures)","review":"I bought this book for my grandchildren. I am 82 now and I read Beautiful Joe as a boy when I was 11 or 12. The impact of the story imprinted in me is an indelible love for dogs and earning my abiding respect. I wanted my grandchildren to be influenced in the same manner. I kept my original copy for a very long time but after many family moves, being a military man, with a family, that treasured copy was lost. That Marshal Saunders' (no relation) book is still being read about 125 years after it was first published is testamony enough. It is a treasure and when my grandaughters have read it, I intend to borrow it for one more reading."},{"Title":"Beautiful Joe (Fiction Treasures)","review":"OK, so I am a sucker for a dog story. This book is so much more than a dog story though. A lot of time is spent in Joe listening to discussions of ethics by the humans in his life; the values of the humans are lofty and worth hearing. There are so many lessons to be learned in this book, my favorite of which is that even a mangled and maimed creature can be beautiful. It's a bit archaic, but still a wonderful read. Can't believe I never read this book as a kid!!!"},{"Title":"Beautiful Joe (Fiction Treasures)","review":"I had never heard of this book until I started browsing the free classics for Kindle. I thought that I would give it a try and I fell in love with Beautiful Joe and most of the other characters in this book. This story made me laugh, cry, and even get a tad angry. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves animals. There is a sequel to this book Beautiful Joe's Paradise but it is out of print and rather on the pricey side to buy used."},{"Title":"Beautiful Joe (Fiction Treasures)","review":"I first read Beautiful Joe as a youngster probably 40 years ago; it broke my heart to read of Joe's beginnings with Jenkins in the opening chapters of the book but as I went on and he was rescued I found I couldn't put it down. The Italian's tragic loss of his animals in a barn fire still brings tears to my eyes, and Malta the cat remains a favorite character simply because she's a cat :).I am so surprised and pleased that the publisher has re-printed the story and that Amazon is offering it for sale; because of the book's age (well over 100 yrs old) and the style of writing it used (I had my mother's book, given her by my grandfather when she was a girl so the grammatical style was still in the original) I was sure it was one of those stories that would be lost in oblivion for just that reason.I do plan to purchase the book for both my daughter for Christmas, as well as an additional copy for her former school's library. Thank you so much, Amazon, for bringing this timeless story to us once again!"},{"Title":"Beautiful Joe (Fiction Treasures)","review":"Published in 1893, Beautiful Joe was the first Canadian book to sell a million copies and was extremely popular in America, too (selling almost a million copies by 1900). A work of fiction told from the dog's point of view, it is based upon the true story of an abused dog (in the tradition of 1877's Black Beauty). It reflects many of the unfortunate realities of society in those days, but it had an incredible impact upon the Western world's ideas about humane treatment of animals. Interestingly, it is still published with the author listed as Marshall Saunders. In fact, it was written by Margaret Marshall Saunders, and published using her middle name since it was felt that no one would want to buy a book written by a woman. (She was in fact the first woman to write a book which sold a million copies!)There's also a website about the real beautiful Joe at beautifuljoe.org"},{"Title":"Beautiful Joe (Fiction Treasures)","review":"\\"Beautiful Joe\\" is a wonderful story.

I was emotionally scarred by reading this book about dog-torture, and I have never recovered. PARENTS: PLEASE DO NOT LET YOUR CHILDREN READ THIS BOOK! I do not know why a book about a poor little dog being horribly tortured and nearly killed makes for a good children's book. Please do not inflict the pain and torment upon your children that was inflicted upon me. Spare your children this horror."},{"Title":"Beautiful Joe (Fiction Treasures)","review":"I heartily endorse this book for dog people, animal lovers, and anyone with a strong sense of ethics. Some of its descriptions of cruelty to animals may seem a bit harsh. However,each instance of cruelty is followed by a scene of dedicated people taking action: i.e., Joe\`s kind owner, Laura,rescues a group of starving farm animals. All of the story\`s human characters promote kindness to, and humane treatment of animals. Ethical behavior toward people is also stressed. I think that this book has new relevance in this century, as we strive to teach children compassion and humane actions. Saunders never lets the reader forget that her animal characters are animals, not talking people. This is an added bonus, since that is hard to do when writing 'creature fiction'. You\`ll find 'Beautiful Joe' hard to put down, touching, and enlightening. A must-read!"},{"Title":"Beautiful Joe (Fiction Treasures)","review":"I am 60 years old..I received this book on my 10th birthday.

This book was read to me as a very young child, I believe I was probably seven. I was horrified and of course fell in love with Joe but it showed me that I could also do what the loving people in the book did and help poor creatures without a voice.I have now volunteered for many rescue agencies as well as rescued many animals myself. I think this book gave me as an animal lover, an outlet and a direction to go in to help aid animals in distress.As an adult I purchased my own copy of this book and plan on reading it to my own children.

I loved it! That just comes to show that you can't judge a book by it's cover. This book is great for animal-lovers it may look like a long book, but once you start reading it the hours fly by in a flash. This book is about a dog named Joe, his first owner is very cruel to him.

I read and reread this book many times. It was passed on to my nieces and nephews (since I had no children of my own) and they in turn read it over and over again. Today this storys merits are more relivant than ever. We have a need to teach kindness whether it is an &quot;ugly&quot; animal or a person. Serial killers and psychopaths usually have one thing in their backround; animal abuse at early age. Exposure to a story at that age where the animal can tell it's feelings, impressions, and actions-on a first hand basis may inspire thought and action on the reader that may extend into his life. The story of this animal is in my thoughts to this day, a timeless enduring story of the highs and lows man is capable of and its effects on others in life, and the acceptance and limitless love of the beast that chose to live with man."},{"Title":"Beautiful Joe (Fiction Treasures)","review":"What a shock to see Beautiful Joe just now on Amazon Books.

Loved the story! It is really well written and told from Joe's point of view. Teaches you so much about animals!"},{"Title":"Beautiful Joe (Fiction Treasures)","review":"I ordered this book because it was quite a bit less than the other versions available. I wish I had looked at the preview and read the \\"disclaimer\\" on the first page. This is basically an unedited scan of the book, so the text is full of typographical errors (problems with text recognition and punctuation). I have not yet read the entire book, but in looking at the first few pages, I can already tell that it will be irritating to read this version. It will be similar to reading email from people that use no punctuation, capitalization, or spell-checking. I just hope that it does not detract too much from the story, which I am sure is good. If I find that reading this version gets to be too challenging, I will purchase another (regular) copy."},{"Title":"Beautiful Joe (Fiction Treasures)","review":"I have been looking forward to the opportunity to share my love of this book with my granddaughter.

This book is an excellent way to introduce the topic of humane treatment of animals to children. The book is so well written that the reader can never forget Beautiful Joe.

It is timeless in teaching children to love animals. I truly hope this book is reissued so that all children (and adults) can enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"Beautiful Joe (Fiction Treasures)","review":"This story was read to me when I was a little girl. I have read it to my girls and they in turn have read it themselves. Beautiful Joe makes a person think about what their actions may do to everyone and everything around them. It gave my daughters an appreciation for animals that I could never do. This book was hard to put down!"},{"Title":"Beautiful Joe (Fiction Treasures)","review":"This book profoundly affected me as a child. As many youngsters are passionate about animals, this book teaches everyday values as told through the eyes of a dog. In a world where respect for human life is not always apparent, this book appeals to the humane spirit in all. By teaching kids to first love and respect animals, they can become better individuals. I turned off the t.v. last summer, and read this book to my 11 and 8 year old children. They loved it!"},{"Title":"Beautiful Joe (Fiction Treasures)","review":"I read Beautiful Joe as a child of maybe 10, over 40 years ago. Can you remember all the books you read in grade school, junior high, high school? If you are like me, probably not. I was not even an avid reader, but sometimes enjoyed going to the library near my grandma's house on those occasions when I spent the night there, to pick out a book or two. One of those times I picked up Beautiful Joe. I have never forgotten it. A few years ago I began to search for it in bookstores--never to be found and the library version is always checked out. How can a book make such a lasting impression upon a person? Thank you Amazon for carrying it."},{"Title":"Beautiful Joe (Fiction Treasures)","review":"OK, seriously... this book leaves such an impact on every child I have seen that has read it. It teaches amazing compassion. It teaches the golden rule doesn't apply just to humans. It begs for people to be the best that they can. It is the basis for the credo of the humane society. It makes you think twice when you see a stray, heck, it makes you think when you look at a rat. There is no reason for a child not to be read this story, in fact several adults I know could benefit from it also. And read the sequel too... Beautiful Joe's Paradise (when the are all in heaven and all damaged/hurt creatures are restored! Even Barnum's elephant, Jumbo gets his tusks back...) Happy reading and get some Kleenex, if you cried in Black Beauty... you'll need it for this, too!"},{"Title":"Beautiful Joe (Fiction Treasures)","review":"Trying to raise a humane child? If so, you want this book. I didn't realize until I was an adult that Beautiful Joe is essentially a humane education \\"tract\\"--a series of quasi-essays on various types of animal abuse held together by the plot line of Miss Laura's attempts to stop animal cruelty. I was surprised by the realization, because I had understood Beautiful Joe as Literature with a capital L--the real stuff, the good stuff. And I'd argue that it is. Much like Black Beauty, it both fulfills and transcends its original object of educating and agitating in the service of animal rights. Each one of its characters and incidents has remained stamped in my mind and heart since I first read it as a child in the 70's. In fact, Beautiful Joe changed my life: today I rescue, rehabilitate, and find good homes for abandoned, neglected, and abused dogs. Every tear that I have shed over these dogs has its source in that first burst of childish grief for poor old Joe. He's a good dog--and he can count me among his good works."},{"Title":"Beautiful Joe (Fiction Treasures)","review":"I too read, &quot; Beautiful Joe&quot; years ago when I was in elementary school. I was unable to put the book down then and was unable to put it down now. I searched many years in order to find a copy of the book. I have my original from my younger days, but decided to keep it in the original condition. &quot;Beautiful Joe &quot; was and is a book to teach us all to be kind to all living creatures. I am sure I will read the book again and know it will be read by many of my colleagues in the school in which I teach. Thank you, Marshall Saunders, for writing a terrific book."},{"Title":"Beautiful Joe (Fiction Treasures)","review":"At age 66, I was telling a child I am tutoring in a public school about this book, then decided to look it up. VOILA! A miracle! It is still available AND universally loved.I had to have read it at age 9-10, so that's 56 years ago. Shocked to find out it was written in 1893. God bless Marshall Saunders, who is probably now in heaven with all the dogs and cats. And maybe people."},{"Title":"Beautiful Joe (Fiction Treasures)","review":"This is a book that I picked up at my grandmother's house when I was probably ten or eleven years old. I can remember what the original looked like, just as I can picture other books that I found in her house, many of them dating from my mother's childhood. This one was special, and I was so glad to be able to find that it has now been reprinted. It is a story of a dog that is told from the dog's point of view. It is an old-fashioned story that will teach your child about kindness to animals, and to others. I bought two extra copies for friends, and reread the book myself. Check some of the other Amazon customer reviews of previous editions of this book--you will see that all readers find it among their favorites. Last year when my father died, my mother told me that this had been one of his favorite books--I had not known that, and it made me sad that we had never talked about it. Get a copy for your family today!"},{"Title":"Beautiful Joe (Fiction Treasures)","review":"I first read this story as a Whitman abridged edition when I was about eight years old. It was hard for me to believe that some people were so cruel to animals, but I loved the book's old-fashioned narration and of the adventures of and lessons learned by Miss Laura and her family in raising Joe. The moment I learned what the word \\"abridged\\" meant, I went looking for the complete story; it took me a long time to find this Applewood Books edition that included three of the farm chapters that were missing from the supposedly complete version I later purchased, and oddly, the Applewood edition is missing the chapter about the crow that is in some other editions. (I believe this is because the Applewood volume is a reprint of the original story and the chapter about the crow was added in a revised edition.) The story is full of memorable characters, both animal--Joe, Jim the spaniel, Billy the fox-terrier, Bella the parrot--and human--Miss Laura, Ned, Willie, Jack, and Cousin Harry. If you are tender of heart, you may find many scenes heart-rending, but it reminds us too that we have much to still work on in the area of animal cruelty."},{"Title":"Beautiful Joe (Fiction Treasures)","review":"I had never heard of this book or read it as a child. I found a copy of the 1930 hardback version in an antique shop in the midwest last summer and purchased it just because the cover illustration looked strikingly like a dog my husband and I had recently adopted from a shelter. When I read the book, I was captivated and astonished. You see, my dog (a lovely fawn-colored pit bull) was rescued after having her ears crudely chopped off and burned. She's been a member of our family for nearly two years, and is an obedient, loving companion. The story told from the perspective of the dog reinforces to me that animals are feeling, thinking creatures, put on this earth for humans to care for and give a voice to. I've since become a great advocate for the plight of the American Pit Bull Terrier, which used to be the symbol of American with its courage, loyalty, and tenacity. Unfortunately in this day and age, irresponsible and unfeeling people have tarnished their image greatly by trying to turn them into guard dogs (which they are not) and reaping profits from fighting them. Then, they are usually discarded. Children would do well to read this book to help them learn about kindness to all creatures; adults would enjoy it as well. Because of this book, the name on our dog's AKC CGC (Canine Good Citizen) certificate and UKC LP registration proudly reads, \\"Ostroms' Beautiful Barley.\\" I'm looking forward to reading the sequel and happy to have found, through these reviews, where the \\"real\\" Beautiful Joe lived and is buried."},{"Title":"Beautiful Joe (Fiction Treasures)","review":"Beautiful Joe is a great book in the tradition of Black Beauty, and will educate today's readers of not only the history of animals' roles in society but also will bring to light the history of our country prior to mass automobile usage. A great book that still rings true today."},{"Title":"Death Cruise: Crime Stories on the Open Seas","review":"DEATH CRUISE, is made up of 22 short mystery stories that, as you would expect, center about cruises. Each story is written by a different author, each using the cruise theme as a common thread to tie the stories together. The styles and entertainment values vary widely, as do the periods in which they were written. These vary from Agatha Christie's story written in 1936, to the bulk of the rest that were evidently written in 1999, the year this collection was copyrighted.I wish that I could say that they were uniformly good, but I'm afraid that I can't because, at least in my opinion, they're not. In fact, they're all over the place.Let's start with Agatha Christie's &quot;Problem at Sea.&quot; I don't think that it has held up very well with the passage of time. I can't reveal what it is about the key premise of the solution of the murder that bothers me so much, as it would ruin the mystery for the reader, but, in light of what is fairly common knowledge now, it just doesn't work today.Now for the bright side. As always, I enjoyed John Mortimer's Rumpole and his wife, &quot;She Who Must Be Obeyed,&quot; who are on a cruise ship on their second honeymoon. for fans of the &quot;Rumpole of the Bailey&quot; series, it is amusing to even imagine Rumpole aboard a cruise ship where one must dress for dinner and if &quot;She Wo Must . . . &quot; has her way, go dancing in the evenings, drink fine liquers, hob-nob with fellow passengers, etc., etc. This story, &quot;Rumpole at Sea,&quot; combines most of the elements that go into a highly entertaining story. As there should be because this is meant to be a mystery, there is a bit of a mystery. There is, however, even more tongue-in-cheek British dry humor. There are people you really care about, and a few that you don't. All in all, it's hard not to be charmed by Mortimer's take on Rumpole, his wife, and a moderately unpleasant judge or two.In &quot;Honeymoon Cruise,&quot; I couldn't find a single character I really cared about, so I just didn't care who was planning to kill whom.But, on the positive side (again),we have &quot;Mutiny of the Bounty Hunter,&quot; which has people that grew on me, and by the end of the story, I really did care about what happened to them. Even in a story this short, the author managed to give us real people who changed as the situation warranted it, not the unidimesnsional ones like those in &quot;Honeymoon Cruise.&quot;In summary: For me, DEATH CRUISE was really a mixed bag, with just enough entertainment value for me that I, like certain movie critics, can give it a &quot;reluctant tumbs up.&quot;"},{"Title":"Your wings,","review":"Assen 'Jerry' Jordanoff was nothing if not amazing. A Bulgarian test pilot and engineer who fled Europe for this country after the First World War, he taught himself English at the New York Public Library---and supported himself with odd jobs such as shoveling snow in winters. He then began working his way through America's aircraft industry, developing new ideas and new technologies seemingly every time he woke up in the morning. Among other accomplishments was a series of instructional texts on aviation---YOUR WINGS was his basic student guide to flying, and it's still full of classical knowledge which any pilot should absorb. The cartoon illustrations of helmet-and-goggles aviators may make some snicker---let them. YOUR WINGS remains both a charming artifact and a lively reminder that some knowledge simply doesn't age."},{"Title":"Your wings,","review":"Contents:AerodynamicsThe Parachute & Its UsePrimary FlightsTake-Off & LandingTurns, Climbs, and GlidesStalls and SpinsThe MotorThe PropellerYour First Solo FlightVisual AvigationThe AirGyro & Sperry InstrumentsMotor Oils and GasolinesThe Engine & Its FoodAltitude-Mixture-PowerThe Spark Plug & Magneto IgnitionVariable-Pitch PropellersThe Airplane & Its Structural StrengthIceMore Airplane AccessoriesRadioInstrument FlyingMilitary FlyingScheduled Air Transportation"},{"Title":"Nobody True","review":"This is an intriguing chiller thriller by Great Britain's master of horror and the supernatural. Written as a first person narrative by the protagonist, James True, a successful graphic artist with his own business, the reader discovers that for years James has been capable of having out-of-body experiences. He is able to project his essence, leaving his body behind, as he wanders around totally unfettered by physical constraints. Unfortunately, on his last such foray, he returns to his body only to discover that he had been brutally murdered and mutilated while he was out-of-body.At first, the police believe his murder to be the work of a serial killer, and, despite his obvious limitations, James sets out hell-bent to find his murderer. What he finds, however, is betrayal, heartbreak, and fear, as he discovers things about his wife, his beloved daughter, and his business partner that he never knew. He also meets the serial killer, a decidedly creepy character that will have some surprises in store for the reader. Just when the reader has it all figured out, the author pulls a rabbit out of the hat.Peppered with wry, macabre humor, the plot is so inventive that the reader cannot help but keep turning the pages of this book, despite its falling somewhat short in terms of character development. It is an entertaining, quick read."},{"Title":"Nobody True","review":"NOBODY TRUE is James Herbert's best work in years, arguably his best yet. It is also one of the most original and compelling \\"horror\\" books in the past decade. Herbert takes what could have been a preposterous plot, and through brilliant narrative and several twists and turns, makes it a must read for genre fans.The hero, James True, is capable of OBEs---out of body experiences which enable him to leave his physical self behind and wander around. Unfortunately, during one of these OBEs, he is brutally murdered and mutilated apparently by a vicious serial killer who has claimed four other victims. So when James returns from his OBE, he has no body to go back to.Herbert skillfully approaches the many aspects of his story: the business partners/friends who he finds he may not have really known; his wife Andrea (kind of funny, if you remember the Andrea True Connection and MORE MORE MORE?), who also has dark secrets; his little girl, Primrose; the horrifying serial killer, horribly disfigured and vicious; his somewhat looney mother and his estranged father. All are interwoven into the exquisite plot, and the reader will find by the time the book is over, he may be a little sad at its inevitable tragic but fulfilling conclusion.NOBODY TRUE is good writing and good reading; let's hope Herbert continues to show a resurgence in his writing skills."},{"Title":"Nobody True","review":"One of the most popular books about horror would be Stephen King's Danse Macabre. Over the years, I've read it a couple of times and have been inspired by it to try out some authors. One of those writers was James Herbert, and now I've read a dozen or so of his books. Nobody True is one of his most recent, and like most Herbert novels, it's a pleasure to read.Typically when you read a book narrated in the first person, you have a reasonable assurance that, whatever else happens, the narrator will survive. Not so here: from the get-go, James True is dead, a ghost relating the story of his life and after-life. Actually, \\"ghost\\" might not be the right word: at the time of his murder, True was having an out-of-body experience, something he'd done on several occasions in the past. The only difference this time is that he had no living body to return to.True doesn't even know who killed him. The obvious suspect - according to the police - is a serial killer, a malevolent person who may have the ability to sense True's presence. True has his own suspicion: his business partner Oliver, who he'd had a major argument with just prior to his death. Some invisible snooping will do nothing to lessen True's suspicions. Yet even if this is the case, what can he do? True is invisible and silent to the living (except, maybe, the serial killer); he is even having trouble learning the rules of his new existence.Nobody True may not have the most original story (even True at one point notes a similarity in his plight to the one in the movie Ghost), but Herbert is an accomplished enough writer to bring new life to the idea. As a novel of supernatural suspense, this works well, with a likable main character, a horrific villain and some nice plotting."},{"Title":"Nobody True","review":"This story I borrowed from the library as an audio and I listenedto this mystery with HORROR stamped all over it.After I had returned it I kept telling friends about the plot.It was SO different Out of Body Experiences being one of the main parts of the plot. Months later i was still raving about this story.I have just read all of the reviews and some of them really describe the story very well so I won't repeat the plot here. Yes Frank Herbert does go on a little too long in one place only about OBE but the overall plot is SO MIND BLOWINGLY different it is in my 10 top storiesthat I will never forget.I would like to give this story a 4 and 1/2 star rating but after seeing some of the reviews I have to give this a 5 star. (I rarely give a 5 star). If you are not into scary horror don't buy this book and then give it a bad rating. It is mystery horror and well done.The twists and at times (very sick) turns makes this a MUST read.I have now gone to Audible and bought this story and downloaded itto keep forever. You will never think about OBE again without thinking of this story!!!!! Highly recommended!!!"},{"Title":"Nobody True","review":"I enjoy James Herbert's style of writing. Some English authors are just a little too proper for me but Herbert keeps his books interesting.Great concept here - having your body killed while you're out gallivanting around on another astral plane. There were a few slow, repetitive spots in the book but for the most part I liked it. Great character development. Truly creepy serial killer (I don't want him wearing MY body). Enough plot twists to keep me guessing. Some tender moments with daughter, Primrose (WHO thought of that name - poor girl)."},{"Title":"Nobody True","review":"His first out of body experience (OBE) was caused by a hot potato when James True was six years old; he has plenty of them since. However, the current OBE proves different for thirty-three years old Jim when he returns to his body only to find his mutilated dead corpse was not capable of receiving his essence.Jim wonders who killed him. Could his art design business partner, brilliant copywriter Oliver Guinane, started again using the drugs that enhanced an unknown anger that Jim married Oliver's former girlfriend Andrea Dodds and they have a daughter Primrose though seven years have passed?; Oliver was physically abusive towards Andrea when he used drugs. Could it be bad happenstance that someone like the serial killer terrorizing the city did him in? Although limited in a three dimensional physical world, Jim plans to learn the truth and hopes to find a way to nail his killer, but the horror of his death pales to what he will find out as true.NOBODY TRUE is a gripping paranormal amateur sleuth thriller that will remind readers of D.O.A. (both versions) except that the beleaguered movie hero had 24 hours while Jim is past due. The exhilarating story line works on two planes as Jim searches for his murderer while also learning that his perfect personal life was filled with major tremors that he failed to realize existed when he was alive. Suspense thriller fans with a fascinating twist will appreciate this tense tale that never slows down while Jim learns that the truth is fatal.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Nobody True","review":"An interesting book in that it was an unusual approach.I found it a little far-fetched on more than one occasion but being a bit of a daydreamer I thought it had some interesting thoughts to ponder, about out-of-body experiences.An agreeable read but if you prefer to be scared you might prefer one of Herbert's other books."},{"Title":"Nobody True","review":"A good novel. What I would call a holiday read. If you read James Herbert then you already know what I mean. Thumbs up rather than down on this one."},{"Title":"Nobody True","review":"Used to love Herbert books - haven't read one in an age. Then tried this one. Bad mistake, tainted the memory of past reads.Boring story that hangs around way too long when the decent thing to do was to end."},{"Title":"Nobody True","review":"I lost interest in this book about 100+ pages into it. The pace in this story is very slow, which would have been fine if there was some important detail being introduced. However, James Herbert beats us to death with repetitiveness. How many times do we need to be reminded of how it feels like to travel while he experiences his OBE?? Many times he refers to it as a \\"Star Treky\\" trasporter experience. The narrator keeps harping the sadness he feels looking in on his daughter and putting his arm around his wife as she is sleeping (he's touching her, but not really touching her). It's as though James Herbert is trying to fill up space by constantly repeating his main character's thoughts that it makes you feel as though you're reading what was on page 33 again on page 82. I'm a big fan of keeping books around if I lose interest, in case I get another spark to go back and give it another chance. I actually threw this book away. Even a story like this one, which follows the thought process of a man who's been robbed of his body and life, needs to have momentum. I will give the author another chance, but this book (as the British would say) is \\"bloody boring\\"."},{"Title":"Nobody True","review":"I like James Herbert when I'm in the mood for something not too heavy but entertaining just the same.The idea that you could be killed whilst out of body on an astral jaunt is pretty darn good.The guy becomes a ghost - and it seems his path has been crossed with a horrible thing called Moker - person, monster type thing...committing atrocities left and right and an innocent knitting needle being employed to do the final dead of stopping the heart. Interesting.Well then.The poor man is then left with the very real possibility that whatever happened to him, his family could be in danger and he is really at a loss at what to do. He has some capabilities when it comes to moving a body with his energy but the main problem is, it has to be a corpse!The bad guy doesn't turn out to be who you think anyway and a shock ending ensues with the monster being thwarted and the guy finaly relinquishing his attachment to his still lving family.If I tell you much more it won't be worth reading!Enjoy."},{"Title":"Nobody True","review":"Die-hard Herbert fans will enjoy this one, as it seems to fit the style of many of his other successes. I thought Herbert did a fantastic job of developing the main character (better than another character I can remember), however as the book progressed I started losing interest somewhat. Conceptually the book is quite interesting but is far too predictable. It is sort of a combination of Fluke and the Haunted."},{"Title":"Nobody True","review":"Herbert had a good idea here, but his delivery is so agonizingly tedious that I hated him by the end of the book. I'm one of those people who can't quit in the middle...If I were, I would have. He can take many pages to describe in the dryest manner some of the most uninteresting things...even things like describing exactly how the person's fingers wrap around an object in order to pick it up. So many times I simply wanted to scream \\"Get on with it man!!!\\" The two stars are for his imagination. The idea of a person dying while of on an OBE was fascinating in itself. There were horrifying moments, but I had difficulty relating to the characters and the ultimate resolution was less than satisfying."},{"Title":"Total Cash Management: A Company-Wide System for Forecasting, Managing, and Improving Cash Flow","review":"I was surprise to review the book and found chapter after chapter that the topics were of interest but no examples, invented or from the real world.

'Journey To The West' has everything from monkey mayhem to monsters, and magic. The quest for the sacred Buddhist sutras in India makes for an exciting journey filled with danger, demons and damsels. If you love classic Chinese literature or Buddhism, then you have to read 'Journey To The West'. I understand that in 2001, a TV movie entitled, 'The Monkey King' is scheduled for released. The following is a summary of the movie: &quot;American journalist Nick Orton is caught up in the world of Chinese gods and monsters while on a search for the long lost manuscript to 'Hsi Yu Chi' (The Journey to the West) by Wu Ch'eng En.

Richard describes his own journey toward solitude with humility and honesty. He outlines the health benefits of stillness as well as unexpected contemplative and creative outcomes of solitude and makes numerous &quot;doable&quot; suggestions as to how to bring more silence into even the busiest life. He cogently makes the point that a life lived from the deepest part of our souls, not only requires but demands stillness. As you read the book, you see that silence is not a luxury, it is a necessity for a thoughtful and conscious life. This is a book I want people I love to read and I am buying several copies to give away as gifts. In addition, I work with people living with cancer and will be sure to make them available to both the staff as well as our client library. Thank you, Richard!"},{"Title":"Stillness: Daily Gifts of Solitude","review":"I own a lot of books on solitude. However, this one is a nice overview of the subject. The most helpful parts of the book actually comes in his use of a wide variety of other books and materials. The book liberally quotes from many other books on solitude. It is a good place to start on the subject and branch off into more authors. The author tends to mention yoga and eastern spirituality quite a lot but never beats the reader over the head with it. It comes across as sensible and reasonable and not prone to navel gazing. The only improvement could have come with his journal entries from his 90 days spent in solitude. The journal entries tend to jump around and not add much light to the material. This is not a journal written in solitude but rather an overview of the subject after having digested 90 days in solitude. His advice is to try 30 minutes of silence per day without radio, TV, books, or other outside interference. It definitely deepened my interest in the subject and left me desiring some solitude."},{"Title":"Effective International Joint Venture Management: Practical Legal Insights for Successful Organization and Implementation","review":"Effective International Joint Venture Management by Dr. Ronald Charles Wolf, an American attorney resident decades in Lisbon, Portugal, has received joint acclaim from the academic world and from corporate entrepreneurs. It is a practical guide to all the essential steps required in the formation and management of an international joint venture. This explicit and lucid textbook is for all members of the international business community, lawyers, teachers and students. It is written in non-technical language but reviews thoroughly complex commercial, financial and legal topics. It is an indispensable guide for the international executives responsible for cross-border mergers and acquisitions and their advisors. Typical comments are:&quot;There has been a large amount written in the strategic management literature about when to set up an international joint venture (IJV), how to choose a partner, and how to manage the new venture.

These sociological details refer to a discover of a scientist of a underground forgotten civilization divided into a complex castes system and he needs to escape. A compelling read."},{"Title":"City of endless night","review":"Written shortly after the guns of World War I fell silent, CITY OF ENDLESS NIGHT presents a strange yet well-conceived vision of the future that might have been, had the Great War ended differently. The premise is that allied bombing in an extended WWI had driven the Germans in Berlin underground into a series of bunkers and subterranean factories. The Germans quickly discovered ways of surviving under these bizarre conditions, while the Allies failed to figure out any means of ferreting them out, and the war turned into a frustrating stalemate.The story is set long after this event, when an American accidentally ends up in underground Berlin and attempts to pass himself off as a citizen. The underground city is a horrifying dystopia built along the latest scientific principles.Milo Hastings has a nice appreciation for the possibilities and perils of civilization and technology. He was at one point a poultry scientist, and later a proponent of health food and healthy living in an era where such things were unusual. A scientist, a believer in the Common Man, in fresh air, sunshine, good food, and healthy living, Hastings wrote convincingly of a society that made Orwell's 1984 look like a walk in the park.I find this book to be strangely compelling. The plot runs along familiar pulp-fiction lines, but because the story comes from an era where even non-fiction was written as if it were pulp fiction, this rarely detracts from the story. And the underground city and its society, with their odd combination of WWI-era archisms and appallingly plausible innovations, kept me fascinated to the very end."},{"Title":"City of endless night","review":"This is a wonderful book written in 1926, which gives an alternate ending to WWI that pits Germany against the free world for 150 years causing the Germans to innovate in the field of science, and degenerate in the area of morals.

It is an interesting sociological thought experiment, and definitely worth your time whether you are looking for a standard dystopian novel, or a classic science fiction. Take a look at this classic read."},{"Title":"City of endless night","review":"This book was written before Huxley's \\"Brave New World\\" and Orwell's \\"1984\\", and makes me think these famous authors were inspired by City of Endless night.

Most of all, the presentation of Joe Wilmer's job as an owner of a first-run movie theater and his dealings with the union is fascinating. This is a novel that could have only been written by Jim Thompson."},{"Title":"Nothing More Than Murder","review":"This novel is Jim Thompson at his best. A tale of small town fraud, murder, lies and adultery. Joe Wilmot is a part-owner of a small movie house with a passion for conning his employees and talking down the unions. He is a man with it all sewn up, an arrogant man with a deadly fraud in mind. But the final twist in the form of his mistress and a tenacious insurance investigator called Appleton, brings this powerful tale of suspense to a shuddering, disturbing conclusion. Very similar in places to Double Indeminity, but still Thompson at his best."},{"Title":"Nothing More Than Murder","review":"I find that Jim Thompson's novels sometimes have confusing dialogue that throws the reader off trying to work out what was meant.Originally I thought that this was just a case of the author not being clear enough but the more I read Thompson, the more I get the feeling that he intentionally sought to avoid clarity as this leads the reader to think about the dialogue themselves and with the elements of fear prevalent throughout his books, it is hoped that the reader adds to the fear by their opinions on what was said.In this book (one of Thompson's earliest), he goes a little bit too indepth into the workings of the 1940's cinema houses but it is an interesting read. As with a lot of his work, the book boils down to the element of lack of trust between two people who (supposedly) love each other.This is a scary novel and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Nothing More Than Murder","review":"This early novel by Jim Thompson is narrated by Joe Wilmot, a smalltown movie theater operator whose reputation as a chiseler is disputed by few. Joe rather unwisely gets himself involved in a love triangle of sorts. One where all three participants have murder on their mind.The plot of Nothing More Than Murder is irritatingly rambling with too many digressions into the arcania of film distribution and exhibition. The dialogue is well crafted but the characters themselves fail to ring true.Readers electing to skip this particular Thompson offering will not be missing much."},{"Title":"Nothing More Than Murder","review":"Not my favorite Jim Thompson, but with a kind of standard mystery ending. Not his usual extreme noir self. Still good, with a rather improbable ending regarding Carol."},{"Title":"Nothing More Than Murder","review":"'Nothing More Than Murder' is nothing more than a short novel by Jim Thompson which chronicles the schenanigans of the small town cinema operator, a murder (no surprise here :-)) and its aftermath. The book is at its best when after the murder everyone seemingly knows who is guilty and tries to extort money from the murderer. And the book's ending is very good, creative (without being gross).Unfortunately throughout the book the author gives us an exhaustively detailed lesson on the business aspects of operating a movie theater circa 1950. While certainly those interested in the film trade from a historical perspective (... the world has moved on with the advent of multiplex cinemas and high tech video equipment), I fear most folks will find it tiresome. I personally lost interest in it rather quickly.Bottom line: lots of dull, overly detailed chatter almost spoils this story of murder and greed. But, as with any Jim Thompson novel, it is still a worthy read."},{"Title":"Nothing More Than Murder","review":"This was not the debut novel of its author Jim Thompson but it was a first in two respects-his debut as a crime novelist and the first time he scored a popular success and chalked up decent sales figures .It is a tale that evokes the James M Cain classic \\"Double Indemnity\\" as it tells the story of the conception and unravelling of an insurance scam ;there are also overtones of Cain's other great work \\"The Postman Always Rings Twice\\" in its depeiction of a marriage gone sour and the intrusion of an outsider into the relationshipStoreville is a small Midwest town -its population is 7,500 -where Joe Wilmot runs an independent movie theatre .His marriage to rhe blue blooded Elizabeth is a loveless one and he is drawn to the hired help ,a business college student named Carol FarmerElixabeth is aware of the relationship and uses it to engineer an insurance scam -she will appear to die in a fire in the theatre ,caused by faulty electrical equipment ,but another woman's body will be substituted ,The insurance money will then be sent to ElizabethThings do not however go according to planThe plaot is okay but what lets the side down a bit is the characterization -Joe is a pale echo of the contolling figure of the similar Cain titles .like Frank Chambers from \\"Postman\\"or Walter ( Double Indemnity )A glib and facile thuggish man ,he remains controlled by his wife and never quite convincesThere is enough of the distinctive Thompson grit to sustain interest but he got better with experience and this does not touch the heights of late booksHistoeically important -but he did better"},{"Title":"Financial Dynamics: A System for Valuing Technology Companies","review":"Dr. Westland provides a well argued case for replacing existing corporate valuation methods with the Financial Dynamics system described in his book."},{"Title":"Financial Dynamics: A System for Valuing Technology Companies","review":"I've had this book for about two weeks, and am halfway through reading it. The text is a mix of storytelling and methodology which makes enjoyable reading. I have been using the software to compute tech stock prices. I am really amazed at how useful the software is. The valuations generated by the software are presented both as graphs of future cash flows with confidence limits that describe how risky they are (the author calls these value cones) and as present values. The software predictions are a big improvement over existing cash flow analysis. I've already made some modest profits applying them to online trades.

It didn't have a jacket on its hardcover so I could only see its title, which I thought was very different and clever. Turns out that the story was humorous in a dark, satirical way. I liked it.Setting is WWII America, and the main character is John Jones, a professor of ancient languages and cultures. Through the power of an unintended incantation, he receives life altering powers: the ability to paralyze a person w/ a certain word or by pointing a finger, and the ability to kill by doing both simultaneously.He realizes this power could be beneficial to ending the war, however he comes across roadblock after useless roadblock in Washington D.C. while trying to reach the President and tell him his ideas.There are also some good supporting characters that add to the book. Overall, I wish the story would have been longer. Or maybe a sequel. I really can't believe I'm the first one to leave a review. More people should read this book, they'd like it."},{"Title":"Zotz!","review":"USN Capt. Walter Karig (1898-1956) wrote a series ofBATTLE REPORTvolumes on WWII and Korea. He scripted episodes of TV'sVICTORY AT SEA, was ghostwriter of three Nancy Drew mysteries and other teen novel series. HisDON'T TREAD ON ME(1954) is a fictionalized account of the adventures of John Paul Jones. Karig's first novel,LOWER THAN ANGELSwas marketed as tawdry romance stuff.NEELY(1953) is for young boys.Thanks to William Castle, Capt. Karig lives on, if tangentially, in the producer/director's loose screen adaptation ofZOTZ!(1962). Be advised: the book and the comic film are very different works.Here, Prof. John Jones is in his late 50s. He's sent via mail a pottery obelisk inscribed in an ancient language. Jones learns the secret powers of Zotz in his backyard just before a bolt of lightning destroys the disc. He apparently keeps these superhuman abilities for life. There's no bad guys who pursue Jones, and his just saying \\"Zotz\\" causes things to not slow down but disintegrate, yet still live. That particular power isn't explored in the narrative.After he gains the power to stun or kill any living thing, an otherwise pacifistic Prof. Jones determines to parachute behind enemy lines and assassinate Adolf Hitler with the point of a finger and the spoken word \\"Zotz.\\" His many efforts to see Pres. Roosevelt are thwarted by layers of bureaucracy. Karig himself appears as one of the obstacles to the professor's goal, and he's later entrusted by the old gent to write his story.A side plot involves a voluptuous young librarian with a snake fetish who works at the university where Jones teaches. Although she's half his age, there's indication they may someday get together, that is if Jones can convince himself she's not an agent of Zotz or part of some nefarious government plot..The book has its moments, but also drags in places. Karig is weakest while trying to \\"write funny.\\" His penchant for inane philosophical and political monologues are distracting, perhaps just filler. The author is best in describing such things as a lightning strike, a man drowning in a turgid, polluted river, or the heated foreplay of an aborted lovemaking session.The first and last few chapters must've been written first, for these contain the lion's share of Karig's language esoterica: truckle, gackle, griff, gooseberry fool, nixie, limgam, tester bed, pelage, garden-close and fictile are all trotted out for our puzzled bemusement.I sought ZOTZ! out because of Castle's movie. The experience wasn't what I expected but it was worthwhile."},{"Title":"Zotz!","review":"I have wonderful memories of Tom Poston in the movie Zotz! I looked forward to this book to re-experience that on the page, but it dragged and just missed the mark for me. I guess I'm spoiled by the movies.The story developed with an alluring hook of a magical notion from the ancient past. Once this was fleshed out, the story just hit the mud. All I remember is the tedium of this mundane character trying every avenue of government he could think of to get someone else to take it off his hands. Boring!Every child dreams of having that kind of power at their disposal.It ends up in the anti-climax of water drifting into the gulf after a thousand mile journey down the Mississippi - diffuse and anonymous."},{"Title":"Zotz!","review":"Just found a copy of this book in an antique (junky) shop while vacationing in Minnesota. Remembered the title from a delightful movie I saw while in the 8th or 9th grade. Tom Poston very memorable in starring role, Jim Backus in a role he practically copyrighted, that of a pompous etc. etc. Kind of an audition for Mr. Howell on \\"Gilligan's Island\\". Also remember being given a plastic copy of the Zotz! coin used in movie. Wished I'd kept it, probably worth $10 on e-bay now.Story is dated but easily updated and comedy of military bureaucracy is right on.The actual movie is available on \\"YouTube\\" in nine 10 minute segments. Very good clear edition with strong bandwidth. Thank you someone for posting it. Only out for sale in a large collection of the director's work on DVD, otherwise, VHS only.The movie is in the style of Disney's \\"The Absent-Minded Professor\\" and will be remade someday by someone, probably a Will Farrell or Eddie Murphy and us old geezers will complain, the old 1962 movie uses some \\"Matrix\\" like special effects, slowing down of a bullet, spinning in mid-air of a falling man.Novel only out in one edition due to absolute \\"averageness\\" of writing. Holds a special place in my heart just because of nostalgia, an emotion I'm unable to explain."},{"Title":"Zotz!","review":"I first heard of Zotz when I saw the awful film based on it made back in the '60s. There was something that made me curious about it and I began to search for it. It wasn't till just a little while ago I was able to acquire a copy. Considering it was written in the late 1940s I think it is quite good. I'm surprised someone hasn't tried to update it and make a new film based on it. It is the story of a man given a great power and his attempts to help his country during WWII with his power and it lampoons the government bureaucracy, politicians and general attitudes of the times. Some claim the book has something to do with the atomic bomb and the great power it gave to our country and our inability to use it wisely. I won't go there and someone else can intellectualize about this all they want. I will say that \\"Zotz\\" while a little dated is still a good read."},{"Title":"V12 Engine","review":"I buy many books and can easily say this wins my \\"Book of the Year\\" award.I have just finished reading it from cover to cover - it is a big, beautiful book and is packed solid with good, interesting information.I like the technical detail, for example, reasons for designs, the problems and good points, explanations and photos of engines and engine parts. I think pretty much every engine discussed is illustrated with either photos, factory or other drawings, excellent cross-sectioned drawings - the illustrations are really good!Also, the engine designers are mentioned so you can keep track of them.There have been an amazing array of V 12 engines built over the last 100 years, I am astonished at the sheer volume of work it must have taken to research this book, and am very glad that the author took this task on."},{"Title":"V12 Engine","review":"This book is represented and advertised as containing substantial technical detail, and several previous reviewers echoed that representation (including one who claimed there were 600 pages instead of the actual 424).Although the quality of the paper and printing are very high, and although the book does contain lots of pretty pictures and some interesting sectional drawings, this work is so devoid of technical detail as to be infuriating.There is more technical information on V-12 engines in Graham White's superb book ALLIED AIRCRAFT PISTON ENGINES OF WW2, and it does not even represent itself as being a technical writing. I write technical analysis articles for Race Engine Technology magazine, and therefore have certain expectations of content when a work is represented as being TECHNICAL. Quotes from various \\"authorities\\" at Road and Track and Car and Driver describing \\"the smoothest idle...\\", \\"the lowest vibration...\\", \\"the clarity of the radio\\", etc. hardly qualify as technical.Yes, the book contains historical anecdotes galore about various evolutionary examples of V-12 engines, life histories of their various designers and promoters, plentiful repetitions of this-much power and that-much torque and how fast the car went, but not a single power / torque / BSFC plot in the entire 424 pages; no substantial discussion of primary and secondary balance issues, bending and torsional stress issues, failure issues, etc. etc.The closest this book comes to a technical discussion is an appendix containing a 5-page condensation of a brilliant paper on V-12 firing order problems by Dan Whitney. Unfortunately, this condensed version omits several of the most important points made in the original paper.(added 01/21/13) BTW, if anyone would like to BUY my copy of this misrepresented picture book, you can have mine (AS NEW CONDITION) for half the advertised price!"},{"Title":"V12 Engine","review":"I bought this book recently as I love V12 engines.Finally,a book devoted to the various V12 engines.This book covers the lot.

The volume is filled with period photos, cutaway drawings, and engineering cross-sections, all enhancing the concise but detailed text. Well laid out in chronological fashion, it's easy to follow the development of the engines from pre WWI sloggers to the modern 500 horsepower supercar engines. Grand Prix race engines also get extensive coverage. The beautiful color galleries are an added bonus. One might say it's a coffee table book, but with books like this one i'm willing to invest in a bigger coffee table. The only minor quibble i have is that some of the drawings and cross-sections are difficult for me to appreciate fully without a magnifying glass, but maybe i'm just getting old."},{"Title":"V12 Engine","review":"The author is British plain and simple, and it show with whimsical sayings like 'monkey motion' and the like. Outstanding historical documentation, but the author overwhelms with minutiae like bore and stroke for every engine, and which cylinder bank is staggered forward.Also the author completely disregards the 180 degree V-12s (not boxing, boxing has 180 Vee angle with a 180 degree split crank journal) and spends too much time on VV12s (three banks of four cylinders).There are some errors in the coverage of modern engines, notably VW VR6 and W12 information. and the author fails to explain the inherrent balance of an inline six, and how any vee angle V12 is balanced, but not necessarily even firing.A good value, and the color photos are icing on the cake."},{"Title":"V12 Engine","review":"A truly excellent work for those enchanted by the fine detail of technology. A myriad of fine drawings and half tones backed up by colour plates of the V12's birth and development through the century. Karl's fluid and emminently readable style maintains interest with pithy anecdotes like Henry Ford's reason for sticking with 4 cylinders rather than 6: \\"A car should have no more cylinders than a cow has teats\\". From 1.5 litres to 27 litres the V12 story is always absorbing."},{"Title":"V12 Engine","review":"Ludvigen's book on the V-12 is a well researched but compulsively readable account of the extraordinary and powerful engines with the lavish specification of having twelve cylinders. While giving details of design and development, the author also evokes the mixture of power, refinement and mechanical sophistication offered by these exotic engines from Ferrari, Aston-Martin, Mercedes and BMW while not neglecting the glorious history of the American Packard and Cadillac applications of of the V 12. It is like reading a book describing food where every bite is of gourmet quality, a city where all the streets are clean and beautiful or a dinner where all the guests are witty and candlelight glows off the bare shoulders of lovely, sophisticated women."},{"Title":"V12 Engine","review":"I have been slowly reading and researching the automobiles this book mentions for the past month. The book is filled with references to never before publicized engine programs.For example, did you know that Ford made a V12 out of their now legendary 4.6L V8? The car is used in an Austin Martin, Ford is the parent company.Little details like this will keep popping up as you read this book. You'll never believe which V6 Ford engine was used to make the other V12 detailed in this book.The book was printed on high quality paper, giving the images of these rare engines an almost artistic quality on the pages inside. The photo of a BMW V12 engine pulling on a dyno with it's turbos giving off a red glow is spectacular!"},{"Title":"V12 Engine","review":"Any book by Karl Ludvigsen is encyclopedic, well researched, and well written. This one fits the pattern. It is a comprehensive history of V-12 engines, mostly in cars but also some applications in airplanes and boats.The level of technical detail is well suited to the general reader but might not satisfy an automotive engineer."},{"Title":"V12 Engine","review":"This is a very high quality volume which is well illustrated with photos and technical drawings of manyV12 engines, old and new. The author's text is extensive, detailed, complete, and very well-written.It displays a comprehensive knowledge and understanding of the subject. There are many obscureand unique engines, as well as many old favorites. One wonders how the author came to have someof the illustrations, as many are of design detail and quality; not usually seen in a publication suchas this. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!In addition to the main text, there is an appendix discussing firing orders used by different V12s. Written byDan Whitney, of AEHS {Aircraft Engine Historical Society}, it explores an obscure topic which proves tobe quite interesting. Left unanswered, however, is firing intervals and how the designers deal withnon-standard Vee angles. Many engines use angles other than 60 degrees; this gives a firinginterval of 60 degrees of crankshaft rotation. Different Vee angles result in uneven intervals, unlessspecial features are provided in the design. This could be an interesting topic for a future discussion."},{"Title":"This Happy Breed","review":"This BBC radio version of Coward's famous play made me cry, as did \\"The Vortex\\" which I saw yesterday. Think Coward was an incredibly versatile, multi-faceted genius. Can well understand his sobriquet \\"The Master\\". I liked the story, the very interesting characters, the dialog, the wonderful acting and all the funny lines. I'm glad I heard it and obviously I enjoyed it. That said, the underlying idea was so much middle class schlock, without which there would have been no play. I also liked the way it was set up (Coward's idea or the director's?) - the musical interludes between scenes (each scene being in a different time period, the whole play spanning some 20 years). Each musical interlude was a song from the time of the scene played by a small orchestra. The songs BTW were American.In this play, the father, Frank, who gives more sermons than Marcus Welby, is an Atheist (so was Coward despite the fact that he was named Noel because he was born a day or 2 before xmas), said something I've thought for years and never heard anyone (not even Russell) say - that he doesn't want a god that singles some people out for special treatment and lets the rest go rot (said when he talks about the people who were killed or injured in WWI (the end of which is when the play begins, he's just home from it) and his wife counters with all the people who weren't)."},{"Title":"This Happy Breed","review":"Just want to simply say that the used book/script I ordered was in much better shape that I though I was going to get.Thank youOvi Vargas"},{"Title":"THE OCEAN WORLD OF JACQUES COUSTEAU VOLUME 3: Quest for Food","review":"Over time, several people have mentioned their confusion over the many different books which appear to have the same name of \`The Ocean World of Jacques Cousteau' and, because no other person appears to have submitted a review for any of these excellent books, I offer this explanation which I hope is helpful.In 1972/3 Jacques Cousteau produced a book of 20 volumes under the overall title \`The Ocean World of Jacques Cousteau' with each volume covering a different aspect of the sea. Over time, different publishers reproduced this series of books in their own matching style. That is to say, the content remained the same but the covers varied - with some editions being clearly numbered 1-20. In 1978, Volume 21 was added and this was a complete expos&eacute; of his famous research ship \`Calypso' (currently being restored in France!). Finding a matching set of the first 20 volumes is difficult enough and a matching set of all 21 is almost impossible.That said, full matching sets of either 20 or 21 books are occasionally offered for sale but they are soon snapped up. My own 21 volumes were purchased here and there and do not match at all. Nevertheless, I would much rather own a complete unmatched set than not have these books readily to hand because they are full of information which is as relevant today as it ever was.The volumes are: 1. Oasis in Space, 2. The Act of Life, 3. Quest for Food, 4. Window in the Sea, 5. The Art of Motion, 6, Attack and Defence, 7. Invisible Messages, 8. Instinct and Intelligence, 9. Pharaohs of the Sea, 10. Mammals in the Sea, 11. Provinces of the Sea, 12. Man Re-Enters Sea, 13. A Sea of Legends, 14. Adventure of Life, 15. Outer and Inner Space, 16. The Whitecaps, 17. Riches of the Sea, 18. Challenges of the Sea, 19. The Sea in Danger, 20. Guide to the Sea and Index and, of course, 21. Calypso.Each book is approx. 145 pages and by purchasing individual volumes at the best possible price, it is comparatively easy to collect a full unmatched set.Many years later, the content was condensed into a single book called \`The Ocean World' although this is slightly different.Whereas some information may be out-of-date, the reality of the underlying message in each volume remains as relevant today as it was when first written and I fully recommend this series of books.Altogether, well worth the effort of obtaining a full set of 21!NM"},{"Title":"When You Can't Say \\"I Forgive You\\": Breaking the Bonds of Anger and Hurt","review":"This book is excellent for a guide to letting go of hurt and anger and being able to live a meaningful life.

I could well conceive that this is because the dreambody defies a certain degree of rational, verbal understanding.Mindell's writing style is fluid, refreshingly down to earth and modest, clear and usually quite accessible. The fault I find with the book is in its focus and formatting. He sometimes seems to shy away from his primary topics, and we find ourselves reading some tangential fairy tales and a slightly muddled, repetitive explanation of the dreambody in the context of physics.Nevertheless, the ideas that Mindell offers us here are powerful, transformative, ancient, beautiful, and accessible. His description of the dreambody is not absolutely full and clear, (p 164: &quot;...the dreambody is composed of all the different degrees of awareness. It has both physiological and dream aspects which are easily differentiated from one another, and it possesses an inner dichotomy which I have variously described...as temporal and nontemporal...&quot; etc.) However I think that many people will read about his concept and say to themselves, &quot;Ah yes, I know what he's talking about!&quot; And fill in the blanks with their own experience. It is an invaluable concept.His final chapter &quot;Working with the Dreambody,&quot; however, is altogether fantastic. You do not need to be chronically ill to find his methods of magnifying a feeling or illness, in order to find out its message, extremely useful. His method may sound obscure in this review, but here Mindell is at ease in his writing, and in reading this chapter I think the method becomes quite clear.Immediately after finishing this book I read &quot;The Shaman's Body&quot; also by Mindell. There he writes with greater confidence and thoroughness, but the books really are quite different, so one cannot replace the other.Overall, I am tremendously impressed, and grateful to Mindell for sharing the insights he's been given with all of us."},{"Title":"Dreambody: The body's role in revealing the self","review":"This is the first book I've read by Mindell and maybe I need to become more familiar with his world - his writing is rather obscure - a bit like the description of alchemy - explaining the obscure by the more obscure. Perhaps it is because I'm African that many of the explanations do not strike a chord or produce an &quot;aha&quot; experience, but more often a &quot;huh?&quot;. HOwever, I'm just beginning on this journey with Mindell and perhaps as I work more and more with his very interesting practical section on working with the dreambody I will begin to understand.

Was it quality circles, TQM, or re-engineering you last tried as a way to rejuventate your struggling organzation? Victor and Boynton suggest you save your money and focus within. Their logical process of analysis and implementation will help your firm on the &quot;right path&quot; to organizational success.The process demands that firms think clearly and carefully about who they are and what business they are in compared to what their customers really want. This analysis helps a firm determine if it should compete on the basis of novelty, commodity, quality, or precision. The choice made suggests that craft work, mass production, process enhancement, or mass customization provides the best strategy to meet those customer demands. Achieving these strategies can only occur as a firm moves from craft work, through mass production and process enhancement to mass customization via the &quot;right path.&quot;In an engaging combination of personal insight and case examples, the authors lead the reader along the &quot;path.&quot; They offer numerous stories of organizations around the world that have followed this &quot;path&quot; to organizational success.Don't let the reletive brevity of their effort mislead you. The ideas they propose should force the thoughful manager into careful and thoughful consideration of the firm's current structure, products, and processes. If the analysis suggests that changes are warranted, then Victor and Boynton's guidebook along the &quot;right path&quot; will prove well worth the initial investment.A thoughtful, creative tour de force in a field littered with lightweight, feel-good competitors.

Strategy alone is not enough.The great value of this book lies in 3 areas :i) Use of illustrating failure as well as success - better to learn from someone else's mistakes so that you can, hopefully, avoid them.ii) Identifying in meaningful terms where to position your organisation for your product/service e.g. if you need a great mass production machine, that is how you should organize; when your customers need more, don't hide from it - just do it well.iii) The style is refreshingly alive. You feel you can relate to real people solving real problems. Too often, books like this feel like they belong only in libraries - this one offers genuinely practical insight. It's up to you to apply it.If I have one (minor) criticism, it is the title. Don't let it mislead you.

Nichols, at the beginning of this edition, as the \\"first modern literary biography\\", which is true, to some extent. Yet, in a time when a string of biographies written on more or less famous people seems to have, as only purpose, the crude expositions of mildly interesting (if at all) juicy tidbits, and this usually in a poor prose, this book, written in the 14th century by the author of the \\"Decameron\\", is at the same time light-hearted, poetic and informative. It gives us not only an insight into Dante's life, work and personality, but also into that of Boccaccio (and his infamous aversion to marriage, at least to that of the 'philosophers') and into the Florence both knew.But most important and touching I think is the honest love for Dante's works and admiration for the man that are on display in every page, even when Boccaccio addresses Dante's faults. And of course, the style of the Florentine, one of the great writers behind the foundation of the Italian literature, only adds to the interest of this biography. A very refreshing reading, and a must for those of you who are at least curious about one of the major masterpieces of European literature and the man behind it."},{"Title":"Life of Dante","review":"Invaluable to anyone interested in Italian literature, Dante or Boccaccio. Boccaccio, of course was a great admirer of Dante's, wrote a commentary on the Divine Comedy and was greatly influenced by him. Writing at a time when Dante was not given the respect he has since (surely inevitably) gained, Boccaccio wrote this biography of him, pointing out his great merits as a person, poet, and political figure. It's fascinating to see the results, with insights on every page into both Dante, Boccaccio, and also Florentine society of the time. There are wonderful stories about Dante to illustrate his peculiarities as a man - I particularly enjoyed the story of him vandalising a workman's tools for misquoting the Comedy. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Life of Dante","review":"This book probably couldn't be labeled as overly entertaining, but it is very interesting. For one thing, it's the very first biography of Dante. Even more importantly, it's written by Giovanni Boccaccio, one of the great luminaries of Italian literature. As far as I know, no other biography written by one literary genius about another exists.I was pleased to find a lot of material and anecdotes in it that I had also found in modern biographies. I also enjoyed reading firsthand the adoration that Dante's people poured upon him so soon after \\"The Divine Comedy\\" was written.There are a few things in the book that might surprise modern readers. The supposed unhappiness of Dante's marriage is talked about for quite some time, despite Boccaccio acknowledging that he has no evidence of marital troubles besides his (Boccaccio's) own personal misogyny. Also, medieval literary theory and Boccaccio's opinions on literature sidetrack the narrative a bit, but that is simply how biographies were written at the time.The only thing I don't like and can't explain is why the publishers included a story from \\"The Decameron\\" at the end of the book. The tale isn't about Dante and does not add to the biography."},{"Title":"Life of Dante","review":"More than a simple biography, Boccaccio's The Life of Dante is an ode to a master by his pupil.

It is actually a farce - a play that is light in tone, in which the plot depends upon situation rather than character; a ridiculous unrealistic sham; a mockery. Shaw introduces the historical Catherine as a rather silly German ruler of Russia, who dislikes everything associated with being a ruler, who likes sexual liaisons. She meets an English captain who is, as Shaw generally portrays Englishmen, a foolish undereducated snob, for Shaw (1856-1950), who was brilliant, was born an Irishman. Shaw tells us that the actress for whom he wrote the play performed excellently. We readers will find the play funny, although at times, like the Englishman, silly, but still worth reading for its humor."},{"Title":"Great Catherine","review":"I was unable to finish this book.

He is also to some relgiously motivated (which raises my suspicions considerably). Nevertheless, I believe it is a unique resource for heterosexual men whose erotic life has been dominated by same sex attraction. It illustrates clearly why that previous sentence is not an utter contradiction in terms.Nicolosi expresses the nature of male-male attraction as it affects some men - including myself - in a more lucid and humane way than I have ever come across elsewhere. For a long time I have travelled alone with my view of why I spent all my teens and most of my twenties fetishising maleness and being very insecure in my own. This book and Nicolosi's 'Healing Homosexuality : Case Stories of Reparative Therapy' which contains very similar themes to this book, have been a revalation to me.Another reviewer here criticises the book as psychobabble. Nicolosi's book probably does read lik! e psychobabble if you don't know what it is like to be stuck with the dilemma that you prefer men, believe you are strong enough to come out, but just don't want to because you know something's not right. The reason why it's not right is because, for some men, there gayness is a symptom of the fact they never felt like other men and consciously or unconsciously craved to be men, but never knew how.That is my story. The great objection that might be raised, which Nicolosi deals with neatly, is that I have been conditioned to hate gays and hate gay-ness in myself by a society which does not accept nonconformity. That's where my self-hatred comes from. For me, that's psychobabble.Nicolosi also presents a clear critique of the virulence with which some gay men react to the notion that there may be those with similar desires to their own who believe they would like to change and can change to a fundamental heterosexual orientation. Like Nicolosi I think this smacks of the sa! me doctrinare and bigoted viewpoint which gay men - rightly! - feel they are too often faced with."},{"Title":"Reparative Therapy of Male Homosexuality: A New Clinical Approach","review":"Nicolosi has written a fine work that speaks for countless homosexually-oriented men who do not choose to embrace the &quot;gay life.&quot; This timely and greatly needed book represents those men who find themselves attracted to other men, yet know that their ultimate fulfillment and wholeness won't be found by &quot;coming out.&quot; They're not confused. Rather, these men have chosen a decisively bold and courageous counter-cultural journey of inner-healing and healthy relating that has often left them ignored and unrecognized. That is, until now!"},{"Title":"Reparative Therapy of Male Homosexuality: A New Clinical Approach","review":"Nicolosi writes from practical therapuetic experience giving hope for those who want change and find their isn't much help available out there.

Good details on origins and the change process."},{"Title":"Reparative Therapy of Male Homosexuality: A New Clinical Approach","review":"I have read this book repeatedly and have also given it away as a gift to others struggling with same sex attractions who are unhappy with their state of mind and being. In each and every case the level of anxiety and distress was reduced after the reading of this book. The fact that our homosexuality is caused by a lack an intimate relationship with the same sex parent was critical in my understanding of self and homo-erotic tendencies. I will shout this books material from the roof tops whenever I hear from those blind individuals that there is no way to healing or that healing does not exist in this fashion. It does work if you have the desire to fight and be painfully honest with self. Brilliantly presented material in an easy to read fashion."},{"Title":"Reparative Therapy of Male Homosexuality: A New Clinical Approach","review":"I read this book and it was very interesting. However it cannot be overlooked that many of the cases Nicolosi uses were of men who were sexually abused or who were otherwise emotionally disturbed. One can hardly assume that these are typical cases and thus one can't generalize as Nicolosi does. Also Nicolosi says that change is not always possible, but asserts that this emotional realization will ultimately lead to heterosexuality. I will give him much credit for speaking against therapy that only seeks to affirm the patient. It is useless to constantly tell a patient to love him or herself if, indeed, that person's \\"self\\" is not optimal or productive. Also, although biology may play a major role in homosexuality one should be wary of assuming that as determinative. Many of those studies are predispository and will only support the anti-gay fetish by portraying all gays and lesbians as animals who are \\"results\\" of their physical lusts. So this is an insightful book, but Nicolosi makes some very bold assumptions, is a bit chauvanistic, and theorizes that whenever a homosexual man is in therapy his anxiety is always caused by his homosexuality rather than the many other things that homosexuals as well as heterosexual deal with. It is a one-dimensional Catholic view of human sexuality but must be read for the emotional perspective. The problem in this country is not homosexuality, it is the religious right's obsession with precepts upon precepts while living a double standard, the left's one dimensional reactionary politics and pseudo-altruism while both sides are doing nothing. The problem in this country is the deep cynicism and the total obliviousness of the human condition. We are not dealing with God here, we are dealing with flesh and blood, human will against human will, and the forces of nature. Public sanctimony and peace doves will do little to save our families or to fully understand the human condition."},{"Title":"Reparative Therapy of Male Homosexuality: A New Clinical Approach","review":"After hearing Nicolosi in a conference I was interested that he has recently claimed to continue this work on over 500 patients.

Nicolosi rationally and thoroughly discusses homosexual behavior as a symptom of a disorder rather than a genetically inherited lifestyle. His work is sound and his research hard to dispute.

Although I did not come out of that lifestyle, I have friends who have (and friends who have tried and not succeeded), and have had many of the emotional precursors to homosexuality in my own history. Reading books such as this have helped me become a healthy man.In my own journey, I have had to painstakingly cull the truths in this book from many religious books, which has not been fun. This book clearly presents the basic ideas behind reparative therapy without resorting to preaching - the only book on this topic that I have ever seen.Most gay recovery books are written by evangelical Christians who force you to convert (i.e. become &quot;born again&quot;) in order to heal. The problem with this, imho, is two-fold. First of all, the authors often neglect some of the deep emotional issues that need to be explored or systematically examined by saying &quot;just commit yourself to Jesus and his love will heal you.&quot; Experiencing the love of God and developing a spiritual life certainly may heal the injured soul, but this is often a copout for lazy pseudo-psychologists who know little of the science of emotional development and the psyhological tools for exploring and healing the wounded soul.The second problem with conversion therapy is that it shuts out many people who are not ready or don't want to convert to Christianity, when many, if not most, of the tools for healing homosexuality can be employed independently of faith - things like understanding true masculinity v. the false masculinity that many men have rejected, etc.Most human characteristics have both biologic and environmental causes (a.k.a. nature and nurture), but the ratio may not always be 50/50. I believe that the same holds true for sexuality, i.e. the factors that contribute to a homsexual orientation are probably both biologic and environmental. People who want to choose either/or here usually have a personal issue involved, and are not genuinely interested in finding the truth, but rather, are entrenched in their own position, defensively mocking or striking out at the fools on the other extreme.The real questions are:- is homosexuality a disorder or not? How do you determine what is a disorder? This is a long discussion (which I would love to have)- are there different types of homosexual? - are some types of homosexuality influenced primarily by genetic or biologic factors? If so, what are they, and what is the proposed mechanism?- are some types of homosexuality influenced primarily by environmental factors? - of this group, are some caused by environmental factors during development? If we assume this, by what mechanism? If bad or absent parental role models are the proposed cause, what corrective method is suggested? How well does it work?I believe that reparative therapy says &quot;yes, some, perhaps most cases of homosexuality are mainly caused by external relational factors that affect gender identity development, and can be corrected through therapy.&quot; Nicolisi paints in the details of this hypothesis with clarity and at least the appearance of scientific rigor, and documents results (albeit only the good ones ;) in his other book, mentioned below.Overall, this book is a great reference for those who want to study the perspective of reparative therapy.Other useful books, not as scientific or complete as Nicolisi's are listed below. However, all but the first two of these invoke Christianity and doctrine (a.k.a. &quot;conversion therapy&quot;), where Nicolisi's book remains mostly clinical and psychological in outlook.Being and Loving by Althea Horner (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED - she endorsed Nicolisi's book)Healing Homosexuality : Case Stories of Reparative Therapy by NicolisiCounseling the Homosexual by SaiaPursuing Sexual Wholeness by Comiskey (great chapter on gender identity malformation and healing)"},{"Title":"Reparative Therapy of Male Homosexuality: A New Clinical Approach","review":"I found this book to be very interesting.

It is my opinion, that much of the truth of the gay issue has been hidden and tucked away in order to promote a certain viewpoint in the media. The book goes into the failure of psychologists to recognize previous years of studies and their failure to offer real help to these men and women. It seems that instead of getting to the heart of why this problem came about, they instead try to help these men go on with their lives by telling them that there is nothing they can do about their homosexuality, except to accept it and live that lifestyle. But,I believe that many men struggle with their conscience and they find it very hard to feel good about the way they are living, as if this was okay with God. In order to live the gay lifestyle openly, it seems to me that you pretty much have to deny the existence of order in the universe. Trees bear fruit, animals bear offspring, people procreate. To say that living a lifestyle that defies nature, and to say that it is equally valid, is a lie. Anybody that actually believes that is just kidding themselves. To say that men are not capable of change, is also a lie. We are all changing, growing, people who are capable of overcoming difficulties if we aren't afraid to face them head on. This takes a lot of humility. This book is great, because it goes into the REASONS why men develop attractions to other men. It explains the defense mechanism that many boys use to protect their pysche from abusive, harsh, or withdrawn fathers, overprotective mothers, and not being able to bond with other boys. These boys tend to withdraw from their own identity, in that they reject the harshness of being a man. It seems to me that being bullied in school or not being accepted into a group of boys as a youth, can also have terrible consequences for boys.We live in a society that is falling apart for lack of enough good men. Boys are getting the impression that religion is feminine, that being in touch with oneself and feelings is also somehow feminine. It seems to me that in reality, many gay men are more of a man than those out there who would cover up their insecurities with sports. It's okay if men are not interested in sports or hunting. It's okay if a man's talent is in an area which may seem more feminine. It's time that we stopped seeing men in their \\"accepted careers\\" and gave them space to be what they want to be. They shouldn't have to feel any less masculine for being the man they want to be. But our society tells us that we need to fit into a certain box. Personal strength of character, is the thing that boys need to be able to be the best they can be, whatever direction they take. They get this strength from their homes, but also from their churches and communities. Being part of an organized church is a great strength to boys because they learn the principles that will make them strong men. They also get the support of other boys and the chance to interact with other boys in a positive way. The Boy Scout program is such a good example of boys learning how to be men and how to interact with other boys in a way that makes them feel valued. If boys don't have the interaction they need with their fathers at home, then church congregations and local boys programs are the next best thing. It seems to me, that we have this notion, that boys should just naturally know how to grow up and become a man. But, that idea is not true. They need guidance and support from older, more experienced men who care. This makes them feel valued and worthy. This is lacking in our society, and I believe that is one reason why we are seeing so many boys turn toward homosexuality. They don't know how to be men, but they want to be. Instead of feeling like a failure, they just simply escape by being \\"gay.\\" Our hearts should go out to these boys, instead of judging them harshly. Everyone needs to be treated with respect. Being a man can be a scary thing in today's world, but if men join and work together, like the Amish people do, then there is unity and acceptance and strength.The first part of this book goes into the details of the failure of the mental health profession and studies that have been done in the past. It also talks about the fact that, for the most part, living the gay lifestyle is not fulfilling and that it is very difficult for men to find true happiness there. It discusses why men seek out other men, in order to feel more masculine and valued by other men. It explains how the process of being accepted and valued by other men, gets sexualized because these men feel insecure in their ability to have a relationship with other men, based on mutual respect. The first part of the book goes into some of the ugliness of the gay lifestyle and this would affect the way the public views these men in general. I thought that it would have been good to present the fact more prominently, that many gay men are very intelligent, successful, giving and caring men. Joe does do that to a degree.The second part of the book goes into the therapy aspect of overcoming homosexuality, and why it can work. For someone just wanting to get on with the doing, you could just skip the first part and move on to the second half of the book, although, I think understanding that there is a lot of research to back up the therapy, is an important thing as well. I think it's wise for society to understand that human beings are very complex creatures, psychologically. Our development as children and youth, can have such a profound effect on who we will be. Our feelings and emotions can get mixed up.I read this book partly, to understand myself better. I am a heterosexual female, but like my friend, I feel like I suffered similar problems in my childhood. Because I was a girl, my lack of fatherly love and attention affected me differently. My father was harsh and critical and not around alot. He withdrew into the TV when he was home. He had a hard time interacting with his children in a positive way. This made me crave male attention and has affected my view of men and my marriage. I was insecure as a teenager because I didn't have the support from my father that I needed. The role that men play in raising children, is a very important role. Men are very important in society, and yet, we have the media downplaying their importance and telling us that we don't need men. The fact is, that we do need men. We need lots of good men. We need their strength of character and body, we need to be loved and cherished by them. Our children need to be spending time with their father's and appreciating the struggles that men have. We need supportive women to help this along. We need mothers who are not afraid of letting their boys turn into men.Traditionally, men have been the supporters and defenders. They were the ones who fought the wars and conquered the oppressor. Where has that idea gone? Men need to learn how to use a gun. They need to be taught how to work hard. They need to be taught to face their responsibilities in their gender identity as a man. That means responsible sex and being responsible for what you produce. All of this comes down to having and needing spiritual strength. In being humble and teachable, we are strong. Throwing away pride and admitting our errors is the first important step. We all have weaknesses, most likely brought on by some feeling created in childhood. Recognizing our feelings and dealing with them is also an important step. Men are told that feelings aren't masculine, so they shut them down. This only compounds the problem. Strength includes facing our feelings and letting them out. Learning how to express anger in an acceptable and productive way, is such an important part of being able to feel valued. Anger is not necessarily a bad thing. Expressing our feelings empowers us and lets us feel that we are important and that our feelings do matter. I believe that by simply validating the feelings of boys and men, that so many of these problems can be avoided. We need to quit putting on the perfectionist front and start realizing that none of us is perfect. It's okay if we don't appear perfect and strong all the time. God gives men weaknesses to make them humble. And if they accept their weakness with humility, God will and can turn that weakness into a strength."},{"Title":"Reparative Therapy of Male Homosexuality: A New Clinical Approach","review":"I am a former patient of Dr. Nicolosi and have obviously read this book, which is a collection of dangerous lies. Dangerous? Says who? Try the APA, AMA and American Association of Pediatrics.

There's nothing the least bit clinical about that. This book is absolute trash and that should be kept away from the youth of America."},{"Title":"Reparative Therapy of Male Homosexuality: A New Clinical Approach","review":"I read this book a few years ago and founds its message hopeful and addictive. I became so entranced by Dr. Nicolosi's appealing spin (he largely avoids the religious debate) that I sought out the local ex-gay Christian ministry to &quot;heal&quot; myself. That period in my life effectively pushed me forward into self-acceptance as a gay man who believes his orientation is natural and normal. The group therapy sessions exposed me to the darkest, saddest group of people I'd had ever been around; I really appreciated being badgered by the &quot;counselor&quot; (her only degree was in Computer Science; go figure) who blamed my refusal to accept Jesus Christ as my personal savior (the Heavenly Father) because of my damaged relationship with my earthly father. Er, no, I rejected the sillier aspects of Christianity when I learned to think for myself as a pre-teen. One of the more virulent ex-gays (who was married with children) who attended the group sessions was always present in the locker room of my gym (I never saw him work out).

This is particularly alarming because NARTH is the primary organization trying to use the courts in California to strike down a new law prohibiting reparative therapy for minors.NARTH is not a scientific organization, but a disreputable public relations campaign that twists legitimate research in an effort stigmatize the LGBT community. NARTH members, including Joseph Nicolosi, are ethically challenged and should not be taken seriously by the courts or society.According to Dominic Davies, of the London-based organization Pink Therapy, in the acknowledgments section of Nicolosi's book, \\"Shame and Attachment Loss,\\" the author expresses a \\"deep gratitude for the assistance of Alan Schore, P.h.d,\\" implying a close a personal relationship between the two men (despite spelling Dr Schore's name incorrectly).\\"Throughout the text,\\" said Davies, \\"Nicolosi claims homosexuality as an Attachment Disorder and distorts joseph nicolosi Leading Scientist Slams \`Ex Gay' Therapy Guru For Distorting His Researchand misattributes Schore's work in Attachment Theory in support of his spurious argument.\\"Davies contacted Schore to clarify his relationship with Nicolosi. In their correspondence, the scientist made clear that he was \\"deeply disturbed\\" that he was misquoted by Nicolosi and said that \\"there is absolutely no neuropsychological research evidence that homosexuality is a disorder.\\" He further stated that Nicolosi is \\"grafting my shame and attachment models on to gender identity disorders, something I have never even written about.\\"Despite pretending to be a scientific organization, NARTH does not conduct original research. In the absence of producing data, this disgraceful group quotes obsolete studies and cherry picks the research of real scientists like Schore.This is not the first time NARTH has been accused of manipulating data to mislead the public. University of Utah researcher, Lisa Diamond, was interviewed by Truth Wins Out and claimed in a Youtube video that Nicolosi deliberately distorted her studies on sexual orientation. According to Diamond's video statement:Nicolosi boook Leading Scientist Slams \`Ex Gay' Therapy Guru For Distorting His ResearchDr. Nicolosi, you know exactly what you are doing. This is a willful misuse and distortion of my research. Not an academic disagreement. Not a slight shading of the truth. It's willful distortion.

Dr. Nicolosi's developmentally reparative therapy addresses the latter psychoanalytically classic \\"not gay homosexual man\\" -- who will not be a stable happy camper -- and calmly offers psychoanalytically sound, unconditional shelter from the current misguided right/left political storms and agendas. (Any objective gay man or \\"not gay homosexual man\\" would benefit from an unbiased reading of Dr. Nicolosi's informed and astute psychoanalytic wisdom.)There ain't no easy way out -- take great care to silence both the offensive religious right and foolishly politically correct left in seeking objective truths in any too hot debate cast in black and white, especially this one. Read the few thoughtful, calm and objective reviews here and read the book -- and be privileged to understand (or be anguished by) the profound difference between naturally born gay men and \\"not gay homosexual\\" (and neurotic or personality disordered) men.

This book has added a great deal to the field.Nocolosi's object-relations approach is perhaps the best in print. His description of the etiology and treatment of male homosexuality puts meat on the bones of Moberly's work. Essentially, Nocolosi focuses on the father-son relationship, while giving minor importance to the host of other etiological causes: relationship with the mother and other siblings, male gender-deficit, assertion, and so forth. He examines the research findings on gay sexuality, and examines the Gay Liberation Movement's refusal to acknowledge their pathological elements.Roughly half the book explains and gives examples of the therapy process. Besides his object-relations explanation of homosexuality, his discussion of the specifics of treatment is packed full of insight and practical guidance for both individual and group therapy. And the case studies give a real feel for how to work with homosexuals in your own practice.It always amazes me that such a book would raise a controversy. When psychology and mental health become political and ideological, it clouds the scientific issues. In many ways, however, the DSM has always been mostly political and cultural rather than scientific. Szasz's critiques hit the mark. In a highly politicized issue that tends toward rhetoric rather than sound clinical data, Nicolosi continues to stand firm. He explores the dynamics of homosexuality within object relations theory and therapy, and has helped hundreds of men who no longer want to continue in this lifestyle. I greatly admire him for his work amidst so much name-calling, and even amidst a profession that has rapidly become merely a cultural tool of repression."},{"Title":"Reparative Therapy of Male Homosexuality: A New Clinical Approach","review":"So-called \\"reparative therapy\\" is both ineffective and unethical.

I found this book useful and encouraging because it supports my thoughts that ( I never accepted nor will i accept being Gay).For many years i just battered myself for being gay not because i was the so called \\"Born Gay\\" but as a 10 year old boy who first experienced (sexual contact) by just being touched by a elder boy in school.As the years went on and when it came to making a choice, i discovered that im emotionally attracted to women but sexually attracted to men and that confused me for so long. I have experienced hetrosexuality for a short period and it worked at times and at times it did not.After reading this book and reviewing the stories of different cases and understanding the lifestyles of different gay men i have come to understand that each if not all gay men have a separate way of dealing with their Homosexuality. An example of what i feel is \\"I dont want to be gay but i still do it\\" or \\"Why me and not others\\" and finally \\"I want my stolen manhood back\\"NOTE: My review is very positive because this book supports my goal of changing.I want to change and im not sad about it.I never lost hope of healing homosexuality because i dont fit Homosexuality under (sickness, mental or genetics) Nor do i despise gays.I just out of free will dont want to be (Gay) and its my right to fight it even if the best professor in the world proves that homoesexuality cant be healed.For all those men out there who want to change you must make a choice either to live as a gay man and be happy about it because you have chosen it or do something about it.

This was the case for me and I applied the theories in this book and have gone from being 100% gay to 100% heterosexual. It has taken three years, but it is done. I also became much more healthy psychologically. This book does not address adequately child sexual abuse which can be a doorway into homosexuality for some. If you have experienced childhood sexual abuse I recommend DNMS therapy - Developmental Needs Meeting Strategy. This form of therapy changes the brain patterns caused by an abusive environment into the brain patterns of someone who grew up in a loving environment. Positive feelings, thoughts, and behaviors then follow. As for the present medical opinions of the APA and the AMA, they are not God and therefore are not infallible, although they are politically correct. They are making a big mistake in not endorsing reparative therapy for those who fit the pattern of broken relationship with same sex parent, siblings, or peers. When I went through reparative therapy it was not stressful. It filled me with hope. It must be realized that reparative therapy does not challenge my values, but supports them. I suggest that if you do not value the thought of being heterosexual that you don't waste your time trying to change.

It is costly and a few people have mixed feelings. I wondered if the book could really help me. I was also afraid that the book would contain a lot of religious jargon with little or no helpful insights. This book is not religious. If you are looking for that, there are many others out there.I had doubts about whether or not i could change. It was hard imagining an aspect that has always been apart of me melting away. But it can happen. If a person is determined to live the homosexual lifestyle and doesn't want to change then this book will be like reading a book on quiting smoking, dieting, etc if you don't really want to do it or have the motivation. It takes time, meditation or pondering, you have to get to know yourself very well. If you don't plan on putting anything into practice or trying any of it or getting help for your same-sex attraction, you will not make progress. Some people are also afraid to confront themselves, to ask themselves questions, to look back at the past, but if you are truly willing and opened minded then you can see results.For me, it was not hard. I actually enjoyed finally meeting my unmet needs. For some it takes years. Because of this some may not be as willing to continue and give up. It will depend upon you, your determination and amount of dedication. I saw results within 6 months, then a year, and now i feel almost home free. I've slowed down because i'm very satisfied with my progress, but i am still making progress just slowly. It is so great to know that there is so much help out there for us. There are retreats, phone therapy, books like this one, websites, etc. As long as you have some type of supportive network you can manage to do this without all that. But developing meaningful relationship with others is a must!My life is excellent. I've never been happier! It is amazing to me to ACTUALLY SEE FOR MYSELF, JUST TO KNOW that Homosexuals CAN INDEED CHANGE. It is one thing to be told. It is quite another to experience it YOURSELF!!!Guys, just as the other people have to right to live their lifestyle, this book should not be shot down simply because of their own choices. Believe us! WE EXIST! Change is possible and there is an ever growing number of us! Just because millions don't stop smoking does not prove that NO ONE CAN STOP! There are many different factors as to why people don't stop. I can't tell you why some people can't change other then lack of motivation, SELF CONTROL, willingness to give it an honest try, or really having honest difficulties and no support. I can tell you that i have and this is one of the books that helped me. Another is Battle for Normality. This book does not get into issues such as should gays have the right to vote, marry or anything else. It should not be shot down as evil as some have done. We exist and we have a right to exist as much as any outright gay person.Don't let the bad reviews scare you. It is encouraging to me to see others posting here that are saying the exact same thing. It reminds me. I am not alone. Many of us are indeed changing and it is only a matter of time before Reparative Therapy gets the recognition it deserves at least at being partially help if only for a few.What about the APA and other associations. They do a great job at what they do. But they are limited. Many are not homosexuals themselves and even if they are, they have likely never changed or even attempted to try. How can they judge us who have changed! Propaganda is the real reason people don't think change is possible we are bombarded with it.Is reparative therapy dangerous? HECK NO! Can you die from reading a book? Can you die from a hug, bonding and being accepted by men? Then, you should be ok.Guys, give it a try, if it doesn't work for you, you can sell your book back and move on. If you want to change but feel you aren't seeing the results you like, there is much help out there.

Not only is 'Reparative Therapy' clear and simple, but it provides hope and practical solutions for those who have chosen not to pursue a same-sex life style. Nicolosi has brought light into questions and root issues regarding same-sex attraction that I have suspected for many years but did not have the understanding, nor the articulation to process (e.g. failure of the father/son relationship, childhood traumas/problems, developmental issues). I would highly recommend Nicolosi's work for anyone who has chosen NOT to pursue their same-sex attractions, as well for those who are STILL NOT SURE and honestly desire to see a hopeful perspective."},{"Title":"Reparative Therapy of Male Homosexuality: A New Clinical Approach","review":"Dr. Nicolosi powerfully conveys his message of hope with clinical research and psychoanalysis that those who do not want to be homosexual can change. More importantly, Nicolosi has created a book which clearly explains the causes of homosexuality and is the most comprehensive on the subject. If you are looking for a book free from unnecessary political views and religious prejudice, this is the book for you to read.I had started to highlight and pick out parts from the book which I felt to be profound and especially enlightening to share with friends and family, however, these passages became so numerous that I simply gave up and decided to just recommend the book as a whole.By far this is the most helpful book I have read on homosexuality, and I simply cannot recommend this book highly enough. Nicolosi explores homosexuality non-judgmentally and with a thoughtful, and thorough approach. He writes with coherence and practicality, offering hope to those homosexuals who wish to change, and is slowly educating the world one reader at a time.This is a great book even for those still living the gay lifestyle, and who do not want to change. It offers a new and refreshing approach as to why homosexuality exists, and how the emotional hurt can be healed. I personally used to be living the gay lifestyle, and became sadly disillusioned after a short while.This book has single-handedly helped me the most in comming to grips with the real me, facing the burried pain, and starting the healing process.Read the book!"},{"Title":"Reparative Therapy of Male Homosexuality: A New Clinical Approach","review":"As a student of psychology and a former homosexual I was pleased to read and study this book, while like thousands of others I questioned the book,. It has not anything to do with religion it is totaly a scientofic study of homosexuality. It is a great book and should be a must rread on all colleges."},{"Title":"Reparative Therapy of Male Homosexuality: A New Clinical Approach","review":"More bad and disproved science which can lead to increased levels of anxiety, depression and suicide ideation.This guy is so fascinated with homosexuality. What is this guy afraid of in himself which he is trying to work out through this kind of dangerous writing?"},{"Title":"Reparative Therapy of Male Homosexuality: A New Clinical Approach","review":"Dr. Nicolosi is a good man, and Dr. Nicolosi is doing a good thing. What he says frightens a lot of people, and he frightens a lot of people becasue they know he's right.I'm currently in reparative therapy. I'm coming out of homosexuality. I've had a terrible past, mostly with my father and with other boys. This is a major cause of homosexuality: the inability to bond with father and other boys. If we haven't bonded properly with father and other boys, our desire to bond and identify with men will one day become sexualized. This sexualization points to a deeper need, namely, a desire to be intimate with fathers and same sex peers. Sadly, many mistakenly think that the desire for same-sex intimacy can be gratified by having sex with men. But this just isn't possible.However, when I bond with mentors and straight friends, the things I never received from father or peers--acceptance, affection, and affirmation--are given to me. I feel good. I feel confident. I feel strong. I feel like a man. And if I feel like a man, I'll naturally be attracted to what is opposite: woman.Consequently, same-sex desires are diminished. I have no desire for men because I'm receiving love from them in a healthy, non-sexual way. This is a very healing thing. Things are only going to get better, too. Homosexuality is not genetic; it's developmental.Reparative therapy takes time. It takes strength. It takes work. Lots of work. Homosexuality takes a long time to develop and it can take a while to diminish. However, rediscovering my true self--the latent heterosexual underneath the lies, fears, and misperceptions--is the most exciting thing in the world. I commend you, Dr. Nicolosi, and one day I'll meet you and give you the great big hug you deserve.If you struggle with homosexuality, you need to read this book. You're safe with Dr. Joe. Dr. Joe knows what he's talking about. The negative reviews you see on this page are evidence of that. Read this book and...read this book."},{"Title":"Reparative Therapy of Male Homosexuality: A New Clinical Approach","review":"Thank God that this book has been intstrumental in repairing the wrong-minded homosexual. My hope is that the same material can be geared toward the Black (\\"African American\\") Community. It's so clinically relevant considering the nature of your work that it can be used to help African Americans suffering from their struggle in their culture. It seems that and exact parallel can be drawn with regard to being black as it is to being gay. You can't choose the color of your skin (orientation) but you CAN choose not to become immersed in a culture that clearly doesn't subscribe to the same ethics and morals as the overall American Culture. This would be so helpful for many people of color who struggle because of the oppression they feel."},{"Title":"Reparative Therapy of Male Homosexuality: A New Clinical Approach","review":"Reparative Therapy is not accepted by any therapist association anywhere. It has been thoroughly debunked. There is no scientific evidence to support it. What there is wide evidence on is the high suicide rate amongst LGBT teens who are subjected to being treated as they are not normal and need to change something that is impossible to change. This book is not clinical and actually dangerous."}]`),H={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:E,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},C=["disabled"],B={key:0},q={key:1};function W(n,e,s,c,r,i){const m=y("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",M,[(t(!0),a(g,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),p(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",q,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",B,"See more"))],8,C)):b("",!0)])}const G=u(H,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-b9f8b52d"]]),N=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/65.md","filePath":"glossary/65.md"}'),j={name:"glossary/65.md"},D=Object.assign(j,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(G)]))}});export{N as __pageData,D as default};
