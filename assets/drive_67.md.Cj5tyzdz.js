I wanted a copy of the book which is no longer in print.I knew Amazon would be the only place to obtain it. It's a memoir about the world in which the author grew up in the northern part of Central New York State. this area is presently one of the busiest,most crowded suburbs in our area, and her reminiscences bring me back to the way it was when I was a girl.The book was in excellent condition and the price cannot be beaten!"},{"Title":"A Vanished World","review":"This memoir was well written and interesting. Sneller writes mostly about her family, including stories about her aunts and uncles' childhoods, which must have been heard while she was growing up. She also gives us a glimpse of what life around the turn of the century was like in central New York, north of Syracuse. Some of the information, about language, food, and clothing in particular, was fascinating. Sneller is quite frank and does not try to hide the ugliness that existed in the late 1800's, broaching such ugly topics as drunkeness, consumption, and incest. This was a quick, enjoyable read."},{"Title":"A Vanished World","review":"I liked the stories about the various family members and their tasks of daily living in their times.

The layout is greatly improved' and the proof-reading is a whole lot better. Unfortunately, however, the writing is as bad as ever, and is slightly less &quot;spirited&quot; than a dead fish.The basic problem seems to be that this author confuses &quot;quantity&quot; with &quot;quality&quot;. His output is indeed prodigious, but the books all tend to read like catalogues - all the facts, presented in a totally deadpan manner.In practice there are now far too many NLP books available, of far higher quality, to leave much room for such poor writing.For a good, all-round introduction to NLP, O'Connor and Seymour's &quot;Introducing NLP&quot; leaves this standing on the starting line.Incidentally, the book categorically DOES NOT contain &quot;significant contributions from other master trainers&quot;, not unless you imagine that quoting someone means that they've made a &quot;significant contribution&quot; to your book.In reality, for better oe worse, the writing is pure wall-to-wall Michael Hall.If you've enjoyed any of Michael's other books then you may enjoy this one as well. If you didn't, it's VERY unlikely that you'll like this one either."},{"Title":"The Spirit of NLP ( Neuro-linguistic Programming )","review":"This book is an excellent primer for those with some NLP knowledge and training. It is for those pursuing master level training, and is presented at the master practitioner level. This work apparently began as L.

Excellent information for those wishing to master NLP in their lives."},{"Title":"The Spirit of NLP ( Neuro-linguistic Programming )","review":"Having said that, I still think that this is somewhat of an important book, it was the first NLP book I saw which openly commented on how Richard Bandler uses tone and Rythm to build propulsion into his presentation.

Having said all this, obviously this is not a beginners book on NLP, so if you're not prepared to wade through terminology than you will be very frustrated by this book."},{"Title":"The Spirit of NLP ( Neuro-linguistic Programming )","review":"This book is aptly named! It does, indeed, cover the Spirit of NLP. A book recommended for people who have completed their Practitioner's course, or equivalent. Michael Hall's style is emerging as one of the best, particularly as a &quot;late&quot; entrant into the scene. He has a total perspective and broad vision, which is conveyed. It is also evident that he is a thinker, and is concerned with putting his ideas across in such a way that he could predict the response! A lot of information here, which also gives us the insight and invitation to understanding. Easy to read, well thought out and laid out. An author to search for - and follow."},{"Title":"Half-Damned: Dhampyr","review":"The Kindred of the East companion roughly outlined Dhampyr for us and this book gives you all the details. They are the living children of Kuei jin(The asian vampires detailed in Kindred of the East, a sub-setting of Vampire: The Masquerade). They differ considerably from the same pronunciation different spelling Dhampir of the main Vampire: The Masquerade line, and probably should have been named something different, they don't get called Dhampyr in my game because I think using an old world European word for an old world Asian phenomenon is silly but others opinions may vary. Being the pretty rare children of animated blood sucking corpses and humans(usually the mother), they have a lot of advantages(outrageous luck, access to very low levels of the powers possessed by their inhuman parents, and a lifetime about four times that of a normal human), these of course come with some downsides(They have a wide mean/violent streak and are more prone to antisocial behavior, their luck sometimes helps them at the expense of others, they may become addicted to canabilism as a means of \\"cheaply\\" fueling their supernatural abilities, and they watch everyone else grow old and die well before they do.) The greatest problem, and the one that makes so viable for roleplaying, is that their undead parents view them as resources to be exploited at best, tools to be used and discarded at worst. They have almost no chance of living out a \\"normal\\" life because even if their bizzare luck didn't get them involved in dire situations, they would still find themselves mired in the politics of the undead. Not a book that is extremely important, it is still an entertaining and well written source of information on Half-Damned and made me want to play one or include them in my game. Four stars, 5 for being that good, minus one for just not being all that important."},{"Title":"Half-Damned: Dhampyr","review":"The Kindred of the East line, unlike most of White Wolf's recent work, is still putting out a good percentage of interesting and useful supplements. Dhampyr is the next of those, detailing the mortal sons and daughters of the Kuei-jin. The book is a pretty nice combination of cultural information, spiffy powers, and the requisite Secret History.I was happy that the authors avoided making this just a sort of Ghouls of the East. Instead of having only bits of Disciplines scrounged from their betters, the dhampyr have a powerful little tool of their own--joss, the incredible luck that surrounds them. Not that they're going to be winning one-on-one fights with the Cathayans, but it gives them a different flavor than the wholly pathetic Western blood-slaves.The cultural stuff is nothing too surprising, but I didn't notice any big holes in it, either. Half-Damned also gives some history that the ancestors don't want leaked out, and of course character creation rules. The book is nothing to shake my view of the game, but it's a good supplement for an important subset of Kuei-jin society."},{"Title":"Half-Damned: Dhampyr","review":"Okay, as I saw in another review, this is NOT for Vampire: the Masquerade. It's for Kindred of the East, a supplement for Vampire, but don't misunderstand, the Kuei-jin (what the Oriental &quot;vampires&quot; call themselves) aren't Cainites, they are a whole 'nother type of Immortals. And as a consqeuence their children (this isn't a new thing for them, like it is for the Cainites) are in a realm all their own. While they could be used to power-play, it also open a whole new realm of options for players. Half-Damned?

I got it today and well I'm sending it back because it isn't for Vampire the Masquerade at all. It is for Kindred of the East. Apparently, Kindred of the East (which is a seperate game made by the same company) can have offspring with a mortal and are also called Dhampirs and well these are the Dhampirs that this book is about. I searched the book high and low to find something that purtains to V:tM and I didn't find a thing. It says it is a sourcebook for V:tM and KotE but it is for KotE all the way.

However, while he might have sacrificed a lot in his efforts, the results are not convincing. The Phaestos disk has been the subject of many decipherment attempts. The Phaestos disk homepage alone lists 39 such endeavours. Fischer's methods are more scientific than most of the others, but ultimately not much more persuasive. The glaring flaw in his method is that he does not have enough checks to eliminate bad assumptions. With a text as short as the Phaestos Disk, if you make enough assumptions you can get a legible text in whatever language you want. That is exactly what is presented in Glyphbreaker. Fischer has studied the Easter Island script extensively, and thus brings a wealth of knowledge to his discussion of that script. However, his proposal is certainly not a true decipherment and the jury remains out on its validity."},{"Title":"Glyphbreaker","review":"Fischer's claim that he has deciphered two scripts makes for an interesting story. The man has certainly suffered personal trials and professional disappointments which would discourage most - as he himself repeatedly lets the reader know. I cannot judge his claim concerning the Easter Island script, but his supposed decipherment of the Phaistos Disk, though it starts out with promise, finishes with unsupportable and highly speculative leaps of linguistic logic. The fact that he can only bring forth a non-specialist National Geographic editor as a supporter should make anyone wary of accepting his conclusions. His repeated comparisons of himself with Michael Ventris, the amateur who deciphered Linear B, are painfully self-serving. His story of having his decipherment rejected by John Chadwick because Chadwick wasn't open to Fischer's ground-breaking results due to old-school conservatism is a telling passage. I think Chadwick, who championed Ventris against the scholarly establishment, rejected Fischer's ideas for the simple reason that they are unconvincing."},{"Title":"Glyphbreaker","review":"Writing about breaking the Japanese NL military code before World War II, Rear Admiral Edwin T. Layton said &quot;...only two hundred intercepts (messages) were ever made, a totally inadequate number for the penetration of any cipher system.&quot;I recalled this as I read &quot;Glyph Breaker&quot; by Steven Roger Fischer. Fischer, using but a single example (intercept) of a Minoan clay disk containing a mere 241 pictorial symbols, managed to decipher the script as an ancient call to arms. Glyph Breaker is Fischer's story of how he deciphered this and also the enigmatic Rapanui script of Easter Island, Rongorongo.To decipher the Phiastos Disk, Fischer had to overcome a terrible problem. He knew in advance neither what the various characters on the disk represented, nor what was the underlying language. In contrast, military code breakers generally know the underlying language, even if encryption makes it unreadable. A comparable example is using Navajo as a code during WWII, a language the Japanese neither understood, identified or ever deciphered. Thus, encryption of an unknown language makes a devilish problem.How Fischer set about deciphering the disk makes not only an interesting story in itself, but is a superb example of science in practice. He began with an internal analysis of the symbols and their order; that is, with the information content of the message. In this endeavor Fischer was lucky to have a long and complete text sequence. The 241 characters of the Phiastos Disk may not seem long, but it is longer than any comparable text in the collection of 57,000 Linear B (Mycenean) glyphs. Virtually the lot of these consisted of accounting for stores of goods, and took Michael Ventris five years to decipher. The sample texts of the as yet undeciphered Minoan Linear A script are even shorter. The entire 7,000 glyph collection of which consists of short accounting marks, dedications, and manufacturer's marks. Deciphering Linear A is like trying to reconstruct English from credit card r! eceipts and coffee cups.Once the internal analysis yielded what it could, Fischer then placed the message in a context. This means simply a guess at the point of origin of the Phiastos Disk, but this was not easy to do. For decades scholars had argued that the disk was not a Minoan work, despite being found in a Minoan Palace. Some even speculated that the Minoans themselves were not Indo-European. Fischer guessed that the disk was indeed Minoan. Whatever language they may have spoken, Minoans would certainly reflect influences of their neighbors by making reference to local places and tribes.Recognizing tribal and place names gave Fischer not only the essential clues for breaking the code, but also provided tests of the decipherment. This general decipher method works because the evolution and succession of languages leaves proper names recognizable. To a linguist familiar with the underlying language of a text, proper names stand out as glaring anomalies. Layton, for example, in breaking the Japanese Weh Weh code found &quot;P&quot; sounds appearing in un-Japanese positions in encrypted words that proved to be Palau and Ponape. In the case of the Rosetta Stone, the most famous of decipherments, the English physicist and physician Thomas (Phenomenon) Young surmised that oval enclosed sections of text were the proper names of Ptolemy and Cleopatra. Champollion used this as his point of departure.Fischer is a linguist, a discipline absolutely essential for the decipherment of ancient texts or military codes. Indeed, Champollion brought to the decipherment of the Rosetta Stone a natural gift for languages. By age 16 he had mastered 6 ancient oriental languages as well as Latin and Greek. Likewise Fischer is a language connoisseur. He learned Japanese while living in Okinawa at age 11. Soon thereafter he discovered French then Russian then German and so forth. He used comparisons among some 20 languages alone to decipher the disk.Thus, clues for decipherment come from both history and linguistic! s. Sometimes, however, the key to decipherment comes not from these typical sources, and thus lies unnoticed for generations. Rongorongo script, for instance, was sung for American ethnographers by a Rapanui steward on a stormy night in 1886. The steward fabricated some of his readings but in one instance he recreated the true structure of Rongorongo inscription. This key to later decipherment lay unrecognized for 100 years, even though later Rapanui identified this particular chant as authentic.Fischer's insight was to recognize the structure of the authentic chant in one Rongorongo script called the Santiago Staff. Without this insight the decipherment of Rongorongo might not have happened; for Rongorongo has no related scripts, it is the only indigenous form of Polynesian writing; and the underlying language, Rapanui, is no longer spoken. None of the strategy that Fischer used to decipher the Phiastos Disk would work here. Adding to this difficulty was the encyclopedia of speculation and nonsense that grew up around Rongorongo.Fischer also had a bit of serendipity. Among all the world's surviving examples of Rongorongo, only one, the Santiago Staff, uses the vertical dividers in the text which helped Fischer recognize the chant. Like Pasteur, Fischer sees that chance favors the prepared mind. He had thoroughly immersed himself in Polynesian culture and mindset for seven years. Indeed, he already spoke numerous Polynesian languages and had compiled a Polynesian dictionary.Someone once described code breaking as requiring medieval patience, and I almost expected a story about decipherment to require the same to read. Fortunately Fischer is a good, albeit scholarly, writer. In Glyph Breaker he shares personal disappointments, financial hardships, and exhilarating achievements, over the fifteen years that these two decipherments required. He weaves historical detail and anecdotes into his story at appropriate places, and never dwells too long on the arcane details of breaking the codes. He offers ! humor and even plays on words to add interest. The book keeps pace to maintain a readers interest."},{"Title":"Glyphbreaker","review":"An exellent document as it decodes the Phaistos Disk. This is one of three of the latests interpretations.

It is exciting to read Fischer's claims, well knowing that he may be completely wrong. Just like when you read a detective novel, the reader can repeatedly ask himself: &quot;does that argument hold?&quot;, &quot;what if it's like this instead?&quot; or &quot;why didn't anyone think about that before?&quot; No one can deny that Fischer spent a lot of energy and thought on the effort to decypher the Faistos disk, and following his thoughts is as intriguing as reading Agatha Christie. Between Fischer's sometimes questionable conclusion there are plenty of interesting facts about history, culture and language of the Antiqity. His style is easy to follow and captivating, regardless of if his result is the final truth (which he thinks himself) or just imagination (which I tend to hold).If this book had been published as fiction, I would have given it five stars."},{"Title":"Glyphbreaker","review":"There is no question that the author is a genius; what else might one reasonably call a person who has broken two previously undeciphered scripts, in unknown languages?This book is a very popularized account of what was done.

In the mid-30s, Auden and MacNeice undertook a tour of Iceland. Auden and MacNeice were then apparently supporting themselves partly by journalism and writing, and apparently had a contract for a travel book. Auden had an interest in Scandinavian mythology and the saga literature dating back to his childhood. The result is a unusual and rather entertaining book. To a large extent, this book is a pastiche. Much of the book is ostensible letters to friends in Britain describing the trip. Many of the letters are in the form of verse and several of Auden's letters are addressed to Lord Byron using a verse form of which Byron was fond. The poetry is a combination of description of the trip, witty commentary on current events, and some more serious reflections. The technical quality of the poetry is often impressive. Other parts of the book are equally unusual. In a set of prose letters written by MacNeice, he adopts the character of a single woman traveling with a group of English schoolgirls. Another section is a set of selections from prior travel books on Iceland. The real focus of the book is not Iceland but the authors' preoccupations. Much of the poetry is very enjoyable and some of it is excellent.Despite the virtues of this book, it is somewhat dated. A fair amount of the book will be hard to understand without a fairly detailed knowledge of interwar Britain. To make it more readily comprehensible to most readers would require a fair amount of annotation, something no publisher would be willing to pay for at this time. This book is probably of most interest to individuals (like me) very fond of and curious about Auden and his milieu."},{"Title":"LETTERS FROM ICELAND","review":"Letters from Iceland (Armchair Traveller Series)is first and foremost a travel book, but it also covers history as it was first written in 1936, literature and humor.In 1936 poets W.H.

This is an interesting snapshot of the two poets and their journey to Iceland after World War I and before World War II. Sometimes lighthearted and filled with joy and love for the country, other times a bit snarky and mirroring a subtle disappointment in the journey.Having been to Iceland I enjoyed their tales of the food, the people and the traditions.

While teachers across the nation are guilty of doling out computer homework, Stoll makes the point that computers in the education system are overrated. He explains the high cost that students and schools alike are paying to have computers in the classroom. In short, whether you worship your pc or curse it, this book will make you reconsider your stance on computers."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"Clifford Stoll has address an issue that everyone should think about in his book \\"High Tech Heretic\\". Computers weren't even a part of the classroom forty years ago. I think that educational computing can be a great thing, but often misused.Stoll has a strong opinion against technological advances in the classroom. He thinks that computing in education are just wrong. Schools across the country today couldn't function without computers. My high school's attendance was managed by computers, and just about every day, the system would crash. The old fashioned way may have been slower, but it caused fewer problems.Computers are a great tool for education, but it SHOULD NOT replace the educators. Personal interaction with students help make good teachers. Computers are the primary source of our \\"Information Age\\", but too much investment and resources have gone into them. Stoll had very good points. I agree with him. I do believe that computers can have a negative effect on education. I would also agree with Stoll that we should go back to the time era of the first introductions of televison and telephones, but in this day and age, people go crazy from being away from computers for just one day!I believe that writing papers on Mircrosoft Word is much more efficient than handwriting or typing on a typewriter, but I think that simple teaching methods should stay withing the educational boundies of society. There are many things wrong with websites (like biased opinions being represented as facts) that are brainwashing children. The old fashioned ways are the best."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"High-Tech Heretic is based on the question the runs through everyone's head; should computers be in the classroom? There are some circumstances that computers should be used in the classrooms. Like typing a paper on Microsoft or graphing statistics on Microsoft excel, but not for math. We use computers in math for test and quizzes and many people do not like it. Some people can not learn their mistakes from a computer. They have to learn step by step and see it in front of them. Many people also can not afford computers and basing their assignments on computers is harder for the students who do not own one. This book is a good book to read and have a debate on whether classrooms should have computers or not and the point is many people have different views on it, but most likely there will be computers in the classroom."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"In High Tech Heretic, Clifford Stoll has the view that the computer and the advances of technology will have a negative impact on teaching and education. In schools across the country, most of all classrooms have computers any where that the students go. A lot of the focus goes into whether or not spending federal aid money should go on fixing computers or to classroom essentials. In this book Clifford Stoll questions the relentless \\"computer literacy\\" by teachers and the computer industry. In this book he wants you to take a detailed look at how the technology world can be better used for the society. Despite the numerous concerns about each of these growing so fast each year, children need to be educated about the advances the world has come to. If we all did what Clifford Stoll suggests in High-Tech Heretic that we should go back and remember when the computer and other technology wasn't here then a lot of us couldn't function right. The advances of technology and computers have become a part of every aspect of our live. In Stoll's book he explains that in great detail of why computers and advancement in technology serves a purpose in the world today."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"Stoll's view that technology and the computer has a negative impact on education could be considered radical. Today most schools around the country have computers, either a computer lab or compouters in a library or even inside the classroom. However, most people would agree with the statement that the money spent on fixing computers should go towards classroom materials. Also some parents would agree that the computers could potentially take away from the instructional time by programming the software or explaining how to use the software. Despite those concerns computers and technology are rapidlly growing every year. Children have to be aware of computers and the new technology if they wish to be sucessful in the future. If society did what Stoll suggests, that people should go back to the time when telephone and TV were first invented, then more then likely people would not know what to do. Technology has become a part of everyday living for most."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"It is useful to think that the book wasn't written by someone who is dependent of the computer while they are taking all things technological while hoping that we return to the past when the television and telephone was invented. Stoll not only know the computer and how it works and functions, but he loves and uses it himself. He offers us a chance to think of were computers play apart in our lives. Being a student I have realized that I have taken advantage of the benefits that technology has with helping me in schools. His thoughts may help those who want to choose more judiciously when and how to use computers in their meantime, but the readers will have to be patient and keep reading ahead. Stoll takes what could have been expressed in a couple of chapters to a whole new level. The reader may come to the conclusion that Stoll's well thought-out and witty approach help decide that he has such one-sided to have such an argument. So next time you decide to get in front of the keyboard give Stoll a chance to allow his insights help you pause before you head to the computer next time."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"Rarely has a sacred cow been bludgeoned as gleefully as Clifford Stoll hammers educational computing in his smart and funny 1999 book High Tech Heretic. With equal parts unbridled passion and wry wit, Stoll challenges the conventional wisdom that the creation of high tech classrooms \\"wired for the 21st century\\" is an inherently good idea.Perhaps surprisingly, Stoll is not some anti-technology hippie who spends his time hugging trees, reading Thoreau, and sending menacing letters to corporations from his crude Montana cabin. On the contrary, Stoll's arguments are given increased credibility when we discover that he is a self-confessed computer nerd who has worked for decades in the computer industry.Many of Stoll's arguments will find a welcoming audience even among pro-computer educators. For example, the most powerful chapter in the book is an indictment of the school-as-entertainment model entitled \\"Makes Learning Fun.\\" \\"Most learning isn't fun\\" Stoll argues. \\"Learning takes work. Discipline. Commitment, from both teacher and student . . . Turning learning into fun denigrates the most important things we can do in life: to learn and to teach.\\" Yeah, Clifford! You go, boy!Stoll waxes equally eloquently on the annihilation of basic math skills encouraged by the use of calculators, the myth advocated by fans of the Internet that \\"information is power,\\" and the diversion of library dollars from books to glitzy high tech gadgets that are often obsolete before they are torn out of the box. Stoll's stridency (and he is strident) is leavened by his sense of humor. Not only does he describe how he converted his old Macintosh computer into an aquarium, he even throws in his recipe for banana bread for good measure.Undoubtedly, Stoll's arguments are a bit overdone. He has not only pointed out that the emperor has no clothes. He has taunted him, smacked his bottom, photographed him, and downloaded his naked pictures to the Internet. The truth is that, used judiciously, computers do have a place in the classroom. The fact that an election map for every presidential election in U.S. history is only a keystroke away can't be a bad thing. Despite Stoll's argument to the contrary, a sense of balance is exactly what is needed. But then, if Stoll was not so zealous, High Tech Heretic wouldn't be nearly so much fun."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"I was grateful to see some hesitation toward using a computer in the classroom. In my math class I include technology but run into some of the problems the author discusses. One such problem is technical difficulties which can eat up class time. Another problem, I have tried many software packages only to discover that graphics are emphasized instead of content. I agree that if we let it the internet can eat up our lives. Maybe the author is a little drastic and I do not agree to the same degree but he makes some good points. We should be aware of the pitfalls of computers. They are great tools but are not the end all, be all. We need to spend time with other human beings and not look to the internet for relationships. Some parts of the book seem to ramble and was distracting. Some points were repeated and that was distracting. Keeping this in mind, I would recommend reading High-Tech Heretic."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"In this book, Stoll presents his views on the negative impact of the emphasis on computers and technology in education. He cites examples like a lack of money for classroom supplies even though a great deal of money is spent on the purchase and maintenance of computers. Also, that instructional time is often spent setting up and learning software.His view is that in many ways technology hinders student learning yet we see an increase in that area and a decrease in the area of social activities and books. This view gives the reader a different angle to consider in a time when technology and training is so strongly stressed in education.I agree that students need strong academic content and trained caring teachers but they also need technology skills in order to be successful."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"Don't let the easy read of Clifford Stoll's book, High Tech Heretic, lull you into believing that the driving force of technology is the root of all our educational and societal ills. In his book, Stoll points a pessimistic finger at the negative use of computers by looking at several issues. For example, what do bowling leagues, Sunday church services, and the boring gray color of computer systems have in common? All were weak issues used by Stoll in convincing us of the technology monster. Now, if you have a hard time visualizing a relationship, don't worry. I had a hard time understanding the relationship and I read the book.Now, it is not fair to say that his book didn't raise a few doubts in my mind. A few doubts arose when discussing how much money should be spent or teaching positions lost in order to financially accommodate computers when in five years the computer's technology will be obsolete? What factors should play a key role in deciding computer learning versus personal experience or application?Lastly, here's one tip for the reader. While reading keep an open mind and realize what this book really is- one man's pessimistic view of technology."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"High-Tech Heretic takes a very witty look at computers in the classroom. Clifford Stoll has a refreshing opinion about this topic, and I found it rather entertaining. His sarcastic comments on every aspect of computers made this book very easy to read. I related greatly to his chapter on \\"Education by E-mail\\". I too have been the victim of online courses. There are some things that just shouldn't be taught online, or even through video tutorials. I find it ridiculous that we are paying to have classes online, are we not worth paying a professor to teach us? There are some things that we just shouldn't do online and classes are one of them. Stoll says \\"The result is a digital diploma mill, where students pay tuition to watch instructional television\\" (Stoll, 101). In my opinion you can't replace a teacher with a computer that is defiantly not a fair swap. How can you replace human interaction? I would like to see a computer duplicate that. Many students need hands on activities in order to grasp the subject matter, and computers don't offer that either. Some things are just better off left alone, and in my opinion teachers should never be replaced. Sure computers help aide the teacher in her lesson, but to replace a teacher completely is absurd. I found this book to be very enlightening, and definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"\\"High-Tech Heretic, Reflections of a Computer Contrarian,\\" a clever and wittily written book, is an easy read. This book discusses the debate over how much educational use computers really have in schools today and the concern of parents and teachers as to whether computers are really needed in the education system. Most people can relate their own opinions to the arguments made in the book because in the United States, almost all Americans have used computers at one point or another. Clifford Stoll, the author, has developed his career around computers and has obviously done his research on the topics. His arguments at some points seem like commonsense but they are in fact good arguments. One of Stoll's arguments is that the computer is replacing the use of books in the school system. He says that computers do not have the ability to teach students the same information they can receive from a book, or even a good teacher. Though, Stoll greatly enjoys computers and believes they have a variety of uses in the technological world today, he argues against using school budgets to supply schools with expensive computer systems, because they aren't necessary to teach at grade school, middle school, high school, and sometimes even college level. Stoll examines the benefits that people can actually get from using computers in an educational setting, in contrast to what students can get from books and other traditional learning materials. This book has great factual information, but is also humorous and interesting to the everyday reader."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"In Stoll's book \\"High Tech Heretic,\\" we are given the opposition that computers are somewhat of a hassle to have in the classroom. He goes off into rampages to how the use of computers has had more negative than positive outcomes. His number one argument is that no matter how good a computer is, it will not teach better than a teacher. And I'll tell you what, I could not agree with him more!Stoll loves computers, actually he knows more about them than a lot of people. He does not disagree with them for pleasurable use, only in the classroom. He argues the fact that so much money is being spent on electronics, when teachers are more effective. No computer can take over the knowledge, experience, and the student-teacher relationship. I find that it is ridiculous that people are spending so much money, firing teachers, and are in such awe about using the computer in class rooms. The main focus of learning will turn to fun, rather than education. On the flip side, I feel that Stoll could have gotten his point across in such a better manner. It seems to me that his book is a lot of complaining, rather than informative. It seems to me that he has put down all of his anger towards this issue and doesn't offer any records of what he is arguing. His argument would be much more effective if he did this. Also, he could expand on his counter argument, that computers are effective in the classroom to make better points. Overall, I feel that this book gave good logical points. I would recommend it to any teacher who feels that the computer is an important aspect to the classroom. This thought that computers are such an important asset to the classroom needs to be stopped before any more electronically advancements are produced."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"The book, \\"High-Tech Heretic,\\" by Clifford Stoll is one that is very skeptical on whether or not computers are worth are the trouble that we as people sometimes go through to use them. Stoll is one who loves computers, but he finds that there can be complications with them. He brings up many good points on whether or not computers are helpful for children in the classroom. He points out that while the computers may be useful in our daily lives, they also can be a hassle. Stoll is skeptical about whether or not computers truley have good \\"computer literacy.\\"Stoll provides many examples throughout his book. You can tell that he knows what he is talking about when he discusses these issues dealing with the society that people live in today with computers. He is an excellent author that provides many interesting points in this well written book."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"High-Tech Heretic seemed to overanalyze the use of computers in the classroom. Stoll mentions on several accounts that a good classroom needs no computers, and that a good teacher should be able to hold their lesson without that aid. In today's high-tech society, it's almost unavoidable. Its criticism and controversy will certainly hold attention and spark opinion in readers. It is both entertaining and informative. And no matter where you stand on the issue, Stoll's High-Tech Heretic is certainly a good read."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"Julie's High Tech Heretic ReviewHigh-Tech Heretic is a book written by Clifford Stoll that discuss' his on going reluctance towards putting computers in the classroom. In order to purchase computers to put in the classroom, school systems are being forced to cut teachers and district supplies. Not only must the computers be bought but school systems also have to hire extra employees just to keep up maintenance for all of this new technology. As an education major, I share the same fear that Stoll does. Being a teacher is being in it for the smile on a child's face when they realize that they just got the correct answer on a complicated question and this is the very thing that computers in the classrooms remove.Technology could never take the place of a nurturing teacher, there are to many factors that come along with computers that are nothing but a hindrance to the learning process, for example pop-ups, distracting graphics, and the copy and paste method. Simply because a student pastes a graphic or some type of material into an assignment does not prove that they have learned or understood the material. This is one of the many arguments that Stoll presents while bashing the movement of technology into the classroom.I agree with the analysis given by Clifford Stoll in this book, to some extent. I think that some technology in the classroom can be beneficial, however when using computers and other technologies of this sort becomes an everyday dependency and begins taking the place of educators, I do believe that is when we will have reasons to be concerned. I would definitely recommend this book, it is very informative and Stoll does a wonderful job of supporting his opinion. I believe that this book deserves four stars!"},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"Clifford Stoll, author of the book High-Tech Heretic, states in the beginning of his book: \\"I'm saddened by a blind faith that technology will deliver a cornucopia of futuristic goodies without extracting payment in kind.\\" The entirety of the book is spent backing up his beginning statement. His defense is well argued and he uses precise evidence to support his claims.Several of the examples in the book came from actual schools and what they were doing when it came to technology and computers. These schools were ready and willing to resort to any measure to have enough money to fund computers. For example, some schools cut supplies, teachers, threw out the expense of textbooks and replaced them with laptops. A few schools, as stated, even turned the library into a computer lab! This is crazy! I don't understand how a school could just cut great teachers in order to fund computers that may not do the job that a teacher can do. Sure, computers store lots of information, but they don't have the nurturing effect that teachers do.It is hard to get away from technology and computers in today's time, after all it's the fastest way to spread information and get things across. However, I think that we should be cautious and not let it overrun a traditional school atmosphere. I believe that it can be a learning tool, but the teacher should be teaching the gist of the lesson. The computer should only be used to reiterate what the teacher already taught.I definitely recommend this book for anyone who is interested in learning about how technology and computers are taking over and Stoll's views of it. At first, I thought it was hard to get into but once I started reading, I became more interested in the book. :-)"},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"There seems to be a relentless arguement in America right now that technology is the answer to all of our problems, especially in education. After all, the Internet is this vast storehouse of information, and if schools were wired for Internet access, or if all students had their own laptops, then, the sky\`s the limit, right? Stoll, who has been around computers and the Internet for many years, says Very Wrong. A committed, dedicated teacher is still more important than the most up-to-date learning software. In a classroom full of computers, at least one of them will crash or otherwise have a major problem, wasting valuable class time while the problem is fixed. Which is more important to the learning process, actually doing science or art, for instance, or seeing a computer simulation? One of the major claims of software makers is that a specific program makes learning fun. Learning is supposed to take time and effort, and is not supposed to be fun. On the subject of donating old computers to schools, unless they are refurbished with new software, an obsolete computer is still an obsolete computer. I'd recommend this book to teachers or administrators who think technology is the answer to everything."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"In the introduction to his book, High-Tech Heretic, Clifford Stoll states, &#8220;I&#8217;m saddened by a blind faith that technology will deliver a cornucopia of futuristic goodies without extracting payment in kind.&#8221; He spends the rest of the book backing up that claim. His defense is well argued. He uses specific evidence to back his claims, and does so thoroughly.I have always believed that technology is great in and of itself; however, dependence upon it will lead to some sort of devastation. In the classroom, computers can be a great thing, but only when well used by a good educator. If the educator is not a good teacher, even a computer cannot correct that. Stoll believes that computers have no place in the classroom at all, because having them only leads to dependence upon them. This is correct, to an extent. This book was written in 1999; since then, there have been many technological advances made in computer software, making them more useful in the classroom, but of course, only by good educators.I found the chapter on math to be very interesting. In this chapter he states &#8220;problem solving becomes button pressing.&#8221; Stoll focuses on calculators, which he refers to as the kid brother to the computer. He gives specific evidence to his claims, telling of how he underwent the &#8220;New Math.&#8221; He tells of how the junior high he attended didn&#8217;t even focus on teaching him how to work out algebra, something he paid for later on in high school when he took a chemistry class. He &#8220;knew lots of squiggly symbols but hardly ever saw an equal sign.&#8221;While some of the information of the book was a little outdated, I really enjoyed reading it. In today&#8217;s society, we only hear about how much technology helps our lives. It&#8217;s refreshing to see someone voice and opinion, and back it up with experiences, which is contrary to popular belief."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"This book, even though Mr. Stoll asks valid questions, is badly edited. Mr. Stoll does not present evidence of what he says other than the occasional \\"I ask one student this question\\" or \\"I ask one person this question\\"? His book would have been more valid if he had base it on studies.Mr. Stoll says technology enhanced lessons can be boring. Well obviously whoever made up the lesson does not know how to plan a good lesson. He talks about computer education where students \\"regurgitate\\" answers but that goes on in many schools without technology in them. Students have to be taught how to learn. He also seems to have a problem with learning be fun. Why not? He is right some subjects are not going to be pleasant but most subjects can be made to be interesting and yes even fun.He discusses most children can't spell and have poor vocabulary skills or that spelling and grammar gets pushed aside so that word processing can be taught. Well then the teacher needs to be fired for not teaching although I have never seen a school refuse to teach grammar or spelling. Computers are meant to be an aid to education not a substitution. You can't blame computers for poor teaching by a teacher.He says why sink money into soon to be obsolete computers but you do not have to replace computers that often unless they breakdown. Schools do not need the most expensive computers on the market. Schools need computers that do what they need them to do and as long as the computer is doing what they need them to do they don't have to replace them. Many things are expensive in the education field but we can't refuse to spend money just because it's expensive because then you would have no textbooks, desks etc.He discusses allowing the kids to learn about subjects online such as butterflies but you can't always get the students outside. He discusses teaching astronomy as an example but not all parents would be willing to let their children go out with a teacher at night as it would be inconvenient for the parents who work at night so this might be the exact place where an online video would be a good aid until the student knows enough about astronomy to go out on his own to look at the stars in his own backyard.I do agree with him on the fact that high school should not be teaching whole classes on competency in one software as sometimes software becomes obsolete which is why many classes are designed to teach a combination of skills. I also agree with no use of calculators in class until the students have a good foundation in math. Students won't always have a calculator with them so they need to be able to do basic math.Over all I did not care for this book. I would have preferred Mr. Stoll to have come up with some scientific data on whether computers help or hurt classrooms. I must admit I wonder if I would have agreed or disagreed with Mr. Stoll six years ago as I noticed some of what bothered me about this book is because some of his arguments are outdated already which really shows us how important it is that students need to know about computers as it seems they are here to stay and will continue to infiltrate our lives as the years go by. I also wonder, if knowing what Mr. Stoll knows now about computers in the six years that has gone by since he has written this book, would the author still agree with himself?"},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"I found High-Tech Heretic, by Clifford Stole, to be a very dull book. While yes he brings up some interesting points as to how computers are costing us excessive amounts of money for upkeep in the classroom, and how computers are overrated for teaching some things, the book is very droll and monotonous. I do agree with Stole that teachers vastly overuse technology. We know that the brain is developing at a rapid rate in early childhood. Does the developing child's exposure to so much information create an overload in the child's brain when it has not formed the connections needed to effectively process such vast amounts of easily accessable information found on say, the internet? The book does doll out many examples of how computers are overused, and has many valid points, which I agree with and that really do need to be addressed by today's teachers. If you're looking for points of view on the subject, however, I suggest you look elsewhere for this is an extremely forced, albeit informative read."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"I read this book only because it was an assignment for a computer class. The author does bring up a lot of good points about how far computers have come. I do not feel that computers will take over the classroom. They do offer a lot of help for students as well as teachers. They will never be able to offer personalized assistance like a regular classroom teacher will. I would recommend this book to anyone who is highly into computers. I myself am not and did not find the book all that interesting."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"High-Tech Heretic is a must read for teachers and parents. Clifford Stoll is careful to point out in this book that he does not hate computers, but that they are often misused in the classroom as well as in the home. As a future teacher, I loved reading this book because it opened my eyes to how the computer can be used inappropriately in the classroom. Stoll argues that computers should not be used as a teacher. He says that teachers are still needed to teach students. Half of this book is about computers in the classroom, while the rest of the book deals with other issues that surround computers.The only thing I did not like about this book is that the last half of it does deal with other issues than computers in the classroom. I think Stoll should have published two separate books. The second half of this book completely shifts gears, which often makes readers feel uncomfortable. I did like the subjects Stoll discusses in the second half of this book, such as how computers are ruining libraries as well as the social skills of the human race. Sadly, I think Stoll is right.After reading this book, I will think more about how the computer can actually harm my social skills when I am wasting hours surfing on the internet. Most importantly, I will be careful of how I incorporate computers into my classroom when I teach in the future. I loved the honesty Stoll offers in this book, and I strongly recommend that adults working with children read it. Adults who use the computer often should read it also."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"High-Tech Heretic by Clifford Stoll is an awesome book. I appreciate it when someone is not afraid to express beliefs that are contrary to most others. Just like Stoll, I believe that computers are not the most efficient way of learning for children and that they should not become the primary source of education. A first grader learns the math problem 4+3=7 better if they can experience it hands on. Does a math program on the computer provide children with hands on seeing, touching, or feeling the problem 4+3=7? WIth a stimulating computer math program, children will just peck on a keyboard. How do you know that they really understand the concreteness of the problem? I praise Clifford Stoll when he expresses how using computers for learning does not encourage motivation. A student who uses the Internet to do research is not motivated to actually find the material they need to use. Going to the library and having the student search and read through books shows a motivated person. (The will to move and do it yourself!)However, I do not believe that using computers in education is not all bad. I believe that students need to learn the concrete way first, and then maybe an online test or review might help check for understanding of the material that was talked about and DISCUSSED in class. Noticed that I emphasized the word discussed, because you cannot talk to the computer screen and hear feedback on things.The author of High-Tech Heretic does an excellent job of explaining his point of view to his readers. The explaination of his point of view is easy to understand and comprehend."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"This book is great for anyone who doesn't agree on relying on the use of computers to improve a classroom. I don't fully agree with Stoll's ideas and opinions given in this book. He leans more toward the issue that computers are more of a problem than a tutor in the classroom.Stoll identified some good ideas, but it seemed that he only over-analyzed these and carried them too far. I do agree that there are some distractions and negativities about applying computer use in the classroom, but I more strongly think that they tend to help students more than hurt them.Although Stoll makes some very good points in his book, he shows very little information to back up his opinions."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"Sounds more like billowy hot air from a Rush Limbaugh type. And I am one who agrees with Stoll's general comments. He could have said it all in a book half the length.A lot of catchy slogans to banter about at a cocktail party. But no real scholarship.How do we learn? Stoll offers scant scientific evidence for his strong opinions. His book sounds like it was put together by surfing the web for a bunch of ideas. A lot of cut &amp; pasting with little support. Not even a list of references or bibliography. All of what Stoll condemns!"},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, unless you are completely against using computers in the classroom. I do not agree with most of the idea/concepts he gave towards using computers in the classroom. Computers can be used ineffectively and I agree that a lot of times they are, but that doesn't mean we should just completely get rid of them. They can be an excellent teaching tool if used in the right way. Children can learn so much from computer programs, but this still doesn't mean that you should completely gear your lessons/activities towards computers. Hands-on projects/assignments are always needed. Even though I didn't agree with most of the book, I did have to agree with Stoll when he said that school-age children should not have laptop!"},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"Clifford Stroll must be locked in the 1960's still. His anti technology veiws are arcane and very naive. For one to honestly believe that computers are not helpful is beyond my capacity of reason. In the last 10 years computers have done a lot for the educational system. Don't misunderstand, I don't think Bill Gates is the mesiah or that computers are the cure all of America's educational woes, but technology has made things more convienant and the learning process now has more avenues. Now we can have options as educators instead of having to use textbooks and only textbooks. Stroll's veiws in my opinion are way off the mark."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"You Shouldn't waste your time by reading High Tech Heretic. Stoll talks about how computers and how they are waste of school money and that they are not a good teaching tool. For one he is not a teacher. I would not believe over half the stuff that he wrote. He does not support anything that he says. His grammar through out the whole book is awful! I did however agree with one thing he said. School age kids (k-12) should not have a laptop computer."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"In my opinion the book \\"High-Tech Heretic\\" was extremely repetitive. When reading the first chapter it sounds as if the whole book is going to have different reasons as to why technology should not be used in the classroom. However, the first chapter turned out to be the rest of the book. There was no new information provided throughout the entire book. Also, I believe the book was too long for the subject it was over. There were so many chapters in the book, even if you did read something that you agreed with it was too difficult to come back to that point. The book held no interest in the subject of technology, the book also held no interest in teaching. In my opinion the book could be used as more of a resource if it discussed things more in depth as to why teaching and technology were so intertwined. I would not recommend this book to anyone. Also, I would never read this book again and I do not believe it was a good resource. This book does not give both positive and negative aspects to teaching with a computer resource. I believe this book is too one sided and would not recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"Stoll continues themes first begun in 'Silicon Snake Oil', this time focussing on the specific question of computers and the Internet in the classroom. He seems to especially question the notions of making learning 'fun' and 'exciting': he argues that effective learning is not generally 'fun', but is instead genuinely hard work. He goes further, and concludes that educational tools which are sold as 'fun and exciting' do so by ceasing to be educational.Stoll questions the 'empowerment' of the Internet. Empowerment in what way, exactly? On the Internet, everyone is a de facto editor / publisher, and much material that would never be printed is given equal status with the greatest novels. As the most thoughful and well-researched works are equalized by the net to the grammatically fractured toss-offs of anyone, the net actually weakens critical faculties.If empowerment means strengthening, then Stoll concludes that the Internet actually enfeebles. Being online is a solitary activity masquerading as a social one. Every minute spent online is another minute in which true opportunties for social contact and interaction have been lost.Stoll has a real affection for libraries, and does not like changes involving purchase of CD ROMs and computers. He notes that computers and media technology are obsolete in five to ten years, but that many communities have incurred 30 year debts to purchase such equipment, frequently by reducing or eliminating new book acquisitions.The problem in the end has nothing to do with Stoll. As a web engineer with a dot com, as a self-employed web designer, I shuddered when people wanted to put streaming video on a website. I would always ask, why not make a TV commercial?This idea was met with distaste, but streaming video was exciting. Hmmm, aren't they the same thing? Somehow, those who wanted streaming video never actually defined where it would come from, and certainly never addressed actually making it.I agree with Stoll, that the form of the net is such that people forget the content, assuming that quality content will follow. Follow from where?The problem with this book is the same as with SSO: the people who most need to read and think and think hard about what Stoll is saying, are the non-thinkers who label him a 'Luddite' for questioning the technology - the very people least likely to be reading, period.End of the day, Stoll makes a thousand times more sense than his detractors. Every educator, everyone involved with development of the Internet, everyone concerned about their childs education, needs to read Stoll, and to challenge the creeeping and by now almost invisible assumption that computrification is a priori good and useful."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"As an educator with over fifteen years in the computer industry, I've &quot;looked at life from both sides now.&quot; And the truth is, Stoll is 100% on target with his assessment of the primrose path down which computerization is leading education.For those looking for a more scholarly work that addresses the false promises spouted by Gates and his ilk, look elsewhere (John Locke's &quot;The De-Voicing of Society&quot; is a prime example), as Cliff Stoll writes in a more popular style.The amount spent on purchasing, maintaining, and updating both computer hardware and software borders on the criminal, with school administrators caught between the veritable rock and hard place. The populist idea that computer usage equals brighter students is a poison for which there is no antidote. Stoll is correct: the hard way is the only way. Nor can there be any substitute for excellent teachers and face-to-face dialog. The overemphasis on computers provides an easy out for all three points.There is no sin in confessing that this path is a deadend. But with so much money riding on the decision, the outcome seems pre-ordained. Stoll shares this less encouraging belief.I once encountered in Palo Alto a network specialist whose sole work was with two Silicon Valley school districts. His consulting and implementation fees earned him a cool quarter million a year - a quarter million that could easily have provided dozens of other more beneficial educational programs. It was his soulless laugh over the way he taking these schools for a ride that was the clincher for me.Yes, the hard way is the only way. Take the time to read this book and you'll be a believer, too."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"I absolutely loved this book. I read half the book the first day I got it. Stoll is so sensible about computers and humorous at the same time. He has written in this book exactly what I have felt about computers and their use in schools. I have used computers, and the net, in school projects for a long time and, even though I love the technology, I can also see how frustrating and time consuming it really is. Stoll brings this out so well in this book. We need a middle ground in this computer-crazy world. We need to rethink the importance of computers in the classroom, rather than just doing what is politically correct."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"This review appeared November 7, 1999, in the Seattle Times and is available online at http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/news/entertainment/html98/stol_19991107.htmlClifford Stoll, author of &quot;The Cuckoo's Egg&quot; and &quot;Silicon Snake Oil,&quot; now wryly examines the uses of computers in education and various related hype from the electronic marketplace. No cynic about technology, Stoll is a Berkeley astronomer and pioneer of the Internet who loves computers and computing. Yet he argues that the educational benefits of computers in schools are few: &quot;A good school needs no computers. And a bad school won't be much improved by even the fastest Internet links.&quot; Nor do school libraries need much technology--the best libraries invest most heavily in books, periodicals, and the expertise of librarians (not &quot;information specialists&quot;).Stoll argues that computers actually retard learning. They waste time because technical difficulties continually interrupt computer-dependent instruction, and they make students who use them for more than word-processing or spreadsheets into passive recipients of unreliable information. 99% of the material on the Web is &quot;inaccurate, out of date, one-sided, or no longer maintained,&quot; and the more dependable Websites tend to provide raw data instead of carefully distilled information. Besides, students are already overwhelmed with information. They need knowledge, which the Net fails to help them develop because its methods, pace, and style undermine the concentration, discipline, patience, and critical analysis required for learning. Stoll concludes that computers in schools are a terrible waste of educational funds.Can a book like this one succeed in making educators across the nation think twice about their campaigns to wire every classroom or put a laptop in every kid's lap? Stoll's long experience with technology gives him authority, he cites reliable studies, and his claims are based on hard facts, clear logic, and plain common sense. But his argument is thinned by a digressive chatterbox style, folksy with nopes, yeps, hecks, heys, and the occasional ouch! or yee-ha! And no combination of facts, logic, or common sense has yet made much headway against America's worship of technology."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"Clifford Stoll's exercise in bashing technology has come to a climactic realization in High-Tech Heretic. Stoll wishes to express that computers do not belong in the classroom, and that human interaction is the only successful teaching method. Students do need teachers, but they do not need mind-numbing lecture or lackluster busy work, which is the very thing that is provided by most contemporary teachers. Interacting through the internet and learning via computer allows students to temporarily escape the torture that is public education. Teaching is what needs to be reformed, not computers. We should be focusing on mundane lesson plans of uninspiring teachers instead of the overgrowth of computer activity in public schools.Stoll's wit and humor throughout the book are entertaining enough, but soon become arid and repetitive. His focus on condemning technology is tiresome. He centers his argument on the theory that computers will replace teachers in the classroom, when such a thing could never feasibly be accomplished. His theoretical situations, while thought provoking, are simply the manifestation of his paranoia.I am a student at a university equipped with several computer labs. I own two computers and do not consider them to be useless pieces of equipment only suitable for word processing. I use my computer for valuable research as well as communicating from friends around the globe, hardly a wasteful pastime. I not only collect information, but new and valuable experiences I will be able to use throughout my life. If Stoll influenced my computer exploits I could turn into the cynical, mistrustful person that Stoll appears to be in High-Tech Heretic. Clifford Stoll tries hard to be philosophical, but comes off as contemptuous.High-Tech Heretic is not a book for the faint of heart. It should be considered with a skeptical eye and not taken literally. Computers are another part of life and education that are here to stay, no matter how hard Clifford Stoll tries to condemn them."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"If you care about our education system, and you are inclined to think that computers are part of the solution, you should read this book. Stoll makes the case that computers are more likely part of the problem.My favorite line is from p. 99:&quot;No pilot project in educational technology has ever been declared a failure.&quot;This aptly characterizes the process of evaluating technology in education as utterly lacking in rigor.Unfortunately, this book also is lacking in rigor. On that score, I cannot disagree with Stoll's critics. There is a lot more strong rhetoric than strong proof here.But the bottom line remains: Stoll is probably right. The conventional wisdom vastly overstates the benefits and understates the costs of computers in education. If this book does nothing more than encourage people to ask questions about costs and benefits, it will have done a heroic service."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"Without a doubt, tech-junkie Clifford Stoll is more than qualified to write a book concerning the overuse of computers in the classroom. His endless knowledge and love of all things technological definitely give him the credibility needed to persuade his audience. However, while his writing oozes experience, wit, and personality, his ideas and arguments fall flat when repeated with every chapterAfter perusing the first several pages, I had high expectations for this book. Admittedly, I had not initially been too enthused about reading this book as a class assignment... and yet, the first chapters were a pleasant surprise; Stoll's writing is neither dry nor dull, but fresh and personal. He highlights many pressing concerns, such as the unnecessary introduction of computers into the kindergarten classroom, the misunderstanding that computer skills are equivalent with true learning and higher thinking, the computer's incapacity to provide children with pivotal hands-on experiences, and the decline in quality communication skills and relationships due to technology. In short, Stoll believes that, while computers can be extremely useful tools, schools are misguided in their moves to centralize the curriculum around glowing screens and keyboards. I must admit, he had me convinced.Stoll's points are very valid. And yet, as I continued to examine the novel further, I began to feel as though I were reading the same chapter over and over again. His arguments quickly became repetitive and tedious. Many of my fellow classmates agreed with me in asserting that Stoll's book could have been cut down to a much shorter length and still have contained the same effective arguments.Another aspect of this book was faulty: Stoll's use of insignificant footnotes. Stoll appears to have attempted to include every single shred of information that he could into this 240-page book. His frequent footnotes seem to be material that his editor had wanted to cut, but Stoll couldn't bear to part with... so he resorted to cramming this information into sentences at the bottoms of the book's pages. Too, some of these unwelcome footnotes contain information that is fairly irrelevant, such as a recipe for baking banana bread. Shouldn't footnotes provide insight, rather than second-thoughts or unrelated data?Overall, High-Tech Heretic provides intriguing insight that brings many overlooked educational and technological issues to the surface. Nevertheless, while Stoll's book is undoubtedly persuasive, the reader should be prepared to continually become exasperated by his redundancy and odd footnotes."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"From the onset of High-Tech Heretic, the reader must be prepared to hang on for dear life, as the completely one-sided slant of this work can easily slide the casual reader into a cold sea of technological cynicism. Now, Stoll has completely valid and often painfully true points, but his execution of these ideas are often somewhat sloppy, unfocused, and highly offensive. Having based his life around many aspects concerning both computers and education, paired with extensive research concerning the two topics, the author would seem to be quite the authority on the subject-which he is, yet he often seems to doubt his own persuasive prowess. This causes an immense portion of the book to fall victim to blatant namedropping that cites incessant and near-identical quotes from concerned parents, professors, and the like in order to assure credibility.Now, the content is highly valid in today's society (though many of the technical terms are now out-of-date, proving one of his points), and expresses why and how too much technology can be truly harmful to our educational systems. Stoll is a strong advocate for critical thinking and personal development, and tells the cruel reality that too many computers do work to decrease our level of humanity; yet, he also fails to admit how computers can also enhance our lives. Many of his arguments degenerate into wispy tangents, only returning on-target to end a chapter.In short, this book can be summed up by two words from Clifford Stoll himself: \\"Balance? Bah.\\" (pg. 74)"},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"In this book, Stoll is a complete computer nerd, and yet even he knows when and where computers should be used. He feels that is the teachers fault that the students of today world are so dependent on computers and that even some of the information that students come across these days isn't even accurate.Teachers practically feed the internet to students and then wonder why all they do is play computer games. I feel that it isn't the teachers fault rather it is society's fault. We are all guilty of doing things the easy way. Computers are making the lives of people who have them easier and easier. But where should we draw the line? How many young children do you see everyday who spend so much time everyday on the computer, or computer games that are pushing obesity?If feel that the old days of recess and children playing outside until dark are rarely seen anymore, and here are where the problems of our world start. Stoll whines in the book about children's ability to read and such, and yet does nothing to promote better ways to do so through a classroom. I believe children need to get outside more, and the things they learn there and from their parents will help each and everyone of them succeed."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"Review of \\"High Tech Heretic\\" by Scott Warner.On a normal setting you definitely wouldn't find me reading a book about computers and technology in the society we live in. This one however wasn't too bad. Stoll made some very good points when it came to how technology runs our society. I liked how he kind of trashed the school systems and how they really don't teach us anything about computers and how to use them correctly. They just throw us in front of them and say \\"OK, there you go now type something.\\" It isn't until you are more grown up that you really begin your education in technology.I think that for this book what Stoll did was he got angry one night, found a computer and started to write about things that he disapproved of. He basically just takes out his frustration on the keyboard and (...) for a hundred pages. It can be a little tough to follow at times because he jumps from one topic to another and then back to the original one. Many times each topic leads into another one but you have to go through two or three just to get his point.I do like this book. Despite my critiquing, I did enjoy his humor used in this book. It's hard to just sit and read about computers and technology and I think he realizes this and added some humor along with the mix. I am a physical education major so reading about these things doesn't exactly float my boat. That's why this book was a little difficult for me to fully enjoy. I'm sure if I was in to computers and I.T. then it would excite me a little more. Other than that I recommend reading it if things like that interest you."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"In High-Tech Heretic, Clifford Stoll questions the ridiculous and often hilarious measures society is willing to take to incorporate technology into the classroom. Although there are a few of his arguments and assumptions that I do not agree with, there were also many good points in his book. Overall, whether you agree or disagree with Mr. Stoll on everything, he makes you take a long, hard look at computers in education. You may even rethink some of your past beliefs.Some of the eye opening examples in the book came from actual schools. These schools were ready to resort to any measure necessary to fund computers. Some schools cut teachers and supplies, others tossed out textbooks for laptops, and the even more extreme converted their library into a computer lab. I definitely agree with Stoll that computers are not a quick fix to education, and they most certainly cannot replace a good teacher.I did not buy into Stoll's argument against the use of calculators. I do not think that calculators need to be banned from education. I believe there are proper uses for calculators, and when used effectively, they aid in the teaching of mathematics. I also did not like his assumption that most children do not go on to higher math. At least three years of higher math is a requirement of graduation at many high schools. There are even middle schools that begin teaching pre-algebra at the 6th grade! This false assumption made me question some of his other statements.At times, this book is hard to get through, and many of the illustrations are far fetched. Despite this, I recommend reading it. Even if you do not completely agree with Clifford Stoll on everything, he brings a different perspective that is worth looking at. After reading this book, I realized that our society needs to rethink the pedestal that technology is automatically put upon and our excess of faith in computers' ability to solve everything. It is worth reading just to find out if your position needs to change."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"When I first began reading High-Tech Heretic I was very hesitant to jump right into the book, but after the first chapter I was overwhelmed by his ability to connect with educators about how inconvenient computers are in the classroom. Clifford Stoll is not afraid to ask the tough questions regarding computer technology in the classroom. In this book he often ponders upon the thought of why there is so much emphasis on learning computer literacy if the children cannot read or write. There are no answers to his questions, but he does voice his opinion on the situation.I agree with Stoll on most of the technological issues educators are faced with and pushed toward. Today administrators are constantly pushing educators to use technology in the classroom and for a man whose life has been wrapped up in computers since the sixties to say that computers aren't the answer thrills me. I hope that eventually everyone will see that the key to education is a teacher with desire to teach, not the latest new wave in technology.I do however believe that computers should be taught in school because today's economy is highly based on computer literacy and to be successful in certain career fields you must have a background on computers.I strongly recommend reading this book to anyone who cares about the future of education in the world or to anyone who has ever used a computer. This book was very well written and Stoll was able to capture how education and children's though process is possibly being tampered with because of the technological advances. I'm glad someone other than a teacher decided to address this issue from an educators point of view and a computer programmers to show how education needs teachers, not just computers. It's like computer generated music and classic rock, the computer generated music comes and goes and has no heart, but the classic rock songs will always be remembered, just like a good teacher."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"I loved the book! It was not at all what I expected when I started reading. But I can't say I disagree with a word he says. I also have some of the same questions as Stoll ask: How can the school board justify spending millions a year on more computers when we have eighth graders that can't read? Why are millions spent on computers in schools and they can't afford a small stipend for a Beta Club sponsor? Stoll gave no answers to any of these but it is enough to make me wonder \\"Is he the only one why ever wrote a book about the reverse side of the wonderful world of computers?\\"Just as Stoll said it, our school, just like all the others, have 2 running computers labs, a library media center with 20 come computers and a new computer lab being installed this very minute. But, when school starts, just like every year, I will have several students that can't read past the first grade level. My thoughts are as Stoll's, If a child can't read, a teacher is needed, not a computer. Computers and do a lot of things but there are times when a teacher can do much more.I was Beta club sponsor for several years with out being given any kind of compensation. Then, two years ago, I went to the board office and ask for a budget to buy some things that the Beta club students needed to compete in competition. I was told there was no money. NO MONEY for academics but they installed a new USB port in our school the very week. Stoll has all the right in the world to ask such questions. I want answers also. But I don't think either of us is going to the answer we are looking for any time soon.Where will the answers come from? Will our schools continue looking for more technology to solve all our children's problems?"},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"As a result of reading High-Tech Heretic by Clifford Stoll, I have to ask myself \\"Am I enhancing or taking away from the learning process for my students by using computers?\\" I, like most educators around the world, find myself trying to keep up with the \\"technological Jones's\\" out of necessity to keep my job. Today's educators feel more pressure than ever before to incorporate technology into their instruction. In fact, teachers are evaluated based on their use of technology in the classroom. However, is all of this technology raising the standards of schools throughout the United States? According to Clifford Stoll's, it may be doing more harm than good.Students are missing out of many basic and nurturing skills by using computers. Computers give students the opportunity to conduct scientific experiments without actually doing the experiments, but how much are students missing out on by not doing it themselves? Can a computer listen to you when you've lost a loved one or feel frustrated because of a bully? Is it capable of building your self esteem when you can't quite figure out how to do your work? Can it tell when you are trying your hardest or just doing enough to get by?In Stoll's book he strongly supports computers are needlessly costing schools millions of dollars. Alas, the investments are short lived because the \\"new\\" technology quickly becomes obsolete only to be replaced by costly upgrades. How many of you went to schools where valuable programs such as music, art, and physical education were cut in order to purchase a few computers? Maybe your child had to try to survive in an overcrowded class because teachers were cut to find funding for new technology.I would recommend any educator or potential educator read this book. Clifford Stoll's sheds a whole new light on using technology in the classroom. Due to this book, every time I design a Power Point presentation or show my students how to publish their writing pieces, I'll wonder if I am really helping my students in the back of my mind. I only wish the high ranking educational officials would closely examine this book too!"},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"In High-Tech Heretic, Clifford Stoll expresses his perspective of the use of computers in today's world. Although I might not have liked some of the ways he made his point. I do agree with many of his ideas. Computers should be used to enhance the topic which is being taught. A computer should not be used to teach the content only to reinforce or expand on the content being taught.Can a computer take the place of a teacher? I agree with Stoll, a computer cannot replace a teacher! A teacher can give students what a computer cannot, the human touch. A teacher who cares and wants to help a student is invaluable in the classroom. As an educator, one problem I see is that many students need to learn to get along socially with others. They need human contact. Many of the kids spend a lot of their time at home in front of a computer or a television. They are not out playing with other children.Will schools really save money if they replace textbooks with computers? Stoll does a good job pointing out the fact that the price of a computer isn't the only cost of technology. You must invest more money into technicians, programs and computer upgrades, replacement of equipment every few years. Stoll also points out the reality that not all information obtained over the internet is highly accurate or even appropriate for the classroom.I would recommend this book for someone who is interested in one person's viewpoint of computer usage. It is a well-written and thought provoking book. It brings to light many aspects of computers and technology in today's world. It leaves you thinking about how computers should be used in the classroom and in society as a whole. Maybe the current push for computer literacy isn't worth the sacrifices made in the classroom to achieve this goal?"},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"High -Tech Heretic by Clifford Stoll is light reading about a topic that is\\" everywhere\\". Clifford Stoll puts on paper what most educators already know about the use of computers in education. As an educator it is refreshing to read this from a self-proclaimed computer nerd. The content areas are the main focus of educators today because of high stakes testing. Computer technology is on the forefront because of the \\"Information Revolution\\". Is there a place for both in today's classroom? Clifford Stoll takes what might be considered an old fashioned but a common senses look at this question. Computers do link students across the world and makes assessing information quick and easy. But, what does the student do with the information? They copy and paste without thinking about why.Teachers with more than five years experience are invaluable. Computers that are more than five years old are obsolete. Clifford Stoll takes a humorous look at what to do with old computers. Fish Tanks! I agree that computers will never replace the human touch. Even an average teacher with great intentions and a desire to teach children is more effective than the most up-to- date computer. Physical contact can never be substituted with a keyboard and a monitor with messages from someone half way around the world. Educators are to prepare students to enter the future workforce. Stoll points out \\"People mainly get fired for being unable to get along with others. Tomorrow's jobs, like today's, will belong to those with social skills. Yet the time we spend behind a key-board dulls those essential abilities.\\"I recommend this book to anyone with an interest in computers and/or education. Stoll takes a humorous, common sense look at computers and their place in schools and society. Maybe he should have been an educator because he gives examples after examples to prove his point. Which may have been an over kill.But, I would still recommend this as a light reading."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"When I first started reading High-Tech Heretic, I was completely offended. You mean to tell me that incorporating computers with all aspects of education doesn't necessarily improve it? Not everyone needs to have advanced knowledge of how computers work? You must be kidding me. How could the educational the educational system that I've been through my entire life be misdirected? Clifford Stoll explains how in this very interesting read. A man who has been involved in the world of personal computing, Stoll takes a completely unexpected ideology about how computers relate to education.Although I was completely disgusted with what Stoll was saying at first, now I am completely sold. Not only does he gripe about how administrators see computers in classrooms as a solution to improving standardized test scores, he gripes about not allowing the teachers to do their jobs. Being a future educator, it is refreshing to hear that a person whose profession is technology truly understands that a computer can not replace a good teacher. And Stoll has done his homework, he knows about learning theories, application of what is learned and how students truly learn.I recommend that everyone read this book. Especially thick headed, number-crunching administrators who need to figure out that teachers and text books are more important than a child being able to type when they are 6 years old. Computers are a luxury, not a necessity. Stoll discusses how reasoning and logic skills are destroyed thanks to the instant information achieved through computers. Children do not need computers to build something, learn about colors, play an instrument or really learn much of anything. I am sold; High-Tech Heretic is a truly refreshing and informative read for educators and everyone else to understand that teachers teach children, not computers."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"While reading High-Tech Heretic by Clifford Stoll, I found myself agreeing with a lot of what Stoll has to say. I do believe that a lot of educators rely too heavily on computers. Computers should be used to enhance a topic not teach the topic. It is up to parents and educators to know how to combine computers with books to give our children the best of both worlds. Stoll mentions that reading and learning to read has taken a back seat to computer software that \\"teaches\\" reading. While Stoll brings up very valid points of why and how the computers are overused, he does not however, give any valuable ways to stop the reliance on computers.Children today do not want to play tag, pick up a book, or create a pretend animal hospital, if they cannot plug it into a computer or Playstation 2 than they do not want to do it. I feel this leads to a lot of the problems that parents and educators are worried about today.This book definitely sheds much needed light on how computers are used today. Mr. Stoll presents this book with well thought out insight into the world of computers with a humor that almost makes the book fun. I do feel, however, that what it took him the whole book to say could have been summed up in a lot fewer chapters.Overall I would recommend reading the book to gain more insight in how educators and parents alike have over relied on computers. Although, you will have to draw your own conclusions on when enough is enough in the computer world."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"Well, I must admit that I quite enjoyed High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian. Stoll plays devils advocate and evokes thought such as: Does computer literacy competencies appear when a sales clerk scans a product? Are having computers in the schools really less expensive than text books? Are we eliminating our librarians due to computers and computer literate students?To answer a few of Stoll's questions, we must delve into the nether regions of our minds and reach for that untainted information. We generally have immediate opinions based upon our prior knowledge (or lack thereof). While reading Stoll's book, I had to strip myself of my prejudiced views of how fabulous computers are to the college student as well as the public school student. I have been taught throughout college by very few professors that the computer is the new technology and tool to catapult you into a market where only few are knowledgeable. Computers do need upkeep by a technologist; however, wouldn't we have a technologist even if students didn't have computers? Isn't technology anything new that will improve life as we know it? Librarians will always be needed-who do we think helps teach these children the specific programs and basics of computer literacy?!Finally, I would like to say that Stoll evokes thought and provides determination on a subject most fear to tread. A computer is only as good as the person that puts in the information or knows how to use it. All in all, I found myself the defendant of the computer, despite the excellent points of view brought about by Stoll."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"High Tech Heretic by Clifford Stoll is an interesting and surprising look at one man's views on the over emphasis of technology in our nation's schools. At a time when there is such a great push for schools, government and society at large to hurry and jump on the technological bandwagon or be left in the dust, Mr. Stoll presents the idea that people should do just the opposite and not dedicate all their efforts to technology. Mr. Stoll makes many good points to support his ideas and discusses school administrator's misguided attempts to address computer competencies by throwing out textbooks and spending millions of dollars on computers and software. He offers many examples to support the statements he makes. I found some of these situations surprisingly true. As a teacher, I have witnessed attempts by administrators and parents to provide the best that money can offer to students by pushing them toward computers and other forms of technology when they should have been going back to basics and allowing students a natural progression to the use of technology as it is needed during the course of their careers in education. Mr. Stoll provides an energetic look into this problem in education and offers readers the opportunity to reflect on issues we are all familiar with but don't take the time to expound upon. I suggest this book for educators, parents and administrators. It provides a new look into the use of computers and technology that most people don't readily come up with on their own. It definitely leaves readers with a mountain of new ideas about how much emphasis should be put on technology."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"It is useful to remember that this book is not written by someone who loathes computers and eschews all things technological while promoting that we return to the \\"good old days\\" before television was invented. Stoll knows, loves and uses computers, but he offers us food for thought by questioning the role computers play in our lives. As an educator, I enjoy being challenged about the assumptions I make about good classroom practice, and this book made me realize that I have taken certain things for granted about the benefits of technology in the schools. His thoughts may help those who want to choose more judiciously when and how to use computers in the classroom, but the reader will have to be patient. Stoll takes a whole book to say what could have been expressed in two chapters. His strong (though witty) approach besieges the reader with such force that he or she may decide that Stoll is too one-sided to have a valid argument. I suggest you give him a chance and allow his insights to remind you to pause a moment before you head to the keyboard."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"In this slim volume, Stoll gives us a skeptical look at computing in the classroom. He unflinchingly questions the assumptions thrown around by the proponents of the technology. This isn't a scholarly work, and isn't trying to be such. If you have ever had doubts about the efficacy of computers in the classroom, this is an excellent starter book. Written in a light and breezy style, you can finish it in a few hours and have plenty of time to reflect on his opinions.Stoll asks important questions. Why are we worried about digital literacy when our kids are barely literate at all? Shouldn't we be more concerned with ensuring that they can construct an essay and do basic mathematics? Is it more important for kids to learn how to make an effective oral presentation, or be able to put together a snazzy PowerPoint presentation?A few things about the book bothered me. It occasionally was repetitive. The light and breezy style was too breezy in some places. I found it ironic that he complained about poor writing skills of schoolchildren, but consistently used incomplete sentences throughout the book. I understand that it was a stylistic choice, but it was a choice that annoyed me.In all, I would recommend it to anyone who has encountered computers in the classroom. Society needs to seriously consider why we have invested so much time, effort, and money to wire all of our classrooms. Could that money have been more effectively spent on more teachers, more varied educational programs, more musical instruments?"},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"I found Stoll's book to be quite interesting and informative. It's intriguing that a man who is so interested in computers should be so opposed with letting them take over the classroom. He makes a clear and wonderful point that while computers are useful in enhancing the classroom atmosphere, a teacher should not rely completely on them to teach his or her class. Just because a child can click a mouse doesn't mean that he or she has gotten anything out of a lesson...a computer doesn't teach students to write, to appreciate the natural sciences, how fingerpaints feel, etc. I would recommend High-Tech Heretic to any parent, teacher, or (perhaps especially) administrator."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"I would recommend this book to anyone who spends time working with computers in anyway, especially educators. I did not agree with some of the comments that he made in this book, but overall Clifford Stoll does present an interesting concept that computers may not deserve all the hype that they are given. I did not appreciate the assumption that he made that teachers put students on computers because they don't want them to have a fear of them. I am a teacher who has three computers in my room, and I can speak from experience they are not placed on those computers because fear of computers is a concern for me. It is another medium for me as a teacher to use to get the information across to the students. I really like the idea he stressed that in schools teachers are being cut, but money is being spent for computers. I do think computers get too much attention, and they aren't as great and wonderful as people would like to make them. Just like any type of media whether it is a book, video, or puzzles, the computer is a way to present information. It most certainly isn't a good way to teach the information. I recommend this book because he discusses many different uses of the computer that actually affects almost anyone who has access to one. It definitely makes you think about that &quot;sterile box-shaped post-modern generic gray plastic&quot; (as Stoll puts it) thing sitting on your desktop. I won't stop using my computer because of this book, but I will be less reluctant to buy into the 'hoopla' that many people place on this machine."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"Educators and parents alike should read this book. It points out the blind-faith that our society places in technology, and the consequences from doing so. Regardless of what you think of technology in the classroom or at home, you'll reevaluate your stance after reading this book. Stoll offers the myths and advertisements of technology with strong counter opinions and facts to bring the realities to light. As a computer-guru himself, his rants aren't just some over-cautious parent, or some techie who only cares about profit. His call for making computers adapt to human beings needs and desires, instead of man adapting to the computer. Much of his novel focuses on the \\"make learning fun with computers\\" hype that is so prevalent today in the classroom. From entertaining, to answers at the touch of button, or click of a mouse, he calls for more than just a balance. While Stoll offers strong opinions, he lacks statistical information to help sway certain readers. But for those who see the need for technology as less than it is pushed, they will certainly find relief that they are not the only ones feeling this."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"Clifford Stoll is a PhD in astronomy with a varied background in education including teaching in high school. He is a computer user of many years citing his technical experience in the past. He is also an MSNBC commentator.&quot;High-Tech Heretic&quot; is not written as scholarly research. It is a personal essay on what is wrong with computer learning in our society today. Stoll does cite sources in his text, but uses very few footnotes and his sources are not completely identified in detail. His work is definately thought-provoking, as he questions nearly every aspect of computing, especially computer use in education.Clifford Stoll is careful to point out that he does not hate computers, however they are often misused in the classroom. He does not buy into all the hype surrounding the latest technologies and is particularly critical of the way schools spend millions of dollars on technology. I partially agree with Stoll on this point, however this does not mean that computers do not belong in our schools. I feel that they are very worthwhile in the educational setting, they just need to be used properly. They are a tool, and like all tools, may be used inappropriately. Schools should constantly examine their methods of incorporating technology into the curriculum in efficient and beneficial ways.A computer will never replace human interaction and hands-on teaching. Stoll's fears that computers will replace traditional books, libraries, librarians and teachers is unfounded. He does however provide a reality check for those who think computers and software are the answers to our societal and educational problems."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"I am writing this during a break in a presentation touting &quot;technology&quot; (read computers) in schools, which I am being forced to attend.

Because otherwise children are bored! I've already bought six copies of this book to hand out to others to combat this sort of brainwashing, and am about to buy more. Stoll's book is full of common sense, which is sadly lacking these days among the computerize-the-schools fanatics.

I agree with him on most aspects however, I disagree when he states \\"Most learning isn't fun\\". I don't think that is has to be that way. Stoll also talks of how computers do not compare with textbooks and I would have to agree, books are long lasting and although some parts become outdated they still provide vital information.

Questioning every aspect of computing, Stoll doesn't buy into all the hype surrounding the latest technology and its promise of enriching our lives and solving all of our problems. He is particularly critical of the way schools spend millions of dollars on technology with little proof of its effectiveness. With its many alternative views, this book should give pause to even the most ardent and enthusiastic supporter of technology."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"It's refreshing to finally find a computer expert that will admit that computers can overcomplicate many aspects of life. In High-Tech Heretic, Clifford Stoll explores the idea that computers shouldn't play as big a role in education as many in today's world suggest. I happen to agree with this. While computers are one of our most valuable resources they can never replace some of the most basic teaching qualities. A computer cannot replace human interaction and hands on learning. While I agree with Stoll about the role of computers in education, I disagree with him that computers should be taken out of the classroom. Computers have helped thousands of students, like me, research material, explore ideas, and meet deadlines much quicker than with traditional methods. Overall, High-Tech Heretic was a much better read than what I had first anticipated."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"I agree with most of what the author said. I feel computers have come a long way in our time. They however will never be able to completely replace teachers. Computers are helpful in many ways, but can not interact with a student.. You need a teacher there to really make a child feel needed. I don't really agree with all of this book, but it would be helpful for a class assignment."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"I feel that Charles Stoll's critique on how technologies should be used in the classroom is a good counter argument for the way in which schools are tending to head today.

Yet I feel that if a school does not keep up on a moderate level of technology (unlike Stoll prefers) they are sacrificing the future success of the students.

Stoll, amazingly talented and experienced, tackles computers and a few intricacies that come with them. A specific topic that appears throughout the work is the involvement of computers in education. He even suggests eliminating them from the classrooms; an extreme and thought provoking approach. Although parts were not too exciting, overall, his witty sense of humor makes reading this text interesting. Well researched and very informative, I would recommend this book to various audiences."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"I feel that the book High Tech Heretic was an okay book. In his book, Stoll does not say that he hates computers, rather they are mis-used. Therefore, he wanted to bring them out of the schools. Computers are used wrongly in many cases, but they do not need to be taken out of the schools. The educators just need to learn how to use the computers properly as a tool.So, I agree to a certain point with this part of the book.The last part of the book however, I did not find as much help. This part talked of the things surrounding computers and that was not in my interest.If you are someone that has to interact with children on a daily basis, then I feel that you should read the first half of this book."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"Heather PenningtonHigh Tech HereticClifford Stoll took my pure ignorance of computers and technology and turned it around completely. I could never begin to understand why someone would love technology so much, but after reading this book I have a better understanding and can relate that same love to other aspects of my own life. From reading about how Stoll turned a used Macintosh into an aquarium, to reading his claim that computers are the greatest invention in education since chalk...well, it's hard to imagine how someone could read this book and not be enraptured.I agree with Stoll that education has become much more centered around technology and I have begun to see that not involving our children in this technology is seriously depriving their intellectual concepts of daily world events and what is going on around them. The world of technology serves as a looking glass into a greater knowledge of politics, religion, and education. Three things we, as adults, are constantly pressing on the younger generations.I suggest this book to anyone wishing to understand more about technology and the need to instill it in the lives of every individual. It has opened my eyes to look at technology as more than a nerdy activity for those who can't get a social life, I now see it as a way to look at the world as if seeing it for the first time. From the viewpoint of a bug on a big map. We're all bugs and this world is our map, we need to have a better understanding of it or where can we hope to go in the future, what can we hope to attain?"},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"I was very disappointed in the relentless criticisms that Clifford Stoll used in this book to portray technology, namely computers. He contributes virtually every problem in society today to technology. Depression, social anxiety, ADHD in children, family problems, declining test scores, loss of teaching and librarian positions, even declining church attendance... all due to computer use as Stoll so bluntly insinuates. He states that the World Wide Web does not offer social skills, strength of character, trust and determination. However, it provides situations that are a test of them just like real life. There undoubtedly are programs that emphasize/teach these areas that one can purchase also. Ethical issues are present in everything we do- even on the computer.Yet another \\"stretch of the imagination\\" that Stoll makes in this book is that kindergarten classrooms are increasingly looking and sounding like video arcades. While this may be occurring in very few schools, I honestly do not feel it is the norm and is quite insulting to most kindergarten teachers who know best how to present their curriculum and whether to distinguish if technology is the best tool for teaching a particular skill.I do agree with Stoll's concerns regarding overuse of computers by many children and even adults. However, he takes it much too far with his personal opinions. The fault should not lie with technology. If a child is spending a majority of his or her time surfing the Internet the fault should lie with the parent or guardian. We can't blame technology for lack of supervision and balance by parents.Finally, I intensely disagree with Stoll in that it is possible to do perfectly well without computers or high tech devices in today's society. Technology allows us to be more efficient and effective in what we do whether it is providing services to a customer in a business or tracking student health records, test scores, etc. As a business owner and an educator, computers are of significant value and a wonderful tool to me!!"},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"While it's true that quite a bit of the the first 1/3 sounds repetitive, the later parts introduce new thoughts and were quite interesting.Contrary to the first reviewers comments, Stoll *does* back up his assertations with plenty of references. Names, titles and locations are well spec'd inline."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Cliff Stoll's book \\"The Cuckoo's Egg\\", but after reading High-Tech Heretic I can't see myself reading another one of his books again. I could have read the first and last paragraphs of this book and came away with the same premise, yet he repitiously restates his general distaste for computers in our educational community. He has some good points but no scientific basis for them. Mr. Stoll points out that a computer can't take the place of a good teacher. Yes, but a good teacher should know how to use a computer as a learning tool. Get off your pulpit Mr. Stoll, computers are a tool. We didn't go back to the abacus because we thought children would be corrupted by a calculator."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"In the introduction Stoll talks about how our Nation spends about three billion dollars a year to wire classrooms that is not needed. I hate to break it to him, but there is a lot of things that our Nation pays for that is not needed, and doesn't go towards a child's education. Let's keep what we get. I believe that whether we like it or not, computers are going to be our future. Not completely but to a great extent it's true. This generation of students does need to know how to use a computer and be familiar with everything that they can do. I guarantee that what ever a student ends up doing for the rest of their lives, it will involve a computer in some manner. Stoll needs to not spend so much time bashing the computer, but realize that there is nothing he or anyone else can do to change the fact of them. Maybe even try looking at it in a positive light. A computer in a classroom can only enhance learning, not take away from it. An educator should know when a computer is necessary to use and when it is not. Putting them in the classroom for fun isn't right, however using it as a educating tool is. Most classrooms have only one teacher to teach the entire class. Yes, it's been like this for many years, but times have changed and information is growing. An educator can teach the entire class a lesson and use technology to only help the students learn even more, perhaps in a fun way. Stoll mentioned that \\"technology promises shortcuts to higher grades and painless learning\\". Why shouldn't learning be painless? Since when is pain a good thing? If a student enjoys learning by having fun, they will want to keep learning. I think it's only helping them grow. This book pretty much just made me shook my head in amazement at the author. I don't know how one man can come up with so many theories about things as he did. How can you trash technology?"},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"First and foremost, I would like to say that this book was entirely different from anything I usually read. My expertise is usually limited to romance novels. However, I found that this book was, to my shock, an interesting read.As an education major, I did not agree with all of Stoll's arguments. He talked as though there should not be hands-on learning in education for a child. Believing in constructivism myself, I found this idea hard to grasp. I believe children need self expression and hands-on activities in order to more fully understand a topic or lesson that is being covered. This way, the activity gives the child more of a perspective instead of an idea that they read in a book.Also, I believe that computers are a benefit to society and the field of education. Educators and students alike have more time to learn since the knowledge is right at their fingertips. I think that they are worth every penny that you have to put into them to keep them up to date. All of the educational tools available should be accessible to a child for the purpose of education. I'm not saying that I think that lessons should be taught mainly through a computer, but I think that there is a happy medium and that computers should be used but not to excess. Stoll had the opposite opinion in that there was no use for computers in education.Overall, this book was an interesting outlook on computers and their use in education. Personally, the ideas Stoll mentioned never crossed my mind and wouldn't have if it weren't for this book."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"My review is on High Tech Heretic by Clifford Stoll. I found this book to be very interesting. I didn't realize how much time could be wasted by the computer. The author himself loves computers. He isn't against the use of computers, but to the extent that society uses them and depends on them. He pointed out several different points about computers being used in schools. My beliefs are like that of his. I don't think that schools should go completely computerized. Teachers are a crucial part of education. The point that he argued and I think any parent or teacher would agree is that children need human interaction in order to develop socially and emotionally. It is very important especially for small children to have interaction with their teachers as well as other students. If they are in front of a computer 24/24, then we have developed a socially innate individual. We have created a programmed species. More importantly as he pointed out in the book, psychologist did studies showing that prolonged use of computers resulted in individuals being lonelier and even showing increased signs of depression. What happened to the good old face to face chatting with friends? Something else he mentioned in the book was how you could get on the computer and lose track of time. I have done this and lost 2 or more hours of time without learning anything. This is time that I could've used to do something constructive or with purpose and meaning. Hopefully as the future nears, people will realize the importance of performing tasks with and without the computer. Our minds if educated are far more dependable than any computer could ever be. I really enjoyed this book and I would recommend it to anyone, especially if they have children in school, or are a frequent computer user."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"High-Tech Heretic ReviewEDUC 222-001/ Mr. SchackMelissa Wygant4-24-06When I first heard that we had to read this book, High -Tech Heretic I was personally skeptical. I thought this was just another book. written by some guy rattling on about technology and how it is taking over the world; needless to say after reading it my mind was changed.I found this book to be very insightful when it came to showing how far we have come in this day and age in regards to technology. I think one of the things that struck me most throughout my reading is the number of times that the author Clifford Stoll makes mention of how many school's are actually receiving large sums of money in order to equip the school and classroom with computers. It appears that through supplying each classroom with enough computers for each student that it reaches a point in which the teachers are no longer teaching the students, technology is.I think this book gives a very realistic view of the monopolizing power of which comes with the access of technology. In reading this book I was surprised to discover that libraries are being replaced, given that everything is being run on computers, there has become a less and less need for books because supposedly they take up too much room. My one concern is that when your data base crashes or something within the system fails to work, what then? Where have all the books gone, out the door into some storage facility that's where.There were a number of trivial things mentioned throughout this book but one thing that I felt was a little far fetched was introducing kindergarteners/elementary students to computers, because there is fear that if they don't start now they'll never catch up. I think that if there is fear that elementary students aren't becoming familiar with the functions of a computer early enough that's a sign that there is something wrong and not with the students but with the schools and the computer programmers.I agree with Clifford Stoll when he talks about there being too much emphasis on technology. But at the same time I agree that technology is a good thing when used responsibly. I don't believe that technology should replace teachers or their ability to teach a lesson. I recall one point in the book where Stoll mentions that a number of students were being taught elements of science and math through computer animated programs, and when asked how the formula or experiment works the student couldn't answer. All they saw were the pretty functions of the program illustrating the lesson but they didn't have a true understanding of the process or function of what was right in front of them.I think when it comes down to it; the internet/technology can be more helpful then not, in many cases, we just have to admit it. Through the internet you find that you can connect with people from across the world, maybe even on a significant level; you can find support from those experiencing the same illness as you or, something that a majority of America has an interest in, keeping track of their investments. All of these things and more are possible through the World Wide Web we just have to choose to take part in it without becoming too overwhelmed or feeling as if we are being sucked up into a huge vacuum of technology where there is no escape. In truth we choose our position when it comes to technology, we have to realize that in this day and age it's going to catch up to every single one of us; it's bound to happen, we just have to know how to approach it with precaution."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"I was not impressed while reading Clifford Stoll's 'High-Tech Heretic'. More than a book, I felt as if I was reading a compilation of other people's quotes and opinions, with interjections when Mr. Stoll felt the need to remark on the matter. He did however make some very interesting observations concerning the use of technology in schools. I myself did not encounter a computer in school until I was in the sixth grade but I cannot say much for computer use in schools today. Mr. Stoll is correct in believing that technology does not need to play as major of a role in education. And that the use of technology such as computers and especially power point presentations are more time consuming and less interesting.For the most part I can agree with Mr. Stoll and his ideas about technology in the classroom being time consuming and more of a hindrance than a help. The only area in which I disagree would be on the use of calculators. I was not required to have a calculator in class until I took trigonometry in my junior year of high school. I can quickly recall my times tables, have no problem doing long division, and can tell you what pi equals. Yet I recently took a pre-calculus course and found the calculator to be extremely useful in some instances. I only just completed a speech course in which citations were required, two of which had to be internet sources. I find no enjoyment in searching the World Wide Web looking for a credible source on my subject of interest. I would much rather write a report, citing twelve sources from books than to have to cite two internet sources.I trust that technology has its time and place, but perhaps the classroom is not it. Though it may be advancing and moving into our lives faster than some people would like; I do not get the feeling that technology is taking over in such a manner that libraries and teachers will slowly fade away. I am almost certain that those who are talking about making classrooms, teachers and libraries obsolete were educated in a classroom, with a flesh and blood teacher and went to the library for research. Shouldn't they then question each other on whether or not they can possibly be educated enough to be making these judgments about methods of learning?"},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"Within this book, Clifford Stoll agressively challenges modern technology and it's place within a classroom. He calls to question the sensical aspect of computers in education; disagrees with it and provides both facts and statistics to back his claim.Stoll states that computers cannot replace teachers. I definitely agree with that. There is a human interaction between teacher and student that cannot be replaced by a machine. I think that while computers will not replace teachers, they will make their jobs a little easier. Stoll also states that computers cause more problems than they solve. Ask anyone whose ever been typing a paper and had their computer lock up, they'll agree with him. Computers can be problematic but they also solve problems. Computers are used in a lot of medical technology that is used today. He argues that computers are costly. I totally agree with Stoll, they are pricey, but the benefits outweigh the monetary complaint.Stoll's book doesn't address the benefits of the Internet. It has been monumentally helpful to today's society in soo many ways. While it doesn't take the place of face to face interaction, it makes interaction possible for people that because of distance would otherwise be difficult.Stoll has done extensive research and this shows in his writing. It is much easier to respect an opinion that is well researched. While I don't agree with all the things that he said, I can understand his point of view because of all the evidence he presented.I believe that computers should be integrated into a classroom but they should never replace teachers. That human interaction that occurs face to face is vital to a child's developments. Technology should assist in education, not be the only form of education. It is meant to help further the learning process, not cause a screeching halt.Computers are TOOLS, not TEACHERS."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"If you are looking for praise of computers and the Internet in classrooms pick up any computer magazine, but if what you are searching for is an honest challenge of technology's false promises, I suggest you look to Clifford Stoll. In High Tech Heretic, this self-professed \`techie' takes a very critical (but not cynical) look at computers and education. As a future teacher myself, I concur with many of his comments, and must say that, after reading this book, approach computers with even more hesitation.So many people affiliated with schools today connect gizmos, classrooms, and fun in learning, with the claim that Computers are great motivators. Like Stoll, I disagree. You see, the will to move (motivation) must come from within, and computers just cause you to sit in one place. If classrooms become centered on an object, where's the interaction? The center of a classroom shouldn't be a thing-but a person: teacher-based, social-based, full of commitment and joy.This author illustrates what many of us know but are afraid to admit - computers substitute punching numbers for understanding concepts. Take calculators for example. Let's face it- they are nothing more than a crib sheet - trivializing mistakes, and undermining learning. As Stoll clearly shows us, there's no room for creativity. A real teacher could interpret many answers to \\"Seven equals?\\" which would be incomprehensible for any computer (3+4, days in a week, 10-3, # of dwarfs in Snow White, etc...). Scholarship isn't about browsing the net for answers, but rather interpreting our world.As one who is in the field of education for the \`AHA! Factor', I long to see that light bulb of understanding only personal interaction can bring forth. Technology puts limits on the classroom where, under different circumstances, a simple math problem could have grown into a discussion on language, science, history, etc. and that scares me.There's no shortcut to a quality education. Fast action is not a replacement for real reflection, and the quick answers promised by technology will serve only to dull questioning minds. Stoll points out how easy it is to mistake a familiarity with computers for intelligence. But many techno-savvy kids miss out on knowledge necessary to be well rounded.Look at social skills for instance. The way we communicate constrains how we interact. A computer can't teach you to get along with others-to read gestures, express feelings, etc. Stoll warns that the Internet today is quickly isolating kids, but what are we to do? Years from now, the ability to deal with people still won't be learned from a computer. Therefore, this author suggests limiting the time spent behind a keyboard. High Tech Heretic recommends we teach what a database does and where it's useful, but is careful to point out a difference between having an access to info, and interpreting it. Learning how to use a computer is mechanical-but critical thinking is crucial!In the end, this quest is one for balance-not an avocation for zero computers. While Clifford Stoll's point,in this book, was that it is perfectly possible to do well without high tech teaching devices, each of us will make our own choice. Personally, I believe whole-heartedly in the following reflection: \\"with or without a computer, a mediocre instructor will never kindle a love for learning, and a good teacher doesn't need the internet to inspire students to excellence.\\" But if you seem to be struggling with this concept of liberty, literacy, and where computers fit into it all I know I am far from the first person to advise, \\"...books and libraries are the best weapons we've got. Use them. Appreciate them. Support them.\\" I encourage everyone to pick up a copy of High Tech Heretic. Clifford Stoll's comical, commonsense approach to the subject will surely help you consider the costs."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"After reading Hi-Tech Heretic by author Clifford Stoll, I have made the obvious conclusion that he strongly disagrees with computers being the main point of education for the students in today's schools. He seems to strongly disagree with the fact that computers are what the world depends on as their mode of learning.He brings up the fact that putting computer systems in schools are costly, but all technology needed in the modern world can be costly. Without it I don't think that students could learn as much and teachers wouldn't be as well prepared to teach.Stoll's does seem to have researched intensely and has argued his points very well. But I believe the truth of the matter is that you shouldn't replace teachers in the class rooms with computers and other technology but use them to enhance the learning experience being done in the classroom.After considering all aspects of the book and the great effort that was put in to this controversial argument I give the book overall a 3 star rating. I don't necessarily agree with every point he makes but the book is comical and he does challenge you to think about different aspects of computer technology."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"The views expressed by Stoll in this book are something that I disagree with. Sure computers in school systems are costly, but with all the information that can be accessed and the tools that teachers can use to help with their lessons, not having computers in a classroom would be detrimental to the learning process.Even though Stoll's point is well argued and thoroughly researched, I still think his arguement is in vain. As an education major myself, I would be lost without computers in my future classroom. Lessons can be taught on powerpoint, and educational games (like jeopardy) can be played.While some critics say that a computer can never replace the nuturing of an actual human teacher. The counter point can be made is that a teacher can never obtain and remember all the information that a computer can. With the help of a computer, teachers will be able to liven up their lessons and spice up convential methods.The only way a computer can replace a teacher is if the teacher lets it. A good educator will use the computer as an 'accessory' to their teaching methods. While Stoll makes his point very well, it was still hard to convince me that he was right."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"In High Tech Heretic, Clifford Stoll challenges us to take a look at the computer from a different angle. To what lengths should we go to to incorporate these tools into the classroom and elsewhere?First and foremost, I give Stoll an A+ for writing in a manner we can all understand. He uses a conversational tone and an easy to understand vocabulary.Next, Stoll presents a very controversial argument very well, he has definitely done his research. My only problem is his tendancy to rant. Yes, this is entertaining, but it lacks logical appeal.And there are times that he seems to be a little harsh on the use of computers. I think there is a place for computers in the classroom. I don't believe it should be to the extent of some of his examples, but surely he realizes his examples are the exception, not the norm.One last thing, he throws in this anti-calculator thing, which makes you think he is insane if you've ever tried to figure sine, cosine, and tangent without one.All in all, however, I gave this book four stars because it is full of ideas most of us have never considered and it's always good to stretch the mind. If that doesn't convince you to read it, then I'll promise you it's funny, how's that?"},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"Clifford Stoll bravely challenges our world of technology and computers in the classroom in his book High-Tec Heretic. He questions the practicality of computers in our modern world, backing it up with common sense explanations, along with facts and statistics. Clifford Stoll has convinced me. Society cannot continue to constantly rely on computers, especially through education.First of all, it is extremely costly to overload a classroom with computers. Then add up the other expenses. Software companies have made it impossible for the computer to solely run off one single piece of software. If you buy one anti-virus program, you have to buy another. And then there are the upgrades to replace the outdated that no longer work on your PC. Once you get your software updated, chances are it's time to replace the computer's hard drive. The computer world has created software and shortened the life span of computers solely for the business and market of our capitalistic economy. In addition to costs, staff and technicians have to be hired to maintain all of this. So does the school system really have the funds to cover these expenditures? Shouldn't they be spending them on other things like a science lab to help the students understand the material through hands on activities, rather than mere computer simulations?Second, Clifford Stoll argues why the book is better than the PC. He says that a book is \\"universally accessible, easily stored, immediately readable, and completely portable\\" (163). What's more, a book allows the student to dig deep into the subject matter. Often on the internet, sites offer similar facts on a subject. It is hard to find a web page where the creator takes as much time to explore the subject as much as an author of a research book did. Most of the web page creators condense information out of books anyways. You're cheating yourself by using the internet for thorough research. During my freshman year of high school, my class went through a computer trial program, where we paid a certain amount of money to use a school laptop for the year. My Biology class provided me with a textbook and a CD-ROM, complete with pages read out-loud and a computerized glossary. Which one did I use the most? Although the CD-ROM was lighter, I used the book. It's concrete. Staring at a computer screen hurts your eyes, forcing you to scan over the material rather than reading in between the lines. Sadly to say, that trial program was a bust.Lastly, the internet chat rooms, email, and web pages are perhaps preparing the next generation as social illiterates. Instead of creating deep and meaningful relationships, immersed in social interaction, the internet creates weak based friendships. Great, I can't wait until I'm taught by a virtual professor.A short review barely gives Clifford Stoll's work justice. My statements above are nearly my own opinion branched from his. He statistically and logically explores every end of the computer spectrum. If you haven't already read this book, read it. Even if you believe computers are our world's greatest technological advancement, Clifford Stoll will help you look at all angles of technology, and not just its convenience."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"In a world where technology is thought to be a must, in that, every home, school and business should have a computer and Internet service, Clifford Stoll enlightens our views of technology being integrated into our lives. According to Stoll in his book, High-Tech Heretic, technology is only as useful as the person operating it. He describes the pro's and con's of technology being used in our world. With the push for technology to be integrated into our schools it is easy to become obsessed with the idea that this could be the answers to a child lacking the knowledge to make good grades. He encourages us to ask these questions. \\"What problems are solved by bringing the Internet into every school? and, \\"What problems might be created when we spend even more time connected to electronic devices\\"(xv). His view is that effective teachers are the answers to the lacking knowledge in our youth and that computers are not the answers to that problem, but computers can enhance learning when used appropriately. Another view that he pointed out is how useful are computers in the occupational world. Of course there are jobs that require the use of technology but many have minimal need for technology. He uses a plumber as an example. How much will computers or technology help him fix pipes? Is using a computer that important with this occupation? In a world where the knowledge of computers is stressed we are indeed limiting some individuals. He adds, \\"When every student-good and bad- is pressed to become a computer maven, and only the incompetents are allowed to become plumbers, neither our programs nor our pipes will hold water\\" (123). Computers are a useful tool and because our society has become so dependent of them, it is easy to see the up side of the computer and hard to see the down side, however, we must remember that computers do not replace intelligence; they only, in most cases, make it a little easier."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"Stoll makes the argument that technology in schools is not where money needs to be spent. In lieu of spends millions on the implementation of technology the schools or more over the children would be better severed if those funds where spend on such things as teacher pay raises to entice better teachers. Stoll's view is a break from the norm when it comes to technology in schools. I would agree that a computer will never replace the teachers in the classroom but I do believe that software will replace the traditional textbook. As a teacher and network technician in the school district I see the good and bad side of technology in the schools. Phase 1 of the technology roll out in the public school in Kentucky cost the state about 800 million. Much of that 8000 million dollar investment is out dated and needs replacing. I believe technology education in the school is very important in today's society so are teachers. We need higher pay to get more educated people interested in the teaching field.Information is power and the best tool to use to organize information is a pc. We need to train our students how to effectively use the pc to make them marketable in today's workforce. What is the role of the school? I believe it is to prepare the students for life. Teaching them to think is the most important tool we can arm them with. The ability to manipulate technology is only a small part of the overall education of the students."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"I found the book High-Tech Heretic by Clifford Stoll to be very informative and one that brought up a lot of topics that many people have failed to think about as our society becomes more computerized. It was great to see a person who has made their living off of computers to honestly question whether the computers are actually providing more good than harm. The thing about this book is that almost everything Mr. Stoll discusses about the harmful effects computers sometimes have on education makes sense. For example, he discusses how some schools are relying on computer programs more than textbooks and how a textbook can last anywhere around ten years or longer while a computer is usually outdated within five years and that it doesn't have the lasting value like the textbook. He also discusses how people become more isolated as they spend more time on their computers which contributes to loneliness and depression. His main focus is his best though and that is that computers should mainly be kept out of the classroom because they keep children from getting the skills they will need most in society which are trust, the ability to get along with other people, creativity, and the ability to speak in front of a group of people. I highly recommend this book to anyone, but I especially recommend it to education administrators to read before they make a decision to spend thousands of dollars on computers instead of raising pay for quality teachers and purchasing text books."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"I found the High Tech Heretic full of arguments about the benefit verses the cost of integrating technology into the classroom. Stoll sets out to push his readers to think about what our children are gaining from the Technological Age that is sweeping our nation. He describes easy access to the Internet not as beneficial to students but as holding children back from their full potential. He feels that exposure to masses of information will not create a love for knowledge but instead create lazy students that don't think beyond the web page staring them in the face. His book is full of witty observations based mostly on his own opinions. Although I agree with Stoll's basic argument that computers are overly valued as an educational tool I disagree with his overzealous ideology about the harmful affect easy access to the Internet will have on intelligent learners. I also disagree with his belief about the lack of benefits of computer education to children.Too much emphasis is placed on the importance of technology in the classroom. Many a brilliant mind was created before access to the web; however, the benefits to accessing information in seconds or communication with other students around the world cannot be overlooked. The Internet has narrowed our global community allowing students to actually see and talk to their counterparts around the world. We can spend a week or two writing research papers instead of months. Instead of thumbing through books or having to drive from library to library looking for relevant materials, students can type in a question or two and within minutes have access to more data than they ever dreamed possible. True, this data must be screened for accuracy and correct content but it saves time and frustration to be able to access it from home or at a local library instead of searching for weeks for the exact information needed for a project.As educators we must find the correct balance between convenience and hands on research. Technology is only going to become more and more important to students. It is up to teachers to create a beneficial mix of technological and hands on education. The cost of technology may be high but I believe in the end, the benefits will outweigh the cost."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"Stoll makes many excellent points about the role computers should (and should not) play in education, but the meat of his argument is served in a thick and inedible sauce of rambling, bitchy, and self-indulgent abuse that demeans Stoll and devalues his book.The pity of Stoll's descent into geek rant is that he does lay out several simple truths that need to be said more often: Computers cannot replace human teachers. Computers can cause more problems than they solve. Schools which take money away from buying books (or hiring teachers) in order to buy computers hurt their students. K-12 education can be done at least as well without computers as with them. Learning cannot always be fun. Fun, educational computer programs are often more fun than educational, and usually do not require the kind of hard work and critical thinking that are essential to learning.I agree wholeheartedly with Stoll about these things and I am glad he has written them, but the symbolic methods that he uses in the process are dreadful. Stoll attacks and ridicules almost every person he disagrees with, preferring to paint them as evil rather than understand their arguments. His book is rampant with gaps in reasoning and flaws in logic. Another thing I noticed in his book is that even when Stoll used quotes from other people he rarely offered a citation of the authors' work, which makes it difficult to study the issues he raises in greater depth."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"Career iconoclast Stoll offers a number of tongue-in-cheek insights on the direction of adult education in an emerging age of instantaneous information. Far from embracing the popular notion that laptops will ultimately replace textbooks in that oft-envisioned \\"classroom of the future,\\" Stoll instead suggests that textbooks will always have an edge over the garden-variety laptop. Yes, schools can update laptops with current information, but one can leave a textbook unattended at the Laundromat for more than two minutes. A textbook can survive the ungentle peanut butter-smeared fingers of preschool life. The cost of having to infuse teachers with software training and the ability to troubleshoot tends to overshadow the raw talent of actually _teaching._ Stoll confidently predicts massive wastes of money on poorly-designed software and buggy programs at quadruple the cost of obtaining next year's edition of a textbook. While Stoll acknowledges the needs of today's educators to do more to engage the enthusiasm of the Nintendo-addicted learner, superficial entertainment doesn't offer the same quality of memory retention as writing, editing, and rewriting an essay. Stoll also predicts massive symptoms of distractibility in an age where young students may well know ten times more about software applications and the World Wide Web than their racing-to-catch-up teachers. \\"The Internet doesn't necessarily empower,\\" he notes, \\"it enfeebles.\\" Stoll also unloads plenty of vitriol on the manufacturers of PowerPoint and its non-Microsoft analogues: in just one generations, he laments, oral presenters have gone from fiery to fumbling -well thought-out anecdotes and thought-provoking lectures are replaced by dry, uninspired animated bullet points, familiar mumbled apologies for audio-visual goof-ups, and the same fifty or so pieces of stock Microsoft clip art. Dancing logos offer no replacement for zeal or creativity. Audiences must _connect_ with speakers in order to retain the message: if all they're doing is watching a show and following along on the \\"audience handout\\" printouts, then there can be no connection. An excellent \\"alternative view\\" resource for _anyone_ setting up a course syllabus on any subject."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"The more I read this book, the more that I began to understand what it was about and the more I began to agree with Stoll.Stoll gives many good reasons to question the significance of computers in the classroom. Stoll challenges using computers in public schools because of the high cost, and the low benefits from it. Stoll also talks about technology in general.Stoll talks about what is wrong with computer learning in our society, by questioning every aspect of computing, especially the computer use in public schools.Stoll, however does not hate computers, he just hates how they are misused in schools. Cliffors Stoll is upset about how much money is being wasted on technology, that is used for the wrong reason.I feel that this book is a really interesting book that teaches alot.

The never ending argument on whether computers are a good idea to have in ever classroom where chrildren can be distracted or use them for useful endeavors. Clifford Stoll did not want computers in the classroom for many reasons, one being that it would harm the development of certain social skills of children in their younger years. It is very addicting to play games and surf the web. Could it really be that dangerous though to allow a child some recreational time on a computer, especially if it is for a school project, it would definatly help out the librarian, that is for sure.

Mr. Stoll is right on target. We as humans are going to need another hand to grasp hold of our laptops. The two hands that we have are needed to hold our water bottles and our cell phones. I agree that there are to many computers in the classrooms. Teachers are using them as crutches. How easy is it to put a difficult student on the computer all day and not have to deal with them.Teachers are learning to depend on computers to teach children how to read and to do math, however the students are not learning the fundamentals of reading and math. A personal touch is needed to teach. Passion and emotions are needed to teach properly.All schools are trying to get more computers in their classrooms, isn't is nice to advertise that your school has computers so their students are that much smarter. New test results are showing that scores are not increasing but they are staying bordreline. Personally I think that there are to many extra classes, teachers need to stick to the basics.How can students be creative when the computer does their thinking for them, and their imaginations are already preprogrammed by the pictures on the computer. Students need to feel art, not just look at it on the screen. Textures need to be felt along with colors.I feel along with Mr. Stoll that there is a place for computers, like for information, reference and record keeping. Please keep children as young as possible for as long as possible. Hide and seek is no fun playing with the computer."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"In the book High-Tech Heretic, the author, Mr. Clifford Stoll, enlightened me to several points about computers that I had previously never entertained. It shocked me to learn that children enrolled in Pre-school and Kindergarten classes are expected to take keyboarding classes. Another well thought out point is, why do things on the computer that you can do for real. For example, dissecting frogs; why dissect a frog on the Internet, when you can dissect the frog for real in a biology lab. I also agree with Mr. Stoll's idea that we, as teachers, sometimes give the students an assignment that deals more with computers, than with the subject the student is signed up to learn. Take Language Arts for example, the student will sometimes spend more time downloading that perfect picture from clip-art, than actually working on the paper in which that picture is to go.However, I feel that Mr. Stoll would not recommend that computers be taught in high schools across this country. Ladies and Gentleman, to many it is a foregone conclusion, that in order to be successful in today's world of work, one must know how to operate a computer in some capacity. I feel that it is our responsibility as educators to teach our students the basics of computers. If we teach our students the basics of Microsoft Office, they will in all likelihood, have a strong enough foundation in computers in which to enter the workforce.This book is a good read, weather you be a computer junkie (and think the computer was put on Earth to save us all), or a computing novice (who thinks that the computer is simply the devil), this book is very well-written and extremely well-thought out, and could possibly allow one change his/her opinion of computers."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"Michelle Tanner, an \\"elementary education major\\", has this to say about the book:\\"The story in the book that I disagree most with is the one titled 'Calculating Against Calculators'.

Against familiarity with numbers. Against acquiring an understanding of algebra.' Sorry to state the obvious but some math cannot be done by certain people without a calculator.\\"This book was a definate [sic] waste of my time and a waste of paper and ink.

They will give you more information than the people who gave it five stars, but without any reasoning.Clifford Stoll suffers from a disorder of extremes. He has some good ideas, but he carries them too far to the extreme, and ruins them. Yes, there are many detractions to using computers in schools. Yes, computers are often used wrongly in schools. That does not maen that computers do not belong in schools (as he would have you think), rather it means that computers need the proper application. They are a tool, and like all tools, can be used in many ways. Murder can be committed with an axe, this does not mean that axes should be removed from the face of the earth. Rather, that is a bad application of a good tool.The only chapter I really agreed with Mr. Stoll was the chapter regarding laptops, and even then he lost my support. He's right, laptops do not have much of a place in the K-12 school system. He then criticizes a college that gave laptops to all incoming freshmes, which is poor thinking on his part. I attended a college that provided laptops to all incoming freshman, and that laptop was a boon to my educational experience.Like many authors with a point with little supporting evidence, Mr. Stoll only quotes people who support his views, or people that support technology in a foolish way, so that he can tear apart their argument. Someone with solid supporting facts could defend every argument that Stoll makes against computers. This book just is not worth reading.I would like to add a point made by a classmate in the graduate class for which I had to read this book: Stoll states many facts, and quotes many individuals, yet he never provides in-text citation, or a bibliography/resource page. How is the reader to verify his facts? How is the reader to determine if the person quoted really made the statements he attributed to them? How is the reader to determine if quotes were taken out of context? How is the reader to determine whether Stol made the whole thing up? Those things are undeterminable, which ruins any credibility Stoll might have had."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"I have to admit this wasn't one of my favorite reads but it was inciteful and it offered alot of new information to me about computer literacy. The author (clifford Stoll) seemed to disagree with the usage of computers in the classroom but it is obvious in our technology advanced world that students of all ages should be exposed to computers, it is becoming an essential life skill.Although i believe in classroom usage of computers, I also believe that over exposure to computers is prevalant in today's kids. Too many kids want to play video games all day or let the computer do their work for them, this will lead to lazy and fat kids. We need to teach our kids how to effectively use a computer and not use it as a crutch or life support.All in all this book is a good book for aspiring educators and anyone interested in computer literacy. Be careful though, this book tends to become somewhat dull and redundant."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"Clifford Stoll's High Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian starts off his book by asking, Am I the only one scratching my head over the relentless invocation of the clich? \\"computer literacy,\\" and goes on to give the example of a grocery story clerk operating some basic computer technology. The question that the situation gives way to, and the most basic underlying meaning of the entire series of essays is: what is computer literacy, the value of the skills necessary to be deemed computer literate, and the role those skills play in the classrooms within our schools?Stoll conveys the message that hands on experience is much more beneficial in teaching children than that any sort of computer program. Computer programs are two dimensional, because it's simply a matter of figuring out which buttons to click opposed to thinking critically to solve problems. Watching butterflies and typing a report of observations, he notes, is much more beneficial than downloading statistics off of the internet. The assertion is made that computers can't teach application in the real world, they can't interact with students, and they cannot make learning fun. Computers give what Stoll calls \\"automatic answers,\\" but this only raises the question: what good is data without the knowledge behind it?I think his essays are relevant for teachers in society. Computers are important if you use them the right way. They must realize that computers are not substitutions for teaching students to think creatively about problems and find solutions without finding what someone else has said or studied online. I think it's true that teachers often use computers as a crutch; the skills they learn on a computer or more closely related to video games than anything that could of use in the real world. Being computer literate is as easily as surf the web in today's society and it doesn't take much teaching for someone to be able to accomplish that. Until computers are used in a meaningful way they have no place replacing conventional teaching methods.That having been said, I think that the way in which it was presented made it hard to read. The language is clear and concise but the length of the book was absurd for the subject matter. The book is, as mentioned before, in essay form and it's very hard to read over two hundred pages on essays with very closely related subject matter. Each new segment was filled with situations and analogies form the author, but the meaning behind them was virtually the same.Overall, I feel that it is a relevant book and can see the necessity of teacher's hearing what the author had to say. The computer skills taught are minimal and have little to do with preparing kids for life in the \\"real world.\\" The book was a little boring at times, and definitely one-sided, but society needs to acknowledge the computers are not being used in the schools to prepare for work, but are misused."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"The book High - Tech Heretic written by Clifford Stoll was about the effect of computers in the classrooms. It gives you a look at what would happen if we placed computer software into our classrooms. It shows you that even though everyone believes computers would be a positive thing to place in a room full of children that's not always true. He allows you to see the other side of things. The book takes into consideration of getting rid of the classroom books and replacing them with a classroom set of computers. He explains that computers would be more expensive and that they will also become out of date with in 3 years. Clifford explains that computers may be full of up to date information, but within a few years they can no longer be used to find that information. He also says that children get extremely up set with computers because they can't use the things they want to. Most of the time computers in a classroom are donated to the school for a tax write off or some other reason. A computer company no longer uses this set of computers for the same reason that a school child doesn't want to use it. They can't use certain software, they ware to slow, don't have enough memory and many other reasons. The children get up set and encore the computer or worse tear it up. There are many reasons in this book why a computer full of classrooms wouldn't be a good thing if you are a believer that computers are the answer to most things then maybe you should take a look inside of this book."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"Before reading this book, I was a firm believer that computers could do nothing rather than help users. However, upon finishing the book, I have found that I now have a much different opinion. The author talks about computers taking away the aesthetic beauty in art and making it more like robotic art in a sense. I couldn't agree more. Computers do not have personalities or emotions so they most definately cannot show such things through work people have done on them. I still feel that computers are very important when dealing with statistics, math, things that need to be done precisely (geometric shapes, measurements, etc.) and that without computers many tasks would be extremely difficult. But, like the author, I dont think computers are needed for everything. I believe there should remain a line between what humans can do and what computers can do. People shouldn't become so dependent on computers that they feel it is an absolute necessity and they can't live without their PC."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"Clifford Stoll's High Tech Heretic is a refreshing, and a practical reflection of the overemphasized use of technology in the classroom. From preschoolers to college students Stoll describes the impractical ways technology has weasled itself into our nation's classroom.As a mother and a student, nearing the completion of my degree in Early Childhood Education, I find myself to be Stoll's #1 fan of the book. I can relate to the examples of inappropriateness of computers Stoll gives in the chapter \\"CRT for Tots.\\" I was recently horrified at my youngest son's kindergarten registration. During his screening I was asked what computer skills he attains. I gasped and began to reply that he could count to 20, hop on one foot, snap his pants, and loved to play and explore with his friends. Does that count for anything? Their response was a forced half smile and suggested certain software programs that I could work with him on this summer so he could \\"catch-up.\\" What about hands on learning activities, exploring, and building on children's acquired knowledge to enhance learning?It was refreshing to find that someone, whose career is based on technology, could also see the negative aspects that too much technology can bring to the classroom. Stoll provides detailed examples of how technology in the classroom has limited students' innovation and creativity. Stoll's chapter on \\"Makes Learning Fun\\" is also a powerful and insightful message of how technology's \\"fluff\\" has disintegrated our society's learning process.Although, somewhat over the top, Stoll provides insightful detailed information on the importance of a \\"traditional\\" classroom; one that consists of textbooks,exploring, problem solving, and teacher-student interaction that help develop our children into unique individuals and not multitudes of \\"computer mavens.\\""},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"I like this guy!

Even though the whole book mainly contains Stoll's own views along with many other people's view's he is not claiming he has all the answers or that it is all truthful. He does however end the book in a very interesting way. The last chapter is a flashback to a point in Stoll's life where he walks the reader through a point in his life that has actually happened. This is the only part of the book that he claims is the truth."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"It was promised between November 16 - 19.

She desperately needs it for a class and could not find it any where locally. She did not wait until the last minute. Her finals, which will include material on this book, begin on December 10. Unless it arrives this week, I wasted my time and money. It won't help her."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"Though I agree with some of what Stoll says on technology in the classroom, I feel he needs to update his book to reflect current trends and new thoughts on the subject of technology. This book was published in 2000, which was 11 years ago. There are so many new and exciting devices out there now; I wonder how he would feel about these new tools. For example, the Smartboard, which is a wonderful tool for the classroom and/or the iPad, which can be extremely useful for those children with special needs.When he speaks of using calculators in the classroom he did gain a point from me. I have always felt that calculators have ruined our younger children due to the fact that they no longer can work multiplication facts in their head, and sad to say many cannot complete simple addition or subtraction without the aid of a calculator now. They have learned how to punch in numbers and use the calculators, but they have missed out on the actual concepts being taught and how to incorporate them into our daily lives.I think that there needs to be an even balance of technology in the classroom. Stoll sees a need for a complete separation of technology and education. He connects poor teaching skills with the use of computers/technology in the classroom. I see this as he is stating that if there is a bad teacher in a school system it's only because of the computers in their room - take the computer out of their room and they will miraculously change into teacher of the year! If a teacher is ineffective, then it doesn't matter if they use computers or not they will always be ineffective until they themselves decide to change. A computer is only a tool, it does not have a mind of it's own and cannot control what happens in the classroom.Stoll does make many interesting points on how our schools monies are being poured into technology and is it truly affecting a successful gain in the knowledge of our students. You have to sit and wonder would our school's money be better spent on books instead of software and technology. These items become outdated so quickly these days. It seems that in weeks the newest and fastest processor out there is obsolete and a better one is on the rise. This process will lead to the school system being stuck with a surplus of useless equipment and having depleted their money supply, unable to keep up with the new technology. I think that school systems want to keep up with the \\"Jones\\" per say and should instead look at what will truly benefit the students. Whether it is newer textbooks or possibly more field trips for hands on experience, I do agree that technology is not always the answer.Overall, this is a very interesting read and really gets your wheels turning. This would be good for anyone interested in education to read. The chapters being short and Stoll's humor helps to make this an easy read."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"Clifford Stoll makes some incredibly good points in his book, \\"High Tech Heretic\\". We are in the computer age, and it does effect the schools and education. But, how much will computers be able to enhance education? In his introduction, Stoll says, \\" ...I wish to make our technology world better suited for people, rather than people better suited for machines\\". In is important for future educators to realize that computer programs are no substitute to teaching with hands on objects such as real disections and looking through a real telescope.Stoll's book becomes very cynical and redundant towards the end of the book. I would read a chapter, and think that I had already read it earlier in the book.Although Clifford Stoll works in the technical world, he is cynical of the advances technology has allowed in society. While he attacks the idea of computers in the classroom, he hasn't mentioned the positive aspects of at least making sure students are computer literate. With computer technology, health care and diagnosis of diseases has vastly improved compared to only a few decades ago. If students only learn the basics on computers, they are beginning the preparations to one day create better technology. With this said, I believe the core content is the most important to teach in the classroom. Students need to learn to read, and know math before they are taught computer literacy.Overall, this is a good book for future educators to read. It show not everything can or should be taught with computers. The best learning someone can do is by participating, and students cannot participate to the full extent with simulations alone. Computers should be in the classroom to enhance learning, not to be the basis or center of the classroom."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"I found the book \\"High- Tech Heretic\\" by Clifford Stoll to be very informative for a future educator. It offers many valid points to ponder when considering using technology in the classroom. However, Stoll is not against technology in the classroom, he is just cautious as to how much is used and in what form. For example, in his book he states, \\"When I teach astronomy to sixth graders, I start with an evening under the stars, not by passing out floppy disks with crammed with Hubble Space Telescope images.\\" The man point that Stoll makes in the book is that students learn more through real life, hands on experiences rather then sitting in front of a computer screen.I think that it is pertinent that educators read this book because it battles with the idea that lectures and presentations \\"have to be exciting\\" and that by using computers and technology in the classroom it makes learning fun. Stoll argues that students may have fun by using more technology in the classroom but that they aren't really learning. This is a compelling argument that all teachers should look into so that they can make their own judgment call on using technology in their classroom.I consider myself to be computer literate but not necessarily to be a \\"computer person.\\" For this reason I was fearful that this book would not hold my attention and I would not be able to finish it. However, I found this book to be very interesting and I enjoyed Stoll's humor through out the book. It is an easy read and not difficult to understand at all. I walked away from the book feeling like I had a better understanding of using technology in the classroom and also how other teachers use and misuse technology in the classroom."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"High Tech Heretic makes some good points, but overall I wasn't terribly impressed. Stoll bashes the teaching and use of computers in school, but in today's world it is essential to learn more than just basic word processing and database management. Nearly every job requires more extensive knowledge than that.Also, internet use by younger kids is on the rise, and it's important for parents and teachers to be aware of what their children are looking at and who they are talking to and to be open to new concepts and developments. If kids learn to put the internet to good use, it can greatly enhance their education and quality of life.One thing I do agree with Stoll about is the fact that learning is not always fun. Learning is hard work and it takes time and effort. A computer can't make you learn, but in some cases it can help. I would never give a child a calculator early in their education to learn simple addition and subtraction, but after they developed solid foundational skills and moved on to more complicated work like calculus and trig, I would allow it.Computers do have a place in today's classroom, and I think it is very important for children to learn to use computers and the internet safely and to their advantage. But computers should never take the place of teachers, and I don't belive we will ever let that happen."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"In the book, High-Tech Heretic, Clifford Stoll argues whether or not the classroom is an appropriate place for computers. Throughout the book, he has many supporting facts and endless information on this subject, as a reader one can tell he really knows his stuff. He brought up the fact that teachers are irreplaceable by technology. Students need the one on one personal interaction they get from a teacher. Teachers lose their jobs often, to allow for new technology which will become obsolete in a matter of a few years. Is losing valuable teachers worth the new technology? Stoll discusses the fact that many schools cut music and art programs to fund computer labs. When schools do this, they are solving one problem, but creating another. It is very important for students to receive an education in the arts, as well as in academics. He also states that many schools down-size libraries to make room for new \`up to date' technology.He also points out something that many of us are guilty of. I am sure we all, at least once, have sat down at a computer, and gotten up hours later, to wonder where the time went. Computers can become a distraction in the classroom as well. Stoll also states that no technology is a replacement for the \`hands on' experience students get from art projects, science experiments and working out math problems. In most cases, students can grasp ideas better when they are able to actually get involved, hands on.Personally, I wasn't a big fan of this book. I respect the writer's opinion and agree with most of it, but just really had a hard time \\"getting into\\" the book. As a reader, you can tell he is passionate about this subject and tries to supply the reader with all of the information. Although this book was full of valuable knowledge, it seemed to be a little repetitive, and drug out."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"Kayla HallEDUC 222 Section 1In Read High-Tech Heretic : Reflections of a Computer Contrarian by Clifford Stoll he states that computers shouldn't be a center of education. He does not think that teachers should instruct all the time using power point and/or the computer, because it takes to much time and can be boring. I agree with Stoll to a certain extent, I know that sometimes just looking at a power point everyday and having someone read it to you is really boring. As a future instructor I want my students to have fun and listen to what I have to say and no worry about what the computer is doing.On the other had I believe that technology is our future and probably before we know it computers are going to do everything, so I believe that students should be aware of how to operate computers. But overall I really enjoyed this book, and I think that he had some good points but I think that he could put more about what he thinks in there other than what everyone else thinks. I highly recommend this book to every student that enjoys computers."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"High-Tech Heretic by Clifford Stoll is an interesting and entertaining book written by a man who spent many long hours on computers, and yearned for a wider discussion over the claims and promises of computing. Some would consider him a computer nerd. Stoll loved computers, but always wanted to know more about them. He considered him self skeptical. Stoll felt computers were taking over classroom education and that they shouldn't be used in classrooms. He states that English teachers must deal with semiliterate students itching to play with computers who can't read a book, due to parents buying electronic machines for their children, anticipating their kids getting head starts. Stoll railed about computers in classrooms, \\"Like a calculator, they give students the answers, instead of teaching them to think.\\" Stoll sometimes gets carried away and exaggerates too much. His arguments are little extreme, yet really funny. That's what makes this book as good as it is. His stories and tales of himself and his relationships with others are captivating. Exaggerating helps him to get his point across. I really like the statement that Stoll made when he said, \\"you get what you pay for, most of what you get free on the net is junk, and you can't have fast, cheap and good all together.\\" Most people get excited thinking that everything they want to know or get is on the net. This is true, but one must be careful because not all the information on the net is credible and true. After all, anybody can design a website.\\"Disguised as efficiency machines\\" Stoll states, in fact \\"these digital time bandits steal our lives and undermine our communities.\\" And if anybody knows computers, Stoll does. He had been programming and using computers since 1960. Stoll claims that computers can't provide a richer or better life. Stoll is also known as the author of Silicon Snake Oil and The Cuckoo's Egg. Stoll is known for an entertaining writer with sensible approaches and this is something I would have to agree on."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"High-Tech Heretic: A ReviewBy Eva MangunWhen you think about reading a book that is anti-technology you usually assume that the only people who would hold such views are granola-eating hippie types. In the case of High-Tech Heretic, the author Clifford Stoll happens to be pro-technology. In his words, \\"My skepticism grows from a love for computing, from a wish to make our technological world better suited for people...\\" His concern is that people are not carried away in thinking that technology will be some kind of answer for every problems.In the first half of this book, Stoll challenges the benefits that we think would come from having computers in the classrooms. While this subject is at high risk for being an enormous bore, Stoll keeps the reading interesting by adding in constant commentary, metaphors, and stories along with very interesting statistics that make this book interesting. Topics like \\"The American obsession with technology\\" Becomes \\"Looney for Laptops\\" and \\"The Economics of Information\\" becomes \\"Junk Food and the Internet.\\"Mr. Stoll discusses subjects like \\"The Arrogance of the Techies\\", he cost of online classrooms, the problems of hypertext that cause it to be difficult to read for any length of time. He also discusses social development problems children might have if their entire education was provided online, excluding interaction time with other people.Although he agrees that computers do have some educational value, for the most part most part, in his mind, education is not just supposed to be a fun computer game. At least, if you want to get a good education that has value and worth, you are going to have to work hard for it. It is not going to be sunshine and flowers, a joy the entire time. He also spends a lot of his time reminding his audience to be cautious about how much they believe about what people say technology can cure. For example, Al Gore is quoted saying that in 1993 \\"In the next decade, it will be possible for an elementary school student to come home after class and instead of playing Nintendo, plug into the library of congress.\\" This may be true, but weather or not the library of congress is online, or any resource for that matter is not the problem, and he discusses these issues in detail.While he has a lot of good points, there is one fault I find with the book. His stories and commentaries do help the flow of the book and make it interesting, but there are parts of it that get completely off the subject, and discuss things that the reader does not care about. He spends an entire chapter on a story of a time when he walked across a balancing beam over part of an abandoned grain mill which was highly dangerous.He should have been more precise. You should not spend four pages on a point that could be made in a sentence. Despite this, however, he has done an excellent job with this book and I think that most readers would enjoy this book."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"High-Tech Heretic Recieves TWO Thumbs Up!!High-Tech Heretic is an awesome book, I agree with Clifford Stoll as he is the one who loves computing and the Internet argues that the educational benefits of computers in schools are few and far between because of the false information from the Internet makes the students believe everything they see online and who is there to tell them how to evaluate an internet source. NO ONE be cause they don't ask their selves if it is credible, so the Internet is making our children more susceptible to believing anything. Making the computer less of a reliable source.Stoll also discusses \\"The Hidden Price of Computers\\" where it is discussed that as technology progresses in the future the more and more recently the computers in the schools have to be updated because they have to be up-to-date!! All this money could be used for a better component than updating the computer, heck give the teachers a raise. It isn't the computers teaching the students it is the underpaid teachers that teach them and if it wasn't for the educated teachers, no student would know everything that they do know about a computer without the teacher. Get Rid of a Computer that is assessable by the student in every classroom and have a computer lab if a computer in the school is necessary like for typing but go back to the books and magazines where most of them are credible anyway.In closing, Stoll's long experience gives him the right to say that computers are a waste of time and if you put a laptop in every kids lap they will be playing games instead of listening to the teacher, or \\"surfing the Internet\\" were it makes the students susceptible to the unreal and pornographic stupidness that is fulling up are nation. Clifford Stoll raises my attention to the unimportance of the computer in the class room and the hidden charges behind the computer. TWO THUMBS UP TO STOLL!!"},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"I found the book High-Tech Heretic by Clifford Stoll to be a breath of fresh air; I agreed with about everything that he had to say. I really think that computers in schools can be a good thing but they are really overused. High-Tech Heretic discusses how overused computers are in the classrooms and how books are becoming a thing of the past due to computer usage. He also discusses how knowing how to work computers is becoming priority, if you are computer illiterate you are in trouble. Stoll also brings up the fact that there is a high demand for children to read and be great readers, but we are sticking computers with educational software in the faces of our children and that is cutting down on the reading of children. I can definitely see that, if a teacher is constantly giving the children games to play on the computer they are going to cut down on the reading aspects of learning. Another thing that I really liked was when Stoll mentioned that people thought that it was cheaper to have computers instead of books. I really don't see how people can really think that way, he talked about the up keep of computers and how cables and cords can get lost and become more costly. I got a computer not even a year ago and I got a virus, had to get it fixed and it cost me $45.00. I even had an anti virus on my computer and still got the virus. I think that a lot of unplanned costs can arise when owning a computer. Stoll discusses how old computers were put to use, he said that the computers were given to schools and were never really used. When computers are out dated they are really not usable, they just don't work right and are more of a pain. Overall I thought that this book was an interesting read. He discusses many things that I felt the same about, it is really good to know that there are other people that think that computers are overuses in classrooms and there are other ways that children can learn."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"High-Tech Heretic : Reflections of a Computer Contrarian by Clifford StollReview By: Amber Hillerman, (Pikeville, KY)Need a reality check? For those of you, who think computers and software programs are the answer to all societal and educational problems, beware. Clifford Stoll \\"brings it on,\\" if you will. He questions whether libraries and books will become irrelevant in the near high-tech future. Even though I firmly believe that computers and other forms of technology will not overtake the use of books in the classroom, Stoll makes some enticing arguments for the opposition.Currently, computers and books co-exist together, so why can't this continue? The author raises some important issues concerning the rise of computers in today's classrooms and whether technology-bound classrooms are even necessary. In \\"A Question of Balance\\" he points out that computers are especially not needed in kindergarten milieus by stating \\"...a child does not need (to do) research in kindergarten, nor write compositions.\\" This may be true, however, I do not entirely agree with him on this subject. I think that children at this age should do more hands on activities, but also be familiar with forms of technology. My five-year-old nephew happens to find the Leap Frog learning paraphernalia very educational.In \\"Junk Food and the Internet\\" Stoll compares the internet to McDonald's: \\"...like McDonald's, the Internet delivers a product which is fast, easy, and cheap...plenty good enough for many people. One pushes mom-and-pop restaurants; the other undercuts libraries.\\" I found this analogy to be quite beguiling. Thus, the internet is as healthy as McDonald's food!Stoll concludes with this statement, \\"Disguised as efficiency machines, digital time bandits steal our lives and undermine our communities.\\" I had been writing a research paper about the rise of obesity, and this got me thinking. Not only is this a world where computers versus textbooks, but also where computers versus exercise! I mean, when making a decision between playing a game of solitaire and doing crunches, who will pass up the easy route?You've got to check out this book!"},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"Reviewed by Nick RoseThough-out the book Stroll played the role of a teacher that is not for computers in the classroom. He says that a student is in a classroom to learn and if computers are brought in to \\"help learning\\" the student will not take in as much. Stroll hit all of his points in a way that makes you rethink the use of computers in the classroom. It was surprising to find out that Stroll is a self proclaimed computer nerd. That would lead you to think that he would be for the use of computers in the classroom but he is the opposite of that way of thinking."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"May 1, 2005Review of High-Tech HereticBy Jessie PlanteIn the book High-Tech Heretic, the author, Clifford Stoll, uses humor and personal experience to explain why he sternly feels that computers are not needed in the classroom. Stoll uses examples from his own life, and also from research studies done, to discuss how the placement of computers in schools will not automatically make students smarter, or enhance their education in any way. In fact, he strongly feels that relying on computers to do the teaching rather than the actual teachers, is crippling the students socially, and intellectually.Stoll goes on to talk about how he feels computers are often used merely as entertainment tools, and how they offer no real educational value to the user. Although students can find enormous amounts of information on the internet these days, it is what they do with that information that will make it either useful or not to them. Many students do not take into account that not everything found on the internet is legit, or accurate, and often students do not even understand what they print off, but hand in projects without learning anything.Another interesting point that Stoll addresses, is how the technological world is trying to make \\"learning fun\\". He explains that learning is not always going to be fun, and that anything that is worth achieving (in this case wisdom and knowledge) does not come easily. Learning takes hard work and discipline, and he finds it ridiculous that computer corporations think that they can create software programs that will do better jobs teaching students the core subjects than the teachers would. In Stoll's opinion \\"computers can't replace good teachers,\\" and he also believes that a lousy teacher will not become a good teacher simply by making their classroom a \\"wired\\" classroom.Finally, Stoll makes his strongest argument against computers in the classroom, by stating that they \\"eliminate interpersonal relationships.\\" In Stoll's opinion, interactions between students and their teachers, and students and other classmates are essential in developing a young child's mind. Student's who spend hours in front of a computer screen are not only taking time away from having face to face interactions with other people, but are slowly but surely separating themselves from society. Also, Stoll addresses the point that children who spend a great deal of time on the computer are more likely to become lonely or depressed.In reading this book it is easy to side with the author, Clifford Stoll, and agree that having computers in the classroom does not enhance the learning atmosphere, and that \\"cyberschools\\" would lead to a world filled with \\"loners\\" and \\"dolts!\\" Personal interactions, and live experiences, are the most effective ways to get a student to learn. It may not always be exciting or fun, but the end result will be much more rewarding."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"In Clifford Stoll's \\"High Tech Heretic\\" he makes this statement: \\"it's possible to [teach] perfectly well without any computers or high-tech teaching devices. For many-children and adults alike-zero computing is perfectly acceptable and even singularly desirable.\\" (71) He goes on to state make the point that a computer can actually make learning more difficult because it inhibits creativity, intelligence and artistic skills from a school environment. I can actually see how a person could see this side of the argument, however, I am not sure that I completely agree. I do agree with the fact that a computer will never take the place of a well-skilled educator but I can't overlook the fact that computers are so helpful. Computers allow a child to have so much more valuable information at their fingertips and I believe that as we, as human beings, become more advanced we need computers to keep up. Moreover, I believe that in his book Stoll made some valid efforts to inform the audiences of the \\"horrors\\" of how and what our children are learning from the \\"Information Age\\". Although I do not agree with everything Stoll says I do agree that a computer is as useful as the person using it for the simple fact that anyone can sit and punch keys but if you are knowledgeable you can use a computer as it was meant to be used..."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"In High-Tech Heretic Clifford Stoll tells his opinion of how computers do not always enhance learning and that people should not be consumed by the Internet and the new \\"Information Age\\". I thought it was interesting that Stoll has almost dedicated his whole life to computers, but brings them down throughout his book. I do agree with him though when it comes to education and computers in that Shakespeare and the Holocaust needs to take precedence over typing. Children are being put in front of TV's and PC's when they need to interact with other kids and experience life instead of watching it. I think Stoll makes a valid point when he talks about how school districts are putting more and more money into wiring their schools when they need to revaluate the value of a field trip to enhance a student's learning. Overall Stoll does ramble on and on about how computers need to be a smaller part in the education process, but he makes many valid points and does it with some humor. I enjoyed his voyage to the future and telling his readers that in 100 years computers will not have taken over the world and that we will still need jobs like lawyers, plumbers, and dentists while computer programmers will be infinite and have low paying jobs. Stoll's book informed me of how computers can sometimes make learning harder and eliminate creativity, intelligence, and artistic skills from a school environment. I do think Stoll showed his age when he constantly criticized video games and reform to any kind of school issue, but I did agree with him in his idea that textbooks will never be replaced by laptop computers. In his argument about laptops Stoll is forgetting that a combination of textbooks and laptops would only help a student learn. But overall I enjoyed reading Stoll's book, it was intelligent, informative, and I think is a book that any educator or wannabe educator should read."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"When reading this book, I kept finding myself more and more intrigued to go along with Stolls theory, or beliefs if you will. Today more and more people believe that computers in the classroom in a sense judge the level of learning. I know numorous people who when looking for school system to place their children, look for how many computers are in each class, and the entire school as well, and take that into consideration when choosing the school. However Stoll will tell you that a computer is only as usedul and the person using it. He also goes into detail about the simple truths of the technology world by asking certain questions like, \\"what problems are solved by bringing computers into every school?\\", as well as \\"what problems are created by bringing computer into every school?\\" This book is quite compelling, at least to myself, and help you to see more that just one view of using computers in school. It will help you find a more solid stance on the idea with info to back up ur new found decision."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"High Tech is a compilation of paranoid ideas and ill thought out plans. Clifford Stoll, the author, is an undisciplined man who couldn't care less about the immense wealth of knowledge that has been and will continue to be gained from computers. His unimaginative doctrines are fundamentally and inferably insane. He rambles on about why we shouldn't use computers in the classroom, and fails to mention that since their introduction into schools, computers have opened up a vast circuit of ideas in young minds. High-Tech Heretic shows only that Clifford Stoll does not fully understand that the benefits of computers far outweigh the negative effects.This book begins with and introductory chapter that seems to never end. The book contains no sound evidence to Clifford Stoll's claims, and if anything makes him seem maniacal. This book reads like a very, very long and overdrawn magazine article and has no hook to catch you up or intrigue you further. High-Tech Heretic serves only to be a debacle. The information is scattered and far between at best. Clifford Stoll tries very hard to sound intelligent, but comes off as arrogant and foolish.High-Tech Heretic is a great read for anyone who sees computers as the object of man's downfall. But for the rest of us sane individuals it serves only as an amusing anecdote. Even less believable than Clifford Stoll's ravings are his jumbled sentences and rambling concepts. If we all trusted his ideas and held them as fact, then we would certainly be jettisoned back into an archaic society.Be warned, only read High-Tech Heretic if you are an un-paranoid, psychologically sound person.

I would like to point out that the book \\"High-Tech Heretic\\" was a complete waste of my time. I must admit that on my list of worst books that I have ever read this one ranks in the top five. All that the author Clifford Stoll did during the entire book was complain about technology in education. The book is full of fallacies. These are his opinions and his opinions only. If I could have a book published on my complaints then what am I waiting for?The story in the book that I disagree most with is the one titled \\"Calculating Against Calculators\\". Math is an extremely hard subject for a lot of people and asking people to do such things as personal finance and trigonometry without a calculator is plain ridiculious. Stoll says, \\"They work against apperciating the nature of math. Against familiarity with numbers. Against acquiring an understanding of algebra.\\" Sorry to state the obvious but some math cannot be done by certain people without a calculator.This book was a definate waste of my time and a waste of paper and ink.

Is it necessary that people write books about something that is extremely unnecessary in today's society? Honestly, this book is a thought of how someday teachers may be replaced by a computer. Is it necessary? There will not be a single a soul that will allow that to happen. Now, true that maybe possible in a long stretch, but today's society is not going to allow that to happen. The book also focuses on the use of federal aide spending in schools. Should that go to fixing a computer or to the more needed supplies; pencils, paper, etc...I would not reccomend this book to anyone who is reading for pleasure.

We know that we cannot trust the system completely.I understand that the computer does amazing things; I also feel that it gives a person too much power. A person ends up spending more of their time in front of a monitor of a computer than needed. Social interacting becomes a myth for those who have no self-control. The world is being neglected; everyone is playing with all the new gadgets. With in getting new computers and gadgets not to mention all the software that has to be used to get it up and running. What are we going to do when our generations to come have no place to play because the world is corroded away by piles of discarded computers.....I think that a person should learn to balance his/herself with the information we have--knowledge is power--too much of one thing and not enough of the other can be unhealthy.

Certainly, that child doesn't need a computer to do research in kindergarten, nor to write compositions... Besides entertainment, about all the machine does is teach the kid how to fool with a computer.\\" The book is full of opinions from Stoll, and that's about it. Since I am an early education major, a lot of what he has to say makes sense, but after a while it seems like all he is doing is complaining. He should make a stand, give facts, evidence, and good sources to let the reader know that he is not alone in this. It was hard for me to finish the book because I was tired of Stoll focusing all on the future. People want to know about now, they want to be informed of the on going computer hype.Continually updating your computer and software has become ridiculous, and Stoll tells us that. It's bad enough to have to keep going to the trouble of keeping up with technology at home, but now it is carried into the classroom. Stoll believes that computers are \\"over-rated\\" and not what learning is all about. We could do without the computers, especially for young children. But times are changing and computers are the world today, both at home and in the classroom. But teachers should not depend on them as a teaching tool, because technology changes too quickly, and students could start to rely on computers instead of the people that are suppose to be teaching them."},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","review":"This book is based on the question wether or not computers should be in the classroom.

If you are comfortable working with terms such as human capital, opportunity cost and GDP per capita, then this is a book that could really enhance your understanding of research based school improvement.The book is divided into two broad sections: Big Policy and Little Policy. In the first section, the author provides a timeline of reforms from Reagan to Clinton, broadly covering the period 1980 to 1998. He also looks at the relationship between the education sector and the government during that period.The second part of the book looks at how to improve productivity in schools (and also what that really means!) and how the policy directive from state and federal politicians can help to make that happen.Although the book was published in 1998, those seeking to understand more about the No Child Left Behind Act will find much of value here. For example, on page 31 the author laments \\"Who would take seriously a plan to save the starving masses of Africa by collecting data?\\" There is also a great deal of discussion about the pros and cons of standardized testing. I suspect that other readers may be as surprised as I was to find out when it was that standardized testing came to the fore....An entertaining read that is sure to leave you thinking - I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Schools for Sale: Why Free Market Policies Won't Improve America's Schools, and What Will (Critical Issues in Educational Leadership)","review":"This is a wonderful book that my class had to purchase. It focused on school budgets and it gave scenarios on how to handle school budget situations. Good book for school administrators."},{"Title":"The Medieval Manichee. A Study of the Christian Dualist Heresy.","review":"One can only marvel at Mr. Runciman's scholarship, his knowledge of Eastern history and languages was remarkable; he was acquainted with Latin, Greek, Russian, French, Arabic and many other Balkan languages. The sources he consulted and quoted are exhaustive and sometimes not easily accessible. He can only be commended for the depth of his research and making known to the reader the existence of a vast literature dealing with the subject covered in this book.Nevertheless, it must be remembered that Mr. Runciman was a secular historian dealing with a religious subject, this obviously leads him to some unjustified conclusions. Despite his obvious erudition, the author fails to give us an adequate assessment of those he ranked among the Medieval Manichee. His appreciation of these people is often pejorative and even derogatory at times.The sources available and used by Mr. Runciman are almost all hostile, since the opponents and in particular the Inquisition made sure that all the writings of those called Manichee were destroyed. All historians know this fact and should therefore be very careful in quoting them. The information gathered by those who dealt directly with these people and which was included in their histories, reports, letters and other writings was bias and therefore largely unreliable.When one desires to write objectively about a movement like say the Paulicians, he should be aware of these well known facts and take them into account so as to present an accurate picture of his subject. It is clear that in his book Mr. Runciman took many sources he read for granted. He failed to weigh things in the balance of objectivity and sometimes he even contradicts common sense. He repeats many of the aberrations that were written a foretime without intimating that his sources could be questionable.Historically this book is helpful for its broad outline and bibliographical notes. But it is my personal view that it fails totally to tell us the true story of these \\"Manichee\\"."},{"Title":"The Medieval Manichee. A Study of the Christian Dualist Heresy.","review":"Obviously, this book is a little old being originally published in the eighty's. However, it is still a great read and one of the best books on the subject. Best of all it is short and easy to read so if you want just a cursory overview of dualism this is where to start. If you want to learn more after reading this one, I suggest Yuri Stoyanov's The Other God. Stoyanov's work is longer and much more difficult to read but it has been recently revised in 2001 and is a more complete look at dualism not only Christian but also Zoroastrianism and other similar belief system"},{"Title":"The Medieval Manichee. A Study of the Christian Dualist Heresy.","review":"This is still the go-to book for a broad view of how the heresy of spirit/matter dualism spread from its pre-Christian origins in Persia, through various pseudo-Christian manifestations, moving westward over the centuries until it reached its much-hyped popular guise as Catharism.This is a world-hating ideology that does not deserve the good press it gets merely for having been persecuted by the Catholic Church. Runciman, as an Anglican, does not carry water for the Catholic Church, but he is realistic about the nature and implications of dualist-gnosticism."},{"Title":"The Medieval Manichee. A Study of the Christian Dualist Heresy.","review":"Steven Runciman's book on the Dualist heresy is quite well done. But in the end, we are surprised by his failure to connect the gnostic aspects of the Medieval Manichee to later occult movements, such as Freemasonry. Even without this perspective, the book is excellent, and highly recommended.One of the aspects of Runciman's writing that we admire so much is his apparent attention to the great Hilaire Belloc's primary admonition to the writer of history: that he must be just. No doubt, Runciman presents history in a manner that reflects scrupulousity and exactitude. He is also eminently readable. Again, like Belloc, we could rightly style his works as popular histories, that both entertain and enlighten.Our objection to this very important work is simply that the author leaves his reader in something of a lurch at its end. Runciman does a masterful job of connecting the Cathar heresy to previous heretical movements throughout history. But then, in conclusion, he seemingly shies away from brining the connections forward into modernity. One explanation for this may be that, as we have learned from other sources, Runciman dabbled in the occult rather frequently. This could explain his evident hesitancy to connect the unspeakable vileness of the Cathars and Bogomils with more contemporary movements. This notwithstanding, we strongly recommend Runciman's work to those who would understand this very important aspect of the history of Western Civilization."},{"Title":"Mood Swings: Show \\"Em How You're Feeling!","review":"It looks cute and is listed as an item for young readers, but it works equally effectively for adolescents and adults. It provides an opener or a warning especially for those who have a hard time expressing themselves or have difficulty identifying how they feel. Too bad some people think because it's cartoonish, it's childish. The faces downplay the seriousness and make it less intimidating and embarrassing for some people to openly express their feelings."},{"Title":"Mood Swings: Show \\"Em How You're Feeling!","review":"I am an Intensive In-Home therapist who works with children and adolescents ages 5 - 17. I use this book primarily with my younger 'kids'. Before each sesssion, the child is allowed to choose the mood he/she is experiencing that particular day. This book works well when trying to teach younger children their basic emotions and how to properly express them. The only problem I have with it is some of the emotions are difficult for a 5 year old to understand. But other than that it is a great book.I would recommend it to anyone who is working with children ages 5 - 9 who has difficulty expressing their emotions."},{"Title":"Mood Swings: Show \\"Em How You're Feeling!","review":"An excellent way to reveal your emotional state to your family, colleagues, etc. We started with one for me and soon added one for each of the other members of the family to encourage everyone, regardless of age, to think about and label his/her feelings."},{"Title":"Mood Swings: Show \\"Em How You're Feeling!","review":"I bought this book years ago to help my son let us know how he was feeling.

Sometimes it is hard to know what you are feeling, to express it with words. these pictures let you express it without words.I think every teacher, class, therapist, parent, and family should have one of these.

Better than Fehrenbach. Better than Haley. A word of warning about all Texas histories: They tend to subordinate everything to politics. This one does a better job than the others concerning Texas' rich cultural history, but the major emphases are still what you'd expect. Spanish settlement. Texas Revolution. Civil War. Development of the Oil Empire and its relation to state politics. I really hope someday we get a good comprehensive cultural history of the state, but until then this one will have to do. And it does quite well.This book is very well written and researched, with a nice balance of biography, demographics and narrative. I'd say it's probably a bit more scholarly than popular, but the writing is still easily accessible. Buy this one if you're serious about Texas history."},{"Title":"Gone to Texas : A History of the Lone Star State","review":"Concise and well written. It could have had more maps, but almost all histories have this fault. Campbell is a better writer than many other historians, but in places he does reflect a modern prejudice or failure to understand the thinking of the times about which he writes.Writing of slavery, he says, \\"Planters did not have their capital 'tied up,' as some like to say, in slaves. Slave property could be liquidated easily. But planters had no economic or financial reason to do so.\\" Well, some \\"like to say\\" this because it is relevant to a different question: not the question of what individual planters could do, but what they could do as a class if the slavery system were suddenly ended. In that event, planters would not at all have been able to easily liquidate slave property, and they knew that. Thus ending slavery peacefully would have had to overcome this financial problem, though not necessarily to everybody's perfect satisfaction. Solutions were possible, but the slave-holding class claimed that the system could continue unchanged indefinitely. Ultimately, because of polarization and failure to compromise, slavery was ended in the worst manner possible, through civil war.I sometimes wonder whether history writers of our time are sufficiently knowledgable of religious formation in their historical period. Campbell writes, of a certain freedman, that he was \\"well versed in the survival skills learned in bondage\\" and \\"had served as the supervisor of registrars in his district, traveling at night for safety and acting, he wrote, 'as wise as a serpent and as harmless as a dove.'\\" But this particular freedman likely knew, not just \\"survival skills learned in bondage,\\" but also the Gospels. Many readers nowadays would not recognize the quoted phrase as coming directly from Matthew 10:16. Mentioning the Gospel source would have fit into the sentence but was omitted, and I was left wondering whether Campbell himself knew the source.Despite my criticisms of this book, it does deserve the five-star rating and is a good introduction to the subject. The attentive reader of this book would come to understand what a large subject Texas history is, but ought to feel a need for further reading."},{"Title":"Gone to Texas : A History of the Lone Star State","review":"In Randolph B. Campbell's Gone To Texas he discusses every aspect of Texas's society, political nature, economy, etc. He starts out during the first arrival of humans in the area and ends with George W. Bush as governor of the state. The reading is quick and easy, passing from one topic to the next with ease. It does not feel like you are reading a textbook. It feels as if you are reading an intriguing tale about the people and events that affected the growth of Texas into what it is today.It is impressive in its scope and depth. Only reading through it once, I have learned a vast amount about Texas's fight for independence from Mexico, the role Texans had in the numerous United States wars, the political atmosphere of Texas (being mainly a one party state) after the Civil War, and the many political and non-political figures that shaped the personality of the state.

While it won't satisfy those who see Texas History as one long string of triumphs, \\"Gone to Texas\\" will surely take its rightful place as a book that \\"told it how it was,\\" rather than how we'd like to see it.Like John Ferling's treatment of the American Revolution in \\"A Leap in the Dark,\\" Randolph Campbell retells Texas history in narrative form, and the volume reads like a great big story. The prose is easy to comprehend without feeling condescending or oversimplified, and the reader is guided by numerous maps and illustrations. Campbell inserts a dash of wit (without becoming cynical) throughout, keeping things from becoming too serious!While I'm not widely read in this field, Campbell's history seems both authoritative and easily read...a delightful celebration, in all its triumphs and failings, of the Lone Star State."},{"Title":"Gone to Texas : A History of the Lone Star State","review":"This was the textbook for my Texas history class in college, and it was one of the few texts I kept for my own use.

Covers the history of Texas from antiquity to the present. Goes into considerable detail without becoming boring or bogging down in knowledge."},{"Title":"Gone to Texas : A History of the Lone Star State","review":"As a native Texan woefully weak in Texas history I recently decided to begin the journey. \`Gone to Texas' was a problematic start. The book begins as a vibrant historical journey and slowly transitions to a verbose encyclopedic roll call of political players. I'm left with the impression the intent of the book was the mundane and emotionless cataloging of political players in 20th century Texas with the beginning of the book serving as filler.I use the phrase \`political players' because the true politics and issues affecting the Texas of the day are seldom discussed. I've read more engaging editions of political who's-who. I found myself skimming through the later third of the book to end the horror.The first third of the book is good. Not outstanding, not excellent, but serviceable. I did learn much and have a good starting point for specific areas I'd like to further investigate.The middle third is a mix of the ends. I found it odd there is no discussion of any natural disasters that befell Texas, from tornados to hurricanes and more. The Kennedy assassination garners only a paragraph or two. There was nothing on the musical and entertainment history of Texas. Not even Buddy Holly. Other than a cursory mention of the Dallas Cowboys there is nothing on football, much less high school football.And while I wasn't looking for the history of my hometown a glaring omission is any real focus on the development, growth and significance of Dallas, Houston and San Antonio to the state. Only population growth and racial makeup of late 19th and 20th Century Texas cities are covered in detail. Any significant local or regional Texan fails to make the cut of \`Gone to Texas'.The majority of Texans highlighted are those that contributed to the story of the United States.This approach leads to an inordinate amount of time spent discussing the United States and world affairs. Obviously the three are related but in an attempt to familiarize the reader with these factors the focus of the book randomly shifts, within chapters and sometimes pages. When a reader gets to the point of the book where Texas joins the Union this issue begins and is exacerbated from there.Is it Texas geographical history? American history? World history? Is it about \`the guys that managed to get elected to congress in Texas' history?Yes. And it isn't good at any of them.This book is terribly mistitled. There is little discussion about the people who went to Texas, what they did when they got there and what became of them. In the preview of the book it talks about all the people pulling out and writing 'gone to texas' on their doors or windows. The preview is the last place you'll hear about that happening, was a selling point of the book for me, and the assertion is at best a half-truth, at worst an out right propaganda lie to sell the book.I have no respect for books that promise to deliver one thing and then patently ignore one of the prime selling points."},{"Title":"Gone to Texas : A History of the Lone Star State","review":"easy on the eyes, quick read.

He handles earlier Texas history well - prehistory, too, God bless him - but he makes its 20th c. sound dry as West Texas dust. It could've been vivid. Texas's 20th c. and beyond HAS been vivid. He botched it.Particularly the 1980s. Campbell and other left-leaners can't fathom why Texas voters gave free-spending, regulation-meddling Democratic Gov. Mark White only one term.

She has identified the key reason some disputes escalate to violence while others do not: issue indivisibility. She tells you when different sorts of actors are more or less likely to treat an issue as indivisible in much the same way a geologist might tell you where an earthquate of magnitude seven or greater is most likely to occur. The idea is not to predict a specific earthquake, so much as to tell you why you need to take special measures in some places (along fault lines) more than others. The case studies alone are worth the price of the hardcover edition, but students and policy makers alike will find the theoretical material clear and widely applicable to many of today's important conflicts; ranging from religiously-inspired terrorism and civil wars, to interstate disputes and bargaining problems more generally. Some critics of this book have complained that a few of its key observations are obvious; akin to saying (again, keeping with the geology metaphor) \\"earthquates happen along fault lines\\" or, \\"when earthquakes happen, those living on fault lines get hurt.\\" But this is nonsense. Professor Toft's analysis explains something much more interesting: why do some people living near the epicenter of a magnitude seven earthquake get wiped out, while others remain relatively unscathed? That's neither obvious nor trivial. Do you want to understand why the Palestinian-Israeli conflict has lasted so long? Why Russia is still in Chechnya and why the conflict there is getting worse by the day? Want to understand why Islam is so often involved in civil wars since World War II as compared to other religions? Issue indivisibility explains key aspects of each these conflicts and this book is a must-read for those citizens, scholars, intellectuals, policy makers, or just plain thoughtful people who want to understand these conflicts and who are interested in designing responses that can end on-going violence and prevent (or at least lessen the damage) future violence."},{"Title":"The Geography of Ethnic Violence : Identity, Interests, and the Indivisibility of Territory","review":"This book is useful, especially for its case studies of the conflicts in Abkazia and Ajaria (separatist regions in Georgia). The thesis, that geography--land itself--is central to ethnic conflict, seems fairly obvious when one is discussing state and national borders, but Toft strangely asserts that it is her original idea!Overall, the book is useful to those interested in the particular case studies. Too jargony at times, the writing is occassionally repetitive. It is a thin book, and some additional case studies would have been welcome.Overall, a flawed but still appreciable contribution to the literature on ethnic conflict and separatism."},{"Title":"Fractal and Chaotic Properties of Earthquakes (Lecture Notes in Earth Sciences)","review":"This book gave the entire scoop on earthquakes and gave the realization of what really happens when earthquakes occur. It seems to be a well detailed book and gives you everything you've ever wanted or even not wanted to know. This includes death tolls, seismology, and the most prone places where these earthquakes occur. It's a great book and definetly makes you wonder: Earthquakes or Us?"},{"Title":"The Flood of the Millennium: (The Real Story: The Survivors)","review":"Disasters happen every day -- someplace in the world an airliner crashes, a fire sweeps through a city, famine claims lives in small villages, or horrendous storms change landscapes -- all transforming lives forever.Newspapers print thousands of inches of copy, journalists broadcast minutes and hours filled with emotional words and horrific photos or video, and the internet whisks millions of bytes documenting human pain and suffering through cyberspace.Information overload makes it too easy to forget the individual stories of victims and victory. But survival is part of the human condition and stories of survival serve as remembrances for what has been lost and provide hope for the future.Janet Elaine Smith has done a remarkable job in showing a heartbreaking story of one such disaster. But \\"The Flood of the Millennium,\\" is not a tale of woe.This book is a testament to ordinary people doing extraordinary things in the face of danger and hardship.The winter of 1997 had been a record-breaking year for the residents of Grand Forks, North Dakota. The people of this town were reeling from eight blizzards -- the worst ever recorded. More than 100 inches of snow had fallen and then an ice storm disabled the city with power outages that lasted for weeks in some of the smaller outlying communities.On April 17, 1997, the residents began preparing to face nature's fury -- but not without a fight. As a volunteer working at one of the larger evacuation shelters, Grand Forks Air Force Base, Smith skillfully recounts the stories of people who lived through the worst flood the town had ever experienced.Written in a crisp, fresh style, Smith places the reader there in the midst of wailing sirens, resonating bullhorns, evacuations, and reports of flooding, fires, and a city suddenly hit with the irony of no water in the midst of overflowing dikes. It reads like some script from a disaster movie. But Smith doesn't stop there.Ignoring her own personal fears of what the future might hold, she gathers stories of others, creatively weaving together emotions and personalities of people faced with uncertainty of tremendous loss -- houses, cars, personal belongings. And yet, they bond together under the efforts of numerous volunteers.Smith shows the unselfish spirit and deep sacrifice made by those who provided care, comfort, nurturing, and solace to more than a thousand residents, many of whom had special medical needs.She easily relates the unselfishness of people opening their homes to strangers and feeding and caring for them while meeting more than just their physical needs. The story she shares is more than just a survival story. As she says in the book, the Good Samaritan was no longer just a story in the Bible.Even though this small book is about a very large disaster, Smith aptly focuses on the positive and does a good job in showing how humor played a major role in coping. Instead of lamenting their situations, she shows how many folks really do seek the positive. One example of this is how the people living in temporary shelters eventually decided to focus on friendships rather than watch the constant news once the coverage began repeating stories.It's obvious that she sacrificed much to help record and keep track of those being cared for as well as filling in wherever there was a need. Yet it is the courage and sacrifice of others that speaks loudest throughout her lively narrative.For those of us fortunate enough to have never faced the threat of losing everything, Janet Elaine Smith gives us a glimpse into that possibility. Yet her sensitive treatment of and respect for those victims turned victors allow us to see the inherent good found in those who are in need and the unlimited unselfishness that abounds in those meeting those needs.Reviewed by Francine Biere for The Coffee Cramp Reviews"},{"Title":"The Tainted Desert : Environmental Ruin in the American West","review":"For anyone who is at all interested in the environment, or the American West, or issues of nuclear waste, this book is a must. Kuletz does something that is lacking in our radio, t.v., news magazine, and newspaper reports on environmental issues--she reveals the cultural biases in our Western, &quot;objective&quot; perspective. She also listens and presents the testimony of Native Americans on their desert homelands.

If you are familiar with books from this era, they are usually published in segments and later put into one full book, (such is this case). Details on the four sections of this book are as follows:Book 1 & 2: Story of a man named Paul Flemming, who lost a loved one and is on a journey through Germany. This is almost entirely thoughts on philosophy discussed between himself, his good friend Baron (who departs at the end of the second book), people he meets, people telling stories and sharing opinions, most of which is naming and contemplating the works of other famous writers, poets, artists, musicians, songs and so on, and reflecting their own sentiments of the works.Book 3: Much of the previous, now in Switzerland, but with an introduction to a good friend Mr Berkley and Mary, who shares similar interests and he quickly comes to love. But in telling a story, he embarrasses himself and decides to leave with his friend, Berkley, to continue his travels.Book 4: Now with a more negative outlook, Flemming travels with his friend when a storm follows and Paul falls ill. After a few weeks, he begins to feel better, and Mr Berkley reads to him. Soon fit to move on, the story continues. Paul is more on the subject of life and death, and with, (at least to me,) an unhealthy interest in graveyards. I guess he's in a transitional period. He meets more people and is inspired by their stories. At the end, he hears the voice of his Mary in the next room and dreams of her. But instead of seeing her, he leaves to continue his travels.Mostly theory and observation, but not enough practice. Given his circumstances, I'd imagine he'd be going through changes. Some interesting introspection and thoughts on life; though, if you're looking for a story with a definite feeling of beginning, middle and end, this is more of a philosopher's book told through the heart of a young man in the midst of a deep existential crisis.PS. I'm under the assumption, also, that Longfellow chose the name Hyperion from the uncompleted epic poem of John Keats (as Longfellow seems to be a fan), since the poem talks about despair of the Titans and their fall to the Olympions. Keats temporarily gave up because it felt too Milton-esk (which Longfellow seems to also be a fan) and from tending to his brother who succumbed to death from TB in 1819. Later Keats attempted continuing the poem (The Fall of Hyperion: A Dream): \\"framing it with a personal quest to find truth and understanding\\"..... Of course, for all I know, Longfellow mentioned this in the Introduction, which I did not read...Ah, as for aesthetics, this is a lovely little edition."},{"Title":"AP Computer Science (A & AB) (REA) - The Best Test Prep for the AP Exam (Advanced Placement (AP) Test Preparation)","review":"It absolutely amazes me how bad this book is. Especially when the AP European History book published by REA is so good. DO NOT BUY! The book has absolutely nothing to do with the actual AP test. In fact, it's probably detrimental if you even try to go through it. Why? Here are just a couple reasons -1. It's funny because when you open it up to the cover page, it lists all these PHD's and all, and you're thinking, well, these people know what they're talking about, right? Wrong. The whole book reminded me of myself, trying to b.s. my way through an essay on a topic that I had absolutely no clue on. Seriously, these people use like this language that is so frustrating that not only does it take forever to read a single page, but I'd catch myself going, &quot;what?&quot; Other times, I'd seriously feel like throwing the book across my room.2. The information covered in the book has absolutely nothing to do with the actual test. Well, it talks about C++ and all, but it's too short where it needs to be longer and too long where it needs to be shorter. And all in all, the topics were just totally off.3. The questions are COMPLETELY DIFFERENT from the ones on the real test. And I mean it too. The questions on the test are totally different from the questions in this book.4. The case study is wrong!It's a good thing that I decided to get this book earlier because I had time to get a different book. I know someone in my class who did some last minute studying with this book and was basically screwed for the test. Don't let this happen to you! Stay away from this book! It was a complete waste of time and money. Buy Maria Litvin's 'Be Prepared for the AP Computer Science Exam'. Now THAT was a good book.Oh yeah, I've been telling you all this, but you're probably wondering who's telling you all this. I had a horrible teacher that didn't teach us anything(we did nothing for like 2 months before the test and we never reviewed) so like I tried to study on my own with this book. Bad idea. I didn't get Maria Litvin's book until a week before the test and basically I tought myself everything I was supposed to learn during the year in a week(without sleeping, of course). I ended up with a four, which is pretty good, since just a week before, I basically knew nothing. But I'm telling you, if I had started with Maria Litvin's book instead of this stupid book, I probably could have gotten a five."},{"Title":"AP Computer Science (A & AB) (REA) - The Best Test Prep for the AP Exam (Advanced Placement (AP) Test Preparation)","review":"A review manual for the AP test could reasonably be expected to at least mention the *existence* of the five C++ AP classes. This book does not.It could also be expected to do more than mention that there is a College Board case study and then phrase its study as something *optional*. (The case study is the subject of at least one of the four extended response questions, and a good handful of the multiple choice.)In glancing at the book, I was shocked to find that, although it gives a thorough-but-terse overview of theory, it seems to have little actual relation to the exam itself."},{"Title":"AP Computer Science (A & AB) (REA) - The Best Test Prep for the AP Exam (Advanced Placement (AP) Test Preparation)","review":"This book is considered as a pretty good review book forstudents who are taking the AP computer science test 'A'.

This book is not the most comprehensive work on the subject. However, it focuses on Australian Holocaust survivors, and discusses their efforts to regain all types of property from all over Europe. It makes the important point that it was not just the Swiss and not just bankers who profited from the Nazi atrocities. The narrative is interspersed with stories from people who lived through the war and managed to get to Australia. Any personal account makes history much more compelling, and the stories are well told. The author also makes the point that it isn't always easy to get property back, even with documentary proof--what may have been a factory during the war might now be a housing development with a lot of people living in it, who had nothing to do with the Nazis' seizure of the original property in the 1930s or 1940s. The author certainly makes the case that some compensation is due and maybe long overdue. The reason i did not give this a five is that the writing/editing is very sloppy, misspelled words (in English and other languages), grammatical errors, and missing words in the text on almost every page. This, however should not deter anyone from reading the book. Everyone can learn something here."},{"Title":"My Mother's Diamonds: In Search of Holocaust Assets","review":"As a U.S. reader, I had heard a lot in the media about the attempts to recover assets taken by the Nazis, particularly Swiss bank accounts.

Blind Alley is a story devoted to Jane. It is a book that combines Johansen's usual mystery and intrigue but is better because of Jane's independence and effort to find her own place. Blind Alley also concludes without leaving you hanging while promising more."},{"Title":"Blind Alley (An Eve Duncan Forensics Thriller)","review":"Jane was the main target in this book.

Just what I was looking for this weekend."},{"Title":"Blind Alley (An Eve Duncan Forensics Thriller)","review":"I have read many of Johansen's books and liked all of them. This is my least favorite. It was very good until about two-thirds of the way through the book. Then the story went off on one of those unbelievable tangents. You know the kind, where all the character's suddently go to Italy, have a large villa to live in, and the killer continues with his threats. I just have trouble with books that take off from reality when they aren't science fiction. The characters were all good and the overall plot would have been good if they had stayed in the US and developed another ending."},{"Title":"Blind Alley (An Eve Duncan Forensics Thriller)","review":"After I read a few reviews on this I was a little worried about my recent purchase. However, I really enjoyed reading it I do agree that Mark Trevor is a bit old for a traditional 17 year old girl but Jane is not a normal or typical girl.

I would recommend this book for any one who can put aside the typical and just dive into a good thriller with a completely new plot."},{"Title":"Blind Alley (An Eve Duncan Forensics Thriller)","review":"This book introduced some new characters into the series. Except for Bartlett, the characters all have the same personality as other characters. If I see \\"his lips twisted\\" or \\"her lips twisted\\" one more time, I will scream. Trevor was good as a love interest for Jane but it was the same as Logan with Sarah. Obviously, the author wrote cheesy romance novels that youcan crank out without changing anything except the locale from novel to novel. The same is happening with this series of books. I was a little bewildered at the reviews claiming pedophilia from Trevor. A seventeen year old woman is at her prime. If a man tells you that he is not attracted to a woman at that age then he is lying or gay. My mother married at 16, her mother at 17.

There's a common thread. A strong female character takes on unreasonable personal responsibility to capture the maniac villain, acting like a damn fool every step of the way. In this case, it's a 17-year-old who thinks it is her personal responsibility to protect the trained adults ... and they go along with it, even though reluctantly. If author Johansen cut out the breast-beating and the discussions about how it's the girl's responsibility to keep the adults safe, it would make a good short story."},{"Title":"Blind Alley (An Eve Duncan Forensics Thriller)","review":"This is my first time reading one of Johansen's books and it held me from page one - the book was one of those that I do not want to put down.

However I think the jacket of the book was very misleading. I was expecting this book to be about Eve. It was not. Eve was a secondary character and Joe was hardly in it all. It was all about Jane. The book description never even mentioned Jane.Do not get me wrong it was still a great book and I would have read it anyway. But I was hoping it was going to deal more with Eve and her opening up to Joe more about Bonnie and other issues. I thought Iris Johansen was going to deal with a lot of lose ends from Body of Evidence. None were resolved. For these reasons I was very disappointed.On the good side, I love Jane and her interaction with Trevor.

What Jane doesn't know is that there a madman, by the name of Aldo, who is out there killing and mutilating any woman with her particular facial features and now Jane is next on his list. But why? Jane discovers that the woman she's been dreaming about really existed 2,000 years ago and her name was is \\"Cira\\" and she happens to look exactly like Jane. Aldo feels he must kill Jane because of his hatred of \\"Cira\\" whom he believes destroyed his life by taking away his father's love.Jane grows weary of being surrounded by security; not being able to live her life as she chooses and decides with the help of Eve and Joe, along with conman, Mark Trevor who is more than he seems to set up a trap to draw out this madman and get him before he kills again. Unbeknowth to all, Aldo has a plan of his own which now threatens the people Jane holds dearest. The clock is ticking as Jane has now run out of time and is now living her nightmare.\\"Blind Alley\\" was a wonderful novel filled with suspense, drama and mystery with many twists and turns that made it a fantastic reading experience.As indicated in the author's closing note, Jane's story will continue and we shall hopefully find out if she has psychic powers or is in fact the reincarnated \\"Cira\\" as well as what is in store for Jane and the mysterious Mark Trevor.

I thought that something was wrong with me, because it took two tries for me to even finish this book. That's unusual because I can pick up a Johansen and go until the end. But she just does not do it for me. I didn't like anything about her. I kept trying to find something, but it's just not there.And Trevor was annoying and intrusive here. No endearing qualities at all, like John Logan, or any of her other leading males. I just couldn't really get into him or Jane.The mystery itself was interesting. If this had happened to any other two people, I think I would've enjoyed it.That being said, this does not in any way deter me from reading other Johansen books. She's fantastic!

I bought it due to the enthusiastic reviews on the back cover or on the first pages in the book.I do not know how her other books are, because this book was as bad as they rarely come.One-dimensional characters, repetitive thoughts/actions (just in case somebody had not got it the first or second time), illogical actions (visitor from Scotland Yard shows up at the private home, not at the police station, and our heroes do not even bother to ask for identification, ......)I could not develop any sympathies for the protagonists, and frankly, I do not care if they get murdered or not.I have no idea if the other books by this author are better, but I do not intend to find out.One is more than enough.Annoying, irritating, boring.Sorry!"},{"Title":"Blind Alley (An Eve Duncan Forensics Thriller)","review":"I was very satisfied with the purchase of this book. The book was in good condition, the price very reasonable, and I received it in just a matter of days.Thank you."},{"Title":"Blind Alley (An Eve Duncan Forensics Thriller)","review":"My mom let me use her hybrid for awhile and she had the audio book for \\"Blind Alley\\" The radio was boring so I decided to listen to it.I see from the other reviews this is the 5th book in a series involving the forensic sculptor Eve Duncan, Atlanta Police Detective Joe Quinn, and their adopted daughter Jane MacGuire.Enter the crazed serial killer named Aldo who is bent on killing any woman that remotely looks like somebody named Cira who later turns out to have been a 2000 year old actor/concubine noted for her beauty. His obsession makes him carve off their faces in order to destroy the face from the world. In his travels he notices Jayne who appears to be the living image of Cira. His quest is almost over! He found her at last.Overall, the plot was ok. I could follow along and I could imagine the settings. Others complain about it but I am coming from not having read the previous books. One thing I will mention is the characters don't fall back on the other books so you don't feel you missed anything.I liked the character Mark Trevor as he came across as a good Anti-Hero. Yet, I was interested in knowing more about him and his sidekick Bartlet.I will admit I expected a trite situation where a borrowed skeleton from ancient times used to lure Aldo would turn out to be Cira. All through the book the question is asked did she survive? Eve as part of the trap does a reconstruction with the promise of doing the real reconstruction. after dealing with Also. When she finishes the final work, you are simply left with her exclaiming \\"my god\\" and that was it. I suspect that was the intention but the author changed her mind and dropped it.The ending was ok. But it left me unsatiated. I expected more and it stopped.Bernadette Dunne does the reading and in the beginning she annoyed me with her attempts to give accents to the characters. Not to mention that Jayne and Eve seemed to whine a great deal. However, I was able to tune it out as the story picked up.I will probably check out her early works and will look for more if Trevor comes back."},{"Title":"Blind Alley (An Eve Duncan Forensics Thriller)","review":"There's a psycho killer on the loose who is targeting women who look like a cop's 17-year old adopted daughter. Adding to the emotional complexity is that the cop's wife lost a young daughter, presumed murdered, several years ago. The wife is a talented sculptor who altered her career to provide forensic reconstructions of murder victims. She has a talent that goes beyond technical skill. She's able to commune with the victim's spirit in some way and provide eerily accurate portrayals.The couple knows their daughter is in grave danger. The young woman is intelligent and independent. This combination of traits helps save her life, but also endangers it.A string of victims along the way leads to the inevitable showdown involving the cop, the killer, and the daughter.I enjoyed that this book was exciting, took unexpected twists, and yet the author didn't have to gross me out with excruciating detail of every brutal and sadistic murder. Blind Alley is one of a series featuring the forensic sculptor, but I didn't feel held back by not having read any of the others. The character of the teenage daughter was engaging and apparently there are future books about her.This is a great crime novel for the idle hours - take it on a trip with you."},{"Title":"Blind Alley (An Eve Duncan Forensics Thriller)","review":"I did not like this one as well as the rest in the series.

Mullally said, I skipped a few of Johansen's books because I got so tired of the word \\"stiffened\\" every half dozen pages or so. How about trying some other tired word like \\"he (or she) bristled\\" once in awhile? I got more out of the Amazon synopsis and reviews than from the book. I liked the first couple in the series, but there wasn't much in the way of forensics here."},{"Title":"Blind Alley (An Eve Duncan Forensics Thriller)","review":"This time Ms. Johansen gives us a little mysticism along with Eve, Joe and Jane and her usually diabolical and 1/2 step ahead villain. Jane is now 17 and has just gotten her driver's license. Eve and Joe have always said Jane was \\"10 going on 30\\" from her life experiences and that factor is taken advantage of in this plot.An international serial killer is murdering women and removing their faces. Eve is asked to reconstruct one that is found nearby and imagine her shock when the face looks like an older Jane!!Jane, meanwhile, is having dreams/nightmares where she is running, in a tunnel, hot and can't breathe -- this is where the \\"fantasy\\" factor comes in -- and Jane wants to find out what happens.Enter a con artist named Trevor, who is, of course, handsome and charismatic and intelligent, and soon the whole gang is trying to catch the serial killer who now targets Jane.I felt we really got to know Jane in this story which was a little thin on the plot due mostly to the fantasy elements. I did enjoy the workings and machinations that went on to try and catch the killer."},{"Title":"Blind Alley (An Eve Duncan Forensics Thriller)","review":"I've read all of the books Johansen has written in the Eve Duncan series, because I love the characters and their stories. So I was excited to see the web of 'certralness' branch out to Jane.I like that Jane is tough, and I like that I can relate with the character, for once, an author not being afraid to write a teenager who isn't an ignorant airhead, caring only about clothing and hair.But as much as I love her characters, the more I've read Johansen, I think her writing is only so-so. There are only so many time you can say 'tentatively' and 'warily.\\" Way too many adjectives and adverbs...Stephen King warns against those, and while I don't like his stories, I respect his writing.So all in all, I'll still be buying her hardcovers...I'm a collecter like that, don't like paperbacks, only hardcovers...but I hope she learns to limit the use of her favourite words."},{"Title":"Blind Alley (An Eve Duncan Forensics Thriller)","review":"\\"Blind Alley\\" is the fifth novel in the continuing story of Eve Duncan, forensic sculptor, Joe Quinn, Atlanta police detective and Jane MacGuire, their precocious seventeen year old adopted daughter rescued from the streets. Be warned that much of this review might be construed as spoilers but I'm betting that it's not going to matter much since you'll likely be giving the book a pass anyway!I used to treat Iris Johansen as a sure thing! You know what I mean - the kind of author whose new title you'd add to your reading list without even caring what the plot line was or you'd pick up a copy at the store without even bothering to flip open the dust jacket for a peek! \\"Blind Alley\\" buried that thought - cold, deep and fast! It was a great deal more than just bad - it was truly painful!A shadowy serial killer named Aldo is on the loose slaughtering women in a most unseemly, gruesome fashion. Carving their living faces right off their skulls, Aldo imagines himself responsible for the systematic elimination of all women who resemble Cira, a courtesan/actress/prostitute killed two thousand years ago in the town of Herculaneum when Vesuvius erupted. It would seem that Aldo is a little upset at having lost the love and attention of his father, an archeologist who became obsessed with Cira when he discovered her statue and some details of her life.As if that isn't deep enough in left field as the premise for a thriller, imagine the eyebrows you'll raise when you read that Jane MacGuire, Eve Duncan and Joe Quinn's adopted 17 year old daughter is a ringer for Cira. Not only does she find herself stalked by Aldo but some inexplicable psychological attachment to Cira plagues Jane with regular nightmares in which she is trapped in caves or tunnels fleeing for her life from the eruption of Vesuvius.It doesn't end there - Johansen tosses Mark Trevor into the mix. He's a con and an antiquities smuggler (picture Lovejoy with a nasty streak!) who had a run-in with Aldo and is intent on killing him. To that end he intrudes himself into Eve Duncan's and Joe Quinn's life and sets himself up as Jane's protector. Now, I'm no prude but the scene in which Trevor, a grown man at least as old as Joe, has a near sexual encounter with Jane, a typical seventeen year old teenager with respect to her hormones and sexuality, is just plain distasteful and, frankly, scored well into the red zone on the \\"yuk\\" meter!There is just so much wrong with this novel, it's difficult to know where to begin and where to stop - nightmares that start, happen and end with no explanation or psychological development at all; unlike any previous Johansen novel I've read, the characters and dialogue seem trite, wooden and completely contrived; the outcome of Mark Trevor as a character is left spectacularly un-resolved; Eve Duncan's obsession with her murdered daughter, Bonnie, continues unabated and is definitely becoming downright irritating; a wonderful sub-plot concerning Eve's forensic reconstruction of a real skull from the Vesuvius eruption was simply deep-sixed!I still own a few Johansen titles that I haven't read so there is perhaps hope. But she'll have to prove to me that she hasn't jumped the shark before I'll spend another cent on a new title!Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"Blind Alley (An Eve Duncan Forensics Thriller)","review":"This is going to be the last Iris Johansen book I'll buy in hardcover, and there's no certainty I'll be buying any in paperback either.Although this book is promoted as being about Eve Duncan, don't be fooled. She, and her partner Joe Quinn, are very peripheral characters here. Instead, its their 17 year old, foster daughter Jane that takes center stage. And she has none of the character or personality of her fictional parents. In fact, Jane is just flat out boring.Seems there's a killer going around and cutting the faces off women that look like Jane. His motives are confusing, and pretty nonsensical, but no matter. For a villian, he's dull and 2-dimensional, and completely without personality. He exists purely to be thwarted. At no time does he comes across as menacing, there are no suprises.The male romantic lead here is Trevor, and like Jane and the villian, he too comes across as dull and uninspiring. Perhaps its just me, but the attraction that develops between 17 year old Jane, and 30+ Trevor was just uncomfortable. I don't understand how an author thats created such interesting, inspiring characters like Eve Duncan, Joe Quinn, Sarah, Logan, Elena, Galen, Judd Morgan can fail so utterly in infusing life and energy into her newest creations.My advice, save your money on this one, at least in hardcover. This book might be a tolerable paperback read if you are in a bind, and want something that won't tax your brain or require any emotional investment."},{"Title":"Blind Alley (An Eve Duncan Forensics Thriller)","review":"I am getting ready to move to our new house and needed a new book to read. Well for some reason this one did not get packed so I grabbed it. What a waste of time. First of all Jane has to be one of the most annoying characters I have come across in a long time. I was actually cheering for Aldo to kill her just so she would shut up. Then Trevor (an adult male) having a crush on Jane (a 17 year old girl) was just creepy. I do not care if he was there to try and help no preverted man who is lusting after my high school daughter is coming into our lives.The plot was pathetic and after all the building up to catch Aldo the writer ends the climax in like two paragraphs.DO NOT WASTE YOU TIME !!!"},{"Title":"Blind Alley (An Eve Duncan Forensics Thriller)","review":"Where did Iris Johansen put Eve Duncan after so many successful years?I have read all but two of Johansen's books. I am an admirer of her character Eve Duncan. She developed Eve over the years to be a very strong character.Blind Alley is a very disappointing piece of work. It's almost as if Johansen decided to make Eve weak in order to make Jane strong. And who is Mark Trevor and why do we need yet another 'rascal' male lead to make the female lead more 'credible'?

Every thing is repetitive in it. I did not like one single character. When the author tries to make these characters strong she just made them annoying. I WISH I would have read the other reviews before I wasted money on this trash. Like another reviewer said -Aldo should have killed them all after the first couple of chapters and put us all out of our misery. As for the child molester Trevor ----that was just sick.

But other reviewers have covered the storyline vagaries, and repeating them is distasteful. The characters are phony. The dialogue is wooden. There is no atmosphere, no distinct sense of place. Cliches abound, and when you think the writer couldn't top the last one--she does. In short, this book is not even worth discussion. It should simply be dismissed. Why didn't the editors and publishers do exactly that?This was my first book by Ms. Johansen. It will also be my last."},{"Title":"Blind Alley (An Eve Duncan Forensics Thriller)","review":"I was able to get through this book primarily because of two reasons: 1. I had never read anything by Iris Johansen before, so I was loathe to give up quickly 2. I was suffering from a temporary lack of other available reading material.My friend John likes to say that nobody ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the average person. I think this book is a good example of that.The book wasn't totally without merit, or completely unentertaining. It was however full of cliches', which I won't mention specifically as they would be considered 'spoilers', but like a fruit cart getting toppled chase scene in an action film, or a 'bullet from nowhere' that takes out the villain (right between the eyes, of course) at the last possible moment before the innocent victim meets his or her demise, this book is full of overdone, outworn situations, constructs and outcomes."},{"Title":"Blind Alley (An Eve Duncan Forensics Thriller)","review":"I was so bored with this book.

That was not this book.At first, I thought it was just me. Unlike others, I found it easy to get into the book. But I found it too new age for me. Between Eve talking to her dead daughter to the creepy Aldo to Jane's connection with the murdered Cira, I decided I didn't need to read the whole novel and checked to make sure Jane and Trevor survived.Maybe this wasn't Iris Johansen's best book.

I can't explain it and I hadn't read any of the author's other books before reading this, so that isn't clouding my judgement.

As soon as I saw \\"Eve Duncan\\" on the front cover, my excitement level dropped off but I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was not all about Eve.The only quibble I have with the story line is that I do not think that most readers are able to enjoy reading about a 17 year old and a \\"can't be over 30\\" year old. It would have been more palatable to make their ages closer and out of the statutory rape range. It was done in Reap the Wind, albeit not with the main characters.I look forward to reading Coutdown since Jane will be 21 ;-)"},{"Title":"Blind Alley (An Eve Duncan Forensics Thriller)","review":"I have read a majority of Iris Johansen's books, with high expectations.

I know this is fiction, but come on. How does stuff like this get published? Also, I'm glad I wasn't the only reader uncomfortable with the romantic involvement of a middle-aged man and a teenage girl. Eww.

This will be my last Johansen."},{"Title":"Blind Alley (An Eve Duncan Forensics Thriller)","review":"This book was nothing but a let down with antiquated verbage and cliched characters. I am nineteen and mature for my age, and believe me, I didn't use words like \\"lordy\\" and \\"darn\\" when I was seventeen. The manner in which Jane speaks and acts is a far cry from reality, even for a supposedly mature and intelligent girl. She sounded more like my 72 year old grandmother than a 17 year old girl. Johansen's portrayal of Jane is quite sloppy and formulaic. The timeline doesn't even add up either. If she applied early decision, she would not receive her response back from Harvard in the early fall, she would get it over winter break. It doesn't add up. And I repeat: this is such a cliche... pick a more interesting and less typical college.This book was horrible and sloppily written with simplistic and uninspiring prose."},{"Title":"Blind Alley (An Eve Duncan Forensics Thriller)","review":"As all avid mystery readers know, we've come to adopt those characters we find in our favorite books, into our hearts and homes. What a wonderful story teller Ms. Johansen is, and I enjoy her enormously. I do have a few questions and comments, though.Has Eve Duncan always been as whiney and shallow as this book depicts her to be? We all come to expect certain behavior and dialogue between characters, but if I wanted to hear this much whining, I'd call my mother and listen to her whine about not being able to go to Miami this year.Sorry, this book bored me to tears, and if it had been a movie, I never would have gone back from the snack shop.And for all those mothers with 17 year old daughters, I think we'd all agree to chip in and buy a DNA sample from Jane to add to our daughter's lunches. How wonderful she is!! Especially when she pretty much announces that she wishes to have an affair with a 30+ con man."},{"Title":"Blind Alley (An Eve Duncan Forensics Thriller)","review":"This is the first Iris Johansen thriller I have read and unfortunately it will probably be my last. The characters are so predictable in their responses to each other that I knew what they would say before they said it. I listened to it as a book on tape which probably made that worse. But Jane, the focus of the book, is simply unbelievable. Aldo and his \\"obsession\\" strain credibility. The best part was the information about life in ancient Herculaneum and the volcanic eruption."},{"Title":"Blind Alley (An Eve Duncan Forensics Thriller)","review":"I am usually quite an avid fan, but this book left too many holes.

Whose face was the last one that Eve sculpted (if that's a real word)? It almost seems like she is setting it up so you will have to purchase the next book just to get the answers to this one. And did the dreams somehow imply that Jane and Trevor are meant to be together?And yes, I am sick of Eve holding it against Joe that he lied to her years ago. He was trying to help ease her pain, she knows it, she has stayed with him all this time, get over it already."},{"Title":"Blind Alley (An Eve Duncan Forensics Thriller)","review":"It finally happened: I threw a book away. It's this one, \\"Blind Alley,\\" by Iris Johansen. What garbage. Johansen is truly lucky to have a book contract, or to have been published at all. This is especially true since she is working in a formulaic format, and still can't make it work. Her writing is pedestrian, and barely one-dimensional. She has little or no ear for dialogue; all of her characters sound the same, so she's also bereft of character development skills. And while it's evident she did some research for her story, she clearly does not have a grasp of her material and has not developed her story line/plot well, not to mention her pacing is seriously flawed. All this leads me to conclude that she doesn't have much in the way of introspective or reflective abilities. Johansen would be doing the world a great favor if she stopped writing this drivel. As I said, this is the first book I've ever thrown away ~ and I have thousands in my own library. It just isn't worth giving to anyone."},{"Title":"Blind Alley (An Eve Duncan Forensics Thriller)","review":"What a disappointment! The characters were so empty and shallow. Ms. Johansen did not take the time to develop them and give them substance. I continued to read, hoping it would get better.

Do yourself a favor, save your time and money and skip over this book."},{"Title":"Blind Alley (An Eve Duncan Forensics Thriller)","review":"After reading a couple of Iris Johansen's books, I thought that this book would be entertaining and a fun read. My main complaint with this book was the lack of character development/relationship between Jane and Cira. Where was the connection? Just because someone has a close resemblance does not make them the same. I felt like Ms. Johansen began with a neat plot twist but let it get lost between the pages. I would suggest taking less time weaving a frayed \\"fantastic plot\\" and more time with actual character and story development."},{"Title":"Blind Alley (An Eve Duncan Forensics Thriller)","review":"Cira. A name, a woman, an obsession. Someone is killing women who resemble this beautiful actress who died over 2,000 years ago during the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, and every clue ends up in a blind alley. Iris Johansen brings back forensic sculptor Eve Duncan for a non-stop thriller as the path of a serial killer leads right to her front door.When I discovered Iris Johansen several years ago, I quickly read all of her books and was particularly fascinated by the ones involving Eve Duncan. She had lost her seven-year-old daughter to a serial killer and the child's body was never recovered. As a result, she had almost unbearable difficulty dealing with the tragedy. So Eve dedicated her life to \\"bringing home\\" unidentified victims by recreating their likeness through sculpture. Each person who she is able to give back to his or her family brings a little more closure to Eve's own grief.From captivating descriptions of the culture and times prior to the devastation of Mount Vesuvius, to the delightful characterization of Eve's adopted daughter, Jane, Johansen once again comes up with just the right combination of story, suspense, romance and values.Oh, for a teenager like Jane! Eve and her husband, Detective Joe Quinn, adopted the streetwise little handful seven years ago and she has grown into a beautiful young woman who appreciates everything and doesn't wallow in the misery of her lost childhood. Of course, with her sense of responsibility, there is also a need for independence, and Jane does not hesitate to make decisions based on her own strong moral code --- even if it will cause her parents to fret a bit.With customary ease, Johansen takes an obsessive killer, dedicated police, a mysterious champion, various archeologists and dramatic settings, and molds them all together to \\"bring home\\" another bestseller.--- Reviewed by Maggie Harding, a substance abuse counselor in Phoenix, AZ who wanted to be Brenda Starr before life intervened.

She understands when the sculpture is the face of Jane their adopted daughter. It seems that a serial killer is murdering women who look like Jane, thinking they are Cira, a woman who died in Herculaneum when Mt. Vesuvius blew. Coincidentally, Jane dreams of being Cira and fighting to get out of Herculaneum through the tunnels aided by her ex-lover Antonio.Mark Trevor uses guiles and lies to ingratiate him into the search for Aldo because he has a score to settle with the man. Aldo has targeted Jane as his next victim believing he has finally found the reincarnation of Cira. Her policeman father Joe, Eve and Trevor bait a trap that will hopefully bring Aldo out in the open so he can be captured if he doesn't kill them first.Some of Iris Johansen's best books feature Eve Duncan and company and Blind Alley is no exception. This exciting action thriller involves Jane who is older than her seventeen years and the feeling that springs up between her and Trevor are appropriate because Trevor doesn't act on them. Although nothing can come of it because she is too young, she is determined when the time is right they will be together. This suspense laden thriller features many of the characters readers have come to care for in the Eve Duncan series as this exciting and powerful work propels fans to want to read more of the fabulous works of Ms. Johansen.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Blind Alley (An Eve Duncan Forensics Thriller)","review":"Three times I picked up this book and started it. Three times I put it down and read something else instead. Since I let myself run out of reading material I picked this up again. It is truly one of the worst Iris Johansen books ever written. As the previous reviewer said \\"It's far fetched and a lot of drivel.\\" After reading the first hundred pages or so I finally flipped to the last chapter and read through that, skipping entire paragraphs. This is really a no brainer, no suspense, most repetitive book I have ever tried to read. I give it a MINUS 5 star rating. I have purchased my last Iris Johansen novel. Save your money. Buy Stuart Woods, James Patterson or Lisa Gardener."},{"Title":"Blind Alley (An Eve Duncan Forensics Thriller)","review":"If someone is ever thought of, or accused of being a reincarnation, it is freaky. If someone goes around and tries to kill them because of it, it's freaky and scary. Jane claims she is not scared when Aldo (a serial killer) tries to kill her just because he believes she is a reincarnation of Cira, an ancient Egyptian. Jane and Trevor set up a trap to get him, but he turns the table and almost gets Jane. After thinking he killed Joe, Eve, and Trevor, he goes after Jane. Thankfully, after he attacks Jane and knocks her to the ground, she manages to grab a rock and she stabs him. To her surprise, he mutters a curse and instantly dies. As she struggles to free herself from under Aldo's dead corpse, she is relieved when she hears Trevor's voice. She is flooded with warmth any joy when she hears that Eve and Joe are OK with only a few cuts and bruises. This is another great book for people who love to read the thrilling mysteries by Iris Johansen.This is a great book for many reasons, one of which is because there are many suspenseful moments like chases and stalking that leave you at the end of you seat and not wanting to put the book down. One is when Jane chases after her dogs bark after she finds a note on the porch saying that Aldo has him and he will kill the dog if she brings someone with her. She finds him and stabs his shoulder with a butcher knife after he tramples her. She hit him hard enough to get him off of her and go away but not enough to permanently hurt him. Another time is when Aldo is continuously stalking Jane. He always manages to get past the strict security enough to be able to kill her. He doesn't because he believes she should be tortured. A suspenseful part is also when Aldo chases Jane in tunnels where Trevor and Jane set up a trap. The problem was that Aldo got in the tunnel earlier and figured out where they would set up the traps and set up his own traps the kill Eve, Joe, and Trevor. Jane thinks he killed them, which makes it more suspenseful because it makes the reader believe that he can now kill Jane, especially after he traps her.This book is very complex in many ways. One is that this case went way back. Homeland Security was after him for years, not to mention Trevor's involvement with it. Trevor managed to get more information on Aldo as he tried to kill him. Trevor knew Aldo way back and he knew what Aldo was capable of. Aldo is very focused in Cira since his early childhood. Since he was little, his dad payed more attention in finding out more about Cira that he did in Aldo, even though Cira died over 2,000 years earlier. Aldo has been determined to kill every woman with facial features like Cira to wipe her face from the Earth. He continues the killing spree until he finds what he thinks is Cira's reincarnation, which happens to be Jane. There are many things that link the whole family together in a complex web of visions and dreams. Eve is frequently visited by Bonnie, her dead daughter, who tells Eve that something bad is to happen to Jane. Jane has continuous nightmares of her in a tunnel running away from something, yet she can't get out.There are many strong willed characters in this story. Jane is a very stubborn and independent teenager. She has been through a lot in her life because she has been in many foster homes in her life. She doesn't totally depend on anyone for anything, which frequently prevents her from getting hurt, until Trevor comes and tells Jane and her family about the situation with Aldo. It turns her life upside-down by making her trust this complete stranger, Trevor. Trevor is a very persistent person. He has been after Aldo since Aldo started his killing sprees. Trevor will not stop until he gets Aldo and makes his the killings stop. Aldo is very obsessed. He's obsessed in getting Cira's fortune, in wiping Cira's face from the face of the Earth, and in killing Jane. Aldo believes he is all-powerful and that no one can stop him, since no one has been able to get him so far.This is a wonderful book. It includes a thrilling chase throughout the whole book. It makes it ten times better because you can get into everyone's heads (good or bad) because Johansen tells the story from everyone's point of you. When you think the good guys have gotten Aldo, he got them, or at least that's what he and Jane thinks. Johansen does a great job in keeping you attached to the book from beginnings to end. There really is no place in the book where you can stop which adds to the effect of this great thriller. A.

Patricia Cornwell did it when she lost interest in Kay Scarpetta and now this author is doing it with her Eve Duncan character. If you wish to write about a new character than PLEASE don't disguise it behind a character that readers have known. I will NOT buy another book about Jane. She is too young, too immature. I bought this book happy to be reading about Eve Duncan, NOT 17 year old Jane. And the new book promises to be all about Jane and Trevor. I don't care to hear about this couple. Shes too young for him, and it made me feel creepy to hear about the sexual tension between a 17 year old and 30+ year old. Don't waste your money on this if you are looking for Eve Duncan, She's not here!"},{"Title":"Blind Alley (An Eve Duncan Forensics Thriller)","review":"Just had to comment on how I love how the author branches out and sort of lets each character have center stage in their own book. This was Jane McGuire's (adopted daughter) of Eve Duncan's turn. The book was sort of different from what I was used to , a bit of the supernatural. Can't wait for Countdown coming in April 2005, will definitely want to read more about Jane and also will continue to read the next Eve Duncan , Joe Quinn book"},{"Title":"Blind Alley (An Eve Duncan Forensics Thriller)","review":"The beginning of the book is a thriller, I can accept that, but when a 17 years old kid made a plan to find the person who want to kill her and everybody accept her as the bait is really farfetched. Everything they do to trap the killer is pathetic. The trip to Italy and changing the newspapers in the web is hilarious. The end, when everybody stays alive except the killer is just a way to end this fairy tale in the most pathetic way."},{"Title":"Blind Alley (An Eve Duncan Forensics Thriller)","review":"I had read some of Iris Johansen's other novels and found them interesting. This one was extremely disappointing. The plot is extremely far-fetched and stretches credulity to the breaking point. But most disappointing is the stilted dialogue which just doesn't ring real. The one saving grace was the interesting historical information about Pompeii/Herculaneum.When I finished reading this novel, I wondered: How does a book like this on to the bestseller lists? Are we all sheep?"},{"Title":"Blind Alley (An Eve Duncan Forensics Thriller)","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I read it one day. Some of it was a little off the wall, but still a great read. I have read all of Johansen's books and she continues to be one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Blind Alley (An Eve Duncan Forensics Thriller)","review":"This was a gift for a friend. Arrived in mint condition on time! Thanks Alot."},{"Title":"Blind Alley (An Eve Duncan Forensics Thriller)","review":"I like the characters and the plot, even though it is far fetched. Readers of Eve Duncan series may be dissapointed as this book deals more with Jane (the daughter). I hope that Ms. Johansen ages Jane a little more in the next book. It is hard to imagine adults taking orders from a 17 yr.old no matter how rational they may be."},{"Title":"Blind Alley (An Eve Duncan Forensics Thriller)","review":"After Fatal Tide I swore I would never read another of her books, but then this got such good reviews, so I decided to give it a try. It was nice to see Joe and Eve but the story was about Jane, and teens are really not that interesting, especially not her burgeoning sexuality, and attraction for a con man she lambastes at every turn. Trevor the likeable but unpredictable villain is sure to be back, as the author quite proudly tells us to look forward to the next book in 2005. If it is anything like this one, give it a miss.There is no hero, no villain, and the whole nonsense with Eve mourning her dead daughter and never being able to forgive Joe for wanting to give her closure is too repetitive. These characters are like robots which lurch in response to stimuli. The whole engine running on the fuel of a serial killer killing women around the world who look like Jane is just too unbelievable and really not that interesting. The whole novel was strung together episodically like a soap opera. Really dull. The ending was delivered with the sequel in mind and thus cheats people reading for so many pages. Get it out of the library if you must, but otherwise, save your money and time."},{"Title":"Blind Alley (An Eve Duncan Forensics Thriller)","review":"I was glad to see it wasn't just me who had problems with this book. I have read all of Iris Johansen's books and have loved them. Picking up one of her books always was a guarantee that you would spend several action packed enjoyable hours. This one, however, I could not get in to. I tried several times, but ended up flipping to the end chapter and then putting the book in the \\"to give away\\" pile. I hope that her next book - sequel or continuation of Jane's story - turns out better than this one. To me, a major disappointment."},{"Title":"Blind Alley (An Eve Duncan Forensics Thriller)","review":"Absolute garbage. The plot is so silly it is not even worth calling it far-fetched, with all sorts of mumbo-jumbo - history, reincarnation, volcanic eruption thrown in. Again we have this superintelligent supertough guy (Indiana Jones/James Bond/computer whizz all rolled into one, & he has a sensitive side as well) who then lusts after a schoolgirl nearly half his age. What, he couldn't find a woman his age despite all his accomplishments. BTW did I mention he was also super-rich? The only reason I finished the book (with large parts unread) was with the hope somehow Aldo & Trevor would turn out to be the same guy with multiple personalities but that didn't happen. And I have never read such unrealistic characters, a 17-yr old who has no friends of her age and acts like a grown professional woman, no amount of her experience on the streets can make me buy that, & Eve Duncan & Joe Quinn are among the weakest characters I have come across. Sorry this was my first, & going to be last, Iris Johansen. The mystery is not this book, but how this writer has adoring fans."},{"Title":"Blind Alley (An Eve Duncan Forensics Thriller)","review":"This book brings back Eve Duncan, Joe Quinn and their adopted seventeen-year-old daughter, Jane MacGuire. Jane is having nightmares about a woman (herself or someone else?) trying to escape from a tunnel. This just happens to coincide with a deranged wacko, Aldo, who is stalking and killing women who look like Cira, a beautiful actress in Herculaneum who died two thousand years ago when Vesuvius blew its cork. Aldo is obsessed with the long-dead Cira because his archeologist father was so obsessed with finding her treasures among the ruins that he ignored his son. Aldo thinks Jane is Cira and is, of course, out to obliterate every last reminder of Cira.Jane devises a plan to bring Aldo into the open so the authorities can grab him. She enlists the help of Eve, Joe, and a shadowy character, Mark Trevor, who just happened to show up out of nowhere to help catch Aldo. They all end up in a tunnel in Herculaneum (big surprise) to see who will live and who will die.In my humble opinion, this is not one of the author's better stories. I know this is fiction, but everything is a bit of a stretch on the credibility scale. However, she leaves enough dangling hints for the next book."},{"Title":"Blind Alley (An Eve Duncan Forensics Thriller)","review":"When I read Johansen's Body Of Lies, I found her dialogue stilted, her characters cliched and her writing style juvenile. But the plot moved quickly and had some good surprises, which is why I purchased this follow-up, Blind Alley.The focus moves from Eve Duncan to her adopted daughter Jane, who is the target of a serial killer murdering all women who resemble some 2000-year-old dead woman. This situation results in Jane crossing paths with a con man who wants to capture this killer (his reasons are never adequately explained, however).Blind Alley is writing at its most generic and bland. Dialogue doesn't resemble how people actually speak, characters are barely distinguishable, and their motivations are rarely explained or rationalised. While the book kept me relatively involved, I was stunned that something so formulaic, repetitive and basic could ever be released on the general public. If you don't care about what you're writing, Ms. Johansen, why should your readers?"},{"Title":"Blind Alley (An Eve Duncan Forensics Thriller)","review":"I have read all of Iris Johansen's Eve Duncan series, and I'm sorry to say, this book was a real waste of paper and ink. It is poorly written with a completely stupid plot. A tremendous disappointment to all of us Eve Duncan fans."},{"Title":"Blind Alley (An Eve Duncan Forensics Thriller)","review":"I bought it to read on the plane. Thank goodness I had knitting along as well (I finished a sock and then, luckily, my seatmate finished People magazine!) I believe this is the first book that I've tried to read by Ms. Johansen, it will be the last. I'll pass it on to some friends that are fans of the genre and get their feedback, but I can't see that I will need to check out this author again (although it does sound like several of the previous reviewers have enjoyed Ms. Johansen's earlier works).I thought that what might be keeping me from enjoying the book was because I hadn't read earlier works and am not familiar with the characters of Joe and Eve (who did intrigue me). The Trevor character confused me and the whole initial meeting between Trevor, Joe, and Eve struck me as a bit off . . . I'm not sure that the reader should be questioning the character before the other characters do the questioning . . .This book is just bad on so many levels . . . I'm not even halfway into it and will abandon it. Thank goodness many of the airport newsstands now make a \\"Read and Return\\" offer and don't care whether or not the customer enjoyed the book!"},{"Title":"Blind Alley (An Eve Duncan Forensics Thriller)","review":"Okay, first and foremost, I have been a huge fan of Iris since I started a few years ago with The Ugly Duckling, purely because a Johansen book could take you away on a thrilling and original ride. Now, the more I read of hers, the more confused I am as to what happened to this one.Just before Blind Alley I finished Dead Aim, which I absolutely loved. For some reason, I began to see undeniable parallels between Judd Morgan, the title character in Dead Aim, and in Mark Trevor. While Judd came off as sexy, smart, and intriguing, Trevor was like some carbon rip-off, with the same background and no added character.I was also disappointed in the lack of story, and the very unlikable character Jane. Even in the earlier The Killing Game, Jane was completely unlike a ten year old and was just a little rude. Now, at seventeen, she is the same and maybe a little worse. Not to mention the endless story of Cira mixed in, I found myself wondering why all the bad luck always ends up on Eve's doorstep or in this case Jane's. I myself am seventeen and I couldn't even begin to relate with anything Jane said or did and I found it really unbelievable that she had any chemistry with Trevor.Finally, I hated the misuse of my longtime favorite Joe. While previously Joe was the central figure and understanding hero, here he is reduced to being a push and shove toy between Eve and Jane; oh, and what is up with Eve with her bickering and all?I suppose I am being to harsh on this book, even though I love Iris and all of her characters. It's just that Jane and Trevor were everything I choose to avoid when reading fiction. When the characters don't appeal, how could the story?Don't get me wrong, I'm still reading the rest of her future novels, but I know I'll be missing Countdown."},{"Title":"Blind Alley (An Eve Duncan Forensics Thriller)","review":"I am a big fan of Iris Johannsen's books. I am normally glued to them until I finish. I read Fatal Tide in 1 1/2 days. I normally enjoy the Eve Duncan series. I just couldn't seem to get into this book. I didn't enjoy it as much. I almost felt it was too far fetched.I look forward to anything else that the author will be putting out. I was just disappointed in this book."},{"Title":"The Dog Who Knew Too Much (Rachel Alexander & Dash Mysteries)","review":"Unable to accept that her beloved daughter Lisa, who seemed to have it all, committed suicide, Marsha Jacobs hires private investigator Rachel Alexander to investigate what really happened to her child. Rachel and her pit bull Dash walk the streets of Manhattan in an attempt to learn the truth. Rachel soon receives some sound advice that she heeds from Lisa's former boss, who tells her that in order to learn what happened to the victim, &quot;you must walk in her shoes.&quot;Rachel Lisa soon copies Lisa's lifestyle by adopting all of her activities and even moving into Lisa's apartment. Rachel studies the martial arts at the same dojo that Lisa attended. She joins Lisa's health club and eats in the same Greenwich Village restaurants that the deceased frequented. Rachel begins to understand the victim and concludes a murder did, indeed, occur. However, Rachel has not gotten any closer to uncovering the killer's identity than when she first started on the case.Readers will enjoy the Rachel and Dash mystery series as the lead protagonists make a charming pair of detectives. The tours of Manhattan are an added bonus and the story line is very exciting. However, THE DOG WHO KNEW TOO MUCH tends to repeat much of the same ground covered by its predecessor (THIS DOG FOR HIRE), thereby leaving readers of the first novel with the feeling that they knew too much going into this tale. Still, Carol Lea Benjamin shows much promise as writer, who, hopefully, will widen her interesting couple's adventures in the next installment.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Dog Who Knew Too Much (Rachel Alexander & Dash Mysteries)","review":"This reviewer is grateful that this book was not her first Dash mystery, because it would have been her last. Ms. Benjamin is too talented a writer to be judged on the basis of what one can only hope is a major and temporary lapse in judgment. If you're looking to try her work, go straight to her first book. In this book, Rachel Alexander comes off as not very likeable: wearing the victim's clothes and jewelry, sleeping with the victim's boyfriend, trying to live the victim's life....all of this has Rachel coming across as a rather sick voyeuristic woman...In fact, her treatment of the victim's boyfriend makes her a rather cruel and callous one. This reviewer does not understand the purpose behind having the victim's dog witness the crime or how the dog even figures into the plot at all. And not enough Dash in this book! Dash is but a secondary decoration in this book...and Rachel even goes out into a dangerous situation in the dead of night, and leaves him behind!!! The only good things I can say about the book is the writing style is good and you will be kept guessing as to what happened in the victim's last moment until the book's end; the problem is that by that point, you'll not care if Rachel herself winds up sharing the victim's fate. Ms. Benjamin is a better writer than this; her character needs rehabilitation after this book.....The readership deserves more Dash and less trash.....This reviewer's advice: Only resort to this Dash mystery when you've read all of the others......"},{"Title":"The Dog Who Knew Too Much (Rachel Alexander & Dash Mysteries)","review":"The narrator is a female dog-trainer turned private detective. The victim is her cousin, who apparently jumped out the window of the t'ai chi dojo where she was the favored apprentice, and an Akita is witness. Everyone has a motive and opportunity; who did it? The author manages a neat ending without turning the dojo into the center of an international conspiracy to smuggle nuclear weapons or whatever..."},{"Title":"The Dog Who Knew Too Much (Rachel Alexander & Dash Mysteries)","review":"This second book of Ms. Benjamin's was a huge improvement over her first book. At least in this book, the main focus is Lisa's alleged suicide and not the actual dog component of the book. However, as with the first book, I like the fact that Rachel throws herself into the case with tenacity. However, I think Rachel's concept of 'walking in Lisa's shoes' by going so far as to stay at Lisa's apartment, wear Lisa's clothes and jewelry, and doing all the activities that Lisa did was a little over the top. There's a big leap from putting yourself in somebody's place to completely taking over their life. The people who were part of Lisa's life who are Rachel's prime suspects are all odd and quirky, but it leant more to the story when trying to figure out which one did it and why."},{"Title":"The Dog Who Knew Too Much (Rachel Alexander & Dash Mysteries)","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Being a dog lover I thought the book was great! Even if you are not a dog lover though the mystery was very good and it kept you guessing. It didn't spend too much time talking about dogs but just enough for us dog lovers. I have an Akita so that is the reason I read it but now that I did I will definately get other books by this author."},{"Title":"The Dog Who Knew Too Much (Rachel Alexander & Dash Mysteries)","review":"I had tried to order this book through a book store(Borders) in my area & they could not get it for me.

Although it is not meant for people with just a casual interest in the area, it is nevertheless an indispensable book for academics and for people serious about the topic.It is also far more readable and understandable than Daniel Spurber's book which provides little of the working intuition of O'Hara. In fact Spurber is meant more for the theoretical economist with an interest in market microstructure, whereas O'Hara appeals to a broader audience in the field of finance."},{"Title":"Market Microstructure Theory","review":"I do not imagine a faculty of management's library without this book avalailable for M.Sc. and Ph.D. students.As opposed to another reviewer, I really liked the structure. Starting with inventory problems, then dealing with asymetric information and finally going thru agent's strategic behavior; you get the big picture regarding the main issues in market microstructure.Maybe a bit more detail and explanations on the derivation of some basic models would have been more value added. Unfortunately, you must move on to the original published academic paper to get a fully understanding of any particular model. You cannot rely exclusively on the book."},{"Title":"Market Microstructure Theory","review":"If you are serious about learning Market Microstructure this book is a great preview to reading the actual papers. It gives you enough intuition that you can approach classic papers by Stoll, Glosten and Milgrom, Easley and O'Hara, Kyle, etc.Also, you do not need a serious knowledge of the subject matter to open this book (although it helps to have an undergraduate level investments class under your belt). However, finance prerequisites aside, you should be prepared with a fairly thorough knowledge of microeconomics and statistics. A semester or two at a good graduate economics program should do the trick. Otherwise, this can be a tough read."},{"Title":"Market Microstructure Theory","review":"High frequency trading involves a deep understanding about the dynamics of the double auction book, how orders are being placed in the queue, the probability of being filled, etc. This book is indispensible and unique on this regard. No high frequency trader will survive these days' market microstructure unless she/he is familiar with the models and concepts discussed in this brilliant work.A lifetime of brilliant research is condensed into this book. Those who dismiss it because it is theoretically sound and rigurous will be punished when that same theory they didn't care to understand plays with their portfolio.I'm glad to say that this book saved my day on May 6th 2010, the same day when Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and many others lost hundreds of millions of dollars. Additional proof that this book is today more relevant than ever."},{"Title":"Market Microstructure Theory","review":"This year is the fifteenth anniversary of publication of the \\"Market Microstructure Theory.\\" Since then, many books on the subject appeared, most prominently Hasbrouck's \\"Empirical Market Microstructure\\" (2007) for advanced readers and L. Harris' textbook for the first acquaintance with the subject(2002), but none, as yet, can substitute for readability and mathematical presentation of MMT. I had not obtain yet a copy of DeJong's book (2009), which seems interesting in its scope and composition. Even this author published in 2009 his error-ridden and overpriced (not my fault!) book--in which I attempted to organize material appearing since 1995 in a logical sequence--but failed. I give it four stars only because if I give five, where should we put La Divina Comedia and Anna Karenina? But the whole subject of microstructure is in dire need of work summarizing the latest achievements and outlining the failed promises. Nowhere it is as pertinent as in the field of high-frequency trading that did not exist when M.

Although the book is not written for the average mba student, a careful read would benefit anyone interested in the structure of markets."},{"Title":"Market Microstructure Theory","review":"I have both an economics and statistics background and I found this a tough read for several reasons.Economic students would love this book.Most of my issues are realted to the writing style and presenation of the information. The style is academic and is not a pleasure read by any means. The other issue is that you almost have to read this in order. Some of the formulas are not obvious, and they are explained in one paragraph 100 pages ago, and that is it.Most of the math is statistics and probability, so if you have a good background in the math then it is not as bad.The other issue I had with it is the endless references to other papers, yes I know they have to be cited, but I wish there would be more of a background in some of the instances..So why the 4 stars.. Because there is alot of great information in this for everyone. The appendix on Bayesian is worth getting the book alone. The authors analysis is also priceless.While at this point the market is full of books cover this subject, and this is probably dated in some aspects, it is still worth the read.Even if you don't understand the math, the authors coverage of the material and discussion provides valuable insight."},{"Title":"Market Microstructure Theory","review":"The book is meant to describe market microstructure. My discovery is that one needs to know a lot about the subject matter to get anything out of it. I had the feeling of reading footnotes without seeing the text! It quotes authors and papers without the slightest indication as to what they are about. I do not recommend it. But there are other books covering the subject. Campbell, Lo and McKinlay (The Econometrics of Financial Markets) proovides in one chapter more information that this book.

Having heard various horror stories about the horrendous prisons there, Gregory's book perked my interest.If you have read Warren Fellow's similar account, read this one! Unlike Fellows, Gregory fully admits her guilt, still finds beauty in Thailand and its people, and was honest about what she thought she deserved. I had a lot of sympathy for her.Like many young travelers, Gregory was naive, sick, desperate to get home, and broke. She agreed to be a mule for smugling drugs out of Thailand. Her reward: 1000 pounds, more than enough to get her back home to the UK.It is not uncommon for young travelers to do Southeast Asia on a VERY limited budget. Many people set out for a year or more at a time. Though SE Asia is very inexpensive compared to the West, funds can run out. Or even if that is not the case, some naive travelers see smuggling (drugs, gems, silk, etc) as an easy way to make some good money.I think that ANYONE heading out to Southeast Asia to backpack through the area MUST read this book. It is a harsh reminder that no matter how easy transporting drugs may seem, it is simply not worth the risk. Many people think &quot;that could never happen to me,&quot; but if you read Gregory's story, you quickly realize that it can and does. Gregory was not a repeat smuggler. She had never done anything like that in her life. And she really paid for her crime. There are MANY farang in Thai prisons who were young, naive, first time mules like Gregory.Gregory hopes that her horror story will convince travelers, like herself, NOT do try anything like that.All around a good (though horrifying) read that portrayed a VERY different side of the same country, even the same city (Bangkok), that I had been enjoying."},{"Title":"Forget You Had a Daughter: Doing Time in the 'Bangkok Hilton': Sandra Gregory's Story","review":"Gregory's book details her life from meeting the guy who offered her money to smuggle drugs, to her life in Thai prisons, adapting to the harsh way of life and finally moving back home to a British prison. The development of her character from beginning to end is evident to all through her concise narrative about her guilt and shame, especially when she speaks of her family members. All in all, this is a haunting real-life story that shouldn't be missed by anyone, especially Caucasians travelling for long periods of time in Southeast Asia. The temptation may be great when funds are running low, but the horrors of prisons in the less-developed regions are not exaggerated."},{"Title":"Forget You Had a Daughter: Doing Time in the 'Bangkok Hilton': Sandra Gregory's Story","review":"On the way back to Taipei City, TAIWAN, I picked this book just to have something to read on the airplane. It turned out to be a very interesting book and one of the favourite ones that I would recommend to my friends. I am Thai and when I watched Thai movies about Thai prisons, I always thought the stories were a bit exaggerated. Kneeling down when talk to the officers? Sex between prisoner and prisoner, prisoner and officer? Stunningly, after finishing this book, I realize how accurate and surprisingly good this book is. This book deserves a good recommendation, indeed!"},{"Title":"Forget You Had a Daughter: Doing Time in the 'Bangkok Hilton': Sandra Gregory's Story","review":"Having lived in Thailand for a gratifying 5 years, I am familiar with everything she describes and feels for the country. Thailand is a stunning country known as the \\"land of smiles\\" but numerous people don't realize that behind those smiles there is an entire different side to Thailand. That life I like most people have never gone through and do not realize how hideous it is. That is what this book is about, a book filled with fact stating the hideous side of Thailand. I was traumatized by some of the events not realizing that such a beautiful country has such a dark side too it when crossing the path of a good person to breaking the rules. I think it is definitely worthwhile reading, it touches your heart so much because you realize that as we speak about the harsh life in prison there are people out there in those hideous prisons which animals control who think they are gods and the prisoners are slaves. Even though Sandra Gregory made a huge mistake the reason for such was so understandable. Even though she smuggled the drugs I think she is a great and caring person helping others realize that you should think twice before smuggling drugs. This is one of the unsurpassed books I have ever read, it isn't an enjoyable book, where you can laugh, it is depressing and sad but so realistic because you know this is a true story, which a human being has been through. Some of the events disgust you but you continue to read because the book has so much gratitude to it."},{"Title":"Forget You Had a Daughter: Doing Time in the 'Bangkok Hilton': Sandra Gregory's Story","review":"This was a rather timely read given the current situation in South East Asia with Sharpelle Corby and the Bali 9. In this book, Gregory tells the story of how she set out from Britain to spend 8 weeks in Thailand, accompanying a friend of a friend she had no previous acquaintance with. Gregory loved Thailand so much that she decided to stay on, until she became seriously ill and distraught over the political situation at the time. Having no money to return to Britain and too stubborn to ask her family for financial support, she 'serendipitously' re-encounters her former travelling companion who offers her one thousand pounds to smuggle a small quantity of heroin for him. Desperately ill and under the impression her acquaintence has 'fixed' things at customs, she agrees. She is, of course, caught.The story describes her time at Lard Yao, known worldwide as the 'Bangkok Hilton' and the shocking conditions she was forced to endure. Following her transfer to a British prison, Gregory continues her tale, drawing contrasts between the penal systems of the two countries, and finding Britain to be the worse of the two.Of particular interest were Gregory's encounters with some very notorious offenders such as Rosemary West. She also speaks of the shadow of Myra Hindley in two of the prisons she was incarcerated in. I actually found the second part of the book, where Gregory was in British prisons to be more horrifying than her descriptions of Thai prisons.Gregory's book is very readable, honest and pulls no punches. However, at the end, you realise that Gregory's book is not so much about her physical survival, but her emotional survival and the evolution of her soul."},{"Title":"Forget You Had a Daughter: Doing Time in the 'Bangkok Hilton': Sandra Gregory's Story","review":"I saw her story on National Geographic's \\"Locked Up Abroad\\" and did a google search the next day to learn more about her story. I found she had written a memoir and ordered the book. I read it within 24 hours - it was very interesting and as the others mention, feel it should be required reading by students before travelling abroad. I myself am naive in assuming the best in people and probably could have easily found myself in her shoes had I travelled that early in my life."},{"Title":"Forget You Had a Daughter: Doing Time in the 'Bangkok Hilton': Sandra Gregory's Story","review":"I have just returned from holiday in Thailand and most intrigued with the country. I am loving the book and can relate to the places she visited in the book. An interesting and breathtaking read, especially if you have visited the country and loved the country. Moral of the story - do not do drugs!"},{"Title":"Forget You Had a Daughter: Doing Time in the 'Bangkok Hilton': Sandra Gregory's Story","review":"This was one of those books that I honestly could not put down. I'm sure everyone knows that feeling, when you just lose yourself in the words and are transported to the world laid out in front of you. I read it in three days (between working each day and socialising on at least two of those evenings) so it's fair to say that I loved it. If you have ever wondered what it would be like to be arrested in a foreign country and sent to prison, this book is for you.Sandra Gregory was caught attempting to smuggle 89 grams of heroin out of Bangkok's Don Muang airport in 1993. Unsurprisingly, she was caught, along with her co-conspirator Robert Locke, the man she claims asked her to carry the drugs. Her detailed description of the lead up to the arrest and her uncanny sense of dread that things were going to end badly is compelling to read. Sandra lets you inside her thoughts and gives a clear insight into the horrifying predicament she found herself in, both before, during and after the arrest.Sandra provides a fairly detailed description of her life growing up in Hollingbourne in the UK, helping the reader to gain some degree of understanding of her as a person (pre-arrest) - her relationship with her family and her hopes and dreams for the future. In my opinion, this part of the book was a bit long winded and I would have preferred a shorter version.She then proceeds to tell her story post-arrest and this is where things get powerfully irresistible to read. As the reader, I felt like I was there with her, during her first days in Lard Yao Women's Prison, her depression and her hopes for freedom that were so often dashed. You can easily see through her storytelling of the worst chapter in her life, why she made the heartbreaking decision to ask for her family to forget they had a daughter.There are two main parts to this book, the first of Sandra's experience of living in Lard Yao Prison, followed by her transfer to the United Kingdom where she was housed with some of England's worst female criminals. She describes the contrasts in prison life and the legal bureaucracy her and her family faced in their fight for her freedom. Importantly, she candidly discusses the fact that she was guilty of the crime that she committed and that she deserved to be punished. At no point does she try to justify what she did, other than to offer her reasons for doing it, which is refreshing.I highly recommend this book.Sandra Gregory was interviewed for a documentary on \\"Banged Up Abroad\\" which can be found on YouTube. &lt;...>"},{"Title":"Forget You Had a Daughter: Doing Time in the 'Bangkok Hilton': Sandra Gregory's Story","review":"Very well written - so well written I read the whole lot in two sittings...

While reading the book in bed sipping on coffee, I could walk to the kitchen to grab a bite to eat or go for a long hot bath if I felt like it. Sandra Gregory could not do any of this. She spent years in jail under shocking and appalling circumstances. Her crime? She naively attempted to traffic heroin out of Thailand for a near-stranger in order to make enough money to fly home to England. She initially received the death sentence which was reduced to life and then to 25 years. After serving years in a Thai prison and then several British prisons with hardened criminals and murderers she eventually received a king's pardon. In telling her story, Sandra takes full responsibility for her actions and never comes across wanting you to feel sorry for her. Even so, I felt that her punishment was way too harsh for the crime. This book is a harrowing tale of how one stupid decision can turn your life around in an instant. It is a riveting read and left me feeling thankful that I have never had to endure anything near what Sandra has endured. If you enjoy affliction memoirs, this one is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Forget You Had a Daughter: Doing Time in the 'Bangkok Hilton': Sandra Gregory's Story","review":"I just loved every minute of reading this book, I thought it was so well written and shocking and brutally honest.

Young people take a lot of chances and this young lady took one too - big mistake. She should have just called home and asked her parents for money. That's what parents are there for (I'm a parent, and I know!). I enjoyed the book immensely and felt badly for the author who lost a lot of years in her young life to prison. Glad that she's doing well now and has moved on! On a lighter note, my daughter walked past the book on my dresser and was very hurt to think that I would read a book about trying to forget that I had her. I had to explain the title to her and I also had to interject a life lesson about the potential dangers of traveling abroad with drugs. I think she was sorry she brought the whole subject up!"},{"Title":"Forget You Had a Daughter: Doing Time in the 'Bangkok Hilton': Sandra Gregory's Story","review":"I felt the gamut of emotions when I read this book. I felt there weren't enough words described by the author for her reason to smuggle the drugs in the first place.She described how she needed the money, but what were the underlying real reasons she would put herself through such risk? I never felt satisfied with her answer. I kept wondering how anyone would risk being jailed abroad--maybe a combination of youthful naivete' and extreme risk taking?Her account of her prison time was heart breaking and difficult to read, at times. She is truly a survivor."},{"Title":"Forget You Had a Daughter: Doing Time in the 'Bangkok Hilton': Sandra Gregory's Story","review":"Sandra Gregory takes us deep inside life in a Thailand women's prison and then into the Durham prison of England. Life was terrible for this woman who was arrested for drug trafficking a very small amount of heroin in her vagina. She truly did not deserve such a long and harrowing sentence. She is a hero in my opinion for having survived such an incredibly soul-destroying incarceration. God bless Sandy for writing such a critically-needed memoir. Her book should be on everybody's required reading list, especially high school and college-age kids. They could benefit from Sandy's horrible experience, and might be deterred from doing the same.

I enjoyed reading the book for several reasons. One, as a ex-pat resident of Thailand, I could relate to and even walk past many of the places she described. Second, I'm a sucker for real-life dramas--the gorier, the better. And third, from reading the book,it was a shocking realization that as an ex-pat, one cannot necessarily rely on one's embassy to \\"take care\\" of any legal entanglements while in the Kingdom of Thailand (ex-pats living here are generally very spoiled and well-taken-care of). I also felt sorry for Sandra, as there are more heinous crimes than the one she commited every day herethat go unnoticed, unpunished (ie, sex-slavery, child trafficking).The prose is readable, enjoyable, but not beautiful nor well-crafted, However, anyone travelling to Thailand as a backpacker or as a tourist would be well-served to read this book. Many legal aspects of Thailand seem erratic or lackadasical compared to Western countries, but if you DO get caught doing wrong, the consequences are harsh indeed."},{"Title":"Forget You Had a Daughter: Doing Time in the 'Bangkok Hilton': Sandra Gregory's Story","review":"that you should always listen to your gut instincts.

The Makioka Sisters is about four sisters living in pre-World War Two Japan. The sisters are from a Samurai family which is declining in fortunes. Two of the sisters are married and spend most of the three books trying to get the other two sisters married. The book really allows us to see Japanese daily life, from interaction between families, worries about employment, the traditions, the holidays, the fashions and even problems a normal family had. The book, funny enough, got the author in trouble because it was about nothing. It neither attacked the government or military nor did the book support or help the national war effort. It was thought of as a waste of paper.The chronology in the front of the book is very useful to understand what is happening during the author's life. If you want a taste of Japanese life, this is it. But it isn't a bus or train book. It is 498 pages of small print, complex plots and twisted sisters. Not easy, no matter how much you love Japanese culture. But worth it."},{"Title":"The Makioka Sisters","review":"This book holds a very special place in my reading history. It opened my mind in the subtlest of ways. It is a book about the meeting of cultures, east and west, and to my surprise neither side wins. Tanizaki shows that blindly revering the past can yield fatal results, but so can blindly flying into the future. Tanizaki's sentiments lie somewhere inbetween. The novel is longer than most and moves at a pace which reveres eastern tradition while assimilating western forms, in short, this is a perfectly poised work that does not sacrifice anything to short term gain nor martyr itself for some unwinnable cause. Tanizaki is a master at a game that his whole culture is (and less obviously ours) is playing. Neither way is completely correct and neither way wrong. The characters in this magnificent novel all walk in between. In some ways the novel belongs to the twenties in which it was written, in other ways it belongs to us."},{"Title":"The Makioka Sisters","review":"This is a sweeping view of a changing Japanese aristocratic and domestic life. As everyone else has said, it's a long book, and it's not flashy, but its characters are enigmatic and real, and after you have read it you wish there was more. I suppose that it does in fact earn the praise given on its back cover--at least as far as my limited reading of the modern Japanese classics would allow me to judge."},{"Title":"The Makioka Sisters","review":"This is one of the rare books which makes you unconsciously smile as you read. The language is beautiful and the pages are full of poignant scenes of personal discovery and familial relationships. I loved the chapter where Sachiko is complaining (lovingly) about O-haru. As an American living in Japan, the insight into Japanese culture and tradition was only a bonus in comparison to the pure joy this novel provided me as I read it. I rushed to finish it but didn't want it to end. Books like that are few and far between."},{"Title":"The Makioka Sisters","review":"This is Tanizaki's masterpiece.

It is probably a cultural thing but I feel it could have been edited to a short story. And should have been. The writing wasn't bad but not fantastic but it just went on into ever more minute detail for no story advancement and to me the ending was left hanging. I could not recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Makioka Sisters","review":"I am somewhat reminded of Willa Cather's works in that there is not any real action or deep plot but boy is there a lot of story. Unlike Cather, however, The Makioka Sisters spans a relatively few years in the lives of its characters. The whole plot, if you can call it that, revolves around trying to get the third of four sisters married. The problem is that Tanizaki could have made the story half as long or twice as long as it is. Unfortunately, he chose the latter. However, it is well written and an easy read. Although I did enjoy most of it, I began getting impatient about 100 pages from the end. Tanizaki must also have thought it was time to wrap things up as he seems to have rushed things at the end trying to wrap up loose ends. I would like to give this 3 1/2 stars but half stars aren't permitted."},{"Title":"The Makioka Sisters","review":"Transcending the barrier between the Japanese and American minds requires direct experience that no amount of reading can supply.

A wonderful portrayal of a society through a tiny detailed snapshot. I especially enjoy the sympathetic character of the second sister's husband, as it is rare to find such a thoroughly likable man in a book primarily about women."},{"Title":"The Makioka Sisters","review":"The Makioka Sisters (Sasame Yuki, Light Snow), first published in 1948, was written by Junichiro Tanizaki (1886-1965). Tanizaki wrote The Makioka Sisters after translating the Tale of Genji into modern Japanese and the Murasaki novel is said to have influenced his own. It tells of the declining years of the once powerful Makioka family and their last descendants, four sisters. It has been translated by Edward G. Seidensticker in 1957. Powerfully realistic, it mourns the passing of greatness while celebrating in wonderfully evocative detail the beauty of a particular time and place, Osaka in the 1930s. In its creation of beauty out of sadness it can be compared to another family saga, The Maias (1888), by the Portuguese master Ea de Queiroz (1845-1900).Why is this long book, largely concerned with trivial family procedures, one of the finest novels written? It is not concerned with great events, causes or philosophies. It has little concern with the war Japan was fighting with China, and then the USA, when the book was first published. Indeed its characters don't think about the war, and in a positive way, which doesn't trivialise their concerns at all (most people in fact don't think about the reasons for a war: perhaps it's better that way). This doesn't mean the book is escapist or superficial, just as the concern with women's lifestyle, dress, makeup, etiquette or social vanity make it something written just for women (books and films were once made - by men - to capitalise on what were considered women's 'little' concerns). Tanizaki does that wonderful thing a great artist can do, he finds the universal in the most exact examination of the particular, and makes a work of relevance to us all. Read another family saga, The Brothers Karamazov (1880) and my candidate for the greatest novel yet written (though I'm more than cynical about the word 'great') and marvel at the many routes artists find to the universal.My review is impossibly partial: The Makioka Sisters is the most beautiful novel I've ever read. The language (translation) is so smooth and flowing, the characters and situations so gentle and muted, yet precise and meaningful, that reading the book is like seeing the universe in a drop of water - you see, which is moving, and awareness of where and how you see brings amazement and then a real pleasure.In this beautiful book the characters have a greater degree of reality than many real people - Tanizaki is a great master of characterisation. I know more about them than I do about most of the people I know. It is done by the accumulation of enormous amounts of detail, but detail which, trivial though it may appear, is just right. The result is the creation of a most ethereal and delicate beauty, a lovely world crumbling to extinction yet all the more precious because of its inevitable passing away.Sachiko, the second sister and her husband Teinosuke are that rare achievement, a convincing depiction of really good and admirable people, though in no way heroic. They are very ordinary people, but their goodness, their little troubles and worries, their faults, even weaknesses, all serve to charm and captivate. Of all the characters in the book these two are the loveliest. It is a real affirmation of humanity to have created two such kind and gentle and sensitive people, and to have made them so real and convincing.The careworn life of Tsuruko (first sister), the hesitations of Yukiko (third sister), the unhappiness of Taeko (Koi-san, fourth sister) all gain from contrast with the stability and happiness of Sachiko and Teinosuke. And what an evocation of the old ways of Japan. Changing rapidly even as Tanizaki writes of them.Detail by detail - Etsuko's games with the German girl Rosemarie, Itakura's leather coat, the 'old one', Koi-san's mimicry and mingled love and resentment of Yukiko...there are literally thousands of details. Teinosuke's love of Spring in his garden, the vitamin injections the sisters take, the forthrightness of Itani - all, everyone, is so precise, not random at all, chosen to evoke mood, reveal character, show milieu.So powerful and evocative has the book been - yet nothing really happens, except to Koi-san. The war approaches, the old Japan changes, Yukiko gets married - unforgettable!I've seen advertised a TV serialisation of The Makioka Sisters, but can't imagine how it could succeed. So much of the book's effect is through language. Visually, certain scenes stand out, such as the cherry blossom viewing or the flood. The narrative though is largely uneventful, small actions that dramatically and convincingly reveal a character's state of mind, early history or personality.Written with love, a strong love of people and place, the book creates love in the reader. Because of Tanizaki I have loved Osaka in the late 1930s and have learned to treasure and respect its people. For those hesitating to undertake reading such a 'Japanese' work as The Makioka Sisters there is the perfect bridging novel The Wind-up Bird Chronicle (Nejimaki-dori kuronikuru, 1995) by Haruki Murakami, which does mention the war - and Charlie Parker and 'hard-boiled' detective stories and Jungian archetypes and the surreal: a roller coaster of a novel and one of the best as well."},{"Title":"The Makioka Sisters","review":"The Makioka Sisters is a special novel for two reasons. Much of Japanese literature this century is very taut and relatively short. One thinks of Soseki, Mishima, Dazai, Kawabata and the two most important of Tanizaki's other novels, Some Prefer Nettles and Diary of a Mad Old Man. Instead of being 150-200 pages, this book is around 500 pages. The popular description of this book, about a merchant family in decline, might imply a book like Budenbrooks. Yet this book is very different from Thomas Mann's fine novel. For a start it only covers four years, not a couple of generations. More important the theme of decline is not a primary one, and Mann's theme of cultural enervation is absent.What we have instead is a book that seeks to be a work of &quot;photographic realism.&quot; It seeks to be &quot;real&quot; not in the sense that Flaubert or James or Tolstoy are realistic. Instead of portraying complex themes and ideas while keeping an eye on what would be actually plausible, Tanizaki seeks to describe what actually happens. This sort of realism is not highly valued since it is often unimiginative and often psychologically shallow. And indeed in this book it can often appear tedious and unrewarding. But a closer examination reveals certain virtues.In a sense Tanizaki's book is &quot;like life.&quot; The story of Taeko of of the youngest sister who cannot marry because custom dictates she must wait for her older sister Yukiko to be married. The story of her two possible fiancess and the eventual pre-marital pregnancy appear, not as part of a complex, organic scheme as, say, the story of Anna Karenina, but as a series of discrete events, moved often by coincidence and chance. A flood becomes a crucial event, one character is killed by a quack doctor, Taeko becomes ill with dystentry at a crucial moment, a proposal is botched because Yukiko cannot summon the courage to answer the telephone. Since this is often how life happens it is not unrealistic and indeed has a special value of perspective.Tanizaki's sense of style and detail are also interesting. For example there is little on food (by contrast one remembers the Christmas dinner in Buddenbrooks). There is the Japanese emphasis on the intense aesthetic absorption in a taut, sparsely described expression of nature. Two of the leading incidents in the book describe watching cherry trees bloom and having a firefly hunt in the night. At one point Sachiko, the second sister and the most important one in the novel, watches her young daughter and her German friends plays with dolls and the German girl accurately tells where babies come from. It is interesting that Sachiko approves of this realism.Most interesting is the fact that this book takes place from 1936 to 1940, during, of course, the Japanese invasion of China. Tanizaki itself stared writing the book during the second world war, and his publication was delayed on the grounds that it apparently did not help the war effort enough. It was not actually published until 1948, when Japan was occupied by the American occupation. How much did this change the political tone? Perhaps not as much as one might think, since the Makiokas write their German friends that they are pleased that their ally is doing so well in the summer of 1940. Yet at the same time the absence of ideology and fanaticism is striking. The Makiokas naturally agree with the austerity campaigns, they refer to the invasion as the &quot;China Incident&quot; like everyone else, and they vaguely wish for peace. This is not unrealistic per se (the Makiokas are probably too old to worry about conscription) and the absence of politics is also not unrealistic. After all women did not have the right to vote at this time. Before commenting on how the Makiokas have escaped the trap of ideology, and before making comparisons to Jane Austen, one should consider while reading this novel the idea that such privatism is essential to such a regime. Instead of totalitarianism smashing individuals and transforming themselves into empty masses, one should consider the insights of Rudy Koshar and William Sheridan Allen that regimes feed off this sort of privatism and political isolation."},{"Title":"The Makioka Sisters","review":"THE MAKIOKA SISTERS tells the story of the lives and relationships of four sisters in the late 1930's and early 1940's in Osaka, Japan. Tsuruko, the oldest, who is married, acts as the head of the household by nature of her age. Sachiko, the second oldest, also married, is a sensitive and intelligent woman who watches over her younger sisters. Yukiko, unmarried, is extrmeley shy and reserved, and extremely dependent upon Sachiko. The youngest, also unmarried, is Taeko (nicknamed Koi-san), a free spirit who finds that she must break with tradition to be happy. It is the responsibility of Sachiko and her husband Teinosuke to find a suitable husband for Yukiko, who must marry before Taeko as custom dictates.The book takes us through several years in the lives of the Makioka family (curiously, since there were only daughters and no sons, both sisters' husbands took the name Makioka), as they experience the joys and disillusions of life in an extremely close-knit family. As their wealth and prosperity wane, they realize that you sometimes must make sacrifices.It was wonderful to read this book knowing that not only was it written by a native Japanese, but that it was also written in that time period, in the early 1940's. Knowing that every description and every conversation was authentic made this an amazing book.I would highly reccomend this to anyone who has an interest in Japanese customs, society and way of life. It was fascinating."},{"Title":"The Makioka Sisters","review":"The first time I read The Makioka Sisters, I called it \\"fragile and lovely.\\" Recently, I read it again. It's not really fragile and lovely. Actually, it's very matter-of-fact. The narrative mostly recounts events and the characters' reactions to the events. There isn't much description or imagery, like in Kawabata. Even big events like the Osaka flood are recounted straightforwardly, with precision instead of lyricism.But the book is very perceptive about its characters. Tanizaki knew everything about the social class of the Makioka family. The book is full of countless trivial little details about their daily habits, mannerisms, styles of dress and conversations. For example, during one of the family's attempts to marry off the third sister Yukiko, the prospective husband is concerned that she seems moody, and the whole family tries to dissuade him in writing and on the phone. Tanizaki perfectly captures the frantic, businesslike quality of the negotiations, simply by describing their arguments at length. He is so perfectly attuned to the routine of a family of this class that, just by describing it, he can recreate a whole period of history. And his extensive knowledge of small details also makes the narrative very lively, and often funny. The book moves slowly, but I found it addictively readable, both the first time and now.The book is much more than a period piece. It captures the superficiality and transience of a sense of closeness between people. The four Makioka sisters are surely very close to one another. They've been together since they were little, and they get along very well. The three younger sisters live under the same roof until they're all well over thirty. Basically they're each other's closest friends. And yet, the second sister Sachiko has no idea whatsoever about what goes on in her youngest sister Taeko's life. She spends much of the book misinterpreting Taeko's motivations. Taeko also remains friendly towards Sachiko throughout the book, which of course does not in any way prevent her from telling Sachiko nothing of her inner thoughts.Similarly, Sachiko has a very good husband, by any standard. He's very capable, treats his wife well, agrees to support her sisters even though there's really no good reason why he should do so, and engages in self-sacrifice when the situation calls for it. Sachiko should be very close to him, and their marriage is overall harmonious. But their relations are \\"comfortable\\" more than they are \\"close.\\" Sachiko is closer to her younger sisters than to her husband, and we already know the real value of that.The oldest sister Tsuruko grows particularly estranged from the others, since she lives separately from them and also has the formal duty of managing the family. Possibly the most touching moment in the book is a tiny episode in which Sachiko visits Tokyo and goes to the Kabuki without inviting Tsuruko to come along. And Yukiko is the most \\"traditional\\" of the sisters, but she's not particularly fragile. Actually, she's the most physically resilient. And in the ending, she rewards her family's efforts in trying to find a match for her by acting grumpy and aloof toward everyone. Tanizaki subtly points out that she comes to be excited by the prospect of marriage, but what makes this observation so amazingly accurate is that she's excited by the prospect itself, not by any individual man.All this is perhaps the root of the feeling of \\"fragility\\" that I had when I first read the book. It is true that Tanizaki's characters are members of a declining noble family, and that the setting is just before World War II. We know that the Makiokas' comfortable lives will shortly be obliterated, and this is poignant knowledge. But the true \\"decline\\" in the book is not so much one of material wealth or social standing, because Sachiko's husband is still very successful, and Yukiko can still find an attractive match, and hey, their chances of surviving the war are as good as anyone's. The true \\"decline\\" is in the way the book gradually reveals that its characters are not really all that close to each other. Furthermore, it suggests that this particular decline is not a product of modernity, war, or lack of tradition, but rather that it is simply the natural state of things."},{"Title":"The Makioka Sisters","review":"Junichiro Tanizaki's &quot;The Makioka Sisters&quot; (MK) has been hailed as a classic of postwar Japanese literature. In style and content, it resembles Naguib Mahfouz's masterpiece of Egyptian life, &quot;Palace Walk&quot;. The novel relates how the once grand Makioka family clings desperately to the past as it copes unsuccessfully with its declining fortunes and social status, and the encroaching tide of modernity. The Makioka sisters' growing desperation is evocatively captured in their endless shuttles between their beloved hometown Osaka and the increasingly dominant but alien metropolis Tokyo, and in their many failed attempts to marry off the third sister, Yukiko, which according to Japanese tradition, must precede any marriage proposal for the rebellious youngest sister, Taeko. I lost count of the number of miais the unenthusiastic Yukiko had to attend because they all ended the same way. In rejection and tears. These repetitive events that lead to dead ends give the novel a claustrophobic edge, though this has a tendency to wear the reader down. Written in flowing prose and plain narrative, MK offers a richly textured picture of a crumbling order, a society in transition as it begins to take in foreign influences ranging from western fashion to a working lifestyle for women. It is also a time of war and upheaval around the world. Non-Japanese readers may be amused by the plethora of Japanese rituals (eg, the meddling of matchmakers and the customary investigation into the social background of suitors, etc) and their stylised manner of speech and thought, but that's the way it was and to some extent is today. Osaka and Tokyo are metaphors for the old and the new. The Makiokas reveal their parochialism when they complain endlessly about the inferior lifestyle they have to suffer in Tokyo. As a family epic, MK is strangely less than compelling. The plot is static. It goes nowhere. The novel's lack of momentum may not be incongruous with its own artistic ambitions but is ultimately tedious. Characterisation is on the whole shallow, though Sachiko, the second Makioka sister through whose eyes the story is told, is pretty solid and comes to life. So does the rebellious black sheep sister, Taeko. MK is an important but not always engrossing read."},{"Title":"The Makioka Sisters","review":"As in &quot;Buddenbrooks,&quot; we are introduced to a bourgeois family in decline, and through them we enter deeply into their society, so different from our own--and both societies, Germany in the late 19th century and Japan just before World War II, are about to undergo tremendous changes. And as in Jane Austen, the plot is propelled by the search for a husband, in this case for the third Makioka sister. This book is absolutely enthralling. It's long, but the pages fly by."},{"Title":"The Makioka Sisters","review":"Amen to the reviewer who compared this work to Pride and Prejudice. After the first chapter, all I could think was that Jane Austen had been reborn as a Japanese man named Junichiro Tanizaki. This work is intelligent, subtle, and carefully observed. I especially enjoyed the distance Tanizaki kept from his main character, Yukiko. We only understand her from the viewpoint of other characters in the novel--but despite her silence, she dominates the story."},{"Title":"The Makioka Sisters","review":"Tanizaki set out, during the war years, to write a book like The Tale of Genji, in tribute to what was best about the Japanese past. The amazing thing is, that he succeeded. He was able to transfer the spirit of the Japanese masterpiece (which is also a world masterpiece) in modern times and delicately describe a whole civilization which had really been destroyed, even before the war was lost, in the dreadful militarism that caused the war in the first place. This book is beautifully written. As other readers have noted, it does go slowly. So does War and Peace. So do a lot of the other novels that really make you think about life, and love and important issues. The book echoes the leisurely pace of the Makiokas' lives and is very nostalgic--but it is realistic too and does not depict the old society as perfect. Each sister has her own, fascinating character. They do not easily fit into stereotypes. Particularly interesting to me is the character of Taeko, the youngest 'modern' sister who will not (or cannot) behave like her more decorous sister Yukiko, the perfect 'traditional' Japanese woman--who can't get married. Taeko behaves very badly by the standards of her time--and very normally by our standards today. It is interesting to see the tension, and the ways in which her behavior affects everybody around her. Not only are the sisters interesting, but there are many very wonderfully drawn secondary characters, like Saeko's cultured husband, and the foreigners, the Russians, the German family with the two children--Just as interesting as the people though are the customs and the culture. There's cherry-blossom viewing, and a firefly hunt and descriptions of how to wear kimonos and many very wonderful descriptions of Taeko's traditional dance-- It's all a whole different mindset than the way we live today. Really civilized. And yet, at the same time, the Japanese army is committing the horrific atrocities in Nanking--I would read this first, and then Genji, if you haven't done that (you'll really go back to another time). Also best, I think, in the Seidensticker translation.Someone who likes this will probably also really like In the Shade of Spring Leaves, a translation of the stories of Higuchi Ichiyo, along with a biography of a fascinating woman who died way too young."},{"Title":"The Makioka Sisters","review":"This has to be considered Tanizaki's masterpiece. It is a beautifully written, deliciously observed tale of the decline of a privileged upper middle class Osaka family, told through the lives of four sisters. I have read this book three times and learn someting new each time. It is a thoroughly modern story with elusive and ghostly antecedents. Although the tale takes place only 60 years ago, on the eve of pre-war Japan, it describes a world now vanished. Tanizaki's writing is fluid and clear. His description of Kyoto during cherry blossom viewing makes me sorry I've never been there at that season. The sublety Tanizaki brings to the emotions and motives of each of the persons attending Yukiko's many miais is amazing. Unfortunately, the film of about a decade or so ago doesn't do the book justice. Thank you, Tanizaki-san, for giving us the Makioka Sisters."},{"Title":"The Makioka Sisters","review":"This book offers a wonderful glimpse into the pre-war life in Japan among aristocratic women. Four sisters, Tsuruko, Sachiko, Yukiko, and Taeko struggle to maintain the family honor and to construct satisfying lives. This is made especially difficult by Yukiko's inability to find a husband and a tradition that prohibits younger sisters from marrying until the older sisters marry. Addictively engaging, this book takes the reader to Japan to spend some time living in the Makioka sisters' world."},{"Title":"The Makioka Sisters","review":"Just read it! The translation is georgous, the spirit of the Tanizaki's style comes through perfectly."},{"Title":"The Makioka Sisters","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and echo California and Hawaii's descriptions. There really is no concrete action in the book--maybe you need to be a Japanphile to appreciate the wonderfully descriptive detail of Meiji era Kyoto/Osaka. One stumbling point: I found the translation to be most inadecuate as there are many grammatical mistakes and even sentences which are incomplete. Perhaps Alfred Birnbaum could redo it?"},{"Title":"The Makioka Sisters","review":"This is a fantastic book - just wish I had bought a paper copy rather than the kindle version. This book is riddled with spelling and punctuation errors on just about every page. I can't believe that the publishes ever had anyone proof-read it (which I would happily do for the refund of my purchase price!). It wasn't an inexpensive Ebook either at $9.99. My favorite error was the heading on the contents page that suggests \\"Other books by John Grisham\\" for the reader.Highly recommend the book; subtle, delicately nuanced writing; well developed, complex characters; and a lyrical and engaging plot - just buy the hard copy."},{"Title":"The Makioka Sisters","review":"This is the third novel I've read of Tanizaki's and it was definitely a huge triumph over the last one I read (title to remain unnamed). Though I thought that this book could've been shorter, 500+ pages as opposed to 250 or less(?), it was all in all a good storyline. Being of Japanese descent, this novel makes me appreciate the so found &quot;freedoms&quot; that we have today in contrast to the past."},{"Title":"The Makioka Sisters","review":"I haven't read the book, but have seen the wonderful movie made from it twice. The film version (in Japanese, with English subtitles) is called &quot;Sasame Yuki&quot; (A Little Snow), but it is marketed in the United States as &quot;The Makioka Sisters.&quot; The film captures the beauty and melancholy of the book, with fantastic photography of the Japanese seasons as they pass during the stories of the sisters. If you enjoyed the book, you'll love the movie."},{"Title":"The Makioka Sisters","review":"The Makioka Sisters, though long and sometimes tedious, gives it's reader a real and descriptive view of another world. The world quite different from today's is about to change at the beginning of World War II. The lifestyle presented is an interesting contrast to American social classes. I could go into details, but it's interesting to read and find a totally different lifestyle from the present."},{"Title":"The Makioka Sisters","review":"After reading the book..or rather, reading what I could of it, I simply can't agree with what everyone's been saying. I found it tedious, and horribly boring. The author failed to make me interested in ANY of the characters, let alone care about what happened to any of them. The pace is horrendously slow, painfuly descriptive, and at times confusing about who is who. There is practically NO dialogue, and character development is entirely narrative if there is any. All the reviews I've seen so far just seem to be shallow regurgetations of people who were told the book was SUPPOSED to be good. It boggles my mind how &quot;The Makioka Sisters&quot; won ANY awards at all. It is more of a rambaling history of every little thing that happens to a family who you really get no attatchment to at all, wether the details are relevant or not. If you insist on reading this book, check it out from the library, and save yourself some money."},{"Title":"The Makioka Sisters","review":"I bought this book because Min Jin Lee, authore of \\"Free Food for Millionaires,\\" identified it as one of her favorite books (along with more well-known Western classics like \\"Vanity Fair\\" and \\"Jude the Obscure\\"). \\"Free Food for Millionaires,\\" \\"Vanity Fair,\\" \\"Jude the Obscure,\\" and \\"The Makioka Sisters\\" are all \\"novels of progress\\": they follow a protaganist (or, as in the case of The Makioka Sisters, a family) through social class struggles; these novels are about oppportunity, lack of it, economic reality, and personal dignity.I find The Makioka Sisters to be a less than compelling novel. The central question, \\"Who will the third sister marry?\\" is just not very interesting; the young woman seems completely uninterested in any of her suitors, and they in her. Marriage is nothing but a way to secure social status; the only things that matter about the suitors are age, any previous marriages, existing children, salary, employer, and family status. None of them seems particularly passionate, opinionated, funny, ambitious. None of them has any discernible personality.The Makioka sisters are similarly bland and lifeless. None of them seems to have been touched by sexual desire (except possibly the youngest sister, whose scandalous romance, a family embarrassment, is referred to as a social liability for the family and not as a glorious fling or a fulfilling passion).None of the sisters seems to want anything out of life except to cling as much as possible to the prominent social status their family once enjoyed. None of them seems to love their husbands or friends or children. They seem to desire only \\"proper behavior\\" from those closest to them. The remote possibility that a woman might actually want something for herself is hinted at in the youngest sister, who has a bit of a career of her own, a little spending money, and possible secret liasons; but her main job is to contain her indiscretions in the margins of her sisters' more formal and acceptable lives.Honestly, I love Henry James's novels, so no one can accuse me of needing a fast-paced plot, or a lot of steamy sex, to stay interested in a book. I can be hooked by beautiful writing alone. But the main characters in this book are so stiff and lifeless, and the things they care about so dead and hollow, that -- despite my admiration for Min Jin Lee -- I just can't stay focused on it. I keep picking up other novels, and then trying to force myself to get back to this snooze-fest.The only thing about this book that I can recommend is its anthropological value. In The Makioka Sisters, you learn curious details about the bizarre vetting process to which prospective brides and grooms subjected each other in 1930s Japan. At one point, a suitor thinks the prospective bride looks thin and pale, and worries she might have TB, so she submits to a chest X ray to prove that her lungs are clear. Then her fmaily hires an investigator to find out more about the suitor's family, discovers that his mother is senile, and calls off the match because of \\"insantiy\\" in his family.This intrusive, clinical, ruthless approach to matchmaking is completely unlike anything I've encountered in Western culture. The notion that you might want to like your spouse, or at least tolerate them physically so that you can have sex and possibly children with them, does not even appear on the horizon (except obliquely, in the form of the concern that the suitors not look too much older than the bride). The Makioka Sisters is a curiosity, sort of like The Tale of Genji: something you read just to get a glimpse of how other cultures play the mating game.But if you want a great read, go buy Free Food for Millionaires."},{"Title":"The Makioka Sisters","review":"When taken into context of the environment, this book does afine job of portraying the demise of the aristocratic class. However,there was also an inherent prejudice that was frustrating to read,although probably representative of the male views at the time...Ifyou're female, spend your time reading something else."},{"Title":"The Makioka Sisters","review":"I was forced to read this at school. It was so interminably dull that one could read the same page over and over again without noticing. By the time I'd read two hundred pages I still hadn't the first idea of what it was about."},{"Title":"The Makioka Sisters","review":"The Japanese Pride and Prejudice! Every page is beautiful and lyric, and yet gossipy and real at the same time. Love it Love it Love it!"},{"Title":"The Makioka Sisters","review":"The Makioka Sisters reminds one of the Tale of Genji, a work which Tanizaki himself was deeply influenced by. The characters belong to an upper class family, and are concerned with appearances, understated refinement, and tradition. Scenes such as the cherry blossom viewings and the firefly hunt are given as much importance as great floods and miscarriages. Although the characters have great depth, they are still not quite accessible--they belong to a different age and class, and float before the reader like a painting on a silk screen. Although the themes of encroaching modernity and falling family fortunes are forever in the picture, in the end it is tradition that has the happy ending, modernity that has her hopes crushed. As other readers have remarked, this is a significant shift from Naomi, where the \\"modern girl\\" is the clear and decisive victor.In many ways, The Makioka Sisters is a full-length novel version of Tanizaki's essay \\"In Praise of Shadows.\\" Few pages go by without a mention of traditional elements of Japanese culture: poetry writing, architecture, nature, dance, etc. None is a casual reference; all have layers of nuance and undertone. Still, there is the feeling that Tanizaki has Traditional Culture win the battle but lose the war, for he--like us--knows that Japan has lost World War II and the elegant world he has created will not survive the following decades of strongly Western-influenced modernization. The youth and beauty of the Makioka sisters and their world is to scatter in the wind like the petals of so many cherry blossoms.Captured best in the scene where Sachiko lies awake watching a lone firefly play about in her kimono sleeve before she lets it go, the book is a reminder that there is no such thing as true timelessness. The Makioka Sisters is very much a story about a family, a nation, and a culture on the brink of violent change. This book will reward readers with the insight and patience to savor every detail and contemplate every nuance. Tanizaki's masterpiece, this book deserves five stars."},{"Title":"The Makioka Sisters","review":"I was never sure, to be honest, whether I would ever get through this book ... but I'm glad I did! What started off as a slow read turned into a delightfully quick one, until I finally realized that I was so entrenched in these women's lives that, like all great books, I just didn't want it to end. I think Tanizaki's master stroke is best evidenced by the content of the novel: it's a story about practically nothing, but oh, what an addicting read!"},{"Title":"The Makioka Sisters","review":"This is a beautiful book. I bought it because of a quote I read somewhere that it was the Japanese version of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". I don't know if that is true (it is more complex) but it certainly held my attention. I think the other reviewers have admirably covered the plot so I will just add a few comments. You feel like you are living with these people - even though it is an entirely different culture. And I was intrigued by the insights into that culture. The names are of course a mouthful for Westerners but fortunately in the beginning the book lists out all the main characters and their positions. In the beginning I was constantly referring back to that list but soon didn't need it. My only problem was envisioning all the beautiful descriptions, particularly of clothing (like kimonos and even western dress), and their hair and the rooms. So I went to NetFlix and found they had a 1983 Japanese film which I immediately got. It helped me a great deal even though it completely changed some of the plot. The book is much better than the film (which seems stilted and artificial to us today) but still I enjoyed the contribution that the film made to my insight. Now I want to look up more of Tanizaki's writings. I would love to see a sequel to this book to see how these characters managed in 1945.... I will look to see if any of Tanizaki's writings cover that period. I highly recommend this book"},{"Title":"The Makioka Sisters","review":"A really fine, hypnotic piece of writing. I think the category can safely be termed using the industry standard 'chick-lit', but it certainly was no barrier in enjoying a book that delves deep into pre-WWII Japanese culture. The coming war is provided in hints, but the real war is between the future of two sisters, and their older sister's hope in a good outcome for them.Sachiko Makioka is empathetic and tenacious in trying to help her sister Yukiko become married and avoid nearing spinsterhood. How the two navigate the vicissitudes of the Japanese wedding dance is instructive and interesting. Sachiko's youngest sister Taeko is the rebel, trying to run away with one profligate beau before settling on a man of a lower class. When he dies, she rebels again, ending up pregnant by a lowly bartender.The book is concise and is very interesting in how it deals with class. Additionally, the view of Europe & America (particularly Germany) is quite fascinating. This nuanced book is well worth reading, and deserves its billing as a 'classic'."},{"Title":"The Makioka Sisters","review":"\\"The Makioka Sisters\\" opens a window into Japanese society in the late 1930's, the years just before Pearl Harbor. We see an upper class family grappling with domestic issues, apparently quite unconcerned about what's happening outside of Japan.

It's a most satisfying book!"},{"Title":"The Makioka Sisters","review":"The story of a declining rich family in Osaka/Kobe of the late 1930s/early 40s reminds me of the North German Buddenbrooks and of the Portuguese Maias, both set a few decades earlier. The subject of decline of clans seems to be transcultural.The Makiokas have had their best years. Now they are struggling to keep up appearances. Main plot driver is the attempt to find a suitable husband for sister #3. Yukiko is nearly an old maid already with her (initially) 27 years. Proposals have been declined in the past, and now expectations need to be adjusted downwards. Sister #4 is also unmarried, and she has unusual ideas of being financially her own boss, with a doll business and ideas of learning designing/ dress making and dance teaching.Does this sound like a recipe for lengthy boredom? It is lengthy, ok, but to me it never reached a stage of boredom. It is a beautiful piece of prose, which must be partly due to the translator, Edward Seidensticker. The interesting historical period adds flavor.The time at the start being 1937, it is amazing how far away from politics the text stays, which is a statement in itself. The ladies of the family can't be expected to bother with such things. It seems unseemly to even mention them.Sister #4 is a bit of a rebel and has made friends with a foreigner, a White Russian woman divorced from an Englishman. This leads to a most amusing and interesting dinner party between some Makiokas and the Kyrilenkos. This is the first time that China and other unpleasantness are even mentioned, after nearly 100 pages into the 500! The Russians raise the issue of the so-called Xian incident, of December 1936, when Chiang Kai Shek was abducted by a regional warlord with the objective to press the nationalist government into a more focused fight against Japan. (CKS was, it appeared, more interested in the civil war against the Communists.)On page 111 sister #2 reads in a newspaper that Japanese carrier based units have bombarded Swatow in South China. That is the first time that we learn that Japan is at war. The whole aggression against China is euphemized as The China Incident. The first person who says, explicitly, that Japan is at war, far into 1939 now, is the Makiokas' German neighbor. Trust these blunt Germans to tell the truth, these uncultured beasts!Tanizaki was a master in pinpointing the intricacies of dos and donts of his protagonists' social world. You don't look the world into the face or even the eyes, it is unseemly! We get a walk through the world of marriage arrangements, and a lot about the Japanese version of a caste society into the bargain. We spend time with people who fear nothing more than the disapproval of their peers. (How I hated that attitude at home! I think I learned a lot about myself in this book, as odd as it may sound.)The book makes me want to re-read the Buddenbrooks."},{"Title":"The Makioka Sisters","review":"This is perhaps Tanizaki's finest work. Four sisters trapped in the gap between traditional Japanese mores and those infiltrating from the West. Each of the sisters comes to life with the authors wonderful descriptive language. Much is left to the imagination, however, in keeping with his theory that the reader MUST participate in the effort with the author and not merely sit back passively. It is not a speedy, swift moving work. Rather, the pace is a slow but steady one which, given the subject matter, is entirely appropriate."},{"Title":"The Makioka Sisters","review":"This book is an immediate pleasure to read from the moment a bretrothal is attempted to be found for Yukiko through to the last page.Set just before World War Two, the Makioka family is of an old and fast fading aristocratic line. The world is rapidly changing around them, yet they continue to burden themselves with centuries old etiquettes and live in a state of denial of their own fading light.This-like the works of Yukio Mishima- is what can only be described as a work of art.There is something unique about Japanese literature that (thankfully!) isn't lost in translation.The Makioka sisters is a book you want to last forever. I cannot wait to buy more of Tanizaki's work."},{"Title":"The Makioka Sisters","review":"This beautiful novel set in pre-World War II Osaka completely transported me to it's time and place. Mr. Tanizaki has drawn the characters of the Makioka family with great care and precision. I sat bolt upright when he first puts Yukiko together with her domineering little niece Etsuko, a scene that perfectly illustrates the personalities of both characters with subtle directness. At that point Mr. Tanazaki had an attentive reader and so I remained. It is said that this is a \\"novel about nothing\\" but that couldn't be further from the truth, it's about life as perceived through the eyes and experiences of one family, principally the four sisters. Life is often about nothing much, I suppose that's why we have the desire to read. The writing has a beautiful ethereal quality, I am reminded of fog or mist or cigarette smoke and yet at the same time it is robust and gripping. The details of the city, Japanese arts, kimono and nature are superb giving great ambience and sense of place. The pace is leisurely but a sense of urgency is implied through the nerve wracking task of getting the recalcitrant Yukiko married off and the knowledge of the cataclysm of war that is lurking but never delved into. I suppose this is a work for a particular audience that can revel in the slower pace of sixty plus years ago in a tightly confined social structure but Mr. Tanizaki rewards the reader again and again with flights from the ordinary into the sublime. The Everyman version with translation by Edward G. Seidensticker is a good choice."},{"Title":"The Makioka Sisters","review":"I read this novel whenever I'm tired of everything else. It's almost indescribable. A plot summary might be &quot;Tsuruko and Sachiko attempt to marry off Yukiko before anyone notices (a) Yukiko's hormonal problems or (b) the morals of the youngest sister, Kaeko; and while contending with financial difficulties in 1930s Osaka and Tokyo.&quot; And it's true that the major events of the novel, at least as far as the characters are concerned, are those which surround the marriage search. At the same time, the melange of ingredients, which include marriages with and without love, intense scrutiny of the tiniest processes of day to day living, gentle (and not so gentle) satire, the Osaka/Kyoto flood, is unique. At some point you realize that what appeared to be a novel of manners, with an omniscient narrator is an entirely subjective chronicle from the viewpoint of one character, and she's charming. Moreover, how can you resist a novel with the last line &quot;Yukiko's dysentery continued until the 26th and was a problem on the train to Tokyo.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Makioka Sisters","review":"This Japanese novel, first published in 1943, depicts the lives of four sisters between 1936 and 1941, a period of time in which Japan was evolving in a military way. However, these wartime preparations are a bare glimpse in the background as the four sisters involve themselves with family life and, specifically, the marriages of the two younger sisters. According to tradition the fourth sister cannot marry until the third sister marries and much of the 540 pages of this book revolve around her marriage proposals. Her younger sister, however, has already tried to elope but the family has stopped that and she is asserting herself by going into the business of making dolls and leaving the confines of the house each day to go to work. These two sisters live with the second oldest sister and her husband and young daughter. They have been upper class in the past but their fortunes are now dwindling. However they still live in a household with servants and a degree of elegance in Osaka. The oldest sister and her husband and six children live in Toyko. They are considered the head of the family and need to be consulted on all matters.With an eye for detail, the author creates this world in a way that made it easy for me to relate to. He takes us into the world of arranged marriages, filial devotion, various illnesses, a torrential flood, the decline and decay of traditional Japanese culture and the evolving preparations for war. All this is told against a background of descriptions of everyday life and the sense of how these siblings take care of each other. I was totally drawn into the story, identified with these sisters and found myself understanding their way of life. I loved reading this book, didn't want it to end and highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Makioka Sisters","review":"Considered Tanizaki's best novel, this work has been called a textbook of Japanese behavior. The author began writing it around 1942-3 in the midst of World War II. Magazine publication in installments was banned after the early chapters were judged insufficiently supportive of the war effort. The work was finally published in book form in 1948, a few years after the war's end. The English translation came out in 1957.The novel began in the late 1930s among a formerly wealthy merchant family from Osaka and ended around 1940, before the outbreak of war with the United States. The family consisted of two married sisters, with their husbands and children, and two younger, unmarried sisters. Much of the novel dealt with the family's concerns about finding a suitable groom for the third sister and determining whether the fourth sister should be allowed to travel abroad, take up a trade, and continue meeting a suitor from the past. There was seemingly endless description of these two concerns, mainly from the second sister's point of view.Determining a proper marriage candidate for the third sister meant endless rounds of negotiation with each successive prospect. Each point of discussion was passed up through the hierarchy of the family ranks for decision, with soundings carefully taken of everyone's potential reaction, and any eventual decisions that resulted then passed back down. Any unexpected development restarted the cycle. Throughout, it was essential to show outward respect for the proper forms, maintain the face appropriate to one's place in society and keep the family's name unsullied. The sister herself, the one on whose behalf the entire family was working, showed the least interest of all in tying the knot and was content to remain dependent. Given all this, it was no wonder she was long past marriageable age.With the fourth sister, by tradition her conduct was regulated by the family of the first sister. The family heads were so stuck in the past, however, that their decisions for her bore little relation to what realistically she needed to do. Ready to marry, she wasn't free to act until a groom for the third sister was chosen. The second sister, her go-between within the family, sympathized with the predicament but wished to avoid a family upset. This meant endless thinking about how to divine everyone's true motives and spin discussions, avoiding confrontation while protecting the family name. And continued reproaches to herself or others -- thought but unexpressed -- for hesitation or lack of proper consideration. What happened in effect was continued avoidance of any clear resolution until too late, when events forced the family's hands, so to speak.The author was skilled at setting up contrasts between the actions of the two younger sisters or the two older sisters, and at establishing situations where a character would condemn another for something and behave later in a similar way. When action on a larger scale occurred from time to time -- a flood, a medical crisis -- his powers of description were memorable. And the irony of the conclusion, after the family's endless consideration of its good name, was very pointed. Not to mention the irony of having the novel conclude, after more than 500 pages, with hoped-for events still in the future.At the same time, what I could appreciate was affected eventually by the book's seemingly interminable proceedings. One wondered sometimes whether the author was intentionally drawing out things to the point of parody. I also had trouble figuring out exactly where the author's sympathies lay. With Teinosuke, the second sister's husband? Not with any of the four sisters, it seemed, most of whom were described from the outside, none of whom received compassion unmixed with mockery. The characters were almost entirely closed to each other, rarely if ever sharing their deeper thoughts. And how class-bound they were, so much of the time.For reasons like these, I didn't enjoy the book all that much. Another novel read recently that was set in the past and focused on the lives of women -- The Doctor's Wife by Sawako Ariyoshi - with a far narrower scope, less mastery and much less detail but with clearer, unalloyed compassion, was preferred."},{"Title":"The Makioka Sisters","review":"Others have commented that this book is slow-going, which I can understand--there certainly isn't a great deal of what you'd call 'action,' in a Hollywood sense--but on the other hand, I found it an amazingly effortless read; pages would simply melt away at an astonishing rate. It's very much a novel after the manner of the nineteenth-century (though it's probably best to avoid Jane Austen comparisons, which, though superficially appealing, ultimately don't really work very well): no modernist jiggery pokery (not that I have anything against that, necessarily), just a straightforward narrative of things that happen. One sometimes forgets how effective this can be, when done well.All this notwithstanding, perhaps the most interesting thing about the novel is its ambiguity: out of the three sisters (the fourth, Tsuruko, being a very minor character, although this does also apply to her, to an extent), only one, Sachiko (the novel's de facto protagonist, I suppose), is made entirely psychologically comprehensible by Tanizaki. Taeko and Yukiko remain to a large extent mysterious throughout. I find that the glib characterizations of them and other major characters in the Vintage edition to be very misleading: nobody in the book can be so easily characterized. Even Taeko's old flame Okubata, who the reader is likely to quickly write off as 'total jerk,' is ultimately given the benefit of the doubt.One thing that may seem strange to some readers is the way that world events of the time are understated. The novel takes place in the years leading up to World War II, concluding at the end of 1940. However, in spite of occasional references to Hitler and \\"the China Incident,\\" there is little effect on the lives of the Makiokas, and insofar as they are aware of these things, they remain undemonstratively, naturally, loyal to their country and their allies. This, of course, is nothing more than self-evidently realistic, and I certainly hope nobody would be deranged enough to condemn them for it. People have to live their lives; it's not as if the US hasn't been involved in its share of ignoble wars (hmm...can we think of a current example?). Tankizaki may be subtly critiquing this behavior, but it never becomes more than an undercurrent.At ANY rate! This is nothing like my preconception of what Japanese novels are supposed to be like was, based on reading Mishima and Kawabata. It is, however, excellent in its own right. If you want something a little more circumspect than your average novel (whatever THAT beast would like!), go for it."},{"Title":"The Makioka Sisters","review":"The war in Asia is already going on, and Pearl Harbor hovers on the horizon. The readers are very well aware of this, as was Tanizaki. The book was published between 1943 and 1948. To the Makioka sisters, the war is still very distant, though. The concerns that are urgent to them are of a more everyday character, not least important the matter of finding a suitable husband for Yukiko, who is past thirty. That we have this knowledge about the future will probably make the final chapters of the book seem heavy with irony to most readers.The fortunes of the house of Makioka have been declining for some time. The junior branch, the family of Sachiko (the second sister) and her husband Teinosuke, nevertheless lead a comfortable upper middle class life near Osaka. The younger sisters prefer to stay with them. Sachiko is the center of the story, insofar as it is told mostly from her point of view. The events, however, revolve around the two younger sisters, Yukiko and Taeko. There is drama and some tragedy, but much of the book simply records fairly undramatic events in the lives of the Makiokas in the years leading up to the Pacific War. Above all, the story conjurs up a world that was already disappearing at the time of the story - and was soon to be in flames. I would describe the book as bittersweet.To me, The Makioka Sisters was not exactly a page-turner. It took me more than a month to read all 530 pages. It was, however, a highly engaging book, beautifully told and easy too read. I never felt bored."},{"Title":"The Makioka Sisters","review":"This is a portrait of an upper middle class family attempting to preserve its status is a changing world. Junichiro Tanizaki tells the story with sympathy and humor. Two of the four Makioka sisters married while the family wealth and status were in tact. Sister #3 must be married before sister #4. This marriage and required investigations and negotiations haven't gone smoothly. As the family fortunes decline, the delays in finding a suitor for sister number #3 and the lifestyle of sister #4 decrease the marriage value of both.Tanazaki pays attention to detail in his portraits. He notes the accents, the kimono, jewelry, injections, small talk, superstitions, who sleeps soundly, the size of the rooms, guarded and unguarded discussions with and about the servants, and the formal letters which exchange greetings, pleasantries and heavy verdicts.Some of the best parts relate the inner thoughts of the characters and how their thoughts incorporated what they presumed to be thoughts of the others. This is best done with Sachiko, as she cares for her sisters, dreads telling her husband of Taeko's troubles, navigates the judgment of the \\"main house\\", gets pressured into a miai for Yukiko or a punishment for Taeko. You think you know a character like Yukiko, but mid-book you learn why she rejected her first suitor, you hadn't suspected it, but it fits right in and you think ahhhhh.After the \\"main house\\" moves to Tokyo, you can feel the out of touch patriarch making colder, more detached decisions for the others. Were this a meritocracy, Tatsuo would never be heading this family. Teinsuke cares for three Makioka sisters supposedly due to geography, but clearly he does it because he's the better man.The book has the stuff of everyday life such as memorial services, dance lessons. waiting for others, seeing a former suitor on a train, inane dinner conversatons, and huge efforts that die on a \\"missed\\" telephone call. It also has the Japanese aesthetic appreciation: the Kabuki, the cherry blossoms, firefly hunts and the curiousity about the west.Current events are a backdrop such as the Chinese \\"incident\\", Okubata's interesting \\"opportunity\\", and German friends return to a country at war. The economy is taking a toll on the family fortune at the \\"main house\\" and a military contract benefits the others. At this time, Japan has been opened to the world for 3 generations and class structures are rigid. There is a anticipation that there will be a war and the characters seemed resigned to it. They have no positions such as \\"pro war\\" or \\"anti war\\" or any \\"fight for the country\\" fervor.This book isn't for everyone. To appreciate it you need some background (not a lot, but some) in Japanese culture and sympathy for people trapped by the social conventions of their times."},{"Title":"The Makioka Sisters","review":"Not having read many Japanese novels, I cannot agree or disagree with those who argue (and there are many) that this is the greatest Japanese novel of the twentieth century. That said, it took no more than two chapters to convince me that Tanizaki was onto something remarkable.The novel's theme is highly recognizable--an aristocratic family, fallen on hard times, desperately clings to family mores that are at increasing odds with a changing society--but Tanizaki's handling of this and other themes is original in its humor and detached irony. Tanizaki is never pious, never over-earnest, and his ability to treat the family's frenzied attempts to marry off the respectable third sister, Yukiko, often had me clutching my sides. Impossible to forget Sachiko's obsessions over the dark spot on her sister's eye (she is convinced that the spot is responsible for spoiling her sister's prospects), but equally hilarious are the descriptions of Katharina's eccentric Russian family, Koi-san's and Yukiko's attempts to avoid the Tokyo \\"main house,\\" and O-Haru's negligible hygiene All this is written in a style that is a paragon of simple elegance, subtlety, and enviable vividness.Many reviewers have made much of the novel's few references to political events, with some even arguing that \\"The Makioka Sisters\\" offers a rebuttal to the authoritarian regime of the 1920s and 1930s. I disagree. The momentous issues of the day--the China Incident (translation: a skirmish that would escalate into one of the bloodiest wars of the twentieth century), German and Japanese military ambitions, and the beginning of World War Two--are danced around, alluded to, almost avoided. The Makiokas go about their mundane business while the world goes to pot, and this explains, perhaps, why we care about them so much: we, the readers, know that the world will soon tap them on the shoulders - and hard."},{"Title":"The Makioka Sisters","review":"The primary emotion that I felt during the reading of this novel (at least the first time) was impatience, slowing building to a combination of irritation and finally incredulity. Why won't the \\"main house\\" in Osaka drop its pre-occupation with rank? Why won't the unmarried Yukiko show some decisiveness? Why doesn't Koi-san actually rebel and break free, rather than go through the charade of submission, deception and clandestine affairs? Why won't the well-meaning, practical Teinosuke take charge? When will the sisters have a mature relationship between themselves?Perhaps this is what makes the novel so good; out of the initial irritation comes understanding of the characters and a reluctant, grudging empathy. They have their own reasons for doing what they do, their own philosophy of life and the reader is encouraged to replace judgement by understanding. Interspersed in this family drama (which could probably have been placed in any culture) is an interesting backdrop of Japanese-German relations as war-clouds are gathering and the typical understated Japanese reaction to the tragedies of life, death and birth."},{"Title":"The Makioka Sisters","review":"Reading \\"The Makioka Sisters\\" is a bit like taking a long train journey on a local train that stops at every station. Tanizaki's novel, the story of four sisters of a once affluent family that has fallen into decline, moves along at a leisurely pace for most of its 500 pages. The novel is set in the years 1937-1941, a tumultuous period in the history of East Asia, yet events barely intrude. One hears of Japan's aggression in China as merely \\"the China incident,\\" and December 1941, has more to do with the impending betrothal (after many disappointments) of the third sister, Yukiko, than it does with the onrush of war.This is a book that is set mostly within the walls of the Osaka household of the second sister, Sachiko, and her husband, Teinsuke, with whom the two unmarried sisters, Taiko and Yukiko, live. The eldest sister, Tsuroko, and her husband, Tatsuo, run the \\"main house\\" in Tokyo (the branch of the family with which decisions about money and marriage lie). The realism of the novel lies in its inclusion of intricate detail: a spot that appears and disappears over Yukiko's eye; the choice of restaurant for a \\"miai\\" (a social gathering to assess the suitability of a couple for marriage); the type of medications Sachiko carries in her bag; the type of dress (western or kimono) a sister is wearing, and so on. So minute is that detail that it may leave a reader who is unfamiliar with Japanese culture quite unhappy by the time yet another \\"miai\\" for Yukiko commences.Yet when the family goes forth into the world, in its circumscribed way, there are scenes of great beauty---of firefly watching, cherry viewing, Fuji-gazing. And this world IS circumscribed, so much so that the three sisters who live in Osaka never adjust to Tokyo (and indeed, their small disasters happen there). Every minute the Osaka sisters spend in the capital reminds them of how provincial they are; ashamed of even of their \\"western\\" accents, they are relieved to return home. Although modernity has crept into the sisters' lives(a phonograph, the films the narrator often mentions by title, cigarettes, permanent waves),they are still often startled by the brusque certainty of some of the more modern women they encounter, with their smart western clothing and lacquered nails. Within the family itself, it is Taiko, the youngest sister, who struggles the most with this tension between modern and traditional ways, and thus is is she who wears western dress with the most ease, while, paradoxically, she is a skilled practitioner of traditional Japanese dance.The last scene in the novel is set on the train that is carrying Yukiko, the third and most \\"Japanese\\" sister, toTokyo for her marriage, at long last, to a dissolute aristocrat; his connections, the family hopes, may lift the Makioka name to some of its former luster. Even here, the novel moves as slowly as it ever did. There is no grand denouement, and the story closes on the most intimate and mundane of details. However, by this point, the accumulation of bits of information about the world at war has gained force, and it seems to carry the Makioka sisters straight into a long dark tunnel from which one knows they will not emerge unchanged.M. Feldman"},{"Title":"The Makioka Sisters","review":"This story, primarily set in Osaka, spans a period of four years (from 1937 to 1941). This period, is a tumultuous period for Japan, and we view it from the perspective of one family. The Makioka is a family in decline and after the death of the parents, the husband of the eldest daughter adopts the Makioka name and becomes the head of the family. There are four sisters: the eldest is Tsuruko, married to Tetsuo (a bank employee); Sachiko, married to Teinosuke (an accountant); and the two unmarried sisters, Yukiko and Taeko, who live with Sachiko and Teinosuke.Tradition dictates that Yukiko should be married before her younger sister, Taeko. Tradition also dictates that unmarried sisters should live with the head of the house. Some traditions, it seems, are easier to ignore than others. A number of attempts to marry off Yukiko fail: Yukiko herself, seemingly passive in many ways, exerts considerable influence from the shadows. Marriage to someone at some stage is seen as inevitable but Yukiko does not seem enthusiastic. In the meantime, Taeko is trying to live her own life.This is an amazing novel. The shifts in fortune for the Makioka family, the changes within Japanese upper-class society, and the influences of the Western world all shape the story. On the face of it, this novel is about the minutiae of the lives of sisters during a period of four years. The turmoil of Taeko's life, the attempts to arrange a marriage for Yukiko and the challenges faced by the careworn elder sister Tsuruko with both social standing and family to maintain contrast with the comparative happiness of Sachiko's life. The detail of the lives of the sisters provides an intricate view of upper-class Osakan life immediately before World War II: tradition and obligation as well as moments of great beauty. Simply superb.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"Title":"The Art of Compiler Design: Theory and Practice","review":"I've only worked through the first 3 chapters, but so far it has been very clear.

He describes in fascinating detail the journey deep into the Confederacy, snatching the train, the subsequent pursuit, and the long ordeal in various jails and prisons. Particularly vivid is his telling of the sudden execution of seven of his fellow raiders, and the subsequent emotional shock of the survivors.For modern readers, Pittenger's book has some flaws. The Union soldiers are, almost exclusively, brave, stoic warriors who endure hardship and death with manly fortitude. The Confederates, for the most part, are drunken, illiterate,cruel louts, the only good ones being those who secretly profess no interest in who wins the war. The portraits are so consistent that one suspects there is more of parody here than portrait. It must be kept in mind, also, that this book was published in 1863, shortly after Pittenger's release, so he did not have answers to some of the questions that come to mind as you read: why were some of the Raiders executed, and so abruptly, and not the others? Why was their exchange delayed for months after arrival in Richmond? Why were they so ill prepared (if his description is correct the planning and preparation for their mission was most casual by modern standards)?Still, the book has some merit, particularly in the descriptions of prison life, and the monotony of diet and daily life faced by Civil War captives."},{"Title":"Daring and Suffering","review":"Daring and Suffering is the most easily accessible first hand account of Andrews Raid. While it is clearly biased toward the Union, it is understandable since it was written after Pittenger has spent almost a year in several Southern jails, including Libby Prision. Although Pittneger wrote endlessly about the raid, some of his later writings are worth looking at; such as Twenty-five Years After: A Supplement to Daring and Suffering; and the more definitive In Pursuit of The General: A History of the Civil War Railroad Raid. By the time he wrote In Pursuit he was able to give a more balanced and complete view of the events. The other participants also wrote about the raid, but they are mostly in the form of newspaper articles. Scholars since Pittenger have been busy researching the raid, with notable authors including Parlee Grose, Joe Head, Wilbur Kurtz and several authors listed in Amazon.com. This fascinating event in the countries history has been the topic of three movies, and many intersting books - including this one."},{"Title":"Daring and Suffering","review":"Very interesting and moving adventure story.

But ALL of them have the tagline: \\"The Only _____(fill in ssubject) Book You'll Ever Need\\".\\"The K.I.S.S. Guide To Astrology\\", by Julia & Derek Parker, DOES live up, (delightfully!), to the K.I.S.S. motto! (Or at least for beginners, like me!) Full of delightful, beautiful, and thoughtful illustrations and charts, this book is full of easy-to-understand text, large print, good paper, and a binding which could be a BIT stronger, but is perfectly adequate if you do not pile other books on top of it! The chapters begin by going into astrological data with which even beginners are familiar, (the 12 sign of the zodiac, their encompassing dates during the year, and the basic personality each sign encompasses), and then go on to far more complex, (but always easily explained and understood), material, such as the various signs \\"at work\\", and what it means when another sign of the zodiac enters your \\"house\\". The Appendix is filled with detailed, (and I domean DETAILED!) charts on such things as 'Planetary Tables', \\"Moon Tables\\", and \\"How To Find Your Midheaven\\". These charts are in necessairily(????) teeny-tiny print size, (no, NOT necessairily, I don't think, as an even slighly larger type size would be very welcome), but the charts are in clear type, which can be read through magnifying glasses if necessary....) This is followed by a few pages of 'More Resources', on selected Books, Schools, Bookstores, and Organizations, (in the USA, Canada, the UK, and Australia!), and give complete addresses, phone numbers, and websites, where available. Herein is also inluded a selection of selected websites, for information on General Astrology, Astrological Books and Magazines, Astrological Newsgroups, Astrological Schools On-Line, Astrological Theories and Techniques, Sports, Weather, Medical, Psychological and Financial Astrology, and also an intriguing site for Horary Astrology, which, the book explains, is the art of asking a question and getting the answer from a drawn-up astrological chart. There follows, (as in all of the K.I.S.S. books I have encountered), a full index, and a list of Acknowlegements.Some people say that astrology is really only a myth, because new planets, (namely Pluto and Neptune), have been discovered since ancient times, when astrology first began, and, anyway, the planets and stars have MOVED! Perhaps so -- but then, I think modern astrologers have changed their knowledge basis these new facts into consideration. All I know is that, whenever I read a basic description of my own Sun-Sign, it's so accurate, it almost looks like a psychological profile! However, I believe that one should not be \\"hemmed in\\" by the proclivities one is said to have, from one's astrological chart. An astrological sign or chart, to me, ONLY tells you what your habits, talents, and liabilities probably are; what you DO with these things is totally up to each individual! The authors of this book write with the same basic philosophy!There is a great deal of information in this book's 429 pages. It may not get you an astrologist's certification -- but it can give you a basic, (and probably more than a basic), understanding of astrological ideas and protocols, if you truly apply yourself to this book, and read ALL the information in it. It can lead you to other sources, if you feel you need them. But there is SO much good, basic, and supra-basic information in this book that it reminds me of a (true!) story I once heard about a legal secretary.... This lady had been a legal secretary for about 20 years -- and now she wanted to become a lawyer. One cannot become a lawyer merely by graduating law school -- though that undoubtedly helps. No -- the crucial step in becoming a lawyer is, of course, to pass the bar exam. (J.F.K. Jr -- despite being brilliant and knowledgeable -- had to three times before he passed it.) But this lady -- with NO law school study at all, and her 20 years as a legal secretary as her ONLY legal knowedge -- passed the bar exam the very FIRST time. : ) I don't know if examinations are more crucial than a diploma, in astrological circles o not -- but if you read this book carefully and thoroughly, your astrological knowledge will certainly be far past the beginner's stage...and will make any further reading or training you desire, that much more easy to understand. Your knowlege, with this book, will increase astrologically -- er, I mean, astronomically! ** : )*******************************************************************P.S.: I have looked on the website of the DK Company, and it seems they are now not now reprinting too many of their excellent K.I.S.S. books.

If you are a power python user looking for XMLprocessing under the hood, it definitely isn't for you.This bookintroduces pyxie, an XML processing library, along with the basics ofSAX (Simple Api for XML) and DOM (Document Object Model) XMLprocessing techniques in a fairly concise fashion. Armed with aminimal degree of comfort with mark-up languages like HTML or XML, aprogrammer ready to start processing some actual XML files for thefirst time will find good value in this book.However, I worry thatthe book may frustrate and/or tick off its target audience, i.e.,Python newbies. This is because much of the code developed in the bookseems rushed out. Whatever the case, you are going to have to debugstuff on the CD. Python is easy to debug and this code is not roughgoing, but it can be tedious and time-consuming if it's something youdidn't plan to reckon with. I'm not convinced that this is altogethera bad thing, since it may prove to be a good way for a python newcomerto get intimate with some handy code. I simply want to make you awareof the situation.Like a lot of pythoneers, I run Solaris, and Ifound that for non-Linux UNICES the CD offers only C source files fora couple of the book's vital tools. I had to find the requiredlibraries on the web and figure out how to come up with makefilesmyself. Again, tedious and time-consuming. A few hints would have beennice. Linux and Windows folks won't have this problem, as thosebinaries are on CD. Some promised Windows stuff never made it on CD..."},{"Title":"XML Processing with Python (with CD-ROM)","review":"The first 250 pages of this book are an introduction to Python and XML. 20 of those are screen shots of the Microsoft installer of Python. Every example begins with type &lt;filename&gt; to fill more space. I think he got the choice of typeface from Curious George Rides a Bike (it allows for 25 lines per page). This should have been a 100 page book with no CD since the code on the CD is all outdated.There are probably 10 or 15 useful pages in this book for someone who knows anything about Python and XML. I was looking for examples about applying style sheets, parsing examples with database connectivity... anything. All the examples he uses can easily be found on the web in a more concise and clear format."},{"Title":"XML Processing with Python (with CD-ROM)","review":"Very little coverage of processing XML documents using Python - plenty of discussion of Python generally, how to use C language utilities to parse XML, how to use awk to modify the output of the C language tools, etc. The book uses a large typeface and includes examples for both Linux and Windows NT screen input/output (which turn out to be nearly identical), so there's not nearly as much content as you might imagine from the page count. I'm relatively new to XML and Python and I spotted two errors in the examples within the first 100 pages. There are two appendices which sound like they're supposed to explain Python to Java and Perl programmers but turn out to be feature comparisons. That's great fodder for flamewars about language superiority, but not a big help for people with experience in other languages seeking a Python jump-start. People who shell out $() for a book on XML and Python don't need a sales pitch about why XML and Python are good choices.I think this book could have been saved with some help from a good editor; unfortunately, that wasn't done. I can't comment on the CD as I haven't opened its envelope, as this book is being returned as totally unsatisfactory, which I don't do very often."},{"Title":"XML Processing with Python (with CD-ROM)","review":"This book has two audiences. People who need to use XML but haven't decided how to process it, and people who use Python and want or need to know about XML. Both will find this book meets their needs.It lives in the same space as Brett McLaughlin's &quot;Java and XML&quot;, and tries to answer an important question: how do I harness the possibilities of XML for my applications? In answering that question, you may find this book a revelation. Java has stolen most of the XML programming hype in the last year. However Python is becoming an increasingly popular choice for programming on the server. And Python crucially has far better text manipulation facilities than Java. The author combines this inherent ability with specialised XML tools (and occasionally UNIX ones!), leaving one in no doubt that Python is a serious (and in many cases superior) option over Java and Perl for building XML applications quickly and easily.This is not a book written by someone who learned their subject matter while writing their tome. He knows his material, in particular XML.Some minor caveats. The author pushes his own tools somewhat, but that's ok, they're free; and the Python community hasn't fully converged on de facto tools as of yet. This is not a neutral book: the author states in no uncertain terms that Python is the best language for processing XML. The book is slow to start: if you know your way around Python and or XML you'll skim the first 60 pages. None of these are showstoppers though."},{"Title":"XML Processing with Python (with CD-ROM)","review":"This book proves that a good publisher makes a difference, and that prentice hall does not qualify. I've never seen a computer book that contains so many errors. Combined with the hideous layout of the goldfarb series, this should be enough to keep you far away from it. BTW: i've added a second star, because valuable stuff is hidden in it; you just have to work too hard to get there.If you're new to python, buy learning python and programming python instead. if you want to apply xml with python, use the web to learn more. Only buy this book if it's *deeply* discounted, or if you're looking for job as a book editor. Otherwise, you'll end up rewarding incompetent publishing."},{"Title":"XML Processing with Python (with CD-ROM)","review":"There are some useful nuggets in this book, but there is also a lot of material that doesn't directly relate to processing XML. The author spends an inordinate amount of space discussing things like AWK, filename globbing on Windows, installing software, and other irrelevant items. The software tools used as examples in the book were written for earlier versions of Python and the Python XML libraries; they do not work with the current releases of Python and PyXML, and no updates are available on the author's web site."},{"Title":"XML Processing with Python (with CD-ROM)","review":"Modern XML programmers should be using the SAX and DOM api's for their projects, and the related standards. Those subjects should have been the foundation for this book.Instead the author spends lots of time talking about some &quot;pyxie&quot; utility that reforms XML into some intermediate line oriented ascii format for processing. He even does system calls to assist in processing. If SAX and DOM didn't exist, then yes, I suppose this is how you'd do it. This would be OK for 10% of the book, as an introduction, but not as the primary tool.To be fair, he does talk about SAX and DOM in a couple chapters. The coverage was light and the examples weren't great.And no discussion of XSLT or XPath? Nor of schemas? To be fair the copyright says 2000, so this may have been written in 1999, so some of those items were not around or popular back then. But if the book is updated, these would need to be added.I think readers might do better to grab one of the Java books for now, and try to translate to Python in their head I guess. I agree with one of the other reviewers that there's a bit of filler in the book, though not as bad as some other books.On the plus side the author is very polite and supportive and would be comforting to newer programmers.I also like the way he keeps extending his xgrep project to have more and more features; it is nice to see an author show a large project evolving (I just kept wishing it was using DOM)."},{"Title":"XML Processing with Python (with CD-ROM)","review":"When you try to learn a language you often get that &quot;so what do I do next&quot; problem. You know the syntax but dont have a domain within which to apply it.

You need to have some XML knowledge under our belt and a programmer's desire to learn the strengths of Python.The CD that comes with this book contains all the code examples from the book, Python distributions for Unix/Linux/Win, the major Python XML tools/modules, as well the MySQL DBMS and the required Python modules for accessing this DB.The author goes beyond focusing on the major tools, focusing on some of the small tricks you can use to search and check XML documents via the command line. He also covers the major programming interfaces that have become available, comparing and contrasting them, as well as showing how they can be incorporated into Python programming. If you've not had a chance to become acquainted with the MySQL DBMS, you also learn how to use it, in relationship to XML document processing and how to access it with Python.Some of the Python code/command line examples are extremely simple, but I think he is quick enough in get to the heart of the subject and does a great job at covering a wide breathe of material. The book has left me with a bigger picture of XML, equiped to start processing XML, and excited about doing further research on this growing technology."},{"Title":"XML Processing with Python (with CD-ROM)","review":"I haven't clue what this book is about and how it relates to real life problem solving.

Also available on Project Gutenberg if you don't have kindle."},{"Title":"The Jesuits in North America in the seventeenth century (Francis Parkman's works)","review":"This book by Francis Parkman, written in the mid 19th century gives a valuable account of the lives of Jesuit priests sent from France to convert the dangerous native tribes around the Great Lakes area of North America. The Jesuits were meticulous record keepers of their missions in North America in the 17th century and Mr. Parkman was a careful historian.This fascinating book contains much information about the 5 Nations (Iroquois) and the Algonquin tribes and their centuries-long ferocious hatred of each other. The Jesuits sent priests to live among these tribes and the astounding ways these tribes lived are fully explained, especially their culture of torture and canibalism. These priests suffered the greatest physical deprivations and danger living among these war-like people. It also shows the manifold reasons the French were in North America at that time, the most prominant being the fur-trade. While the priests were zealous to convert the Indians to Catholicism, the Crown was interested in the great profits that could be pulled from the forests through making the native peoples dependent on the French.The book corrects much of the wrong information that most Americans learn about these formidable tribes. It is a gripping look at a culture gone forever and unabashadly shows both the natives' attributes as well as their unrelenting cruelty towards their enemies. The reader comes away with an understanding as to why these peoples are extinct and how in part, their own actions played a definitive role in their eventual demise."},{"Title":"The Jesuits in North America in the seventeenth century (Francis Parkman's works)","review":"Book arrived quickly and very inexpensive like new.

The book was recommended and was out of print i had heard, so when I found it on Amazon I was pleased."},{"Title":"The Jesuits in North America in the seventeenth century (Francis Parkman's works)","review":"The author and the Jesuits who labored to convert the various tribes repeatedly distorted images of the Wendat (Huron) and the other tribes encountered in order to justify the continued efforts in North America. The constant onslaught of adjectives like \\"savages, filthy, smelly,\\" etc. continues ad nauseum. They ignore that America wasn't discovered in the 1400s by Europeans, but by the native Americans more than 15,000 years earlier. Today research indicates North America may have been settled more than twice that many years ago. They ignore the Democratic forms of government developed by the tribes. They ignore that the Indians didn't need a new religion as they embraced believes that predated Christianity and even Egyptian and Early Greek beliefs by thousands of years. The Jesuits, the civilian government, in the form of Champlain, were there to exploit America's vastly superior resources and steal the land from the \\"savages\\" who had lived in harmony with nature for many millenia. They took the resources and repaid the Indians with trinkets, beads and diseases that wiped out entire tribes because they lacked any built-up immunities. The Europeans also brought a new animal to America, one the continent could easily do without - the Norway Rat - one of the major spreaders of disease in Europe. All of the negatives are glossed over as part of the ongoing European efforts at complete genocide of native Americans."},{"Title":"CliffsTestPrepCatholic High School Entrance Exams","review":"I purchased this title along with two other Catholic high school test prep books.

Not a good purchase."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"This was required reading in my graduate counseling program. It was a great book then--and I have reread it a few times sense--and it is still a great book. It offers a lot of perspective on different issues and is eye opening from the therapists viewpoint. This is a great book for therapists and patients alike. And it is very entertaining too."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"In his bookLove's Executioner: & Other Tales of Psychotherapy (Perennial Classics), Yalom puts his own reputation on the line in order to give us, the reader, an inside look into therapy from the therapist's point of view. As a studying psychotherapist I found his book both fascinating and useful. Yalom shows how even the most seasoned therapist has reactions to his clients, and how to take these reactions and use them in therapy.Not interested in the science? The stories are witty, thrilling and entertaining. You couldn't make this stuff up!"},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"An eye opener to the world of psychotherapyLove's Executioner is very insightful and a great educational book. I have learnt immensely about the profession called psychotherapy along with extreme behaviours and some of their underlying reasons. Yalom has a great ability to teach and write and those combined with being a psychotherapist synergise to a writing style that is intriguing, moving, powerful and not to forget very funny at times. This is an eye opener for those of us unfamiliar to the field of psychiatry and I cannot help wondering the possible impact this book and its alike would have if they were part of the high school education curriculum and common knowledge to people."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"This excellent book takes an in depth look at the dark and sometimes disturbing world of psychology.

It is a must-read for anyone interested in the human mind, psychology, medicine, and/or literature. Beautifully and compellingly written, this is also a tremendously moving book. It is right up there with the great classic case studies by Freud, the works of Sacks, and of A.R. Luria. It is that good."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"I am a true fan of Yalom, so I can't help but love his books. However, this is an excellent semi-fictional (to protect confidentiality) book of case studies. Yalom's writing style makes one feel he is talking to you directly. His personal thoughts about the cases are interesting, insightful and often tinted with humor. An enjoyable, yet teachable read."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"I have enjoyed this book for many years and repeatedly give this as a gift to social work students and supervisees."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"In the tales that Dr. Yalom relates in this book, he shares the accounts of his patients' problems, however, and more profoundly he shares a great deal of himself and how he responds to these problems. The image that emerges is that of a therapist who is not always right, nor always agreeable, but always human. His defects are made endearing by the fact that he is aware of them and struggles with them. He is a first rate storyteller and the glimpse he allows us into the therapeutic relation is quite worthwhile."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"I am generally not a fan of modern psychological methods and their inability to face the spectre of death and the fundamental decay of our 'modern' civilisation (primitive cultures were much more sensible in their organization in comparison with the capitalist terror we have created).. This is precisely why dr. yalom's book appeals to me.. It is a certain breed of existensial psychology that looks at death head on.. but credit must also be given to yalom's obvious personal report with his patients and his understanding of humanity (something experience seems to play a key role in)..I have never been so struck by the personal accounts of the theraputic process in the very moving stories yalom has compiled here.. I found myself completely absorbed from the first pages on.. I feel that i have greatly benefited from reading this book."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"An incredible book. Dr. Yalom restored my faith in therapists and human beings. I have read the book twice and given to many friends as gift. The most healing aspect of the book is one's realization that EVERY individual is flawed, conflicted, volunerable ... and the journey of self-discovery and acceptance is the only path to reaching inner-peace and content."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"This book should be required reading for anybody either undergoing psychotherapy or providing it. Irvin Yalom uses his experience with ten clients to illustrate how people change in therapy. Sometimes the change comes out of brilliant insights, sometimes it comes from the therapist's mistakes. Either way, Yalom's integrity in relating these vignettes helps the reader understand the process better.If you're not in therapy, perhaps this book will help you understand yourself and your internal processes a bit better. Which of Yalom's patients do you identify with? Which to you totally reject? Either of those patients, and Yalom's treatment of them, has something to teach you.If you are in therapy, notice how Yalom treats his patients, how he thinks about them. How does this compare to your relationship with your therapist? Do you experience the same challenges, the same caring, the same dynamic? Or do you just show up and whine for an hour?As a therapist, I found Yalom's work particularly brave. Who would write a book about their mistakes? Yet, from his mistakes, I find myself learning--and also better enabled to learn from my mistakes. Reading Love's Executioner helped to keep me from sitting on that God-like Throne and remember to be a human being with my clients; a fellow sufferer, an ally in the healing process.And if the idea of therapy seems not to apply to you, then you may simply find this book a fascinating story about how a thoughtful and insightful man deals with the sorrows, wounds, and needs of other human beings. These stories impart a powerful understanding of human relationships, whether you're involved in therapy or not.Five stars for candor and courage.

He has openly and honestly exposed all of his personal and professional weaknesses. As a therapist myself, it was refreshing to read an honest representation of what actually occurs in therapy rather than a self-serving and white-washed version of what happened. The strength of this book is in Yalom's ability to express the intricacies of the therapeutic process, the stages that each therapeutic relationship can go through, and its impact on both therapist and client. Another strength, is Yalom's willingness to openly expose his own therapeutic failures. I have learnt a great deal from him about what actually works in therapy. I have also re-learnt the value of not inflicting one's own biases on one's own clients. This problem can be solved by either resolving one's own issues, or referring the client to someone else who may better suit the client's needs. Yalom openly confronted what occurs when a therapist persists with a client, when they are unable to create an effective therapeutic relationship. No-one is perfect, not even the great Yalom. In exposing his own weaknesses, Yalom risks being misunderstood or even ridiculed. However, by taking this risk, Yalom offers the reader the opportunity to thoroughly examine the therapeutic process itself, what works and what fails for therapists and clients alike. It was a great read, I couldn't put it down!"},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"Just wanted to add that I'm sure therapists can learn more about the therapy process by reading this book, and clients can benefit not only from relating to the patients presented in the book -- but _also_, the added insight from getting a feel for the &quot;big picture,&quot; of what the therapist is trying to do, can be very helpful to those in the recovery and healing process. One also leaves the stories with a great sense of admiration for Yalom. Yalom does a great job of verbalizing the process of counseling, with its infinite nuances."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"Dr. Yalom certainly does not put himself on a pedestal. He is honest about his prejudices and shortcomings and because of that, is able to overcome them in many cases. His personal belief, &quot;an unexamined life is not worth living&quot; serves him, his patients, and his readers very well. Whether you are considering therapy, have been through therapy, or are simply interested in getting to know yourself a little better, this book is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"In \\"Love's Executioner,\\" Yalom shares fascinating and true stories from his psychotherapeutic relationships. He tells us that changes were made to protect the identities of his patients, but that he utilizes \\"symbolically equivalent substitutes,\\" and he admits to fudging some of the dialogue, which is probably little different than anyone's post hoc process notes.Yalom is a great therapist, a solid teacher, a good story-teller, and a good enough writer to make these tales well worth reading. These stories are probably entertaining enough on their own to be read by any audience, but they have immeasurable value for budding therapists. In Yalom's semi-fictionalized narratives, as in his more academic writing, he endorses a fluid, non-dogmatic approach to therapy. I enjoyed his comments on traditional psychoanalysts, who \\"seem more certain of everything than I am of anything,\\" an attitude which Yalom claims serves to comfort the therapist but does nothing to help the patient: \\"Though there is something reassuring about an omniscient therapist who is always in control of every situation, there can be something powerfully engaging about a fumbling therapist, a therapist willing to flounder with the patient until they, together, stumble upon an enabling discovery.\\" As something of a nascent flounder myself, I find this reassuring.If I had to complain, and it's being petty, but I wish the title and cover illustration didn't make it look like I'm reading a second class romance novel. I know I shouldn't care what a train full of surly strangers thinks about my reading, but I do catch myself feeling a little self-conscious about it, especially because I catch myself jumping to conclusions about other people based on what they are reading. Especially here in Boston, when I see a person purposefully choose the Boston Herald over the Boston Globe, I know it can only mean one of two things, and they are both reprehensible. And the titles of the individual stories in this collection all make sense in the context of the therapeutic tales, but might be alarming to the other sardines reading over my shoulder on the rush hour greenline carriage. I know these are small-minded objections, but, what can I say?"},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"Many of the reviewers have already discussed the details of the stories so I am going to keep my comments on Dr.Yalom's therapeutic approach. Being a psychiatrist myself, and having the luxury of receiving and giving therapy, I will say that Dr.Yalom's brutal honesty, his grasp of transference and countertransference, his humbleness in acknowledging his own blunders is simply breathtaking. He is a breath of fresh air as most psychotherapist, and analysts in particular have truly a hard time acknowledging their mistakes. You hear about their patients' transference but never about their own countertransference. Dr.Yalom bares it all. Reading him made me feel like I am back in supervision with an excellent teacher who truly knows what therapeutic relationship is. Most of us believe that it is our interpretation of patients fantasies and dreams that bring about change. The reality is most changes come about by the patients' own hard work and we only provide the safe environment for that to occur. Dr.Yalom humbly acknowledges that time and time again. His departure from fixed rigid rules, sometimes holding someone's hand, hugging someone, extending therapy session, reducing fee or not charging fee are all great examples of a therapist who is truly engaged with that particular patient and for every patient he creates a new therapeutic relationship. There is no cookie-cutter models, or algorithms for therapy.A must for all therapists, therapists in training and people interested in therapy."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"As a therpast in training this book was great! I loved reading about Yalom's version of his therapy sessions. I also enjoyed the fact that he is painfully honest.

I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"Love's Executioner is a gripping read. Not only does Yalon provide the reader with ten difficult and interesting cases, he gives a powerful insight into the skills and dilemmas of the therapist.

She is often more introspective and willing to read deeper books than I am. This is one of those books I would not have picked up on my own but did it for the club so I could discuss it.What an interesting book. It was a little bit disturbing to me. Although this therapist was willing to write about his mistakes I often felt a bit anxious for the people in this book. I often felt a bit like there was more that could have been told, more to say about the stories in this book than Dr. Yalom told. I think I was looking for the 'whole story' and even he couldn't give it because he just knew this little snippet of a person's life.It was worth reading this book.

Too often the analyst/counselor/psychologist is the \\"idolized parent\\" is not supposed to have real/human feelings of his or her own, and Dr. Yalom's book (this and several others) show current and aspiring clinicians like myself that it is only natural and desirable to not only have these feelings, but to acknowledge them.The author writes with a familiar style that makes you feel as if you have been in analysis with him. I have learned a great deal about how to process my own cases (and my own therapy experiences) by reading this, as well as Dr. Yalom's latest work which is direct to therapists themselves.I am not sure this is a book I would recommend to someone who is not a mental health professional; nevertheless, it was food, and healing for my soul at a time when I needed to process some very signficant personal and professional issues that were overlapping.Thank you again, Dr. Yalom, for reminding me that nobodys like myself practice our great craft by standing on the shoulders on great men like yourself."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"Riveting memoirs of ten of Dr. Yalom's most intriguing patients in psychotherapy! For the budding therapist in me, the stories were so infused with memorable insights into a therapist's mind. Dr. Yalom shares his success, failure, insights, and bewilderment with transparent honesty. I felt like I was in his head during these actual therapy sessions, listening in on the chatter of one of the great psychological minds of our time.I would highly recommend the book to two other groups of people. First, those who love stories - these are some of the best and most exciting as Dr. Yalom constantly takes you from the conversation with his patients into his own mind and then back to the session. The stories are fairly short, fast paced, and exciting, for those who struggle with giving attention to a book.Second, to those who are simply interested in exploring their own lives through voyeuristically looking deep into the lives of Dr. Yalom's patients. He hides nothing at all - you'll see to the core of a person's heart and mind, the deepest and most confidential thoughts of a human being are shared here - thoughts and confessions of death, murder, rape, affairs, and dream life (all the clients are of course disguised and consented to their story being told).So, if you're interested in great personal stories of lives that were changed in psychotherapy for whatever reason - to get a view into your own deep life struggles, to learn from one of the great therapists, or to just hear some amazingly detailed and heart-wrenching stories - I'm gonna tell you to go buy and read the book."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"Evrything I've read by Yalom has been both personally and professionally helpful beginning with his group therapy book in graduate school.

Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"Irvin Yalom's experience as a therapist really shows in this book. He lets the reader into the deepest discussions of therapy, which leave the reader with a new understanding of not only the specific details of psychology, but also a new outlook on life.The book starts out slow with the first four to five stories; especially the first, which I found to be the least interesting.However, the book picks itself up as Yalom gets the reader to explore the deepest trenches of the mind. The concluding chapter is a marvelous one that will grant the reader a perspective on life."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"In a short time I have become a Yalom fan. After reading two of his books, I must say that Dr. Yalom, is smart, entertaining, and great in his way of writing. It is very interesting for me to hear from a Psychotherapist what they feel while listening to us patients. Dr. Yalom's writings have definately helped me see the Therapy session from my Therapist's stand point, and has helped me understand why Therapist's work the way they do. After reading Dr. Yaloms books I have gone into therapy more perpared for the journey and at times I have made my Therapist do a double take on my knowledge of the theraputic process. Yalom is one reason why I have chosen to go back to school and pursue a career in Psychotherapy. I would recommend all of Dr. Yalom's books to all readers, especially patients who want to have an inside view of what their Therapist's might encounter in the therapy session."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"This book gives an honest opinion on the struggles and the victories in being a psychotherapist. I especially recommend it for those going into the field. It is reassuring to know that even the greatest of psychotherapist (Yalom) has difficulties he has to over come too."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"The first case presented by Dr Yalom is a seventy-year-old lady called Thelma who fell in love with her previous therapist Matthew 8 years ago and has thus to deal with the difficult ethical question whether a therapist should be allowed to seduce a patient or be seduced by the patient.Carlos is virtually alone in the world and his obsession is to make love to as many women as possible, never twice to the same one.Betty is an extremely obese, plain, boring and deeply depressed twenty-seven year old woman. Because the therapist may sometimes be rebuked by a patient's physical appearance, this gives the opportunity to the author to talk about the concepts of transference and countertransference.Penny is a thirty-eight year old woman whose daughter died four years previously, whose husband abandoned her and whose son is in jail and the other hiding. She suffers from acute bereavement.Elva had been traumatised and suffers from post-traumatic stress, she feels unsafe, has a reduced startle threshold and is hypervigilant.Dave needs the therapist's help because he wants him to be the keeper of his love letters.Marie remains frozen in grief three years after the death of her husband and the only way to help her is an attempt to be treated by a hypnotherapist.Saul worked for a year at the Stockholm Research Institute and he is convinced that his research there was not really appreciated. When a first letter, then a second and a third arrive from the Institute, Saul is convinced that they are writing to him about the poor quality of his work and dares not open them. He then falls into a terrible depression.Marge's own evaluation is that she is nothing, garbage, a creep, a cipher. When her therapist leaves the city after treating her for ten years, she seriously considers suicide...And finally there is Marvin who at sixty-four starts developing disabling migraine headaches which result in impotence.In each case, Dr Yalom carefully describes his work as a psychotherapist in order to help his patients overcome their problems. One can only feel a strong empathy with each individual sufferer and marvel at the technique and stratagems the therapist has to use to cure those troubled personalities."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"I found this book in the garbage in front of my building, god knows I should have left it there. The writing is excellent and the stories are fascinating, but the author injects far too much of himself and his repulsive attitude towards women into the narrative. \\"If only rape were legal\\"..ha ha the hard core feminists were outraged. In the Love's Executioner story, he winks at us..who would find a 70 year old woman attractive? The Fat Lady rants were truly nauseating. His self-serving wrap-up did nothing to ameliorate the foul taste of his hatred for fat women. Then, in the very next story, he says, \\"I like hard women..\\"Who cares what he likes? What a pompous, arrogant jackass.I didn't read any more, I threw the book in the garbage can from whence it came. Sometimes \\"free\\" books aren't worth the price. I wish I could get back that hour of my life, and purge the writer's nastiness from my mind! Imagine going to someone like this at a vulnerable stage in one's life, only to be patronized and treated with contempt! This guy has serious issues that need to be looked at."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"Who wouldn't want to know what the therapist is thinking? This book describes Irvin Yalom's honest reactions and insights while telling fascinating tales of emotional recovery. As the editor of) an anthology of writing about this subject (Inside Therapy, for which Dr. Yalom wrote a foreword, I find his writing as compelling as a great book of fiction yet as true as the most honest memoir."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"Excellent book! I laughed, I cried, and I learned so much. A really great book. I appreciate Dr. Yalom's opportunity to sit and learn with him. Thank you. Highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"This book was a fascinating glimpse into the sometimes bizarre relationship between psychotherapist and patient. While I appreciated Yalom's candor about his own feelings and reactions to his patients and what they divulged, I was frankly taken aback at the transferrance he described as sometimes flowing both ways. It seemed at first highly unprofessional, yet after reflection, it would be unrealistic to think even the most dedicated professional could empathetically listen to his patients' complex web of emotion and pathology without becoming involved in more than a superficial way. As Yalom describes it, his willingness to dig deep with his patients and immerse himself in their relationship was critical to their trust and cooperation.In the introduction, the author offered a mind-expanding discussion about psychotherapy, its essence, and its goals. I felt greatly edified from having read it. A few of the highlights:\\"So much wanting. So much longing. And so much pain, so close to the surface, only minutes deep.\\"\\"My primary clinical assumption -- an assumption on which I based my technique -- is that basic anxiety emerges from a person's endeavors, conscious and unconscious -- to cope with the harsh facts of life, the 'givens' of existence...I hope to demonstrate, in these ten tales of psychoterapy, that it is possible to confront the truths of existence and harness their power in the service of personal change and growth.\\"\\"In my many years of work with cancer patients facing imminent death, I have noted two particularly powerful and common methods of allaying fears about death, two beliefs, or delusions, that afford a sense of safety. One is the belief in personal specialness; the other, the belief in an ultimate rescuer.\\"\\"Since patients tend to resist assuming responsibility, therapists must develop techniques to make patients aware of how they themselves create their own problems.\\"\\"While the assumption of responsibility brings the patient into the vestibule of change, it is not synonymous with change. And it is change that is always the true quarry, however much a therapist may court insight, responsibility assumption, and self-actualization.\\"I highlighted some other tidbits in the book I found interesting, but they mean much less out of context.\\"As a general rule, the less one's sense of life fulfillment, the greater one's death anxiety.\\"[It was] \\"Nietzsche who said somewhere that when you first meet someone, you know all about him; on subsequent meetings, you blind yourself to your own wisdom.\\"\\"People who feel empty never heal by merging with another incomplete person. On the contrary, two broken-winged birds coupled into make for clumsy flight. No amount of patience will help it fly; and, ultimately, each must be pried from the other, and wounds separately splinted.\\"Of a patient who could not get past the death of a child to cancer, he said, \\"She had that very hour give me a concept that would serve me in good stead in all my future work with the bereaved: if one is to learn to live with the dead, one must first learn to live with the living.\\"In this book, Yalom is highly successful in his goal of providing for the layperson a glimpse into the methods and efficacy of psychotherapy. As Austin said in his review, I suspect many readers will feel they might benefit from some time with a good therapist too."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"Dr. Yalom, reveals the complex transference and countertransference in a very humane way. Exposing himself to the reader as a person and therapist, he shares his wisdom and weaknesses. I am humbled by his honesty."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"This book was assigned as part of a class in my Masters in Psychology program. The book is filled with stories about Yalom and his clients and as a future therapist I find it fascinating. I would read it even if it were not assigned. He offers an insider view as to how a therapist views his own internal dialogue and experiences in the therapeutic process."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"I just love it! When I was reading the book almost every page had something that touched me inside, made me feel more human just like anyone else. I learned so much with it that I couldn't go by without sharing my experience here. It's definitely a book to re-read over and over again."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"There is no higher compliment than to say that it, along with The Gift Of Therapy, made me a better, more inspired therapist."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"Yalom is famous for his work as an Existentialist Psychotherapist and in this time-tested work, he delivers the goods once again. Very human and humane in his exploration of the lives of other people, Yalom brings out what it really means to face existential pain and the crux of eclectic/existentialist psychotherapy.I used this book for case study material for a psychotherapy class and it works great for those purposes as well! If you need good material to use for a paper or just general reading to gain insight into this form of psychotherapy, I highly recommend this work!"},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"Great book to look into the thought processes of Yalom with different clients he had over the years. Has good words of wisdom for individuals wanting to be psychotherapists or counselors, even if your theoretical orientation is not Existentialism."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"I am really unclear as to how this book might have received anything less than 5 stars... It was recommended to me by my psychotherapy supervisor, at my request to read something a little more digestible than our textbook on said subject. I began reading and was immediately immersed in a magical, mysterious field of psychoanalysis that had been previously hidden from me! As promised, I not only learned, but enjoyed the learning, and hardly realized that I did learn throughout the journey that was this novel of short stories. I literally could not put the book down, and so apparently thought the others who read this book from my public library; the book itself has been read so many times that it has literally fallen apart into three separate sections. I am now a better therapist, and a happier person for having read this book- Thank you, Dr. Yalom!"},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"Irving Yalom is very frank and very blunt about countertrasference situations with his patients. Very interesting vignettes that I highly recommend for students, professionals, and faculty alike."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"I read this book as a textbook for an introduction class in an MFT program. Absolutely loved the writing style, humor, insight, and perspective that Yalom brings to the field of counseling/psychology. The writing is accessible, sharp, and poignant. It opened up great class discussions, but would have also been a fun and interesting read outside of the classroom setting."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"Reading what others have wrote, basically that the way he thinks about patients is disgusting, is not true. What Yalom does in this book is prove that he is human. I am a woman, and I don't find his thoughts inappropriate. At times, Yalom does judge his patients, but as you read on, as he gets to know them, this judgment passes..is this not how everyone lives their lives? Judging others until they get a closer look? This book gives an incredible view into the therapist/patient relationship and is a real eye-opener to many of our everyday issues. I would highly suggest this book, it is one that I believe I will find myself reading again in the future."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"This book had me captivated from the moment I opened it and it never stopped, I didn't want to ever put it down. For anyone who wants to read about the therapeutic relationship and it's dynamics this is the one!"},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"I started reading this book with the expectation that I would find an interesting but nonetheless mechanical look into the brass tacks of psychiatry... and found something far more dangerous and intriguing: Dr. Yalom is a creative writer. And he's utterly brilliant.Starting with the prologue, this work is filled with deep and genuine originality, taste, and introspection. Dr. Yalom's prose is sagaciously crafted, and a pleasure to read and reread.The entirety of the collection is used as an abstract for Dr. Yalom's belief that \\"existential psychotherapy\\" -- an operative stance where existential issues are the patient's core complications -- can be one of the most effective and multi-purposed tools in the psychiatrist's arsenal. Each case-study illustrates the mechanics -- and the spirit -- of this approach in fascinating detail.One of the most interesting facets of this book is how candid Dr. Yalom is about his own feelings, biases, and reactions. The propositions that doctors are explicitly human, that therapy depends dramatically upon the manipulation of cause-and-effect, that the identity of the therapist is not (and cannot be) unaffected by the exchange, and that psychotherapy is, for the lack of a better phrase, significantly driven by trial and error, are all huge areas of discussion.And what's more, when it comes to the individual stories themselves, there is no shortage of emotional impact. We really live these sessions along with patient and doctor, and each climax and culmination leaves the reader more in touch with their own reality. (\\"Therapeutic Monogamy,\\" for instance, left me with tears.)A radical and radiant piece of scientific, creative nonfiction. Definitely a 5 star read."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"This book contains some very real personal and insightful facts about a therapist and his patient.I enjoyed it and it read quickly."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"It is rare to find a book with such detailed description of the process of psychotherapy written in a style which makes it very enjoyable reading."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"I had to read this book for a graduate course I was taking. I read it in one day instead of chapter by chapter because the stories were so interesting. I found Yalom a bit much to stomach at times, but the clients themselves were very interesting and his writing style is engaging."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"As a student in the field and someone participating in counseling myself, this book offered many insights into my behavior in both roles. Great book for anyone interested in psychology from any angle."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"This was my first Yalom book. The title caught my interest then i bought the book and started to read it before dozens of books i planned to read.The preface, which explains the very/basic pains of being/ life, i think includes one of the most crucial basic lectures in one's life... After this strong preface, the main structure of the book, the tales section, focusing on more personal issues -but still being very universal- is lighter.The book finishes with a marvellous tale called \\"In the Search of Dreamer\\" in which deep/ hidden/ unconscious feelings, disappointments, desires are revealed to the patient by extraordinary dreams. I was amazed at Dr Yalom's talent in interpreting these astonishing dreams."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"This book is written by a psychotherapist, who has mainly existential views though he is flexible enough to adjust his practice to meet the needs of individuals. Each chapter follows an intriguing story of one of his patients - an overweight woman who loses almost 100 pounds, a terminally ill cancer patient, a widow, a mother grieving over the loss of her favorite daughter, etc. The cases shed light on the true practice of psychotherapy. It illustrates successful exchanges and frustrations alike, thus providing a realistic expectation for those considering the profession. The author wrote it mainly in a story format, but throughout describes his thought processes that clarify some of the techniques. I read this book in a day because it's written in such an engaging style. Primarily, it showed me what to expect if I were to become a psychotherapist. It also discussed issues in the patients, or even the therapist, that everyone has to deal with at some point in their lives. It gave me a better understanding of others, and myself as well."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"Love's Executioner is a collection of stark and often lurid tales from Irvin Yalom's psychiatric practice. From the first chapter, it is clear that the reader is in for a roller coaster ride through the therapeutic process that often reads like pulp fiction. At first, the author appears struck by his own hubris; however, it becomes clear that he is aware of his foibles and is in fact, using them to teach and enlighten. This book is loaded with insights into the process for aspiring and practicing therapists and the author leaves enough interpreting for the reader so as promote thinking, discussion, and dialog.These stories are carefully crafted reenactments of real events that are designed to elicit a response from the reader. On being real, we see that Yalom does indeed admit to his shortcomings. The irony is that his issues are actually our issues. They are designed to challenge us to explore our own ideas, preconceptions, and counter-transference issues. This book is in fact, what he has referred to as a teaching novel. His unapologetic style and sincerity overcome the morbidity of some of the tales. In the end, we find out as much about ourselves as we do about the clients he is treating."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"This is a must for anyone interested in Psychotherapy. Beautifully written, the tales are incredibly honest accounts of cases Yalom has dealt with. I have recommended the book to many of my friends and colleagues. A must!"},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"This book is a fascinating and honest look at psychotherapy from the therapist's perspective. His detailed summaries of his work with various clients makes it feel as though you are experiencing the process in his mind. Whether right or wrong, effective or not, he gives his opinions and the outcomes of his work throughout each case (including his personal growth). His accounts are truly intriguing, humorous, touching, and genuine. Yalom even includes some taboo and politically incorrect, but entirely human, things he experiences throughout the sessions, adding much credibility. Love's Executioner is well written, easy to read, incredibly entertaining, and informative... so go read it. :)"},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"This was read in little over a day, and that is with personal vision problems! Dr. Yalom writes in a manner that lets the reader be an essential voyer into the sessions. At times I could not put the book down until I found out what happened in the next session. The clients were being seen around the same time and some of the stories intertwine in Yalom's life. I was encouraged because at times my response would mirror his confirming for me that I working towards the work I am meant to pursue. It is a little like CSI for the psychotherapist!"},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"This is a fascinating book, opening the intricacies of psychotherapy for all to see. Yalom can seem like an egotistical jerk, and then like an insightful, caring man. I enjoyed the book - but the fact that Yalom seemed to do more growing than his patients made me skeptical of therapy!"},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"Though I am not a mental health professional or a patient, I found these stories moving. Who would have thought that a collection of short stories set almost entirely in a psychiatrist's office would offer so much drama? The action in Love's Executioner takes place in the minds of the characters, yet Yalom's grasp of his patients' fundamental humanity, together with the therapist's own candid self-criticism make these stories into genuine page turners. As the patients recount their lives and struggles, the drama works on the level of the interior experience of the characters. Ultimately, that is where we all experience the drama of life. We experience life, love, heartbreak and distress in the privacy of our own minds, and we as readers can be enthralled by these internal struggles of the characters every bit as much as by dramatic external crises. Yalom has a gift for the telling detail so that he can recount an entire case history in ten pages while still conveying the essence of the personal growth (or resistance) of both the therapist and the patient. As explained consisely in the prologue, each of the stories is designed to illustrate Yalom's existential approach to psychotherapy. Yalom holds that most mental illness can be traced to \\"existence pain\\" or the pain the people feel in coming to grips with the \\"four givens\\" of existence: Our essential alonenesss, the reality of death, our terrifying freedom and responsiblity for our lives and our lack of meaning in life. The inability to face this pain is the primary source of disfunction for Yalom, and his method consists in helping patients come to grips with these fundamentals. I do not subscribe to existentialism as a philosophy, and I am neither a patient nor a therapist. Nonetheless, the realism of the human drama in these stories was compelling for me. Ultimately, we all must get real with the harsh realities of life, and Yalom's gift is that his stories entertain even as they heal."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"A friend gave me this book a few days ago. My friend is very well-educated, has lived all over the world, and has experienced more than most people. When he gave me the book, he said to me, \\"This book reflects my vision of the world\\".How could I help but be intrigued?Opening the book, he then read the following passage from the Preface: \\"Four givens are particularly relevant for psycho-therapy: the inevitability of death for each of us and for those we love; the freedom to make our lives as we will; our ultimate aloneness; and, finally, the absence of any obvious meaning or sense to life.\\"When I recently read the novel LIFE AND FATE, which takes its characters through the massive Battle of Stalingrad and Stalin's Great Terror, I couldn't help thinking how poor in material for great novels is the typical life of a prosperous, well-educated professional living today in the OECD. Compared to the intensity of the experiences described in LIFE AND FATE, even wonderful writers like Ian McEwan are boring.But, as the Preface accurately foreshadows, there is nothing boring about LOVE'S EXECUTIONER, because my friend is right-- the four issues described in the Preface do indeed define the human condition.In a sense, LOVE'S EXECUTIONER offers, in the broadest possible sense, the ancient wisdom found in Psalms 90: \\"Teach us to number our days: that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.\\" Dr. Yalom is quite frank about what he considers the \\"magical\\" thinking and \\"delusion\\" involved in religious belief, however. Aside from his commitment to unflinchingly acknowledge the truths he describes in his Preface (and therefore, \\"Teach us to number our days\\"), Dr. Yalom's faith resides in the healing potential of the relationship between the therapist and the patient. This could be generalised to incorporate the Second Commandment to \\"Love thy neighbour as thyself\\" with its emphasis on human relationships and mutual openness, but one senses that Dr. Yalom would acknowledge this point, at best, with a sardonic shrug--\\"Whatever gets you through the night.\\"Yalom is his own main character, and LOVE'S EXECUTIONER is a dramatic account of how the \\"character\\" Dr. Yalom undergoes dramatic encounters with deeply troubled characters not unlike the way the \\"character\\" Dante encounters vividly depicted souls in Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise.Like Dante's DIVINE COMEDY, LOVE'S EXECUTIONER is episodic. The ten tales all vary and will affect individual reader's differently. For some reason, I found the case of the morbidly obsese woman deeply moving, while being most unsettled by the cases of the elderly neurobiologist and the elderly accountant--perhaps because they were the patients most similar to me.thers will relate to other patients, but what Yalom consistently does in each of these stories is to bring out the fascinating richness and complexity of human beings, the many layers and conflicting motivations and emotions, and by doing so he fully justifies the intense struggles and engagement of \\"Dr. Yalom\\", the character, in his efforts to diagnose and heal his patients, all of whom, whether likable or not, seem intensely alive in the pages of LOVE'S EXECUTIONER.This not to say that Yalom is a genius of the order of Dante, of course, but these tales have an intensity that can be compared to the effect of great literature. Dr. Yalom derives his authority, not from artistic genius (although he is a skillful and sophisticated writer) but from the fact that he is intimately familiar with terrain that frightens and intimidates most of us: severe psychological distress, grief, suicidal feelings, depression, unresolvable anxiety. Like Dr. Szczeklik, the author of CATHARSIS, Dr. Yalom maintains his poise under circumstances in which most of us would be acutely uncomfortable, and probably ineffectual. The fact that these two doctors can calmly navigate the ground of life and death, of insanity and inner darkness, sets them apart and makes their books compelling."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"I loved this book because it illustrates so beautifully the inescapable challenges and contradictions at the centre of existence. In the words of one of Professor Yalom's patients &quot;everyone has a heart&quot; and we are permitted a rare insight into the therapeutic relationship to feel and understand how these hearts beat, bleed and heal. This book provides unforgettable insights on human relationships and the nature of therapy."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"THANK YOU! This book was sent to me fast and it is amazing! I am in a graduate program for clinical psychology but I love to read books that are related but not textbook on my free time"},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"Huge Yalom fan, love all of his writing. He is the best active therapist / writer out there, and anyone interested in psychology should be reading much of his work."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"As a graduate student in counseling, I was both excited and relieved by this candid account of Dr. Yalom's own experiences with ten very unique clients. He lets us see what he was thinking, shows us that we aren't alone in thinking some patients are boring, others completely frustrating. Dr. Yalom is a brilliant, yet completely honest human, and I have learned as much, or more, from his writings as I have in my formal counseling education. A must read for anyone interested in studying to be a therapist or thinking about getting therapy!"},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"A masterpiece work of what therapy can do for both someone practicing as well as receiving therapy. It should be recommended reading in classes prepareing therapists and it also is an excellent guideline or base of what a patient should aspire for in receiving treatment. It is clearly and brilliantly written - not much jargon - and if you do not need therapy or do not think you do, you can benefit tremendously from just absorbing the dynamics. A quick quote - &quot;if one is to learn to live with the dead , one must first learn to live with the living.&quot; Enjoy it - learn."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"If any of you reader-critic people think you're encountering a therapist or Doctor or friend who sees you without judgement--then you're simply fooling yourselves. Anyone who pretends they've got no judgement of you is selling you something. Even the holiest of humans judge--I'm sure of it. Get over yourselves--we are limited, we are not perfect. Yalom speaks the truth about his countertransference and that is a gift to all who are involved in the therapeutic enterprise. It is when we deny the shadow that we are in real trouble. Fat may not disgust everyone it is true--but this is Yalom's experience, and this is what he gives us unabashedly. Can you not find it within yourselves to allow him his feelings? Unconditional positive regard can only happen with full acknowledgement of all projections good and bad."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"Dr. Yalom's book is a compelling read...there is no doubt about that. However, the good doctor is one of the most pompous, egotistical authors I have read in a long time. If criticism of Dr. Yalom's personality is not something you care to read about in a review, you can click the \\"not helpful to me\\" button and move on.The stories were fascinating...they truly were. But is the point of therapy to heal the patient..or heal the therapist? Dr. Yalom seemed to spend more time serving himself than serving others. But that is just my take. I appreciate his honesty...and maybe I should give him a little more credit for being so honest...but much of his *honesty* borders on cruelty and, as a humanitarian, I have a hard time with that. Plus, he tempers a lot of his self-deprecating honesty with a large dose of, \\"look at how brilliantly I handled this patient!\\" Although I enjoyed reading about the history/therapy/resolution of each of the patients, I found that I just could not finish the book. His personality was that repugnant to me. And for me not to finish a book is extremely rare.If you are looking for interesting stories about psychotherapy, by all means purchase this book. You will get your money's worth. However, if the narrative is also important to you, you may find yourself in the same situation as me...wondering how such a pompous individual can stay in such a *people* business for so long."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"Yalom, as usual, uses fascinating examples to stir one's inner world and take the reader where he or she may previously have not ventured. At least, perhaps, not ventured from such a perspective. I found this book stretching my thinking in understanding myself and others in a more human way; but most of all, as a psychotherapist, to embrace the work I do with a far more realistic approach for which I am forever grateful."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"This short book contains a lot. Mr. Yalom is well known for his limitless wisdom and research regarding group therapy. This book is very witty and entertaining. What I like most is that the author reveals some of his inner dialogue when working with clients. This is very revealing and refreshing; to know that even therapists have issues and, as any good therapist knows, regularly receive psychotherapy themselves. I would recommend this book to anyone. I don't recall there being any 'psychobabble' or terms that are used exclusively by therapists. Mr. Yalom very simply presents the lives of some very complex people."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"Along with a mountain of other texts, this book was required reading in my first psychotherapy course. I was enrolled in a PhD program in clinical psychology, with a relatively strict orientation towards cognitive behavioral therapy. One of my concerns was that I would have to assume a persona, a guy in a labcoat with a clipboard. The most powerful impact Yalom's book had on me as a young therapy student was the understanding that who I am as a person both would and should impact who I am as a therapist. I felt liberated. Yes, I needed to have a philosophical/theoretical foundation to the work I would do with clients, but who I was would influence the work that I did.I experienced the \\"narcissism\\" that so appalled some reviewers as breathtaking honesty. We are all of us human. Any therapist who reports being free of all unacceptable responses to clients, of never having a thought or engaging in an exchange that was more a function of one's own history and struggles is either deluded or a liar. Should doing therapy with clients be a substitute for addressing all of one's own foibles? Absolutely not, nor does Yalom suggest as much. However, a therapist who experiences clients as \\"less than,\\" people from whom we can learn nothing, fills me with far more dread than a therapist who acknowledges an ignoble response to a client or the fact that s/he is also imperfect and capable of prejudice. None of us who is honest can say that we have each and every one of these reactions and prejudices perfectly catalogued or perfectly conquered. Life is about growth. I don't think we're supposed to stop doing that until we enter the Great Dirt Nap.As for those upset by some of his revelations, (e.g., to the \\"fat lady,\\" his internal sexual response to female clients) I have two questions: 1) Prior to achieving sublime self-actualization wherein I no longer have such inappropriate responses, just what *should* I do about them? Pretend they aren't there? Engage in self-flagellation like a medieval monk? Well, a wise person knows where these approaches lead; 2) Do you really think that the 20 or so pages of each vignette actually encompasses every important aspect of the therapy, or is Yalom attempting to address some very limited themes and issues?It has been about 18 years since I first read Yalom's book and let me say that I do not conduct therapy as Dr. Yalom does. First, I am not Irvin Yalom, nor have I ever tried to be Irvin Yalom. Secondly, the ugly reality of the field of psychotherapy today is that unless one exclusively services the very wealthy (something I am not willing to do--behold one of my own unconquered prejudices), we are very limited as to the time we can spend with our clients. I still consider myself to be a cognitive-behavioral therapist, an orientation of which Yalom is not a big fan. I also have some disagreements with Yalom regarding the value of diagnosis and other matters. But in addition to the early liberation I described above, Yalom's wonderful book has helped me to be less doctrinaire, more flexible, willing to embrace alternate approaches and more client-focused, more accepting of my own imperfections and understanding the absolute necessity of addressing them. I think I'm a damned good therapist, and I thank Yalom and this book for setting me on the road.When starting work with an intern, I typically give them a copy of this book. As a goodbye, I give a copy of Yalom'sThe Gift of Therapy: An Open Letter to a New Generation of Therapists and Their Patients. The latter is an excellent selection of brief lessons in conducting psychotherapy and is also highly recommended. I can't guarantee that every psychotherapist-in-training or practicing psychotherapist who reads them will have a transforming experience, but I would hope that at minimum one would pick up an idea or two that will positively impact your practice in the future."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"LOVE'S EXECUTIONER offers the reader a rare look at psychotherapy through the eyes of an extraordinarily skilled and experienced psychotherapist. Dr. Yalom tells the stories of his encounters with his patients with unusual honesty and warmth. His willingness to acknowledge uncertainty, self-doubt, and not always generous feelings about his patients portrays psychotherapy as an intricate, but imperfect art. Shattering the illusion of the all-knowing psychotherapist does both therapists and patients a service by creating realistic expectations of this special kind of encounter between two human beings.Dr. Yalom brings to each of his stories the vibrancy of a finely crafted mystery, each with twists and turns and often endings that are as much of a surprise to his patients as to the therapist and his readers. His fascination with obsessive love sets the tone of his title story and also plays a prominent part in his historical novel WHEN NIETZSCHE WEPT. His superb storytelling both entertains and gently educates, providing his readers with a rare insight not only into psychotherapy, but into the human condition.Richard Moskovitz, M.D., authorCarousel MusicandLost in the Mirror, 2nd Edition: An Inside Look at Borderline Personality Disorder."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"This cleverly written book redeemed the value of psycho-therapy in my eyes. This profession is really a craft, since it relies on strategy and tactics to help the patient reclaim control over his/her life. In therapy, appeals to reason are often ineffective. And so are attempts to tell the patient \\"what to do\\". The first step in all successful therapy is responsibility assumption, aimed at behavior change. The focus is not so much on \\"content\\" but on \\"process\\"; not on the \\"what,\\" but on the \\"how.\\" A good therapist helps the patients \\"unfold\\"; he sheds light on patterns and meanings, and helps them assume responsibility. A therapist treats the patients as \\"equals\\" (This is why I could NEVER be a therapist).Yalom emphasizes the importance not only of an archeological dig of the past, but of a loving, involved presence in the here and now. He also suggests that we should never categorize people because there is so much more to a person than the contours of his/her problem: in other words the \\"other\\" is ultimately unknowable.Therapists also have to deal with transference and counter-transference; dream interpretation; and deep meaning behind certain words and sentences of their patients.The book is called \\"Love's executioner\\" because Yalom sometimes has to help patients unmask the projections behind and infatuations attached to their patients' \\"love.\\""},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"Dr. Yalom has created a collection of stories regarding ten patients and their experiences. What is unique about Dr. Yalom's writing is that he is free and open in describing his own feelings about and towards his patients. These cover a full range of emotions, including frustration, anger, disgust and empathy. Usually one reads about the patient, but in these encounters, Dr. Yalom almost bares as much of his own pathos as his patients and that can be unsettling.One patient understands and is finally relieved of her eight-year obsession with a younger man, but is left with the reality of her own boring octogenarian life. Another regards a man who is dying of cancer and would like to rape all women, especially those in his therapy group. He is filled with anger, but finally understands how to change his human flaw before death. Yet another chapter is just called, \\"Fat lady\\" and this is one where Dr. Yalom really lets loose with his patient. He empathizes and completely understands her history and pain, yet readily admits to being disgusted by her appearance and was surprised that he could actually get his arms around her in a final hug.Some may find his technique of psychotherapy obscenely honest, yet it does put the practitioner on the same plane as the patient. To many, that will be upsetting - to realize that the person helping you is only a human guide for your own journey towards \\"wellness\\"."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"I have read only the first half of this book, but find myself entirely impressed by Yalom's reassuring sense that his readers are given about honest reactions to clients, and his strategies for dealing with countertransference. Very eloquently written; as a graduate student, I only wish I could observe Yalom in action."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"As an insight into the psychotherapeutic process, from the therapist's perspective (and a highly regarded therapist, at that), this was a moderately interesting read. That's about all I got out of it. A friend had recommended it to me because of its unique perspective on love...and I just didn't find that in the book! And while I've had a few problems in my life, and seen a therapist or two along the way, most of the characters on this couch were a bit too far over the edge for me to relate to."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"I think the &quot;overweight&quot; woman who Dr. Yalom had a hard time relating to should send him a bill for the &quot;breakthrough&quot; she helped him achieve.I am reminded of the line from the movie, Dangerous Liasions, &quot;Like most intellectuals, he's intensely stupid.&quot;"},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"To be honest: I am writing this review after having read just 35 pages. I purchased this book because I, as a layperson, enjoyed his \\"The Gift of Therapy.\\" Yalom is insightful, an excellent writer, an efficient, and, it seems, an effective therapist. However, the beginning of the first piece in \\"Love's Executioner\\" made me wonder about the extent of his compassion. For instance, he says about Thelma, a 70-year-old woman who is consumed by a brief affair she had eight years before she sees Yalom: \\"Everything I saw in my first glance--her wrinkled seventy-year-old face with that senile chin tremor, her thinning, peroxided, unkempt yellow hair... told me she had to be mistaken, that she could not be in love. How could love ever choose to ravage that frail, tottering old body, or house itself in that shapeless polyester jogging suit?\\"No shame here."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"This is the first book by Dr. Yalom that I have read, but I can't wait to read the next. He is insiteful and helpfull. The central theme of this book is the fear of death and the struggle to overcome that fear. Most people at times have batteled with the fear of death and this book with its ten stories of psychotherapy can give courage to us all.The title story &quot;Love's Executioner&quot; is about an older woman who had an affair with a previous therapist. It is full of twists and proves the adage truth is better than fiction."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"While I thoroughly enjoyed Yalom's book, I must say I was shocked by his almost continous anger and disgust at his patients. Carl Rogers, father of \\"empathic listening\\", states that \\"unconditional positive regard\\" in the therapeutic relationship is imperative for the healing relationship. Yalom, on the contrary, finds everything from a woman's weight, to the way a patient licks her lips, as excuses to get angry and feel disgusted at her. Luckily, he is knowleagable enough to know this is countertransferance, and deals with it. Personally, I'd rather have a less judgmental man as a therapist. The book is well written and interesting though, if you can get beyond his own personal biases."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"This book does describe the therapists clinical encounters and, in almost scary detail, his own personal thoughts. I say 'scary' as almost every encounter with a female patient is about how this married therapist fantasizes about her! The analyses of the other patients is also kind of strange - one patient regrets not having children and has a dream where he meets a daughter he never had. Dr Yalom interprets this as the patient meeting his &quot;female side&quot; and wanting to be in greater touch with it (!?). I'm no therapist but I would have thought the more obvious interpretation was that it was related to his regret about not having children.......the only reason I can see in buying this book is that the cover price is small compared to even one of Dr Yaloms therapy sessions - and reading the book may put you off ever bothering wasting your money on consulting this therapist."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"In the last 10 years I read a lot about psychotherapy and most of the time I learned something new and useful. However, most often, the author would try to \\"sell you\\" his truth, his method as something truly superior to all the others. His method should be present in everybody's life like the water on our planet. Instead Dr. Yalom's book is full of stimulating doubts. The question we should ask ourselves to get our answers and live to the fullest. It's an honest, warm book"},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"For those of you with little time I'll get right to it - Yalom's a great writer, probably a good researcher and a lousy therapist - all by my sole opinion and the evidence of one book of reading by the guy, and his bibliography. The book is engaging, there are moments of brilliance that emerge in his work with patients (trust me these are patient folks ...) and even some interesting aspect of reading Yalom's revelations which account for the greatest part of the book. Simply put this is as another reviewer on Amazon's website put it, \\"an intellectual masturbatory confessional.\\"This guy (Yalom) is on with himself. He is one of the most self-important characters I've ever come across in my reading. He has the typical \\"Graves Six Type\\" penchant for revelation, hedonism and the projection of caring about - and in this case even for - others. The reality is more like he's all about making sure he's okay with what's going on at every moment in his story. His patient's therapy is his chance to get paid for doing his own personal development. Two pieces of evidence for me: One his long diatribe on how \\"countertransference\\" is for the psychotherapist what \\"balance' is for the ballet dancer. His take on countertransference is the psychotherapist's inability to get out their own way in the therapy and their need to work on this - in Yalom's case at least at the expense (literally) of the patient. Two, is his constant internal revelations about how he's experiencing the patient's therapy, about his sense of pleasure or ease or satisfaction in doing therapy with this particular patient or another. This guy is off with himself!!! What a hedonistic fool ... in the classical sense of fool.However, there is a redeeming quality to this book and a reason to read it in my opinion. It is an excellent example of why more \\"traditional\\" forms of psychotherapy (the \\"fifty minute\\" hour type spread over twenty of so years ...) has fallen off, and it's not the \\"fault\\" of HMOs and PPOs despite what these professionals want to claim and their endless lament that the world's not fair (to them or to their patients - of course without their patients how would they entertain themselves and know they are okay in the world?) especially in the face of competition from \\"newer\\" human development technology. It is also, again in my opinion, an excellent primer in some of what NOT TO DO in helping others. What's described is how Yalom so often takes months of his patient's time getting to meaningful work with them, often taking months just to build a suitable level of rapport to do the work the patient requires and desires ... what they are paying him for specifically. He so often describes taking this time because he doesn't want to hurt the patient's feelings or have them think badly of him ... This guy's supposed to be a professional therapist, not only that but one of the best of the best ... and his concern is that he's too incompetent to get his result without hurting his patient's feelings or that they might not think well of him. What's worse is that this guy teaches and supervises other student therapists.The most egregious display of incompetence you can learn from here is how easy it could be for those so inclined to make this work of helping others into a form of working on themselves ... and endlessly so. I am of the opinion that although the healer is also human, and that this humanness is a powerful force in being of help to others, that the work done with others is NOT THE PLACE for doing one's own work ... whatever that might be.Finally, after making sure he's okay, having fun and that his patient's think well of him he begins the actual work with them often only getting to the \\"remedy\\" in the last few weeks of months of preparatory therapy. What I know from both professional experience and education is that this kind of transformational work can be accomplished often in the first session with a client. However, I must also say again that I am not a psychotherapist, not trained in psychotherapy ... and maybe this is ultimately what I learned most from Yalom - I don't need to be one nor do I want to be one ... if this is the result I could expect in being one, kind of like the purple cow of professions ... if Yalom's descriptions can indeed be held as the template of what psychotherapy is about and what psychotherapists are actully like in the privacy of their own thoughts.In the end there are other examples of \\"doing therapy\\" in literature that are much better examples of what can be accomplished by a highly trained individual who less concerned about what he's thinking and what his \\"patients\\" think of him than in moving their patients/clients lives forward. Just do a search under brief therapy or solution-oriented therapy and you'll get a list of suggestions there to begin. If your penchant is for \\"deep\\" therapy, which you believe requires months or years to get to there are also those therapists doing that kind of work without the need to hold the patient/client in place as a kind of manikin for themselves and their own work. I'd recommend \\"The Case of Nora\\" by Moshe Feldenkris as a great piece of therapy literature as an example of the kind of work that is possible with a client in the hands and mind of a master therapist."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"i readed 3 books, and really ideollogicaly i agree with yalom's work, i also want to establish a connection with him, cause i work with people who where in terrorists attacs and i had experience i want to share with him, about parents who lost their children , or survivers, specially at the Israely embassy and jwesh community center in argentina 1992 and 1994."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"His \\"elegant interpretations\\" his \\"powerful words\\" his seniority towards everyone in his field.

I thought that some of the stories were interesting. The book starts with it's \\"good stuff.\\" The middle was ok. The last couple stories were dull.

Very difficult to read. With no past therapy experience on any Therapist couch, I felt terrified with the experiences of the Therapists, not to name patients. From time to time, I feel that this is a profession of the affluent only, and the people on the other side of the equator, are luck that they do not have that much money to spend but pray God, in order to keep themselves sane, which is much cheaper. Price of the book is just a fraction of cost of one hour on the couch, so that book reading is much more feasible."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"I'm not done with it, but I'm enjoying it so far.

Easy to read and entertaining!"},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"I enjoyed the fact that the therapist's point of view, including his own constructive criticism of his attitudes towards clients were very realistic. Each story has a lesson to teach those of us who are therapists. I will recommend this book to my colleagues."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"I found Irvin Yalom to be very insightful into his clients' struggles and humanity. Yalom's ability to reproduce various sessions and present them in an entertaining yet thoughtful manner was incredible. I purchased this book to learn more about the Existentialist viewpoint in therapy, but it also piqued my interest in the psychodynamic approach."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"I enjoy those anecdotals which reveal what's going on inside of the therapist's head. Thankfully, Yalom -while at times arrogant and conceited- shows a more touching side by admitting when he's been stumped, felt apathetic, scared, etc. Basically, it's his usual honesty but in a more touching context. For that reason alone, I was able to go back to some of his other written works and understand that he's direct because he doesn't know any other way to be, and such directness is often misperceived as arrogance. We can learn much from Dr. Yalom, and there's a good chance you will likely fly through this book and reflect on some of those stories often if you're an up-and-coming clinician; this is a good thing, because anyone who expects you to operate perfectly is a fool. If Yalom can admit he's only human and find those connections which transcend theory, then you can -and should- too."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"Rarely does one get to look inside of another's mind through the one person who has such up close and personal experience with them, especially when they are troubled.

I learned a great deal about the process of psychotherapy. I was particularly interested in how Dr. Yalom made his interpretations, and how he proceeded to devise an approach that best suited the patient he was treating. Of particular interest were the patients' dreams and Dr. Yalom's interpretations. It was also very inspiring to see the way the patients themselves used the findings in their therapy, and then proceeded to change their approach to life and eventual happiness."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"Once I started reading this book by Yalom, I couldn't put it down. What a surprise, it was one of those required books for a class, and now its a proud part of my book collection.

Must read."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"What do you want? What do you want? This question was asked in the first part of the book with various responses. It is aimed at the heart and soul of we the readers, compelling us to bring up from our inner being our dreams. Our dreams come leaping to the surface, but along with them emerge hopes yet unmet, failures, hurts, and fears. The book is a case study of a variety of interesting people - each with their &quot;wants&quot; and problems defined. If you like psycology - &quot;what makes people tick&quot;, you will enjoy reading Love's Executioner"},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"This was one of those books that I just could not put down. It was so refreshing to read a therapist admitting that there are some things about some patients he just doesnt like, and instead of letting these patients go, he seizes the opportunity to learn from them. Being in therapy myself, I had worried about whether or not it was healthy to let myself get so attached to my therapist, but these stories have shown me that the best work is done by having a special connection. I cant speak highly enough of this book; probably the best thing i have ever read."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"With no professional or scholarly background in the field of psychotherapy, I nevertheless found this book engrossing, enlightening, and endearing. Each chapter of Love's Executioner describes Dr. Yalom's experience with a different patient, so it is like a collection of short stories. Yalom's writing style is clear and compelling. I was impressed by his honest, open discussion of truths he has faced about himself as he has endeavored to help his patients. It was hard to put this book down. When I finished it, I promptly purchased two more of Yalom's books. I recommend Love's Executioner without reservation - it's intelligent, interesting, heart-warming and thought-provoking."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"I ordered this book as a textbook for one of my Masters classes and I surprisingly enjoyed reading it.

Great book for school or just to read."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"I chose this book to review in an assignment (I'm a counseling student) and absolutely loved it!!! I love the way Yalom writes and this collection was very intriguing. The book took many hours for me to read because I found myself thinking about my own issues, what I might do in Yalom's situation, and my past experiences in group leading. This book isn't just wonderful for counseling students, though. I recommended it to a friend because it has touching personal stories and reveals the truth about therapy."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"Through the lives of ten patients, Yalom writes of the four central harsh facts of life all humans must confront. A wonderfully written book ... which focuses not just upon pain but upon our resilience and resourcefulness in the face of existence."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"This is an eye-opener for anyone who has ever been in therapy. Yalom is brutally honest about his own prejudices and emotions experienced as a doctor conducting a course of therapy. He also demonstrates that human beings are capable of greater insight and self-examination than many of us have ever imagined."},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"The thing I liked the most about this book is the authors willingness to give the reader a glimpse into his own personal life as well as the fact he is willing to admit that unlike the image of the know it all therapist, he not only had a lot to learn, but his own education was constantly evolving.A lot has changed in just ten years. Alternative lifestyles, older women younger men re: Harold and Maude , sexual alternatives aka polyamory and a variety of other changes in society make this a must read. I only hope the author does a second book along the same lines since he is very observant and shares his learning experiences so well"},{"Title":"Love's Executioner, And Other Tales Of Psychotherapy","review":"Having read one of Yalom's fiction works, I expected to enjoy this book, and I did - immensely. I like psychology and read a lot of non-fiction works. This book deals with a serious subject in an entertaining way, the stories read like fiction and are certainly &quot;stranger than fiction.&quot; In the Prologue, Yalom provides a brief introduction to Existential Psychotherapy, a core part of his technique. This is not a self-help or how-to book, but one can learn from the examples while enjoying the easy narrative writing style. Anyone with an appreciation for psychotherapy should love this book. Even those who think shrinks should be shrunk would probably find it entertaining and interesting if not enlightening."},{"Title":"Like Father, Like Son: Rediscovering Sonship on the Fathering Journey","review":"I have known Jamie Bohnett for over 20 years.

Just like a woman brings this type of baggage (or positivity) into a relationship, so does a father bring the positives or negatives of his relationship with his father into the marriage. It also colors how we see the heavenly Father. When we realize that, we'll be halfway there. The other half you'll gain through reading this book is that there are several areas where our families need us to strive as hard as we do at work when we are in the home arena. Discipline, love and attention, spiritual equipping, play and several other topics are addressed in quick chapters that can be digested in one sitting.

Yes, those two strapping chaps who traversed across our country with that teenage Indian girl before anyone else did. Indeed, before reading Stephen Ambrose's near 600-page book \\"Undaunted Courage\\" I doubted how much truly \\"interesting\\" detail could exist in their journey. After seeing a few History Channel specials, I was convinced I knew the gist of their journey more than most, and felt that was probably sufficient. What else was there to really consider? As it is with most detailed historical nonfiction I read, I was surprised instantly. Not only did this book provide an intense examination of exploration in early 19th century America, but it is, in general, the most intriguing, intense, suspenseful, joyous, depressing, and inspiring book I've read in a long time. How Ambrose is able to exude such a variety of emotions in his writing I hope to one day discover. How Lewis was able lead people and conquer unknowns so successfully while fading so tragically I doubt I will ever be able to comprehend.The book's title comes from a characteristic given to Meriwether Lewis both during childhood by a schoolmate, and, after his death, by Thomas Jefferson. It may seem strange that two friends of Lewis so separated from each other at such separate times in Lewis' life would choose the words \\"undaunted courage\\" to describe him, but if one is to simply observe the broadest aspects of Lewis' personality, such a description would only be expected. Indeed, the book is more of a biography of Lewis' life and his \\"undaunted courage\\" than a historical account of the journey itself. Certainly Ambrose dives into great detail of the journey, but it is always done through Lewis' eyes. The book begins with Lewis' childhood and ends with his death, giving the legendary expedition only about 3/5 of the book's content. This is not a downside by any means.Ambrose's detailed description of Lewis' childhood, family, education, connection to Jefferson, and military history is not only valuable in understanding Lewis' complex personality, but is beneficial in understanding how Lewis was able to manage the expedition so well. From the very beginning there is a sense, as Ambrose hints at, that Lewis' upbringing prepared him for the unknown journey ahead better than anyone could've planned. The implicit vocational thoughts that come to mind are intriguing to say the least. Ambrose's pre-expedition account doesn't stop with Lewis biographical detail and, alongside his outline of Lewis' evolution from boy to man, he examines the economic and political aspects building up to the expedition from America's infancy to its firmer nationalism. This sort of context is not only helpful, but is essential for understanding the fair-weather friendship between the American people and the expedition before, during, and after the expedition. Details given, like Lewis' firm Democratic-Republican politics, may not appear a necessary issue in understanding the men as they pursue the landscape on the expedition, but in the pre- and post-expedition situations there is high relevance to Lewis' political relations with Jefferson as well as the influential Federalist voices at the time.After outlining the events leading up to the expedition, Ambrose dives into the detailed planning Lewis put into the journey, his uniting with Clark on the Missouri River, and their party's expedition to and from the Pacific. Ambrose's narrative abilities had, up to this point, done well enough with the biographical and political context, but now, along with the heavy use of Lewis' highly narrative journals, they completely satisfied my reading wants. With the amount of Lewis' journals used in the narrative of the journey, one could even see the book as being written by both Ambrose and Lewis. Given that Lewis may be an even better narrative writer than Ambrose, the book is enhanced to the highest level of narrative historical nonfiction one could ask for. Accounts are always detail-abundant, and mostly firsthand in their variety of descriptions: relations with Indians both peaceful and bloody; songs sung and issues chatted around the bonfire; unique imagery of the plains, Rockies, and Pacific costal forests; hunting expeditions chasing and being chased by grizzlies; feasting on elk and buffalo; starving and scraping by on horse meat and roots; arguments turned to whipping and tribunals. Nearly every aspect one could want in an adventure is given with enough narrative vigor to turn its historical detail to an inspirational asset. Ambrose covers all sides of every account he is able to attain and after it all I felt as though I knew not only Lewis, but Clark and the rest of the party's members. I knew who was a good hunter and who wasn't. Who complained and who was helpful. Who Lewis liked and who he didn't care for. These are the types of details that make you feel a part of something (and to feel a part of the Core of Discovery is no boring trip).After experiencing both the emotional peaks of success and the devastating disasters, I felt as though I didn't want the trip to simply return and have the book end. Perhaps Ambrose understands his ability to foster intrigue, because most of the detail he delves into post-expedition would probably feel unnecessary and boring without the companionship and connection to Lewis that is developed in the book. While the last leg of Lewis' life as a politician and national hero is probably the most emotional and depressing of the book, this section would not seem so intense and personal without understanding Lewis' somewhat supernatural vitality and leadership skills exhibited up until his return. Therefore, Ambrose wraps the book up in a successful manner I would think impossible, given the complexity of Lewis as a person. I felt as though every aspect one could inquire of Lewis was covered with such comprehensiveness and wrapped up with such clarity that even the most emotionally disappointing instances were covered in full by the artistic and historical impression Ambrose impressed. The reality of it all felt more inspiring than anything.The book is quite long and took me a considerable amount of time to \\"plow through\\", but it never felt tiresome given Ambrose's ability to convey a wealth of information in a way that is concise with its detail and both paced and climactic. I recommend this book for any American whether or not you are interested in history. It reads better than any modern fictional novel would, but it is valuable in the way it describes the type of courage and determination that this country was built on and the fact that that brand of courage was not just some author's fabrication. It is by the daring and courageous efforts of men like Lewis and Clark that we are allowed to enjoy a country not only free from countries like Britain, Spain, and France, but one that ranges from coast to coast and from sea to shining sea."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I admit to not warming up to this book for the first few chapters but when I devoted some time to really reading Undaunted Courage I found it to be excellent.One amazon reviewer said, 'it's so good you'd hardly know you were reading history'. Great point.

I learned so much from it...BUT I almost feel like I was inundated with too much information. I don't deny that the details make the story interesting, but pages devoted to how many pounds of dried soup Lewis bought didn't really interest me. I did enjoy that it gave more attention to Sacagawea than you'd get in a typical US History class."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Meriwether Lewis was a smart, brooding figure-a soldier-politician, a leader of men, healthy, clever and ambitious. Beyond that, Ambrose paints Lewis as the mysterious prot&eacute;g&eacute; of the genius president, Thomas Jefferson. William Clark is drawn as a \\"Daniel Boone\\" and as \\"the best friend a man ever had.\\" The characters are important, but the power of \\"Undaunted Courage\\" is in the book's first-hand accounts (sometimes from the pen of Lewis, sometimes from that of Clark) of the great adventure, the incredible expedition of thirty-odd American soldiers determined to follow their leaders and determined to find the Northwest Passage. What a pity it wasn't there.But I loved the trip. I loved reading \\"Undaunted Courage\\"-the history, the adventure, the thrill, the disappointment. Review the reviews before this one and those that follow. Better than that, read the book and you will agree, but-Roughly forty years ago, I learned my history in high school and college. Since then, I picked up social studies from the networks and in the streets, but until I found the time to read \\"Undaunted Courage\\" I had forgotten what a vulgar bunch our ancestors must have been.According to Ambrose, \\"Jefferson wrote \`Our children see (the intemperance of their parents toward slaves) and learn to imitate it' . . . . Jefferson hoped and expected that the Virginians from the generation of Lewis and Clark would abolish slavery-even while recognizing that anyone brought up as a master of slaves would have to be a prodigy to be undepraved by the experience.\\" What the genius president considered but failed to appreciate was that the depravation might be a vertically transmitted, communicable process. Not genetic, not infectious, but transmissible simply by exposure to the depraved.As he spoke to Native Americans along the Missouri (this from the pen of William Clark): \\"Children, Lexis went on, the president (is) now \\"your only father; he is the only friend to whom you can now look for protection, or from whom you can ask favours, or receive good counciles, and he will take care to serve you, &amp; not deceive you.\\"In the Deep South in the forties and fifties, sensing my confusion with racial injustice, my dad told me something that now sounds like what Jefferson seemed to be thinking. \\"Maybe . . . in the next generation.\\"Two hundred years ago, agriculture depended on slavery. Fifty years ago, agriculture had been mechanized and slaves had been free for a hundred years. The depravation remained. Since my dad said \\"maybe\\", much of the old corruption has been displaced by different kinds of madness-assassinations, wars that everyone lost, mass murder in Oklahoma City and something horrible called the generation gap. Hmm.In every case, some group (parent, militia or the State of Virginia) had chosen to oppress. Has this nation experienced a \\"new birth of freedom?\\" I think so, but not through defeat of the oppressor. If freedom has dawned, it is because the oppressed have simply stopped empowering the depraved."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Reading this book took me into another world where many of the places I have already been were discovered for the first time. In the eyes of an explorer, what could they have felt? Ambrose's writing was wonderful in presenting characters that lived, breathed and travelled at great personal risk over a frontier that wasn't nearly as deserted as they believed. His ability to describe a world were news travelled as fast as a man on the fastest horse gave heart to what life was like in the time of the expedition. I am not a big reader of non-fiction but recommend this book highly to anyone that wonders what &quot;pioneer spirit&quot; is."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I have two favorite historians: David McCullough and Stephen Ambrose. When trying to describe their differences to my husband, I told him that David McCullough is a tweed jacket with patches, a snifter of brandy and a roaring fireplace. Ambrose is a shot of whisky, jeans and flannel and an audience around a campfire. I appreciate Ambrose's style, for the most part, and knowing that he actually retraced most of the voyage in doing his research leaves me in awe of him. But the nature of this narrative is rather up-and-down, particularly working up to the party setting off from St. Louis. I recognize that the pre-journey preparations were important to telling the tale, but I got the idea that he was rather bored with it, and as a result the details weren't too compelling. I had to keep setting the book aside and coming back to it. But once he got to the story of the exploration itself, the momentum picks up, and so does his writing style. I appreciated his use of the actually writings of the Captains, but there were a few places where their entries were used too frequently in place of him conveying their story in a possibly more riveting style. But over all it was a well-written book, and I would recommend it to anyone that I already knew was interested in the Lewis and Clark expedition."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

Born of Thomas Jefferson's insatiable curiousity about the world and prophetic vision of the U.S. as a vast and powerful country, Lewis and Clark set out to head upriver on the Missouri and find the Northwest Passage, a dream of explorers for generations. Ambrose details the outfitting of the expedition, the assembling of the team, and key to his success, the recruiting of Clark, a man he did not know all that well. We follow the group up the river and into an area few Americans knew. The many maps are essential here--one can only appreciate the rigors of this trip when you realize how far north the river flows, almost as far as today's border with Canada. Traveling season was short and winter camps located in harsh, cold country. The accounts of Lewis' encounters with the Indians are especially interesting and amusing, great examples of how Americans patronized and underestimated the intelligence of these &quot;savages.&quot;This expedition would have been successful enough if the only object was to reach the west coast. But Jefferson charged Lewis and Clark with forming alliances with the Indians, cataloguing the flora and fauna, and mapping the entire vast region. Although of course the Northwest Passage didn't exist, the scope of what the team did was enormous, and we know so much about it today because of the voluminous journals that were kept.The end of the story is quite sad, however. Publishing the journals proved difficult, and Lewis' life deteriorated after a burst of fame on his return, for reasons not entirely clear. But he accomplished something under conditions that would be unthinkable today, and Ambrose ably conveys the challenges and hardship of this great adventure."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"This book as is most of Ambrose's works is the best recounting of one of the most incredible journeys in history."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I read this shortly before moving to Montana and living on the Clark river and Lewis and Clark trail.

After talking with a ranger there about available material, it seemed appropriate to buy something that approached the Lewis & Clark story from Meriwether's perspective. I haven't finished the book yet, but from what I've read, it seems Lewis did the most in preparing for the trip. He deserves a lot of credit. So far, I've enjoyed reading this book. There's a monument at the Meriwether Lewis historic site dedicated in 1848 and, at the time, there was some dispute about whether Lewis had committed suicide or was murdered. Back in 1809, he (Lewis) was headed for Washington DC to clear his name. Apparently there were some financial irregularities signed off on by Jefferson, but disapproved by Madison when he took office. Lewis was potentially on the hook to pay the discrepancy. Although he wasn't robbed in '09, it doesn't necessarily mean his demise was the result of suicide. CSI technology wasn't \\"all that\\" back in those days. Perhaps his pending arrival in DC and the information he possessed made him dangerous to somebody. It's far fetched, I know, but possible. Think of similar modern day tales like Absolute Power or Now Way Out etc..."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"This book was very good and I enjoyed it. I looked forward to what came next on Lewis and Clark's epic trip across the continent. The book followes Lewis's life from his time as Jefferson's secretary to his suicide in Tennessee.

Very interesting."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Fascinating retelling of a nation-changing, if not world-changing, drama.

Ambrose.

This work is very good. But it is certainly not great. I find it hard to believe that Ambrose does not point out more often that Lewis was a blatant male chauvinist and when he does, he brushes it off as if it is an acceptible fact. That Lewis made no mention of the fact that Sacagawea's friend was in tribe that they met and her brother was the leader speaks volumes about how clueless Lewis was to the reality that surrounded them at times. But Lewis's penchant for being a bilnd idiot clouds his commentary and forever mars the history as viewed by the 20th and 21st century reader.Ambrose is obviously taken in by the Lewis and Clark travells, which I freely admit are amazing stories. Ambrose, however, takes it to a new level and fashions a super-hero out of Lewis, who, quite frankly, acts a bit of a boob at times.Look at the facts of the matter concerning Lewis. He was simply put a national hero. Yet he was unable to procure a wife after his adventure? His excessive drinking and brazen attitude were sure turnoffs to any woman he would have courted. Ambrose ignores this, mentioning only the alcohlism in passing and essentially shrugging it off.Lewis was a bold and great adventurer. He was also a poor ambassador of the white man to the red man. Likewise, his chauvinistic views towards women make it very hard for me to look at Lewis and see this hero that Ambrose portrays."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"This is the most entertaining narrative I have read, Ambrose does an excellent job of sticking to the facts, seldom does he speculate, and when he does he let's us know. The maps are excellent. The book just flows along like the Missouri River taking all the bumps along the way, I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"This is another superbly written book by Ambrose. I found myself absorbed into the whole adventure of Lewis and Clark from start to finish. I enjoyed learning relative historical aspects around the trip, such as how the politics of the day effected the trip."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"It was a little slow for the first 100 pages, but then delivered a riveting experience. This book changed my impression of the age -- including Jeffersonian politics, life on the frontier, the conquest of the continent, technology, and the American Indians -- more than any other book I've read in recent memory. Especially a good read for these times, when so much revisionism is operating in the media. It was fascinating to read Lewis' matter-of-fact observations about the tribes he encountered on his route."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"This a great book, easy to read as a novel, yet it's part of our history. I have suggested this book to family and friends, young and old, who all have enjoyed it. Don't be leery, if you are not a history buff."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"The story of Lewis and Clark is an underappreciated one in US public schools. This seminal voyage was on par with the modern-day ventures into space, and the voyagers for the most part were far less imperialistic than, say, the conquistadors further south and much earlier in time.As usual, Ambrose writes with an infectious passion. He obviously admired Meriwether Lewis, though not unconditionally so. He infuses the story with an excitement that turns it into a real page-turner, although this certainly had no negative effect on his scholarship. The portrait of Thomas Jefferson, the real mover and shaker behind the voyage, is interesting as well, especially since so many young Americans are taught so little about perhaps the most influential man in the history of the United States.If you are laboring under the illusion that US history is boring and lacking any epic stories, Ambrose will change your mind."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"When I picked up this book, I had some interest in the Corps of Discovery. By the time I finished the book, I was hooked on the entire expedition. Stephen E. Ambrose wrote the book as if it's an adventure story in many ways. I strongly recommend this book to those who have an interest in the expedition or if you want an excellent real life adventure story."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Ambrose provides a great survey of the Lewis and Clark expedition, describing the travels in enough, but not tedious, detail while injecting a bit of politics so the reader remains aware of the big picture. After the necessary (and not so interesting) primer on Lewis' early life, the story opens up and becomes much better. The author has a habit of siding with heroes in his other books, but here he provides a balanced view of all the characters in this fascinating story. Definitely worth picking up, even if you didn't think you were into this subject."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Unapologetically, Ambrose reveals his personal enthusiasm for his subject in this delightful telling of the Lewis and Clark story. I thoroughly enjoyed learning about Jeferson's role in the undertaking and the little told story of Lewis' end. Ambrose makes this history live! If you plan on reading his new book on the transcontinental railroad (I just started it), I highly recommend you read Undaunted Courage first as it sets the scene for the coming development of the West."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"This book deserves a highly reguarded place in the eyes of history goers. It is important that people do not overlook this journey, because if it is not looked at, one cannot understand American expansionism at its fullest. This book paints a clear picture of the American west before it was modernized. It shows a whole way of life, which is nonexistent anymore. It shows how the Indians lived before the west was tamed. It clearly paints a picture of an Indian buffalo hunt that has not been seen in over 100 years. It depicts a time when America was not a superpower and just a blossoming country that was still dealing with financial issues and tax rebellions. This book also shows a time of slavery, and where the horse is the fastest means of transportation. It successfully recreates a young and growing United States of America."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"About a third of the way into this book, I began to feel disappointed. Not disappointed in the book, but rather disappointed by the fact that I knew how the Lewis and Clark expedition turned out. Had I not known, I thought, this book could be a tantalizing will-they-make-it adventure story.But surprise: This is a great adventure story anyway. Lewis and Clark's expedition had to overcome so many obstacles that the reader, even knowing the ultimate outcome, can't help but be engaged.I was struck by how often Lewis and Clark almost DIDN'T make it. Their boats nearly overturned, they were attacked by grizzly bears and Indians, they ventured onward despite near starvation, harsh weather, sickness, accidents and various wrong turns. Stephen Ambrose seems to include just right pieces of information to keep the drama going.A tip to readers: Try not to peak ahead in the story by looking at the maps too early. You'll find more suspense in the tale if you're not totally sure where they're going.The integrity of the book is enhanced by the thoroughness of Ambrose's research. He doesn't make up quotes or try to add artificial color -- he gives us only what can be supported in the historical record. Ambrose does adds important commentary at critical times, assessing Lewis's personality and providing historical perspective on the accomplishments of the expedition.One nitpick: I wish Ambrose had done more to describe the physical characteristics of the areas where Lewis and Clark traveled. E.g.: Was it a pine forest? Open prairie? Thick brush? Too often I had to build that image on my own.It's important to note that this is not just a story of the Lewis and Clark expedition, though that is the bulk of the book. This is a biography of Meriwether Lewis. The expedition section is the best part of the book, and it might be tempting to skip over the other parts. But the beginning offers nice background details about Lewis, describes his close relationship with Thomas Jefferson, and gives the reader a foundation for understanding the purpose and importance of the expedition. The ending describes Lewis faltering post-expedition life. This, unfortunately, can't help but be sad."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Like other Ambrose books that I have read, Undaunted Courage is well written and researched. It tells the tell of Lewis and Clarks' great adventure across the USA. I have not read much of anything about this epic adventure before finishing this book, so I expected to learn a lot from one of America's best historians- I was not disappointed.You get some great insight into what America was like in the early 1800s. America was full of great promise (the pioneer spirit, the land of opportunity, etc), but we also faced some serious problems (treatment of blacks, indians, woman, etc). One of the great ironies of the book is that some of the people who help Lewis and Clark to fulfill their mission, are treated the worst by the pair. Makes you wonder how such highly educated men (to include President Jefferson) could be so wrong about certain things, yet inspire others to accomplish great deeds.Ambrose is a great storyteller, one of the best. His passion runs deep for this subject, so he gets long winded (as many other reviewers have noted) at times in the narrative. I think that is my main complaint about the book. Ambrose takes forever to get the explorers across the country, but returns them in a whirlwind. The book would have been better served if Ambrose took a more balanced approach to the expeditions timeline, giving equal weight to both parts of the trip.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning more about the cross-country adventure of Lewis and Clark. If you are ignorant about the subject, like I was (I thought it was just the pair with their female indian guide for most the trip), you will gain greater insight into one of America's truly historic events. Lastly, this book will make you appreciate many of the advancements we have made since then (i.e- transportation and communication systems), although it may also make you want to spend more time enjoying the wonderful outdoor parks of America."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"The Louisiana Purchase and Lewis & Clark Expedition were momentous chapters in our country's history. Accordingly, sometime ago I attempted to read about the adventure from Lewis' and Clark's journals. I gave up. The journals are a tough slog. As he does so well, Ambrose has made the account of the Lewis & Clark Expedition accessible to the \\"common person.\\" No novelist could write a better story. This is the kind of book that keeps you turning pages--eager to see how the story ends, but a little sad when the words finally run out.Many reviewers comment about the marvelous, exciting adventures of the \\"Corp of Discovery\\" that were completed with \\"Undaunted Courage.\\" However, Ambrose's narrative is bigger than the expedition itself as it delves into other enlightening topics. For example, Ambrose provides a good accounting of the acquisition of the Louisiana Territory and interesting insights into Jefferson's role in making it happen. Among the founding fathers, Jefferson took a leading role in advocating a limited role for government. However, he was willing to do just about whatever he deemed necessary in order to obtain the Louisiana Territory and fulfill his vision of a nation that would cover this land from sea to shining sea. Ambrose shows just how far Jefferson was willing to go to snatch the Louisiana Territory for the U.S.Native Americans played a critical role in assisting the Corps of Discovery. In fact, without the assistance of the various tribes they encountered along the way, Lewis & Clark seem unlikely to have successfully completed their trek to the Pacific Ocean and back. Ambrose's narrative illuminates our understanding of how Native Americans were viewed by Jefferson, Lewis & Clark. It was generally a condescending and patronizing perspective.Lewis is clearly the focal point of Ambrose's book. It is obvious that Ambrose holds Lewis in high regards...and rightly so. Periodically, however, Ambrose steps back for a more analytical and critical assessment about Lewis' and, to a lesser extent, Clark's, leadership. These guys did a lot of things right; and there is a lot to learn about leadership from Lewis & Clark.Despite the hardship and the risks, Ambrose narrates a story that makes me wish I were there for the adventure."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"....This was an awesome book. Ambrose is a historian by training who writes for popular consumption. Meaning you get an excellently researched book, that has footnotes, without the pedantic plodding that history is often stereotyped with, largely stemming from the boring survey books so many are forced to read as part of a required college class. More importantly though is that Ambrose is an amazing writer, he can really tell a tale. He understands the key necessity of primary sources and that history is the anecdotes of someone else's experience. His story, the history, comes to life with the appropriate background and first hand accounts that bring to life the times of which he writes. This is the amazing story of the Lewis and Clark expedition. It is a story that Ambrose is passionate about, having spent countless hours walking the trail himself with his family in addition to pouring over the journals themselves. The resulting work is a fascinating view of the world of Lewis and Clark and the incredible journey they took. Like any good historian Ambrose creates the world view from which the characters and the story takes place. This provides the contextual understanding of Jefferson and Lewis's motivation and generates what I consider to be one of history's true joys, the \\"a-ha\\" insight into a historical event that gives real meaning to your knowledge. The fulfillment of the \\"get thee understanding\\". This is the meat of knowing that hangs on the bones of fact.For example I found it insightful regarding the modus operandi and attitude of the Virginia Tobacco plantations, versus say that of the German farmers further south. The descriptions of the various native American's and their cultures that the expedition encountered was amazing. I thought it striking that grizzly bears were so common in the Rockies. And lastly I was shocked that Meriwether Lewis committed suicide while traveling from St. Louis to D.C.Read this book!"},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Usually this kind of book is extremely boring to those readers who never got their master's or doctoral degrees in history. I am one of those readers. I think the last time I read about Lewis and Clark was in college and I didn't get fired up over them or Thomas Jefferson. Well, if you want to transform a deadly dull history class into an absolutely compulsive recounting of the Expedition, using original source material to boot, this book is the one to take to, or instead of, class. I felt as if I were on the Expedition except that I didn't have to undergo any of the rigors. (Thank God, the conditions were horrendous. I would have never made it back.) I also realized how we could use a President like Thomas Jefferson today, a man who with one hand opens the West with Lewis and Clark while with the other is busy putting together the Louisianna Purchase. Ambrose details Jefferson a great deal in the front of the book. Knowing Jefferson's planning and scheming, not to mention his brilliance, to attain his goals really opened up American history for me. To see the &quot;quality&quot; of candidates we have today for President with their total lack of vision, by comparison, would have made Jefferson weep."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"This a great book, easy to read as a novel, yet it's part of our history.

But rather than the story of two guys with backpacks on an extended &quot;sight-seeing&quot; trip (which I had always believed of the &quot;LewisandClark&quot; story), we have the tale of a well planned military excursion deep into unexplored territory, much of it never seen even by Native Americans. Of course their official objective was to see if there was an all-water route to the Pacific ocean- which they never found. But along the way, they had some of the most amazing adventures to be found in any history book: encounters with Grizzlies, accidental shootings, men falling off cliffs... Perhaps most interesting is their interaction with the various Indian tribes, and the tales of the amazing assistance they gave the men in passing through the mountains.

Ambrose really does put a lot of effort in this book and it shows, he has been to the places he talks about, his descriptions are accurate, and best of all, he does not &quot;beautify&quot; history. He tells it like it was. Mr. Ambrose also goes deep into the reasons the expedition took place, Jefferson's reasons, his correspondence with Lewis, and the politics of the time."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"For me, Undaunted Courage seemed to start off incredibly slow, but it turned into a \`just one more page' type of reading once the expedition began. Ambrose, a professional historian and graduate of the University of Wisconsin in Madison (Chapman and Jorgenson, 8), has been forever interested in the Lewis and Clark travels since reading the Biddle edition of the journals of Lewis and Clark in 1975. Ambrose, a doctor of American History and former professor of history at the University of New Orleans (Chapman and Jorgenson, 8), is best known for his critically acclaimed, best-selling masterpiece D-Day. He didn't fall short of another masterpiece with Undaunted Courage. Ambrose is most appreciated for his \\"uncommon ability to bring history and historical actors to vivid life\\" (Chapman and Jorgenson, 10). He is particularly good at making Meriwether Lewis come alive in Undaunted Courage. He introduces the reader to a new side of Lewis - a side that is at times fascinating, yet frustrating to understand. Ambrose's account forces the reader to delve into the material and examine everything they previously thought about Meriwether Lewis and his heroic travels west. As I reexamined my ideas of Lewis, I was shocked to discover that there was so much I never learned. This work has opened me up to a completely different side of Meriwether Lewis. The hero portrayed in high school history texts differs greatly from the hero described by Ambrose. Although he is no less a hero, Ambrose's Lewis has problems that never make it into most history textbooks. He battles alcoholism and depression so serious \\"that it caused him unbearable pain\\" (471). These are characteristics I never would have associated with Lewis. I find it disturbing that Lewis' faults are never mentioned in classroom settings. However, that was part of the reason this book had such an impact on me . . . I learned so much from it. This book showed me that even heroes are human and that even the people who are respected and adorned are not always happy with themselves. Undaunted Courage could have easily been a book of fact after boring fact, but it was not. Ambrose's objectivity, devotion, and never-ending infatuation with the Lewis and Clark expedition helps keep the book interesting. It is filled with interesting facts about characters and the expedition itself, but what enjoyed most about the novel involved Ambrose's own experiences on that famous trail. Combined with quotes and authentic journal excerpts from both Lewis and Clark, the book is a masterpiece. Nothing is left unanswered. Everyone should read this book."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"If you're into U.S. History and like actionusing original language, this book is for you.Taken from original journal entries of Lewis & Clarkyou feel like you're going along on the journey."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I have just started reading this book and am about halfway thru. It is very easy reading and Mr. Ambrose does an excellent job of mixing in factual wording from the Lewis and Clark Journals. Quite pleased. I have read several L&C; books and some of the Journals. This ranks right at the top.I have never read written works by Stephen Ambrose before but am familiar with his expertice given on PBS TV programs.

I literally couldn't put it down. If you love history, this is a fantastic interpretation of what must have happened from the notes that were taken on the trip. Yes, editorial liberties were taken, but what a wonderful way to tell history."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"What I liked best about this book is that it reads like a neighbor telling you all about his favorite nephew. Ambrose's descriptions and judgments and asides have almost an avuncular feel. If this is not your thing, the book will probably bug you.What I liked least about this book is Ambrose's unquestioning high regard for Jefferson, but since Ambrose's attitude reflects that of Lewis's, I can go with it.The outtakes of the journals, the excellent maps, and the good-natured commentary combine to make me LIKE the characters. I feel familiar with them after reading this book. I am impressed by their accomplishments, and feel I know them as people much better.It is also clear that Ambrose knows the areas where Lewis and Clark explored. Many of his notations tell how the area described look to present-day canoers or hikers, and he gives highway exits and directions to some of the less-remote campsites and overlooks. Ambrose's love for the beauties of western America comes through, and they add to the fond tone of the book."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I will keep it simple. Next to the Holy Bible ~ best book I ever read. I have since then read several of Stephen Ambrose's books and highly recommend them. He and his family put many years of research in before writing any book. I have travelled across the country all the way to Cape Disapportment as a result of reading the book and following the trail. Everything Mr. Ambrose claimed in the book is accurate, very interesting, and provides us a heritage for our country that everyone should be proud of."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"The history of the Voyage of Discovery is one of the outstanding feats in American history. No one has told it better than Stephen Ambrose.

It is a great way to learn more about the founding fathers of this country and have some real-life adventure as well as tragic thrown in throughout. Those things that we now take for granted once required risk of life to achieve. Great Read!"},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Upon completing this book I found myself asking the question, \\"What about Clark?\\" The book begins with a detailed account of Lewis prior to the exploration. It pays great attention to the developement of Lewis' ability to lead such an expedition and accurately describe the indians, plants and geology he encounters. Before Lewis asks Clark to join the expedition, Clark's name is merely a blurp in the story. Once they team up, the author is careful to inform the reader how important Clark's role was to the party. He even goes into some detail about Lewis' attempt to make it known about Clark's importance. However, during the retun trip, Lewis and Clark split into two groups to explore different passages over the divide. While Lewis' route was discussed, Clark's adventures during this time were not. Finally, upon the completion of the expedition, Clark is merely mentioned as a person occasionally in Lewis' life. We go through the events that will eventually lead into Lewis' suicide; however, we do not learn of Clark's future.I understand that the title indicates a story more dedicated to Meriwether Lewis. Unfortunately, after all the effort it took the author to get us this far, I believe that even a small chapter at the beginning describing Clark's developing into being Lewis' equal, one in the middle describing what Clark saw along the other route and one describing the life and accomplishments of Clark after the return would have completed this story.Beyond all that, I believe that the author did a great job at telling this story. I found it extremely educational to a person who knew little about the expedition before reading this book. I would highly recommend it if your desire is to learn about the purpose of the expedition and the politics of the time."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I cannot in any way imagine that this story will ever be told better than version. Besides Ambrose's usual two pillars of strength (knowledge and storytelling), I think this might be his best work because it also encompases his pure excitement and love of the America dream and the western myth. He so powerfully pulls together the adventures of the Corps with the building of a nation over the next 100 years."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Anyone who wishes to read a comprehensive, yet entertaining account of the Lewis and Clark Expedition owes it to themselves to read Undaunted Courage. Starting with the historical background, and early life of M. Lewis, the story of the expedition's journey across a continent is told in such a readable style that one is almost sorry when it's over, and they've returned to St. Louis. Ambrose makes extensive use of their journals, and adds his own views on why certain decisions were made, both wisely and not, over others. While pointing to the obviously gifted leadership of \\"the captains\\", he is not oblivious to their faults. Likewise in his descriptions of the various Indian tribes: both noble and unadmirable practices are related. The overall result of the author's approach is to tell a tale of courage and discovery, without any undo sentamentalism. There are, to be sure, many moving descriptions of events, e.g., the suicide of Lewis, who probable suffered from bi-polar (manic-depressive) illness, years after the expedition itself. And his descriptions of the various settings, with which he is eminently familiar, make it easy to understand why buffs today retrace long segments of the Corps of Discovery's routes. All in all, a great work of history. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"You don't have to do any reading between the lines, nor in fact, go far into this book before you realize that the 1803-1806 journey of Meriwether Lewis and William Clark into the unknown American west, holds a very special place in Stephen Ambrose's heart. He says as much; &quot;in short, we have been obsessed with Lewis and Clark for twenty years&quot;. And understandably so. It is a fascinating tale. As told here by Ambrose it is part biography of Lewis, part travelogue, and pure history writing at it's finest. Although Lewis and Clark are central, the journey is as much a story of the vision and ambitions of president Thomas Jefferson, who in fact authorized the trip. &quot;From Jefferson's point of view, the captains [Lewis and Clark] were on an expedition to explore newly acquired territory, to find the water route to the Pacific, to extend commerce, to collect specimens for science, and to establish an American claim on the Oregon country&quot;. From this description of objectives we get a clear picture of the times and the spirit of adventure; the sense of elan and the feeling of optimism that was typical of the young American nation. The unknown west was seen by the intellectual Jefferson as some sort of quest, an eager venture to be undertaken by his explorers.Ambrose describes it all in loving detail and is able to recreate this sense of enthusiasm for the west with it's promises for the future of America. Ironic then, that the instrumental character - Meriwether Lewis is shown to be a man of anything but good cheer and optimism. While a competent soldier and good leader for the expedition, the man was alcoholic and suffered bouts of deep depression. His ending was grim, convincingly argued and poignantly portrayed by Ambrose, as an act of suicide by a demented mind."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"\\"Bring me men to match my mountains, bring me men to match my plains.... \\"(American poet Sam Foss, 1894)This is the greatest story of early America I've read.I received it as a gift right after 9/11 when I had a stack of books about the Middle East I'd acquired and looked forward to reading. I wasn't in the mood for what appeared to be to be a hagiography of Lewis and Jefferson.What a surprise when I found this to be the most readable, gripping, informative and inspiring book about American history I've read in my entire life. Far from being a hagiographer Stephen Ambrose describes his characters with all their flaws. His narrative of the heroism and genius of these real people will forever remain one of the greatest adventure stories of all time. The book has copious images of maps, paintings and photographs which help bring the story to life.I could not put this book out of my mind until I'd completed it. Its fundamental theme is the effort and cooperation of two extraordinary men, Thomas Jefferson and Meriwether Lewis; to map and explore the breadth of the U.S. continent, including researching the native Indian population and the flora and fauna. This was all unknown territory. Lewis was the point man, and Jefferson oversaw the excursion from headquarters in Washington. Fortunately for us, a third exceptional man, Stephen Ambrose, has brought this awesome adventure to life for our enjoyment and enlightenment.Meriwether Lewis died by suicide at age 35. Perhaps, having lived on the edge of peril and experiencing the heady feeling of challenging the unknown for so long he simply couldn't adapt to settled society. (I was reminded of the lives and deaths of two other American adventurer/writers, Jack London and Ernest Hemingway.) Whatever the cause of this sad conclusion, the triumph of his brief life outshines the tragedy of his death.Following is an extract from Jefferson's journal of 1813, paying tribute to Lewis: \\"Of courage undaunted, possessing a firmness and perseverance of purpose...of sound understanding and a fidelity to truth so scrupulous that whatever he should report would be as certain as if seen by ourselves, with all these qualifications as if selected and implanted by nature in one body for this express purpose, I could have no hesitation in confiding the enterprise to him.\\""},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I always enjoy books that make history interesting. As a prolific reader of history, I can highly recommend &quot;Undaunted Courage&quot; by Stephen Ambrose as one of those books.Also recommended: &quot;West Point: Character Leadership Education... Thomas Jefferson&quot; by Norman Thomas Remick."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I was very disappointed in this book; its only redemption is the subject matter, which Ambrose dulls beyond recognition, anyway. (I'm in the minority on this, which baffles me.)I really don't know where to start with this, except to say that the subtitle must have been spliced on when the author realized he had added nothing to the subject. The theme is supposedly about the \\"Opening of the West,\\" but the heart of the book is really a tedious narrative of the trip up the river, if that's possible. There is little historical perspective aside from contemporary politics, and there is absolutely no critical analysis of the primary sources. (Also, the first few chapters are so bad that I think he must have had his assistants write them--they are no better than undergraduate research assignments).You may notice that the text is meticulously footnoted, but this is merely a ruse to hide the lack of anything meaningful to say. For example, Ambrose repeatedly catalogues the number of elk, deer, pronghorns, buffalo, etc. shot by the hunters--not once, not twice, but endlessly. I would much rather the space had been used to provide the reader with some wider information about the area they explored, such as more background on the natives, the wildlife, the climate, and how the area has changed in the meantime (maps, please!). But Ambrose is myopically focused on the expedition itself, and he doesn't really seem to care about the West except how it appeared to Lewis' eyes.And this is the worst problem with the book: Ambrose roots openly for the expedition's success, but he also laments nostalgically for what this success inevitably destroyed. He's a Romantic of the most naive kind, one for whom the West is populated both by Whites and by Indians, by rifles and by buffalo, by Americans and by wilderness. For him, beavers and fur trappers live in harmony, and Charley Russell is a clear-eyed photo-journalist.Ambrose wants to have been there to see it as they saw it. That's nice, but that's not a reason for you to read this book."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I woke up this morning to the news that Meriwether Lewis had committed suicide, and I could scarcely take it in.This was the man who had led the Corps of Discovery--30 other men and himself--across the hitherto uncharted North American continent west of Missouri with little more than some gunpowder, dried soup, and some rudimentary navigation equipment now lying dead on the floor after being challenged over a few receipts and a few management decisions as the governor of the Louisiana Purchase.That's what you get for making walking across a continent with little more than the clothes on your back look easy. That's what you get when the class nerd is also an excellent sniper.As a public school student decades ago, I learned that Meriwether Lewis and his buddy William Clark mapped the land that since became the Western United States. End of story.However, Stephen Ambrose's bookUndaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West (Kindle Edition)took this fleeting fact and gave it life and color in wonderfully readable prose that left me feeling I, too, had discovered the American West and named the flora and fauna of that beautiful, challenging, dynamic landscape.President Thomas Jefferson chose Meriwether Lewis for the expedition after educating him in the arts of botany and celestial navigation--after realizing he was the right military mind for such a task.What neither Lewis nor Jefferson fully understood was how difficult it is for a romantic and poetic yet no-nonsense decision-maker to navigate the intrigues and layered details of political life. Lewis was a solider and explorer; he was not a bureaucrat.I never knew.The challenges that Lewis could not surmount coupled with his tendency toward depression cost him his life. However, these facts are mere details that do nothing to dim his contribution to the natural world that is the western United States and to our confidence in our ability to dream big and pursue our dreams--barefoot, if need be."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"There have been quite a few books written about the lives of Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, but it is safe to say no one writes these historical biographies quite like Stephen E. Ambrose. The advantage with reading Ambrose is you get the entire story and then some!Ambrose does not begin with the first steps Lewis took towards the Pacific, but the many steps involved in his succession as Captain, the development of his friendship with Thomas Jefferson, and what led to Clark joining Lewis on this most historic journey. And with the detail that Ambrose uses with Lewis and Clark's travail across the American West, one cannot help but feel it is really taking years to get through this lengthy book.The advantage of the audiobook is that apart from being very mobile, one feels, as they list to these well-read words, that he or she is really waling along with Lewis and Clark, listening to them chatter amongst themselves, watching as Lewis writes his journal, playing a lead role in the fights that place between the members of the party, and what led to the specific decisions that were taken.My only complaint really would be that Ambrose goes a little too far with his depth, as the book carries on fro quite a few pages after Lewis' suicide, to the extend that the author rehashes what he has already told the reader, and reveals points of character about Lewis that the reader certainly already knows. Nevertheless, plowing through this book is much like the journey Lewis and Clark took: it is long and hard, but a historical journey that the reader will never forget.Originally published on April 29th 2002.For over five hundred more book reviews and exclusive author interviews, go to BookBanter ([...])."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Stephen Ambrose (\\"D-Day,\\" \\"Band of Brothers\\") may best be known for his World War II histories, thanks to his role as an adviser to Steven Spielberg during the filming of \\"Saving Private Ryan.\\" If true, that's a shame, for \\"Undaunted Courage\\" is flat-out one of the best works of popular American history written in the last twenty years.Ambrose and his family have famously been huge fans of Meriwether Lewis and William Clark for years. Many devoted Lewis and Clark nuts have been enchanted during evenings at various L&C; seminars where Ambrose showed up to share thoughts and ideas with the rest of the group. A born storyteller, Ambrose has been known to play favorites with his subjects (witness the lionization of Eisenhower and the denigration of Patton in his WWII histories). For most of \\"UC,\\" that same trait applies as both President Thomas Jefferson and Captain Lewis make correct decision after correct decision, often while serving as exemplars of the New American in the process. Occasionally Ambrose goes a bit over the top, such as describing in rapt, almost lusty tones the meeting of Lewis and Clark to set out on the expedition.But this does not diminish \\"UC\\" as history. Far from an ivory tower historian who never leaves the library, Ambrose has walked and canoed the paths and waterways up and down which Captain Lewis led the Corps of Discovery. Full disclosure - Ambrose pays fair tribute to William Clark and acknowledges him as uniquely indispensable, closer to Lewis than his right arm. But it must be said that Ambrose is Lewis's man first, last and always. As a result, \\"UC\\" is filled with evocative descriptions of the territory covered by the Expedition - this is an author intimately familiar both with the Lewis and Clark Journals as well as the actual terrain described in those journals.What elevates \\"UC\\" is Ambrose's willingness to confront both Jefferson's and Lewis's failures after the Expedition. Lewis was disastrously appointed to be governor of Louisiana, and his lot in life was to spoil his celebrity status in both speculation and drunkenness. All this culminates in Lewis's pathetic suicide. Ambrose does not shy away from pointing out the losses to science, to exploration, and to the country as a whole from this disastrous appointment. By facing up to Lewis's shortcomings as governor, it makes Ambrose's high praise of his conduct on the Expedition ring that much more true.Steeped in the actual journals of Lewis and Clark, \\"UC\\" offers riveting descriptions of the journey itself as well as the minor daily details - the mosquitoes, the back-breaking labor, the key offers of support and occasional resistance of the Native Americans, and even the poignant future treatment by this country of some of the more noble Native Americans Lewis and Clark encountered (I'm looking at you, Nez Perce nation!). While Ambrose does not excuse these men their contradictions (Clark gets called out a bit on his inconstant treatment of his slave, York), but he also does not condemn them with 20th-century hindsight.All in all, an excellent work of popular history - this should be required reading for all American high school students."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Ambrose brings the magic of the Lewis & Clark expedition alive with this magnificent book.A great author can struggle with a pedestrian story and a great story be tarnished by an unskilled author. However, Undaunted Courage is the re-telling of a classic story from the heart of America by a great author who also loves and lives the material. There are so many mini-stories woven into the book that it helps to stimulate entertaining discussions of this historic accomplishment.The book also brought to me a far greater appreciation of Jefferson's great impact on art and science in the young republic. While we think of thte expedition in terms of its impact on our political history, it was equally important in gaining an understanding of the biological and geographical wonders of the uncharted wilderness.It is a wonderful gift to young people to help them understand the foundation of our westward growth. Reads with the excitement of a novel and the enlightenment of good history.It is hard not to repeat the many good things said about this book other than to mention that if I were to be allowed only 5 books to take for a year of isolation this would be one.It's easy, but rewarding reading.Highly recommended and a book that's filled a lot of Christmas stockings and birthday packages in our family."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I listened to this as a Book on Tape as read by Barret Whitener.In terms of the technical quality of the book and narrative I had no complaints. Whitener has a fairly soft and tenor voice and he uses a fairly consistent style of reading with a reasonable amount of inflection and modulation. The tapes themselves were well made and used the method of completing a tape side with an appropriate message to switch sides or tapes and further the next tape repeated the last sentence from the where it left off. That allowed for good continuity and confidence that I felt was well done. It's a shame other renderings of other books on CD or tape do not use this simple courteous method.As regards the book itself, this was the first in depth work on the Lewis and Clark expedition I ever interacted with. I was passingly familiar with the general history and wanted to know more. This book delivered.Ambrose has written an eminently readable and listenable tale that should appeal to both the serious historian and yet he has made it appealing to the average reader who can enjoy the tale without feeling he is being immersed in academia.Lewis' tale is valuable for what it reveals of Thomas Jefferson as well who enters in and out of the tale as would be expected.In particular, at the end I found Ambrose's handling of Lewis death to be particularly well done. He was factual and yet not afraid to jump in with some references to competing theories that claim Lewis' death was a murder. Ambrose's refutation of those theories seem reasonable and well referenced.I can't imagine any work out there that would be better to read on this subject, short of the original Lewis and Clark Journals themselves.Well worth the time and effort to read or listen to!"},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Warning! Reading this book could make you a lifelong Lewis and Clark fan. It happened to me. Since reading this book shortly after it was published I have been inspired to more thoroughly study the history of this expedition and even to trace its paths. Today, as I am writing this, is the 200th anniversary of the expedition's crossing of the continental divide. For years I had planned to be on Lemhi Pass on this date to commemorate the event. But, as often occurs, events conspired against me, and instead I am home writing this review. A few weeks ago, however, I did get the opportunity to travel the Lolo Trail where I visited several Lewis and Clark sites (including the trail itself). It was a great trip. Anyway, my life has changed for the better because of this book. The story is presented in a way that is very readable yet with enough detail to really convey the experiences of these courageous men."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"You already know the story of Lewis and Clark. You probably learned it in grade school and retain some vague notion that it was an important event in American history. Let's see, Lewis and Clark traveled across the continent following the Louisiana purchase, met a wide range of Indian tribes, and mapped the territory for President Jefferson.Now, listen to Stephen Ambrose tell you the story and it will knock you across the room. It's as if you want to pick up a piece of yarn and by accident you grab a 10,000 volt wire. This book brings the story alive in a way that only someone who is a rare blend of disciplined historian and thrilling story teller could do.Steven Ambrose first lays the foundation: Lewis' background, Jefferson's strategy, the significance of an all-water route to the Pacific. Then he gives you the play-by-play record of the journey, weaving his own narrative with excerpts from Lewis and Clark's detailed journals. The travails they face along the way come into stark relief, as if you were right there with them, sitting in one of their canoes, hiking across the continental divide desperately searching for the Shoshones with horses, hunting for elusive game for tonight's dinner, etc.This book is impossible to put down. You'll soon be looking for every other book Stephen Ambrose has written."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Some people commented that reading through this book was tough...try reading all 120 reviews like I just did! Interesting to me how there is such a variety of opinions on the same book. Sorta' like the variety of opinions on the JFK assassination...well, here's my two cents: Undaunted Courage is without a doubt, one of my all time favorite books. I've reread it three times because it's fascinating. Imagine doing what Lewis and Clark did. I get nervous driving to Los Angeles without a map! Put yourself in their place and Ambrose does a fine job of that. Insofar as the &quot;dull, inaccurate&quot; comments from other reviewers all I can say is perhaps you're not focusing hard enough on the story. This journey was anything but dull. Well done!"},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I agree with author Norman Thomas Remick (&quot;West Point:..Thomas Jefferson&quot;) who said that Stephen Ambrose was the best, ever, at informing the public by making history interesting. &quot;Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson...&quot; is a great example of what this wonderful author and historian gave to America. He passed away this year. I hope someone comes along to fill his shoes (perhaps Mr. Remick?), because Stephen Ambrose shall, indeed, be missed."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Stephen Ambrose travels well-trodden ground in presenting yet another version of the Lewis and Clark expedition. He chooses to focus mainly on Meriweather Lewis and his relationship to Thomas Jefferson. It was officially Lewis' expedition, but the young Lewis strongly felt that it was a journey he shared equally with William Clark. Unfortunately, Mr. Ambrose treated Clark as an ancillary figure, and the reader doesn't get a full impression of Clark's accomplishments on this voyage.It struck me that Ambrose wrote this narrative more for his own personal sense of discovery than he did that of Lewis and Clark. We are told repeatedly that Ambrose has made this journey himself several times, after being drawn into the story by an old volume of Nicholas Biddle that was given to him by an aunt. Biddle was the first to transcribe the voyage of discovery in 1814, after Lewis had died and Clark was left to try to get their copius journals in print. The first full-length treatment of the voyage was presented by Reuben Gold Thwaites in 1904, upon the centennial of their debarkation date. Since then we have also been treated to narratives by Bernard De Voto and David Lavender, both of which are far superior to Ambrose's rendition. Gary Moulton has recently completed the definitive set of journals replete with maps and drawings done by Lewis and Clark and four other members of the voyage of discovery.Ambrose provides no new light to this heavily documented voyage. Instead, he seems to fawn over their every accomplishment, constantly noting all the &quot;firsts&quot; when in actual fact there were very few &quot;firsts&quot; on this &quot;voyage of discovery.&quot; The route had been covered many times before at various stages. The only real first was that of linking the Missouri to the Columbia River and providing the first full-length map of this river course. But this does not seem to daunt Ambrose who never seems to run out of praise for Lewis and even Clark at times.However, he does become more critical of Lewis in later chapters, as the stress of the voyage begins to wear on him. I found most of these criticisms to be rather weak, especially Ambrose's insistence that Lewis' melancholia had become acute. Lewis did indeed suffer depression after the voyage but there was little to indicate that he suffered from anything more than anxiety during the voyage. Needless to say, such an undertaking was a huge strain on a man who celebrated his 30th birthday in route to the Pacific and I think Lewis held up marvellously well under the circumstances, thanks in large part to the ever-patient William Clark."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Stephen Ambrose is a best-selling historian for a reason. Meticulous research combined with prose that reads more like a novel than a history are Ambrose trademarks. In &quot;Undaunted Courage&quot; Ambrose takes us back to the early days of the American Republic. Meriweather Lewis is the protagonist. His journey of exploration across the continent with William Clark is the main event, and the supporting cast includes Thomas Jefferson, Sacagawea, and other leading icons of the period. The genius of this book is Ambrose's ability to take these historical giants and brings them alive again. He brought me to tears at the end of the book with his account of the death of Meriweather Lewis.In the hands of Ambrose, the journey of Lewis and Clark becomes an excellent focal point into the early 19th century. The transportation revolution that began in the first quarter of that century, after Lewis and Clark's journey, completely transformed the economy, society, and the entire nation. It is one of the most important themes in 19th century history. One of the many jewels of this book is a brief reminder by Ambrose of the fact that as late as the early 1800s transportation technology had not changed much since ancient times. As Lewis and Clark struggle across the continent, over high mountains, and up (and down) wild rivers--propelling themselves by sheer muscle power, the reader is vividly reminded of a vastly different world that was about to be changed forever with the advent of steamboats, and then railroads. In a few short pages, Ambrose brilliantly frames this amazing journey of Lewis &amp; Clark within this context of a nation on the cusp of a revolution in transportation.The paternalistic attitude that Lewis and Clark (and Thomas Jefferson) had toward native Americans is shocking. On the surface this may seem like a nave assertion, but I felt that actually reading the words that were spoken as they met new Indians was very insightful and surprising. They were just so blatantly condescending to the Indians!This is history at its best. It is an adventure story that is unforgettable. It is a wonderful window back to an important time and an important event in American history."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I've had several inspired teachers of history in my life, but I've very seldom caught the spark of a retelling of history. This book is one of the shining exceptions of my experience. I'm the grandson of immigrants who pushed into parts of the Upper Midwest and Far West in the 1800's, and I'm also the grandson of Lakota Sioux of the upper Midwest. In reading this adventure, I feel and imagine the experience of both of my families as they met, sometimes with courage, sometimes with trepidation. The arc of the story encompasses so much of what I admire about Americans (courage, determination, even blind faith in an endeavour), and it hints at the conflict and tragedy to come to native Americans in the wake of the country's expansion and development. The method of Mr. Abrose's telling of the story is as close to perfect to me as a story can be told. The character development of Clark and especially Lewis (and his relationship to Jefferson) provides an excellent foundation of understanding of the world-view and aspirations of the Captains setting out from the political and developed East into the unchartered West. Appropriate consideration is also given to native Americans and the nations to which they belonged -- they were often the true saviors of the expedition, without whom the expedition would have certainly disappeared, swallowed into the mountains of the West. The story within of Sacagawea represents the courage and good fortune of the expedition. Her experience connects literally and figuratively the westward intrusion of the expedition into the worlds of the people already there.As soon as I finished the book, I imagined my sons and I taking a summer to follow part of the path of the expedition through Montana and the Dakotas. It's something to plan for for couple of years, as the Captains did."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"In an age of historical ignorance, a lot of people still know the names of Lewis and Clark. They even have a rough idea of what they did. But Lewis and Clark have, for most, long ago petrified into icons. Ambrose resurrects the real people behind the legend.The book is a biography of Meriwether Lewis. But, reflected in the light of Ambrose's examination, we also come to know William Clark as a real man. Of course, the book concentrates on their famous expedition, but it's over a hundred pages before that journey starts. Ambrose doesn't waste the space though. Not only does he show how Lewis' life prepared him for leading the Corps of Discovery, but we also get details of Lewis' friendship with Thomas Jefferson, Lewis' experiences in the Whiskey Rebellion and his training in scientific matters before leaving for the west. We also get a brief, but fascinating, section on how Thomas Jefferson's slaveholding was not only a moral failing, as he knew it was, but also not justifiable on an economic level since German farmers in Virginia had profitable farms with fewer acres and no slaves.Of course, the bulk of the book is taken up with Lewis and Clark's trip to the Pacific and back. And it's a gripping tale of survival, exploration, first European contact with some Indian tribes, and, briefly, of combat. Ambrose's style is emminently readable even if, as some have noted, he does repeat certain passages from time to time. His biggest contribution may be to emphasize Lewis' scientific contributions. Lewis faithfully gathered a great many samples of the plants and animals he found and made detailed descriptions in his journal.Those journals are at the heart of a mystery covered in this book. Lewis' raw notes are still extant and are extensive. But, for great chunks of time on his trip, he made no entries. Ambrose, following other scholars, offers an explanation for those gaps.Lewis' journals are also central to the mystery of his psychological dissolution. Though he made preparations to organize his notes and publish them in book form, he never completed the job though he had plenty of time. He came back a hero in 1806; he died from a gunshot wound in 1809. Ambrose blames early fame, alcoholism, and Lewis' tendancy towards depression. And he makes a convincing case, conspiracy theories notwithstanding, that it was suickide and not murder, a conclusion bolstered by Lewis' history and the opinion of his friends. The failure to publish his findings and pass his knowledge on to a wide audience hurt the historical reputation of the expedition. It was only in the 20th Century that Lewis and Clark became popular figures of American history.Ambrose's account will certainly keep Lewis and Clark from falling into obscurity again."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Having read a number of Ambrose' works, I must say this is his best. A labor of love, Ambrose spent over 20 years following the trail of Lewis and Clark with family friends and students. That passion for his subject shines through.What emerges is a fascinating portrait of Merriwether Lewis. Ambrose examines the the voyage, his relationship with Clark, with Native Americans and with Thomas Jefferson, his mentor/father figure. Few Americans, with the exception of Jefferson, have possessed as much talent as Lewis, a true Renaissance Man. Fewer still have mad such a mark on their country.Ambrose takes us back to a time &quot;where nothing moved faster than a horse- and no one thought anything ever would&quot; and examines the opening of the American West. This book is a true masterpiece, and the kind of history which can make americans proud again-- accurrate, examining, yet reflective of the best in America's hopes and aspirations in the early years of the republic. Plus- it's a great story!"},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Written by Stephen Ambrose, an experienced author, Undaunted Courage is an account of the famous Lewis and Clark expedition. This novel is written for someone who is not knowledgeable about this historic journey, and is written at a high school level (I should know, I'm in high school!). Ambrose designed this book to be a balance of fact and story told from Meriwether Lewis's view. The author presents a balance of facts, excerpts from Meriwether Lewis's journal, and his own voice telling the story.Ambrose organized the story in chronological order, beginning with Lewis's childhood. He continues with the details on Lewis's teen and adult life, and continues on through the expedition and the events after the expedition's return. Lewis's childhood and adulthood prior to the expedition is details through the first six chapters. Chapter seven begins with the preparation for the expedition, detailing how the men who went on the expedition were chosen, the gathering of supplies, and the difficulties. The joint captainship of the expedition by Lewis and Clark magnifies how well they worked together. Chapters 8 through 12 detail the first year of the expedition. It begins with the travels of Lewis from Washington to Pittsburgh, where the expedition gathered and prepared to set off. The first leg of the journey down the Ohio River to the Missouri River to the winter camp of 1803 is told with emphasis on discoveries of new wildlife. Chapters 13 through 18 relate encounters with the Mandan and Sioux Indians. The winter of 1804 was spent at Fort Mandan with the Mandan Indians, who were very friendly. The expedition then continued up the Missouri River and encountered the Sioux. Unlike the Mandan Indians, the Sioux were hostile and demanded goods to let the expedition continue up the river. From the Missouri River the expedition continued to the Marias River, and then continued to the Great Falls of Missouri. Chapters 21 through 24 describe the long, hard trip over the Bitterroot Mountains, and the search for the Shoshone Indians. The Shoshone Indians were a friendly, humble group of people, who offered all they had to the strange white men. Chapters 25 and 26 detail the last leg of the journey to the Pacific Ocean and Fort Clatsop. Chapter 27 begins the trip home. Chapters 27 through 32 tell about the exciting adventures home.Ambrose's writing cleverly blends fact, story, and excerpts from the journal of Meriwether Lewis so that it is detailed and interesting to read. The chronological account of the expedition works well for this book because it is important to read about the events in order to really understand what the expedition was, and where it traveled. The way the chapters are titled, date and event, work well because it prepares readers for what will happen in the chapter, and gives a sense of where it is headed.Ambrose includes maps of the expedition's route and pictures of things that were discovered or important people, such as Indian chiefs. The pictures supplement the story to give an idea of what type of things were being seen on a daily basis during the expedition. However, pictures could have been more meaningful to the story if their connection to the story had been better explained. Much of the author's description of places, things, and events comes from excerpts of Lewis's journal. This is effective because it gives the book voice, and gives you the view from one of the first people to see the things that the new country had to offer. \\"Lewis wrote a 500 word description of the Platte, that fabulous river that makes its way from the Rockies across modern Nebraska to the Missouri, running a mile wide and an inch deep, just bursting with animal and plant life\\" (150). Ambrose could have included more from Lewis's journal to strengthen the voice and solidity of the story. Ambrose did leave some important and interesting events out of his book. For example; he never addresses what happened to many of the people like Sacagawea, Clark's slave, York and even Clark himself after the expedition. He also undermines Sacagawea's significance in the expedition's success. Ambrose never highlights the fact that Lewis and Clark and everyone on the expedition were cut off from civilization and everything they knew. They were out on their own hoping they were prepared for unknown that lay ahead.Although this book was a lengthy account of the Lewis and Clark expedition, Ambrose proved that the expedition was important to the development of the United States because of all that was discovered about the land and its inhabitants. However, Ambrose did not address how the expedition directly affected the United States then or today.Undaunted Courage is a wonderful book for someone who wants to learn about the Lewis and Clark expedition. I think this book was written well for an audience that reads at about a high school level. The first seven chapters, 80 pages, are slow. These chapters detail Meriwether Lewis's childhood, and life up until the beginning of the expedition. William Clark is not mentioned until chapter seven, when the expedition starts to take shape, and preparations for the excursion begin. Ambrose packed information into this book, but on occasion was wordy and had a roundabout approach to the story. Some of the transitions from chapter to chapter could have been smoother, allowing the story to be more fluid and easier to read. Undaunted courage was interesting to read and was at times more like an adventure novel than a documentary. I liked that the author used so many quotes from Lewis's journal. This allowed the story to have voice, and gave me a sense of who Lewis was as a person. I enjoyed this book because the author made it fun and exciting to read by telling the story from Lewis's point of view. Ambrose composed the book to be like an adventure novel, while it filling it full of facts about the expedition."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Was never much of a history buff until I read this book. Mr Ambrose was on C-SPAM BOOKNOTES and I sat listening as he shared with Brain Lamb what his book was about, and then I went and bought a copy as soon as the interview was over. This is one of those books that holds your interest. It is the rare find that makes for a great read aloud book. We have been recommending it because it gives a rare look into a deep friendship between two great giants in Amerivan history. Meriwether Lewis of Lewis and Clark fame and Thomas Jefferson. What knocked the socks off me was how many species Lewis and Clark saw as they made their trek west. Being the first white man to ever lay eyes on both new species of plant and animal as well as massive land changes. Also of great interest, especially in this day and age when the issue of depression and suicide are in the news a lot, is the fact these men suffered from depression and that Lewis even gave serious thought to suicide as he and Clark struggled west, often short on money or even broke, sick and discouraged. This is a book that should be required reading for all high school-college students, voters and politicians. It is a humbling book written by a man I consider to be Americas greatest historian."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"This is one of the best books I had ever read by Stephen E. Ambrose. Its called Undaunted Courage. The book is about Thomas Jefferson selecting two great men to lead an expedition to the western frontier. Their names are Meriwether Lewis and William Clark. The book starts out with their childhood and how Lewis grew up living on a tobaco plantation with his mother , and Lewis eventually owned it. Then he became part of the first infantry unit in the Whiskey Reabellion. Thats when he became friends with Thomas Jefferson and Lewis eventually met Clark. Then Jefferson came into office in March of 1801 as the third President .Then right after he came into office he assigned Lewis and Clark on an expedition to map out the western frontier. They found on their journey lots of indian tribes and lots of new plants and animals. They also went up the Missouri River and hunted lots of buffalo. After they had mapped out the frontier they went back to Washigton to tell Jefferson what they had discoverd. They tolled him that the Columbia River ends at the Pacific Ocean , but he was disaponited that there was no exit to the Columbia River. This may have been the reason of Lewis suicide. They also had an indian girl named Sagagwa to gude Lewis and Clark home.This is one of the greatest books I had ever read because it made me fell like I was really there. It brought many things to light I had never known about this book. I give this book an amazing 5 stars."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"In 1804 Lewis and Clark set out for the unknown. This journey would take them across the content, there they would have to be a combination of scientists, explorers, diplomats and soldiers.Steven Ambrose did a wonderful job with this book it really helps to bring the characters to life, not just as bland historical figures that you see in most books.Overall-If you like a good book that deals with REAL historical figures get this book."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Ambrose has done an outstanding job in capturing the difficulty faced by Captains Lewis and Clark-- taking a group of soldiers into the abyss-- the Great American Desert-- and finding out all he can about this hostile land for their President while keeping hostiles at bay, their soldiers healthy and happy.Using the journals of Lewis and Clark as a starting point, he does an excellent job of keeping us interested in their challenges, their triumphs and their daily lives. It's all too easy to see these men and women of 200 years ago as stereotypical cardboard cutouts, but Mr. Ambrose has done an excellent job of keeping it fresh and interesting.One of my favorite reads of 2001 as well as one of my favorite reads &quot;of all time.&quot; A sweeping story well told."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"my first Lewis and Clark book, couldn't put it down. Just enough, not too short or too long. What a great adventure!"},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"The facts are there and the story could be so good, but Ambrose doesn't do it justice. No one comes alive in this book in spite of all the quotes and research. Additionally, Abrose's grammer is awful. Reading this book may be more exhausting and frustrating than the expedition was!"},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"This book has an unpleasant surprise ending, which I am giving as a spoiler hoping it will save someone else some money. I knew the outline of the story and knew of Lewis' tragic early death. But after that, the book just ends. Hello? What about Clark? He lived a long time after. What of the other men on the expedition? What of York, the slave? What of Sacagawea? The book leaves so many loose ends that it is maddening. A shame since the rest of the book is an excellent read. Maybe Ambrose's family will issue a revision that gives the complete history."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I've read Ambrose's other works, like D-Day, and loved it. The problem with this book is that it seems, simply, written for and by a simpleton. The prose, which perhaps was meant to be elegantly spare, instead leaves you with a kind of &quot;yeah, so?&quot; reaction. One of the few books I've actually had to give up on. I just couldn't take it."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"The voyage of Lewis &amp; Clark is no doubt fascinating. But this book is little more than a rehash of Lewis's notebooks by an adoring fan. We hear over and over how brilliant Lewis was, while the actual events demonstrate that repeatedly it was only the good will of the Indians he ran into that prevented him and his quite large expedition from being slaughtered. The book does not add much to our understanding of the time, the period or the man."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Stephen Ambrose writes mechanically at best and is in need of a good editor. Mr Ambrose has an unabashed &quot;crush&quot; on Meriwether Lewis, much to the detriment of Wm Clark and Sacagawea. After the captains-2 hit the trail, I had a hard time forcing myself to plod along with their not-so-merry band. Paddled a boat, ate some meat, traded with Indians, ad nauseam for 1800 miles. And then we retraced our steps! It took me six months for read this leaden tome."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I read this book on the recommendation of a friend, because I was interested in this aspect of American history, and knew nothing about it.If you are hungry for accounts of Lewis and Clark, go ahead and read it. The drawbacks of the book are not so serious that you'll regret having read it. (I don't know the L and C literature, so perhaps it's the best available.)If you like an intelligent writing style and solid scholarship, you'll be disappointed. Furthermore, I found Ambrose's attempts at interpretation to be pretty weak, occasionally laughable. (This may seem harsh, but others seem to unaccountably fawn over the guy.) See the review entitled &quot;A dissenting opinion&quot; for more details on the weaknesses of the book."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"A River Calling: A Christian Father and His Sons; A Canoe Adventure; A Spiritual Journey That Would Last a LifetimeHaving canoed the length of the Missouri river from Three Forks, MT to St. Louis, MO back in 1979, I became hooked on the Lewis and Clark expedition. Ambrose does a great job of putting the reader right there on the expedition. In fact, when I returned to the river in 2002 with my two sons, I ran into a few folks who said it was this book that motivated them to canoe the Missouri in MT. For Lewis and Clark fans out there that are also Christian dads, I have written a book not only about my 1979 trip but also my 3 day trip with the boys 23 years later. If you're looking for a book on Christian fatherhood and raising godly sons along with travelling the river, you might like it. See \\"A River Calling\\"."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Historian Stephen Ambrose pens a compelling tale of great adventure, featuring the exploring tandem of Lewis and Clark venturing into the great Northwest, mapping the newly purchased Louisiana territory. It is a story of great courage, privation and leadership.Sadly, juxtaposed with the story of survival and heroism is the tale of Meriwether Lewis' life after his successful expedition. The same man who had steely resolve to lead his party thousands of miles and back found himself unable to manage his own life and personal affairs in the aftermath. Addiction to alcohol, financial mismanagement, petty feuds, bureaucratic skirmishes over undocumented expenditures, indolence in not preparing his journal for much longed for publication and the inability to find a wife plunged Lewis into a spiral of despair.Add to this a pinch of bipolar disorder, which Ambrose theorizes Lewis had. He could not keep his act together and ended up taking his own life. Though some argue that Lewis was murdered, Ambrose makes short work of this notion.The contrast between the Lewis of the expedition and the Lewis in its aftermath is a cautionary tale of \\"the curse of success\\" and how great beginnings can derail and produce melancholy endings."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"A family friend gave me the audio version of this book that has been on my \\"to read\\" list for years. I'd never quite gotten around to it but boy am I glad I finally did.In Ambrose's hands the story of the Lewis & Clark expedition is lifted from the stale and stilted pages of the history textbooks and it becomes an exciting narrative - full of adventure, wonder and tons of hard work. Ambrose is a gifted writer.I am reminded of the David McCullough quote: \\"No harm's done to history by making it something someone would want to read.\\" No danger of that with Ambrose. Not only has he read everything there is to be found on the topic but has travelled the route several times.Cotter Smith did a great job of reading the text and keeping up with its lively prose (with the single exception of mis-pronouncing the capital city of South Dakota - he called it Pierre, like the French name, but they proudly pronounce it \\"peer\\".) Stephen Ambrose himself handled the intro and conclusion.I can't wait to pass on this audiobook to someone else."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"This book is primarily about Meriwether Lewis and his role in theexpedition across the continent. Stephen Ambrose is phenomenally gifted in bringing history to life.He sticks very close to the sources and only occasionally takes detours to make conjecturesabout things about which the historical record is silent. Despite this thebook is a real page-turner. While Ambrose does an excellent job in describing the ups and downsof the expedition, I do think that it is a very worthwhile reading the original journals.I have only read excerpts, however, I believe they surpass even this book. Also, the recent PBS documentaryshows many of the locations described in this book. It is well narrated definitely worth seeing."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"The Corps of Discovery comes alive in this author's capable story-telling talent. The personal introduction of how the Lewis and Clark adventure affected the author's life brings context and relevance to the story from the beginning and instills the author's passion in the reader. Taken from the logs written during the adventure, you are led to discover with them all that they discovered as if for the first time. You will never look at America west of the Mississippi quite the same way again. Your imagination will soar with the wild country it was not that long ago. More than dry scientific and anthropological studies, the Lewis and Clarke journals are an adventure travel log full of surprises and discovery. Mr. Ambrose has done an outstanding job of sharing his sense that history is an adventure. You will find it difficult to put this one down once you start."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"It's amazing things turned out the way they did. What a fasinating time and journey it was. Although how lucky we are things turned the way they did.Had it not been for Jefferson unremitting urge to explore westward, him reconizing the leadership and exploration abilities of Lewis and choosing him to exlpore personally; and Lewis choosing Clark, his perfect reciprocal to join him on the quest to the Pacific, things would of not turned out so lucky. Even with all that luck, Lewis and Clark were perhaps even more lucky they had not been killed by the Sioux or any of the other Indians they had encountered for their arrogance. This is prehaps their only foible in their almost perfect leadership.The story is almost like some classic author would make up. But it's fasinating because it is real. If you like adventures, traveling into the unknown, dealings with hostile Indians were covet your belongings, couragous leadership, and scientific discoveries, and having to remain constantly on guard. This book is perfect for you. A must read for an expoloration fan. And without a doubt, a must read for any American."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"It's not easy to bring this kind of historic tale to life, yet this one is better than most.

Stephen Ambrose is unparalleled when it comes to historical writing."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"The book basically follows the journals of Lewis &amp; Clark as they make their way west.

Of course, a researcher must also scour The Journal of Lewis and Clark edited by Bernard De Voto but a reader may safely choose to obtain the important facts and information about the Corps of Discovery from Ambrose's highly readable prose rather than from the badly misspelled and often hum-drum log notations of the Captains. Undaunted Courage is the 800 pound gorilla of Lewis and Clark literature. However, I also recommend Lewis and Clark Among the Indians by James P. Ronda, Bison Books, for additional insight into the influence of First Nations on the expedition."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I picked up this book because it was an adventure story not because it is an historical account. It scores a 10 on both adventure and history. If this book were in the classroom it would make history come alive. I am loving every page of this book and want to find more books like this on other historical events. My only question is &quot;What about Sacagawea?&quot; I didn't get the impression from the author that she was as important to the expedition as I had been taught.

Why read this particular acount? By focusing on Lewis Ambrose allows you to see the expedition in a manner that is almost personal. I say almost because this reader never quite understood Lewis, and Ambrose gives all of us ample reason to be confused about who he was and what he was capable of.The challenge of the description of the expedition is, to my mind, pace. How to capture the feel of the day to day courage, not to mention the energy required. Ambrose does an excellent job of this. There are a few passages where his sense of pace fails altogether, but they served, for this reader, to point out just how well Ambrose succeeded in the rest of this book.If you decide to read this book promise yourself you will not judge it until Lewis and Clark leave St. Louis to go north. It is slow until that point, but Ambrose was right to include it. Do not judge the book until you have seen its best parts."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Everyone (hopefully) knows the 'facts' about this episode in US history - the purchase of the Lousiana Terratory and the expedition to the Pacific Ocean lead by Lewis and Clark. What most people do not know is contained in this well written, compelling narrative.Ambrose takes the reader by the hand and together accompany the explorers across rivers, over mountains and prairies until they reach the Pacific Ocean. He also paints a convincing background of the beliefs (e.g., that the Mandan Indians might have been the Lost Tribe of Israel) and politics which fueled Jefferson's ambitions for the future of America.However, the heart of this story is the character of Meriweather Lewis. A man, born into a landed and privileged family in Virginia, Lewis is the epitomity of self reliance, a man of modest but heroic proportions.

History at its best is not a recitation of dates and figures, but an understanding of people, thought, economics and how the dates and figures relate to the living, breathing people of the day. Part and parcel of this is an understanding of the personal quirks and foibles that force historical figures down one road rather than another.Undaunted Courage contains all of these elements and more. The mistakes and triumphs of the first American foray into terra incognita are told with care and detail and allow a true understanding of this amazing journey.

Both will be more than satisfied."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Ambrose has accomplished what few have . . . history that reads like fiction.

For me, such an experience is the definition of a good history book.The subject, as anyone who reads the introduction will see, is one that is dear to Ambrose. His intimate knowledge of the subject comes through in what is a thoroughly gripping narrative.Ambrose clearly admires Meriwether Lewis, but his writing is fair and impartial as he delves into the trials and triumphs of the expedition as a whole, and Lewis personally. The story begins at the beginning, well before the voyage of discovery begins, by establishing the relationship between Lewis and Thomas Jefferson that will ultimately result in Lewis being given command of the expedition.Clark's role is not ignored, and Ambrose repeatedly points out that Lewis viewed Clark as a co-leader, although the government at the time recognized him only as Lewis's lieutenant. But, as the title suggests, the book focuses on Lewis, the great project's leader, and his sponsor Jefferson.Lewis's tragic decline and eventual suicide ends the book and serves as a sad counterpoint for his great and yes, courageous, leadership during the expedition.Altogether the book offers a fascinating read for anyone interested in the story of Lewis and Clark, or students of Thomas Jefferson looking for additional perspective into the events that shaped his presidency."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"For an interesting and informative journey through an important piece of American history, I recommend &quot;Undaunted Courage&quot; by Stephen E. Ambrose. It's a portrait of physical courage. I also recommend &quot;West Point: ... Thomas Jefferson&quot; by Norman Thomas Remick for an interesting and educational journey through history that becomes the epic of the USA. It's a portrait of mental courage."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Stephen Ambrose, while a professor, used to take students each summer to recreate the Lewis and Clark Trail, and then use their journals as a guide. Most of us were never lucky enough to have had him as a professor, but this book will easily allow him to be your teacher.The amazing, grand scope of the Lewis and Clark journey is usually confined to a short paragraph in our American History textbooks. We can try to imagine what it was like, but Ambrose shows us that our imagination barely scratches the reality of what was the most amazing journey I have ever read about. The challenges, conflicts and new experiences faced by the party of men sent by Jefferson simply must be read to be understood. I am very glad I came across this effort, and count it among the most profound U.S. History works I have read. Ambrose's book is easily as good as his World War II works, and far better than Nothing Like It in the World (his book about the transcontinental railroads' construction). This was great."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"This book was the first novel I read where history was accurately portrait in a compelling, engaging storyline. While some introductory parts where slow to read, I felt as though I was actually on the exploration when Stephen Ambrose took the reader through the harsh winters, indian negotiations, and the real experience of exploring the unknown. The book was thoroughly enjoyable and inspired me to seek out more challenges and face the unknowing with more vigor than ever before. Great book."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"This book is the that made Ambrose famous (and rich.) He had written many fascinating biographies and books of history but none were as widely received as this one. But from the opening chapters it is easy to understand why everyone loves this book.This book is an excellent read just from the standpoint of one who enjoys history in an of itself. Courage is produced by much research and verification of fact, it compiles the best of the writing from the explorers themselves, and it gives first hand information on the lay of the land from the author who spends each 4th of July somewhere on the trail itself. Also, the book reads like an adventure story written for the bigscreen. It is grippingly well-written, with compelling characters and a great story line, and it is moving emotionally when you put yourself in the shoes of the explorers.Upon reading this book I wanted to take off a few months and travel the path Meriwether Lewis across the US just as I wanted to float the Mississippi River after my first encounter with Huckleberry Finn. By this book, you will read it more than once."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"This is a MUST READ book for all adventurers! The opening chapters are a bit &quot;slow&quot;, describing Jefferson, Lewis and their relationship. These are very important chapters though. They help to better understand the expedition. As the expedition evolves, Ambrose's descriptions and comments seem to flow as swift as a river. In school we only scratched the surface of the Lewis &amp; Clark Expedition. Undaunted Courage gave me a better appreciation for what actually happened."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Ambrose presents extraordinary details about the preparation for the exploration. I've always tried to imagine how life would be like on that trip, and these details really help complete the pictures I have in my mind. Ambrose describes Lewis' intense training in the technical skills he would require. He talks about the aggravations the corps had with a drunken boatbuilder. He talks about the trade-offs that had to be made when deciding what items to bring and what to leave. The description of these preparations alone was worth the book. I also enjoyed the descriptions of daily life on the journey: food, medicine, punishment, pay, accounts of bravery, accounts of boredom, description of equipment, and so much more than I can go into. It was a thoroughly enjoyable read and I was captivated."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"If my history teacher had graded this book, she nodoubt would have reminded us that we cannotforget good writing when we leave English class.The content was fascinating, but the style wasturgid and boring. Ironically, Anbrose criticizesLewis' writing in a sentence that is 8 1/2 lineslong!I learned a lot about the times in which Lewislived, but what was surprisingly weak was thesense of wonder at themagnificent discoveries the expedition made.This was especially surprising in light ofAmbrose's personal interest in the outdoors.It was an interesting book, but why is everyoneraving"},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"This book has Meriwether Lewis as its focus, and Ambrose shows all the attributes and failings of the explorer. Lewis and Clark led an expedition up the Missouri River, through Indian country, across the Continental Divide, all the way to the Pacific. Commissioned by President Jefferson to explore the newly acquired Louisiana Territory, this book foreshadows the future movements of people into lands populated by the wildlife and the natives, and the clash of cultures that would ensue. Lewis is shown as a man of great zest and perserverance, as well as being a product of his era, arrogant to a fault and possessing the prejudices of the time.The first half of the trip is well detailed, as the expedition gets together, sets out and travels through potentially hostile Sioux country. The trip was full of triumphs and disappointments as well, and the potential of danger was always there, such as with the incident with the Blackfoot Indians on the return home. Certainly this is a must read for anyone interested in the opening of the West in the 19th century."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"The story of Lewis and Clark and The Corp of Discovery is told in this easy to read book by Stephen Ambrose. The exploration of the American West in the early 19th century could probably be compared to Americans landing on the lunar surface in the late 20th century. They were going into unexplored territory and the risks were high. Their ability to communicate and cooperate with Indian tribes along the route was key to their success. Ambrose also documents well the natural hazards they had to deal with--the mountains, the weather, the prickley pear, the wild animals. (Compared to today, the shoes/boots/moccasins they wore were primative---one can imagine the difficulties one would encounter walking across the plains in substandard shoes.) And being an Oregonian, I can imagine the misery of spending an entire winter on the Oregon coast at Fort Clatsop with rain every day, soggy clothes, awful food, and the desire to see home again. There are numerous books on Lewis and Clark, but this one is by far my favorite. With the bicentennial coming up, it should be a must read for high school history students."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Perhaps because of the avalanche of praise bestowed on this book, I was rather disappointed when I read it. A credit to Ambrose that his book is rarely dull, but his is far from a comprehensive study. Perhaps it would have been more accurately sold as a biography of Meriwether Lewis, whom Ambrose is almost embaresingly enamoured with.For a first read on Lewis & Clark this is not a bad place to start, but critical information on some very important people is lacking. We never learn about the ultimate fate of York, Clark's slave, who was critical to the survival of the expedition but was brutalized by his master on returning East. Sacagawea is also abandoned after the journey. Even Clark is given scant attention considering his role.in other areas, critical scholarship is lacking. It is also the opion that Lewis commited suicide and was not murdered but Ambrose gives short shift to those who claim otherwise. Why did a point-blank shot to the head and subsequent wounds fail to kill Lewis for several hours? Ignored is the well known evidence that Grinder family spent some of Lewis' money over the years after his death. Now, it is most likely given his mental state and previous attempt that Lewis did kill himself but Ambrose rumbles past any forensic or psychological investigation in 3 pages, instead wondering if Lewis made a mental role call of his companions or dreamt of the Dakota prarie.The mental state of Lewis is described merely as \\"meleancholy\\" several times and later theories of his substance abuse patterns or homosexuality are not addressed. In other areas, Ambrose is far too eager to give credit to Lewis & Clark for being \\"the first\\" to do everything but start a fire. Numerous trappers and explorers dating back to LaSalle had been in many of the areas or even used the same routes. On page 311 Ambrose even credits a brief debate on where to proceed as \\"The first vote ever held in the Pacific Northwest...the first time in American History a black man had voted, the first time a woman had voted\\". Needless to say York and Sacagawea were not made formal partners or granted any rights to speak of, and many Native American societies could take issue with that being the \\"first vote' or even first vote by a woman'I apologize if this if overly harsh. This is a solid, readable account but not the all-encompassing masterpiece most reviews here regard it as."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I am glad I read Undaunted Courage. The Lewis and Clark Expedition is a major part of our history. The major criticism I have is that I found the \\"mid section\\", where Ambrose recaps the travel diary Lewis recorded during the expedition, too long. I did get a feeling for what it was like to be on the journey, but perhaps 150-200 pages instead of 300+ pages would have sufficed.On the other hand, by having to slog through the book, you get a sense of the fatigue they endured, but also the excitement. I suppose a Montana National Park Ranger or Northwest US aficionado or American Indian buff would savor every detailed description.I was just as interested to learn about the events that lead to the expedition as well as what happened to Lewis and Clark and the Louisiana Territory afterward the expedition. As an early American history buff, I also enjoyed learning about Jefferson's role.It was interesting to read about American Indian life in the Northwest in the early 1800's before the white men invaded their territory and their interaction with Lewis and Clark. I enjoyed reading Lewis's description of all the new plants and animals and lands he encountered.All in all, even though it was a little longer than I would have wished, the book was worth it."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Ambrose does a splendid job of making the Lewis and Clark voyage come alive again for the 21st Century reader. This work provides a helpful glimpse into Jefferson and Lewis that is not often heard. Becoming familiar with this story makes one appreciate the bravery and adventurous spirit of those that went before us in America's history. The start is a little slow due to voluminous details, but once the voyage reaches St. Louis, the book keeps the reader on the edge of his seat. Ambrose's passion for Lewis and Jefferson makes the reader feel like he or she is a companion with Lewis and Clark on their expedition across the country and an advisor for Jefferson in the White House. Instead of analyzing history, Ambrose succeeds fairly well in helping us relive it. There are points where Ambrose is a bit overconfident in his explanations, but this doesn't tarnish his marvelously informative and entertaining work. Too bad Ambrose couldn't change the tragic outcome of Lewis' life at the end."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I won't take much of your time, just enough to say, \\"This is a great book!\\" (and maybe expand a little on that) I read it about a year ago, and I will undoubtedly read it several more times in my life. It's a story well-told!Action, adventure, history, politics, geography ... and even a good measure of sex thrown in so there's something for everyone! Although a reader of this book knows the eventual ending to the story (the Corps of Discovery made it back safely!), it is still cram-packed with details and \\"little known facts\\" that will surprise all but the hardcore historians.This book re-awakened a passion inside me to discover more about the great nation in which I live (my fellow Americans know what I'm talking about.) I have also re-discovered the pleasure of reading versus watching television as my primary source of information and entertainment.When a book inspires a long-dormant reader to turn off the TV and return to the library...well I can't think of a greater compliment to an author's work or a stronger suggestion to READ IT FOR YOURSELF!"},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Yes, this is hardcore life. I couldn't put it down. The book is thoroughly researched and beautifully written. There is a third Captain here and his name is Stephen Ambrose. Mr. Ambrose show how keenly intelligent these explorers were from President Jefferson right down the line to the youngster Shannon, who later became an attorney, and John Coulter, who is credited with discovering \\"Yellowstone\\".This summer I drove up to Great Falls, Montana and spent ten days driving along the Missouri River and stopping at the historical sites along the way to Wood River at St. Louis. It was fabulous. I took a digital photo of Captain Clark's inscription on Pompeys Pillar and plastered it on my computer as my screen saver.I was amazed how much of the history of this book is still with us. Remember that Captain Clark named a river after his girl friend Judith? Well, in Montana, I crossed Judith River while driving through Judith Basin, near Judith Mountain, in Judith Basin County, and finally stopped in a little town for supplies called Judith Gap! If that isn't romantic - what is?After I read Undaunted Courage, I read the Lewis and Clark Journals listed in the index. Aside from Atlas Shrugged, and a few others, this is the most absorbing book I've ever read. TO THE GLORY OF MAN"},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Until you have read this book, you could never truly understand the Lewis &amp; Clark expedition you have always learned about in school. I really did not know much about their journey until I read this incredible book. When I first saw how many pages were in this book I will be honest that I thought it might be a little long and boring. I was wrong, once you get in to reading it, it is a lot better than I thought it would be. Lewis was an incredible man to have on the journey with abilites that helped them along the expedition, he was definitely designed to be in tune with nature. Not only did Lewis &amp; Clark learn a lot along the way so did Thomas Jefferson from these incredible two men and their sidekick Sacagawea. And for that matter so did I just from reading this book. However, I was disappointed with the ending of the book and the life altering decision made by Lewis. This was the perfect time for me to read the book with the release of the gold dollar coins with Sacagawea on them. I wondered who she was and why she was important enought to be honored with her portrait on these new coins. After reading the book I learned why she was instrumental to the expedition. If you want to understand part of an incredible historical expedition and find out why Sacagawea was honored with her portrait on our new gold coins read this book, I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"&quot;Undaunted Courage,&quot; by the great American author Stephen E. Ambrose is a book that will always be remembered. I found the up close look at Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson and William Clark priceless. However, the backbone of this well-researched and superbly written book is the tale of brave men exploring an unknown frontier and only losing one member of the party.Moreover, Ambrose documents the &quot;essential honesty&quot; that distinguished Lewis and Clark from other explorers like Hernando DeSoto and Francisco Pizarro who were looking for gold or wanted to convert Indians to Christianity. Ambrose also does an excellent job of informing the reader the sad truth of American Indian Policy which at the time of the expedition was, &quot;get out of the way or get killed.&quot;Nevertheless, this truly special book examines Jefferson, the &quot;empire builder,&quot;...Lewis, the fellow Virginian with a rich family history and a passion for exploration and Clark, the professional soldier and pragmatic friend who provided valuable leadership during key moments of the trip.Lewis, Jefferson and Clark helped the United States become a continental power stretching from sea to sea. Ultimately, the news of Lewis and Clark's return and the subsequent published journals triggered a rush for the mountains across the nation. This is a wonderful book...because the partnership of Lewis and Clark is arguably the most famous in American history. Highly recommended.Bert Ruiz"},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I purchased this book after being inspired by the Ken Burn's documentary on the Corps of Discovery. After being mesmerized by Burn's film, I became immediately immersed in this fascinating legend.The book chronologically follows the story from Jefferson's vision of the trip through the journey itself to Meriwether Lewis' untimely and mysterious death. Along the way the reader becomes intimately familiar with the mental challenges that Lewis must have endured during his grueling adventure as well as the physical demands placed on the entire expedition.Most fascinating are the descriptions of the terrain and the native people that the Corps encounter. Ambrose's description of the Corps' experience as they first enter the vast plains of the midwest was reminiscent of the Garden of Eden; a land so amazingly rich and beautiful. It provides great insight into the pristine habitat that American settlers found as they journeyed West.In my opinion, Undaunted Courage is superior to the other Ambrose books I have read (D-Day and Citizen Soldiers). The insight into Lewis is a fascinating character study wrapped in a wonderful adventure. A must read for the fan of early American history."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Stephen Ambrose obviously had a warm place in his heart for the Lewis and Clark expedition - he tells in the Introduction of his decision to celebrate the nation's bicentennial in July 1976 at Lemhi Pass in Montana, where Lewis was the first American to cross the Continental Divide. His wonder at the accomplishments of Lewis &amp; Clark, and his genuine love for the American West they first explored, make this book a very readable labor of love.It is difficult to imagine in today's time the obstacles faced by the expedition, and to do judtice to the ingenuity of the expedition in their successful voyage to and from the Pacific. Thomas Jefferson had no idea what the explorers would find as they travelled up the Missouri River, seeking a waterway to the Pacific, as he apparently thought they might come across prehistoric creatures like the mastodon. They were equipped with a large supply of Dr. Benjamin Rush's &quot;thunderclappers&quot;, pills made of mercury, chlorine and jalap that operated as &quot;an explosive purgative&quot; which were dispensed by the men for almost any ailment. When that didn't work they applied a &quot;poultice&quot;.Yet, somehow, almost all of them made it! Through hostile Native American territories, with little to offer but beads and useless ornamental goods, the expedition peacefully co-existed with tribe after tribe, while painstakingly noting new species of fauna and flora never before noted by Americans. They hunted and fished for their food, and adapted to every new circumstance despite sometimes overwhelming obstacles. They were also wise enough to recognize good fortune when it dropped Sacagawea into their laps, as the Indian woman (and wife of trapper Charbonneau) probably single-handedly kept them on peaceful terms with numerous tribes with her translating skills, and her apparent peaceful nature. Tribes assumed they came in peace when they saw her.The book takes great pains to praise the leadership style of the men, and Lewis' apparent willingness to truly share his command with Clark even though Lewis was named by President Jefferson first, and then suggested his colleague Clark as a true &quot;co-commander&quot;. Some of the detail early in the book as to the expedition's supply needs, and their meticulous preparation for the lengthy voyage, were a little taxing to the patience of the reader but once the Corps of Discovery left St. Louis and began their remarkable voyage, the narrative picked up considerably. Ambrose borrows heavily from Lewis's journal, sometimes providing illustrations showing Lewis' narrative and sketches of the new species they were observing for the first time.In particular, the end of the road for Lewis was poignant and unforgettable. Americans should be more aware of the remarkable accomplishments of the Corps, and this book is an excellent starting point."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Like many Americans, my knowledge of the Lewis &amp; Clark expedition was from high school history books and a visit to the St. Louis arch. For those of you in my shoes wanting to learn more, this is a great starting place for a general overview of this sadly overlooked episode in our history. Some reviewers here think the book started out slowly. There is some truth to that, but without background information, a lot of the author's analysis of different situations would not make sense. For example, Ambrose discusses the lack of crop rotation by Virginia tobacco farmers and their insatiable appetite for more land at length. Later, this discussion makes sense because it partly explains (among other reasons) Jefferson's desire to make the Louisiana Purchase and to pursue the dream of Western expansion to the Pacific. Overall, the book is detailed and interesting as it puts together information from a lot of other scholarly sources. Ambrose is clearly an expert on the subject and you'll finish the book thinking you are too. However, I found it a bit disappointing for 2 reasons: 1) Sacagewea's role as interpreter/guide does not seem as important to the success of the venture as the author would like us to believe (I wanted more details about her--even some physical description of her was lacking except the comment that she was a mere 15 yrs. old at the start), and 2)the slow disintegration of Lewis in the end left me feeling deprived of a satisfactory explanation for the way it came about. This last criticism may not be the result of any flaw in the book, but a result of the frustration many historians feel over the lack of concrete information available. Even Ambrose thinks about &quot;what if's&quot; in the end. What if Lewis had not returned, what if he had published his journals immediately, what if his life hadn't ended so young? Would he now be a bigger hero rather than a fading memory?"},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I am using this book as the basis for a course I'm teaching on the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Although I've read at least 10 books on the subject, this is still &quot;The Bible.&quot; Ambrose presents an interesting juxaposition between narrative and quotations from the journals of the two men. The feeling is one of a participant on the adventure, experiencing the hardships, the hunger, the cold. This book is essential for anyone who is serious about the subject. It is not a love story, nor does it seem fictionalized, but it is not stiff nor formal, either. In comparison with other books, the material is as close to the truth as possible. Ambrose is a good writer and knows how to draw the reader into the next episode. He also is able to weave the different threads of this important historical event into one cohesive whole (&quot;Meanwhile, back at Montecello, Jefferson is...&quot;). This book will keep you company as well as inform you."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I have found Ambrose to be a hit and miss author, having read his books on Eisenhower (a hit) and the Transcontinental Railroad (a miss). This book fits into the former category.This book is a biography of Merriwether Lewis with the focus on his famous expedition with William Clark. Ambrose does a good job describing the hardships that Lewis and Clark went through during their trip across the country. Few acts of exploration are comparable; they went across completely uncharted territory filled with both natural and human perils and suffered a minimal number of losses.There is a lot of good material in here and Ambrose tries to be fair to all sides. For example, Lewis is portrayed as heroic at times and rash or suicidal at others; the Indians they encounter are sometimes benevolent and sometimes hostile or thieving. Ambrose portrays the individuals in these events as the complex characters they are.As for Lewis and Clark, their names are inseparable in history, and Ambrose makes a good case that that would be okay with them. They were good friends and had complementary skills that made their mission a success. But in Ambrose's version of the story, Lewis is the main character, and that helps make his book a great read."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Being a long time, voracious reader, it is difficult to say \\"top ten best\\" when describing how you feel about a book. This does not apply here.Undaunted Courage is a wonderfully expressive book written in vivid detail about the amazing journey of discovery, by a band of men, vaccinated with an impromptu courage tested daily by the elements, animals, and indians they meet along the way; while exploring the unknown Pacific Northwestern territory purchased by President Thomas Jefferson from the French.It is a book whose pages should be taken slowly, savoring each passage like a fine wine. Swirl the words around and after carefully swallowing, treat yourself to another sip of spacious text; then sit back, close your eyes, and imagine youself riding in a canoe with them, water splashing on your face as you paddle past the beauty of the White Cliffs, amidst the cold, clear water, abounding with amphibious life.To finish Undaunted Courage brings a yearning to start the whole adventure again. This is what reading is all about, and for writers like myself, Stephen Ambrose delivers much needed inspiration.Charles Hamilton Sr, Former Executive Director of Northwest Teen Challenge, author of From Darkness To Light and A Step Of Faith.A Step of Faith"},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"In this day of relentless boredom for most people, this book provides a venue for the imagination to travel in time that has almost been forgotten. The details of what went on before and after the \\"Corps of Discovery\\" allow the reader to understand more than the trip itself. This view from the balcony allows the reader to have closure on the leaders, members of the crew, and the adventure.

It will take time to read but you won't be disappointed. There are interesting stories and facts all along the way and it will give you a good slice of Amrerican History from that period.Truly one of the most historic expeditions of all time, with apologies to Columbus and Marco Polo, the saga of Lewis and Clark is basically a tale of the opening of the west and the prelude to the manifest destiny that expanded America to include land on a grand scale. The rivers of Montana and the west slopes of the Rockies are so historically important and Ambrose does them justice. A must for any armchair American historian or for anyone who fishes for trout in the rivers of Montana that Lewis and Clark explored for the first time in American History.The tale is historically important for Native Americans in a much different way. However, Lewis and Clark were, at least by most historical records, interested in making the expedition a peaceful journey. They mostly succeeded. Those that followed, of course, did not."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"These guys are my heroes.

I have become an avid first edition collector of L&C; and Mr. Ambrose's synopsis can only be topped by the generosity he showed the L&C; Foundation. Once you finish reading Undaunted Courage many will undoubtedly want more. Dr. Moulton's synopsis makes a nice follow-up or delve into Dr. Moulton's rewrite of the full journals or if you have the $ find yourself a 1st edition of Thwaites. Earlier first editions, particularly the 1814 Biddle and 1807 Gass, while more valuable are very limited.This story can only told better by Lewis and Clark. Those who want to see two sites that are as the were should visit Camp Disappointment and The Fight Sight by Cutbank, MT. Camp Disappointment still has as many mosquitoes as complained about by Mr. Lewis.Fascinating reading and should be a first read by anyone looking to indulge themselves on a journey that hopefully will yield as much pleasure as it has to me.Mr. Ambrose lives on with this fine piece of early Americana and I am ever indebted to him for enhancing the publics awareness of 29 of American's greatest heroes."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Ambrose precedes his reputation with this excellent account of the Lewis and Clark expedition. The primary focus of the book is Lewis with a heavy dose of Thomas Jefferson and his influence on Lewis. The book is very detailed and an accurate account of the Corps of Discovery expedition. The details could be dry for some readers, but for those with an inherent interest in history, this is a great read. Undaunted Courage builds upon previous biographies of the Lewis/Clark expedition and adds its own spin through the discussion of Jefferson. I learned lots from this book and would highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"This is the most enjoyable book I have ever read. The narrative style of Stephen Ambrose takes what could be a dry lecture and makes it extremely interesting. The book reads like a best selling novel. It also leaves the reader asking what about Captain William Clark? He receives minimal coverage.The book gives a nice background on Captain Meriwether Lewis. The book shows how Lewis' background prepared Lewis for the journey and how it provided the relationship he had with Jefferson to lead to his selection for the journey. Lewis was Jefferson's personal secretary when selected to lead the voyage that would take him up the Missouri River, to wintering with the Indians, to the Rockies, over the mountains, down the Columbia River to the Pacific Ocean, and back. Lewis experienced hardships and saw wonderful sights. The sites included herds of buffalo and Indian tribes with no previous contact with white men. He and his partner, Captain William Clark, made the first maps of the trans-Mississippi West, provided data on the flora and fauna of the Louisiana Purchase territory, and most importantly established the American claim to Oregon, Washington, and Idaho.The book shows how Lewis is financially underwritten by a variety of characters. This list includes Jefferson, Clark, numerous Indian chiefs, and Sacagawea, the Indian girl who accompanied the expedition, along with the French-Indian hunter Drouillard, the great naturalists of Philadelphia, the French and Spanish fur traders of St. Louis, John Quincy Adams, and many more leading political, scientific, and military figures of the turn of the 19th century.This is a book about a hero and national unity. This is a book also about a tragedy. When Lewis returned to Washington in the fall of 1806, he was a national hero. Lewis greatest failure was he did not get his journals and notes organized and published. The scholarly value of those would have been great. Publishing them in a timely manner would have made Lewis financially independent. Instead Lewis took to drink, drugs, engaged in land speculation, piled up debts he could not pay, made jealous political enemies, experienced severe depression (probably from the drugs), and ultimately took his own life.

The most interesting parts are the descriptions of the behavior of the Native American cutlures, as described in Lewis' journals and the post expedition lives of Lewis and Clark. I was inspired to spend a great deal of my summer vacation retracing the journey of Lewis and Clark after reading this book."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Here is an example of a book that is sold as being almost as monumental as the events it conerns. While no one can deny the achievements of Lewis ( and I almost forgot Clark ) the book is, lets face it, an unadultereated adulatory portrait of a man with serious flaws. The final chapters of the book, which deal with Lewis's post expedition years, are in my mind a ratification of the monumental ego of the man. His behaviour throughout caused me to ask the question: would I have liked this man in person? On finishing the book, I couldn't decide whether I disliked Lewis the man or Lewis as portrayed therein. And for what its worth, the hero of the expedition as far as I'm concerned, was Clark for tolerating Lewis."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Travel with Lewis and Clark up the Missouri River into the Pacific Northwest. &quot;Undaunted Courage&quot; by Stephen E. Ambrose, a detailed account of Meriwether Lewis' journey with William Clark and the Corps of Discovery, taken from the explorers' words, allows the reader to experience firsthand the adventure into unknown lands.Ambrose details the life and times of Lewis, including the events that shaped his life and how ultimately the trip cost him more than he could have ever anticipated. The reader will have the opportunity to return to the late 1700s and early 1800s as seen through the eyes of Meriwether Lewis.Thomas Jefferson is also a prime figure in the story as he fosters the idea of the venture and the young mind of Lewis. Jefferson had the dream of expansion and development of the country and became instrumental in arranging the trip and preparing Lewis for his responsibilities on the trip. The relationships between contemporaries, Jefferson and Lewis and Lewis and Clark, is explored in great depth as these historical figures come to life in these pages.&quot;Undaunted Courage&quot; is a must read for lovers of history or for people who simply enjoy a great adventure."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Not long ago, I visited Oregon and some of the places where Lewis and Clark ended their journey across the continent, which made me want to read more about the expedition. All roads seemed to lead to this recent work from Stephen Ambrose, so I picked it up.I have to say that I was a little disappointed. First, it's as if Ambrose couldn't quite decide if he wanted to write a biography of Meriwether Lewis or a history of the Lewis and Clark expedition. The story of the expedition is couched within a proto-biography of Lewis' early and late life. There isn't enough there to really consider it a Lewis biography, and I think that the work would probably have been better if Ambrose had either left this material out, or greatly reduced it. Clark isn't profiled in this way, and Ambrose seems to lament in the introduction that someone has already beaten him to the punch with Clark.Second, the writing is very workmanlike. The writing isn't bad, but it's not great either. The narrative is very slow in the beginning, but picks up steam as the expedition actually gets underway; however, none of it was especially captivating to me.Third, Ambrose gets repetitious with \\"firsts,\\" some of which are of dubious validity. Fairly early in the expedition, Ambrose treats us to a series of \\"Lewis and Clark were the first to do X\\" statements about every third page. Some are undoubtedly true, but others--such as Lewis and Clark holding the first vote west of the Mississippi, or being the first Americans to see a coyote, despite over 10,000 Americans living in Missouri when Lewis Clark got there--are probably not true, or simply can't be known to be true.I was disappointed because I really wanted to like this book. I didn't dislike it, but it's completely average. I've read several other books by Ambrose, and this was disappointing by that standard. Ambrose wasn't necessarily a great writer of history, but he was a great popularizer of history, which is certainly important. While Undaunted Courage isn't bad, I'm certain that there has to be a more exciting story in the Lewis and Clark expedition than that offered here."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Every schoolchild knows of the Lewis and Clark expedition. Few of them know that it almost died in obscurity. Jefferson wanted Lewis to write a comprehensive report on the expedition but Lewis never wrote it. He had a nervous breakdown because of some personal problems or was overwhelmed by the amount of information collected or he had a historic case of writer's block. Until someone in the basement in the Smithsonian found the expedition's notebooks and catalogs of new species no one gave Lewis and Clark the credit they deserve. As Stephen Ambrose points out, countless species of animals were renamed based on first discovery by the expedition. This is but one of the tid-bits that Ambrose uncovers and explains in Undaunted Courage. I give the book 4 stars instead of 5 because it is not one his best books only the best I've read on Lewis and Clark.If this review was helpful, please say so."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Undaunted Courage is part biography, part travel journal and is an excellent example of the way history should be written. Chronicling the Lewis and Clark expedition, Ambrose takes us on the arduous trek up the Missouri, across the plains and over the Great Divide to the storm swept Oregon coast - and then back.The book is chronologically organized, giving the reader a sense of the grinding challenges Lewis and Clark faced, with abundant details giving the reader a sense of accompanying the explorers on their journey. The maps (and there are several) are also helpful in re-tracing their steps. But Ambrose goes beyond the journey itself, occasionally giving the reader a glimpse of the world that was to come to the Native Americans Lewis and Clark encountered - indeed, foreshadowing the volitile relationship that Native Americans would have with the US government for the next 200 years. He concludes the book with an epilogue of the participants of the expedition - some returned to the Rockies as mountain men (John Coulter, for example), others simply vanished from history.As the bicentennial of the Lewis and Clark expedition approaches, this is a must read book for ANYONE who wishes to have more than a passing familiarity with one of the seminal events in American history."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"An incredible writer at his finest. The historical detail is fascinating and the adventure is incredible. You feel as if you are making this journey with Lewis & Clark. This was my first Ambrose book that I read. He has become one of my favorite writers because he never cheats the reader. He knows his story, his characters and his history and weaves a tale that is fascinating."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"What an outstanding work and what a pity that so few will become acquainted with it! Ambrose has knocked another one out of the park with the story of the famous Lewis & Clarke Expedition that opened the American West to the new country.How many times have we heard that \\"all they did was walk a long way\\" or \\"they did nothing that native Americans had not done before\\" or (worse of all) \\"they didn't accomplish anything.\\" This is the story not only of just explorers but of Presidents and nations. Their trip was no Sunday stroll through the woods. It was preceded by lifetimes of experience, years of preparation, organization and planning on a scale rarely seen before or since and once underway, withstood the hardships of the open country, unfriendly natives and unfamiliar wildlife.We live in an age in which heroes are castigated and belittled for the mere fact of being heroic. I admire not only the physical courage necessary but the intellectual underpinnings of the trip. The results were astounding and changed - perhaps as much as any one event - the way we viewed both our nation and our mission. The story was told chronologically with great detail. Their trusty translator, the Indian girl, her husband, the soldiers, the Indian chiefs - all became real in this book. The maps were superb and the individual vigenettes (losing supplies, men lost, arguments, snake bites, etc) gave the story a reality that mere recitation of facts cannot provide.The research required for such a book is astounding (note the incredible bibliography). And Ambrose has a way of bringing to life dry, historical figures...they become more than characters in a book. He superbly blends culture, history, politics and science into a seamless whole - a task worthy of five stars."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Another great adventure book, Stephen Ambrose really is an excellent writer. There was so much history i never knew about these two great explorers was fascinating to learn so much, and his ability to tell a detailed account of just what they went through is amazing, a great book for any aspiring leader."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"This is one of those books that I never stop reading. I have read it in it's entirety but it's a book that I can ;pick up at any time and pick any section and read again."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I really enjoyed this book and looked forward to reading it every day. I found it a little difficult in the beginning (although I'd just finished the Harry Potter series, so maybe my brain wasn't tuned up). It's very dense reading--there's a lot of detail, which I appreciated--I felt like I was getting as close to honest as Ambrose could determine himself. I also enjoyed Ambrose's narrative commentary and footnotes. Maps were also helpful and useful. This is a book that I will always recommend!"},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Ambrose does a very good job writing a detailed bio on Lewis while presenting the expedition from it infancy with an early history of the Louisiana territory and the early plans to explore and exploit the land. Lewis literally is a prot&eacute;g&eacute;e and neighbor of Jefferson and he is virtually educated by Jefferson as his secretary and along with tutoring by scholars. Although someone free with monetary scripts, Lewis shows great organizational skills in getting the trip together and he shows modesty by wanting to co-lead with Clark for whom he attempts to gain equal rank. He fails to gain Clark the rank of captain but in spite of that, he still shares command. Ambrose describes in detail Lewis' meetings with the various tribes along the Missouri River, Rockies and Snake River who without their assistance, it is unlikely Lewis and Clark would have survived their journey. High points of the book is Lewis and Clark's interacting with the tribes particularly the Nez Perz along with the Chinooks which was quite a contrast and of course the Plains Indians such as the Sioux, Mandans, Hidatsa and the Arikarees. Quite a story about their crossing of the Rockies which took them by surprise and this is the literal high point of the book along with the suffering in their west coast camps that were dominated by boredom and limited game. The plains are described as a paradise for food.Lewis' ability to examine and write about minerals, botany, zoology and the geography is quite astounding for a layman along with his ability to administer wounds and act as a pharmacist with good results. The interesting low points of the expedition is Lewis' failure to get a portable iron frame boat to float and his naive venture to meet the fierce Blackfeet tribe with only four men that rightly would have ended his return trip if he met a sizable party. Also facinating is that Lewis never seems to recover from the expedition as he is appointed governor of the Louisiana territory, which seems to be too much responsibility along with his inability to write the book that Jefferson and the public expected. At the end he is overwhelmed and after 400 pages Ambrose describes his suicide in a reasonably detailed manner. With so many concerned about his mental health, it's amazing that Lewis was allowed to travel without a significant escort always at his side.The low point of the book is the return trip where Lewis and Clark split up for several 100 miles taking different routes before rejoining, little is written of Clark's journey along the Yellowstone where he splits his group into horse handlers and those in canoes. Although never mentioned in the book, Clark's horse handlers led by Sergeant Pryor encounter Crow Indians who steal their horses. Pryor and three men attempt to over take the Crows for 10 miles in unknown territory finally giving up and floating themselves down river in fresh buffalo hides stretched over tree branches called Bull boats. They have a frightening encounter with Grizzly bears who think the smelly buffalo hides coming down river to them are dead buffalo that they were accustomed to seeing floating down river for easy pickings. Clark's discovery of the huge limestock rock natural monument which he named Pompey's Pilar after Sacagawea's son is also never mentioned.Clark is portrayed as the ultimate military man and as a great woodsman which makes him invaluable. More detailed on Clark's post expedition life would have been interesting. His ability to balance Lewis was huge for the expedition to succeed. Sacagewea is very prominent the expedition's success in communicating with the Rocky Mountain tribes and her knowledge of the country. Her role in translation is responsible for a lot of the expedition's peaceful dealings with the mountain tribes. Regretfully not much is known of her life after the expedition. This is a great introduction book that is worth reading."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"This is a nicely told narrative of the journey of Lewis &amp; Clark, including both the preparations prior to their departure and their lives after they returned from the Pacific. It is lengthy, trying to blend the adventure with the politics and the economics, and in places it gets quite speculative, such as when it attempts to surmise the cause of Lewis's untimely death (I'm trying not to give anything away here).Anyway, as with all of Ambrose's work, it is what I think of as &quot;workmanlike&quot;, always using a simple literary style that makes no pretensions intellectually. In point of fact, the author is a great story teller, and if you ever avail yourself of audiobooks (or 'books on tape'), his works lend themselves perfectly to that format."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I've always wanted to learn more about the Lewis &amp; Clark expedition, and wading through the bad spelling and grammar of the journals was often difficult and time-consuming. So I read this book instead. What a treat. It's complete and comprehensive in it's coverage of the events and cirumstances that led to the expedition and also of the events following the return of the Corps of Discovery. I learned many interesting facts and anecdotes about the expedition that I'd never heard before. It took me a little while to get through this book, and it got a little dry in a few spots. But it's definitely worth reading and pushing through to the end. You will learn a lot."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I was first aware of this book nearly 18 months before it was published. I saw Stephen Ambrose on C-SPAN's &quot;Booknotes&quot; with Brian Lamb, promoting his &quot;D-Day&quot; book (yes, I've read that one too). Lamb asked what his next book was going to be, and Ambrose didn't hold back and said that he was working on a biography of Meriwether Lewis. &quot;Oh, wait'll you read my Meriwether Lewis book,&quot; he said. I hardly knew of the L&amp;C expedition, but his hook worked. I knew that I was going to read it when it came out. When it did come out, I grabbed a first edition. And if you care to know, this was the first Ambrose book I ever read.I don't profess to know much about the great expedition, but this book was a genuine eye opener. I learned so much about the expedition, Lewis and Clark, Thomas Jefferson, I devoured it in a few days' time.If you're like me and don't know much about the subject, this is the book for you. You'll come away not only informed, but entertained as well.I personally believe that this is Ambrose's last great work. His other books published afterwards were good, but they weren't as sharp or, as Michael Beschloss said on the jacket blurb, as &quot;lyrical&quot; as this.Will someone PLEASE make a movie of this? It demands it!"},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Stephen Ambrose REALLY likes Meriwether Lewis and Thomas Jefferson. He positively gushes adoration when speaking of these two figures of American expansionism. Roughly, UNDAUNTED COURAGE is the story of how Jefferson and Lewis put their heads together to form an expedition of men to forge through the wilderness of what is now the northwestern United States in order to try to find an all-water passage to the Pacific ocean, and how the resulting exploration succeeded in some ways, but failed in others. At 480+ pages, the book is just long enough to give you the feel of the whole account, with plenty of excerpts from Lewis' and Jefferson's writings, but left me wanting to read more of the details. Where can I get a copy of Thwaite's edition of the Lewis &amp; Clark journals? :o) I recommend this book for anyone interested in the history of the United States in the early 1800's. It is easily readable for high school level and up."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"This book is a moving experience; transporting the reader along the journey. It is vivid and continually interesting; one of the best books I ever read. It is an uplifting and inspirational story of ingenuity, leadership and tenacity. It is rich with the lessons of human endurance and conquest. Ambrose is a true genius of a writer. I predict you will feel like a better American after this read."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Undaunted Courage tells the story of Meriwether Lewis &amp; TJ with an abundance of facts. Ambrose tells us a story with the words of the people who were on the expedition. I do not see why people complain that this book has book has narrowed in on Lewis too much. Read the the title! It is about Lewis and TJ, not Sacajawea or whoever else you were expecting. It is just Lewis and his wonderful expedition."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Using detailed references to a vast multitude of written history, Ambrose makes you feel as if your were on the Lewis and Clark expedition. One reads the book with a continually increasing sense of awe at the courage, ability, and engenuity displayed by Lewis, Clark, Thomas Jefferson and the other members of this enterprise. This should be required reading in all highschools and colleges."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I think this book is as good as any by Stephen Ambrose. The subject matter is something that's interested me for a long time and it receives the loving attention it deserves. It's obvious from the very beginning that the author is a huge fan of Meriwether Lewis. The first part of the book covers Lewis's childhood and the events that led up to the expedition. There is little conflict here and the book seems as if it will be a fawning tribute. This continues into the start of the trip itself and Ambrose sometimes seems to over do the hero worship. He also overdoes the fact that these are the first white men to see the territory west of the Mississippi. There are several lines such as &quot;...the first Americans to see the sunset west of the Mississippi.&quot; and &quot;...the first Americans to celebrate the fourth of July west...&quot;. The book starts to level out though and the author starts to balance out the narrative. We start to see the darker side to the white mind set. There isn't a lot of worry of political correctness however as some of the Indian tribes aren't portrayed favorably either.The journey is interesting with many thrilling and humorous incidents. The final years of Lewis's life are tragic but I really didn't get a feeling of the tragedy that was coming from the narrative. It seemed a little underplayed until the final chapter.This is a great story about men who willingly risked their lives just for the thrill of adventure (and land grants), but it's also a poignant look at a complex, tragic hero. I would highly recommend this book for anyone interested in history or just a good adventure yarn that gives a good glimpse of America as it was."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"There is not much I can add to many of the superlatives already bestowed upon this work. But I have one item of praise I think worth noting.For reasons not relevant, my short-term memory has been wrecked by disease and the treatment (side effects!) for said disease. There are many things I have done or said in the past 10 years of which I have absolutely no memory. Thus, because I read this book around 2003 or 2004, it would be understandable if I remembered nothing of it.In fact, there is one discussion in the book which, to me, must have been written akin to lightning hitting a giant tree and somehow leaving words, symbols, etc. It concerns Ambrose's discussion of Lewis & Clark's courage.While discussing what Lewis & Clark accomplished, Ambrose writes how no man (no white man) knew what lay across the next horizon, or on the other side of the mountain before them. It could have been a raging, uncrossable river, a desert (e.g., high plains), or a magical city of gold. No one (again, no white man who had recorded his experience) knew. Yet, they kept going on towards the Pacific Ocean even after many people in \\"the East\\" thought they must be dead. These were two very brave men.And a kudos to President Jefferson, who received with interest the many items of Natural Science sent back by Lewis & Clark. While certain political interests have been successful in teaching an entire generation of American youth either nothing about Jefferson, or that he is only of note for having sexual relations with a slave, he was, in fact, by far the most brilliant man ever to be President of the U.S. Think about it. Who is the last President you can imagine commissioning a scientific (as well as political) expedition and then studying the results on the level of an expert? The last President with any private sector skills (other than a lawyer or military) was...I'm not really sure. Certainly, H. Hoover as an engineer. Maybe J. Carter for agribusiness?"},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I love this book. It had been recommended by a friend. It is so interesting and I like the historical information about Thomas Jefferson much better than a biography that I had read about him. (Which spent so much time talking about Sally Henning) I am amazed by the amount of scientific data that was done on this journey.I'm not finished yet but am thoroughly enjoying this book. I wish the print weren't so small."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I recently acquired \\"Undaunted Courage\\" as a gift and have been enjoying the great way Ambrose brings to life the characters and the activities. I noted, however, as Lewis and Clark journeyed down the Ohio River prior to actually embarking on their adventure, that Ambrose completely omits what I think to be an important part of the trip, plus he makes a very problematic error. When Lewis & Clark traveled down the Ohio River, there is evidence that they stopped, at least for a day, perhaps more, in Maysville, KY. And it is there, in Maysville, that they met, recruited and signed on the later-to-be-significant John Colter. Ambrose notes in the book, incorrectly, according to my resources, that Lewis signed Colter on in Pittsburgh. In Maysville there is an historical marker that speaks of Lewis & Clark's time in Maysville during that venture, and of their signing on John Colter. Colter was a Virginian by birth who had moved to Maysville at age 5. It is more likely that the expedition met up with him in Maysville than in Pittsburgh, as Ambrose suggests. Also, earlier, years prior to the Lewis & Clark expedition, Ambrose notes that on a trip down the Ohio River Lewis stopped in various river towns and lists \\". . .Limestone, Maysville, . . .\\". Actually, Limestone and Maysville are one and the same town--the name of the town was changed from Limestone to Maysville in 1787. The latter suggests that Ambrose perhaps spent more time researching other parts of the expedition than time spent in this segment of the country. Even so, I think Ambrose's treatise on the expedition is a wonderful and well-written description of this historical event."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Perhaps no other journey, save the landings on the moon, has fired the American imagination like the expedition of Lewis and Clark to the Pacific Ocean and back. It is the story of the opening of the American West, of an incredible tale of leadership and personal hardship, and it offers a first glimpse into an unknown native world that no longer exists. Undaunted Courage is Ambrose's attempt at placing the Lewis and Clark expedition within the context of the early years of the American republic, especially from the perspective of Captain Meriwether Lewis.Ambrose, who was a historian in New Orleans, had a great ability to focus on larger events, from the perspective of leaders, and especially leaders who had a hands-on experience with great events. His works in the later part of his career, like the famed Band of Brothers, focused on small military units, which faced unique circumstances, and exhibited great bravery through trying times. In a sense, the Lewis and Clark expedition was the first Band of Brothers: two officers and roughly thirty enlisted men, trekking over unknown territory, and out of touch with their command and the rest of civilization for over two years.This book is written partly as a biography of Captain Lewis, who was also the equivalent of today's White House Chief of Staff in the Jefferson administration. Ambrose presents Lewis as a trusted man, given to wandering, beset by personal demons and depression, driven to success, but often forgetful in critical moments of his task. Most of all, he wants the reader to understand that the expedition would have failed, as many other shorter ones did in this time period, were it not for the excellent junior officer leadership, and the real espirit de corps that the enlisted men developed; as their very survival depended on the type of teamwork they created.Ambrose loved this subject, probably as much as any other in his career. He spent a significant amount of personal time camping and traveling the route that Lewis & Clark took, for decades before this book came to print. His first hand knowledge of the difficult terrain traveled adds a sense of realism. This is more than a memoir of Lewis. It is a travel and nature description, particularly of the mountain and Pacific northwest. The writing style reads aloud well, almost as if Ambrose would like the reader to take the book and read portions at a campfire, as he often read portions of the Lewis & Clark journal over campfires to his students.There are good maps, which make following the journey easier, but there are not many pictures. This is more than just a retelling of the Lewis & Clark journals, as it relies extensively on secondary sources, and his own personal historical judgments of the group's decision making processes. There are times when the writing could be tighter, when it would be better if Ambrose would not linger so long over a particular time period, as the group encountered an Indian tribe, or regarding the preparation for the expedition. Perhaps because Ambrose really loved this subject so much, that he does tend to gush over his subject, but that is a minor quibble. What the reader should find is a great tale of adventure, and a leadership study of two officers who complimented each other as well as any could."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Very enjoyable book. While I was familiar with the generalities of the Lewis & Clark expedition, I was not even close to having an understanding of the detail on any level. Ambrose provides that detail (the difficult traveling, Jefferson's political manuverings, background of Lewis & Clark etc) in a very readable manner that had me unwilling to put the book down. If anyone has interest in this period of American History, this is a must read."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"This was a wonderful book. It was if I was on the expedition with Lewis & Clark. It was extremely well researched, and brought a real insight into the lives of the explorers, a view of the national political scene of the early 1800s, expansion into the west, and Indian policy.I gained a huge admiration for those who trekked out into the unknown. Recently, as I flew from Minnesota to Idaho, looking down over some of the terrain that they crossed, just made me wonder how they dared venture into the unknown. This book enlightened me on what a huge undertaking the expedition was."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I'm not sure why, but history was a completely boring subject when I was in school and I remember but little of it. And it's unfortunate, because there are so many fascinating stories and people and events that it's nearly all I read anymore. The story of Lewis & Clark's exploration of the Louisiana Territory and expedition to the Pacific is one of those stories, and this is an excellent telling of it.Stephen Ambrose covers the topic well with a focus on Meriwether Lewis and why he was ideally suited for the task. Together with Clark, he reached the mouth of the Columbia River and returned and only one member of their Corps of Discovery died (very early in the journey, out of a group of over 30 men). Ambrose discusses the amazing accomplishments as well as the mistakes that were made, but places everything into proper context, giving us an excellent insight into the personality of Lewis. It was fascinating reading how the Plains looked with their endless herds of buffalo and frequent encounters with Grizzly bears, or the struggles in crossing the Rocky Mountains which turned out to be much more difficult and hazardous than they had imagined. The plants and animals and Indians they encountered along the way are all here, including the 15 year-old guide Sacajawea and her infant son, who is rightly honored. They may not have found the all-water route that Jefferson wanted, but they accomplished something amazing for the time and shared some truly uncommon experiences.Ambrose chose to retain the original spelling of the men which provides an interesting, and sometimes amusing, look at the time. This is an exciting and readable book I can highly recommend. It made me want to plan a trip to see parts of the trail myself."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"This is one of the greatest books written on the Lewis and Clark expedition. It has every element of a great novel let alone the historic, factual, epic it is. There are passages that can make one weep as well as those which terrify. Some day, hopefully soon, a movie-maker will turn this book into an award winning film and reveal to the public the depth and majesty of this great American adventure."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"With so many reviews sometimes I hesitate to add one more. This is a gift, a treasure to all Americans who come after us. All good stories do not necessarily have the benefit of good story tellers and vice versa. I believe this is THE reason this book is so powerful. L&C is a tale of the stars aligning at exactly the right moment with precisely the right cast there to undertake the adventure. Behind it all is the vision of Jefferson who saw with perfect clarity what needed to be done (the La. Purchase) and the immediate need to explore it and open it up to the boundless energies of those who would make it home. With carping, second-guessing New England Federalists at his heels he selected the man to lead the expedition. He equipped Lewis with the necessary resources, intellectual and material to execute his bold plan. Lewis selected an uncanny compliment to co-lead the venture and the rest, as they say, is history. This cannot be over recommended and should be mandatory reading for all citizens before high school graduation."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I didn't know that much about Lewis & Clark and the Corps of Discovery before reading this book.

The article praised the author and book, and I was not disapointed. The historical facts, geography, and interesting sub-plots are artfully spun together to make for a very interesting book. I was not too familiar with the locations covered by the expedition, and found myself referring to an atlas to better visualize where the expedition was at certain times.My only complaints are that some issues and/or events are described two or three times in different chapters, and that the maps in the book are inadequate for the rich and detailed narrative."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Predominately a reader of fiction I found this book more spectacular than any adventure novel."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I loved this book. I had never known much about Lewis and Clark other than the obvious that one learns in high school. This great tale let me live the thrilling things that befell the Corps of Discovery in ways that made it come alive. The only negative was a longish start before the actual adventure but that is only a minor complaint."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Stephen E. Ambrose scores again! Not simply a retelling of the adventures of Lewis and Clark. Ambrose tells the story of the Lewis and Clark expedition in its broad historical context and the principal protagonists - Thos. Jefferson, Merriwether Lewis, &amp; William Clark - emerge as truly human figures; heroic, yes, but not without very human frailties. A fascinating read!"},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"This book rekindled my interest in the Lewis and Clark Exhibition. Ambrose brings the adventure alive with detailed information on the group's day to day struggles, dangers and discoveries. An excellent book that forces you to appreciate not just Lewis and Clark, but all Americans who took great risks to allow us to live as we do."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Re: Book length. The idea that more is more doesn't hold up well for me. We don't really need to know what &quot;Ed&quot; ate for breakfast on Tuesday the 19th, unless it killed him. That said, I wish this book had been a bit longer, in the body or in an appendix. I know what the title says, but more detail on Clark's eastward trek after splitting with Lewis would have been appreciated. Hence, the 9."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"We tend to search out historical perspectives on events and subjects that we perceive to be of larger impact to American culture and acheivement. After reading Ambrose's work, I have settled on the opinion that the impact of the mission of the Corps of Discovery is one of the top 3 acheivements in American History; the others, winning our independence from England and the Civil War.I feel satisfied that Ambrose has used every possible historical account available to paint an accurate portrait of the adventure. The author has pursuaded me, as a student of American History, to apply myself in gaining a greater understanding of this event and its impact."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"It is difficult to put one's mind into an era when great expanses of the West were blank on the map and a cross- continent waterway was still a dream.. Ambrose takes you from the geopolitical vison of Thomas Jefferson to the reality of exploring great expanses of territory unkown to the new Americans, but home to many tribes who offered the hand of friendship to the explorers. The narriative flows like a river through this tale of vision and courage."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Like all of Stephen Ambrose's books, \\"Undaunted Courage\\" is very well written, extensively researched, fascinating, and entertaining. I strongly recommend this book, as well as other Ambrose books like \\"Citizen Soldiers.\\" Having said all that, and even though I think \\"Undaunted Courage\\" is overall an excellent (4 stars) book, I have several problems with it. First, as Ambrose himself laments several times, there are large gaps in Lewis' journals (for unkown reasons, although possibly related to spells of serious depression?), which means that some of the most interesting parts of the Lewis and Clark expedition are essentially blank voids or at best second-hand or lesser accounts. This is a tremendous loss to history, and possibly irretrievable. Highly unfortunate -- and a major bummer! Second, although Lewis was excellent at recording important details of flora, fauna, latitude and longitude, he is absolutely clueless (or uninterested) -- as Ambrose also admits/laments -- about human emotions, especially his own. Although Ambrose tries to fill in the gaps, Lewis' lack of psychological/emotional awareness severely harms his narrative (the most glaring is Lewis' rapid deterioration from heroic expedition leader to alcoholic, drug addict, and ultimate suicide. Unfortunately, we really have no clue why this was the case.) Meanwhile, Lewis makes matters even worse by combining his emotional/psychological myopia with a nearly unremitting, condescending, patronizing attitude towards blacks, women, and Indians. Admittedly, this was in character with aristocratic, slave-owning, Southern white males of his day, but still, I personally find it to be a constant annoyance, at the least. Also, Lewis' actions at various points were extremely reckless, and potentially disastrous, based largely on his view of the Indians as children/simpletons who could be manipulated at will. Great commander and leader? Questionable at best! Finally, although Lewis and Clark's expedition certainly was an amazing one, I couldn't help but feel a sense of disguist and sadness at both the behavior of Lewis and his men (I understand the danger of applying today's moral standards to history, but still!). Basically, what we're witnessing here, when you remove all the romanticism and adventure, is an esentially cold-blooded, realpolitik stab by young America at empire building, which in the end would lead to brutal destruction and near-total devastation (of Native Americans and the buffalo, for starters), and ultimately the creation of a country where even all WHITE MEN (let alone non-whites and women)were (are?) not equal. What we're also witnessing if we look below the surface romanticism of the whole expedition (and also the knowledge gained, which is impressive and important) is a bunch of young American men cutting an amoral, not-particularly-attractive swath through Louisiana territory, across the Rockies, to the Pacific and back, leaving a trail of destruction, deception, and disease in their wake."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Parents, If you're looking for a good history book for your children to read, please beware.While Ambrose credibly presents the exploits of the Corps of Discovery, he also fails to resist the modern urge to talk about their sex lives. Descriptions of the men's sexual practices with the Mandan indian women and their varied venereal diseases are offered for our enlightenment. The author also regales us with the curious sexual rituals of the Mandans, themselves. In addition, for no particularly beneficial reason, Ambrose relates to us how cold the winter was by offering us the natural consequences to one who would chooose to relieve himself out-of-doors.Parental caution is advised."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I purchased a \\"new\\" book. However, when I received it, there was damage to the front cover. It looks as though someone has bent the cover, and there is a visible fold."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I had always been interested in Lewis and Clark but this book was just too much. This book had no real catch. I assume that it was pretty much accurate but there was nothing in it that made me want to turn the page. I had to physicaly force myself to get through it. In other words don't read this book unless you either are Lewis and Clark. ( I think that even they would fall asleep during this book) or your life depends on getting through it."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Sad to say a person that has excited many people about history, me included, was not credible. Anything he has written has to be questioned. The man build his career off lying about his relationship with Dwight Eisenhower. He plagiarized who knows how many times. He isn't exactly known for getting it straight. Too bad that people continue to read his works and believe they are getting the facts. The publishers should at least point out that Stephen Ambrose was a fraud. I'm a bit upset because I wasted my time reading his work."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Reading the fine print on the bottom of the box, I see this is technically a Books on Tape recording, so Simon &amp; Schuster is off the hook. I can overlook Cotter Smith's somewhat flat reading of the text; after all, you can only add so much drama to a non-fiction book. But if you're going to read a book that focuses at least partly on Thomas Jefferson, is it too much to ask that they pronounce his own home correctly??!!!! Is it too much to have a director or producer say, &quot;Hey Cotter, could you back up for a minute? It's 'mon-tuh-CHELL-oh,' not 'mon-tuh-SELL-oh.'Quite frankly, this is at least an average recording overall. But the fact that one of the most basic components of Jefferson's life, something we're all taught as children, can be mispronounced and then make its way on to a finished recording ruins this production from the very beginning."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"This work is said to be plagarism--see Scandals and Scoundrels: Seven Cases That Shook the Academyby Ron Robin"},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Most unpleasant book.

Reading this book was very depressing."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Not to be hyperbolic, but Stephen Ambrose has written a history book that should be required reading in every American high school. He brings the Lewis and Clark story to life with such vibrancy that the book reads like adventure fiction. Surprises abound for those only marginally familiar with the Lewis and Clark story. One simply cannot underestimate their contribution to their country. Most fascinating is Ambrose's critique of them as military commanders, which they were. Simply put, an outstanding and monumental historical work."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Great read.

But it was a small price to pay. The journey up the Missouri, over the mountains to the Pacific, and then back, is an incredible adventure, vividly told. The writing is crisp and descriptive -- You can feel Lewis' awe as he stands at the continental divide, his depression during the dreary Oregon winter, and the excitement and fear of each new encounter with Indian communities. A most memorable read."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"For many American's &quot;Lewis and Clark&quot; is a cliche\` -- a meaningful but old story lacking depth and feeling. Ambrose, in his somewhat rough, candid style, brings the reader into the adventure. As you read you walk the miles, scale the rocks, feel the deprivation, thrill at the vistas, The book is well researched, and Ambrose can be forgiven for some latitude in assuming the content of certain conversations that are undocumented. Ambrose is especially honest in pointing out the role good fortune had in complementing the courage and skill of Lewis, Clark and the Corps. Often lost, but not ignored here, is the importance of Native Americans besides Sacagawea. Ambrose is clear that the expedition may not have survived, let along been successful, without the support of the Mandan, Clatsop and Nez Perce tribes. The irony of later U.S. policy toward these (and other) tribes is not lost. Indeed, Ambrose is correct in pointing out that U.S. exploitation of Native peoples was a strategy long before later provocations. Although Ambrose's prose does not always rise to the story, I found myself wanting to grab my boots, load up my backpack, and head for Lemhi Pass."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Hollywood should read this book if it wants for high adventure! An amazing insight to the L&amp;C expedition. It delves into the amazing bravery that these men took and looks at the troubled nature of Captain Lewis."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"&quot;Undaunted Courage&quot; is a well written, detailed look at Meriwether Lewis and his management of the famous Lewis and Clark expedition across the Louisiana Purchase. The author, Stephen Ambrose is clearly entralled with Lewis's adventures and he has a right to be. The decisions Lewis made, his unrelenting passion for the job given him by THomas Jefferson and the ingenuity he showed on so many difficult situations reveals Lewis to be a man of immense courage, stamina and intelligence. With one glaring omission the author reveals the true depth of Lewis and his abilities. We come away with a sense of how huge this undertaking truly was, how much knowledge was available to be gathered (and the supreme job that Lewis did in gathering so much of it) and the many layers of politics surrounding the expedition.While noting in passing Lewis' many racist acts towards native Americans and his paternalistic attitude towards native Americans and African Americans, Ambrose does not at any point go into detail to look at what Lewis' racism says about the man and how it impacts the job Lewis did or the contributions that others made to his success. It is not enough to simply assume he was a man of his times. He was smart enough to see the possibilities in the native Americans who's skills he could use. In fact a number of native Americans played such an important role in the journey that it can be said it would have failed without them.While this is not the focus of the book and should not overshadow it, Ambrose himself notes the racist acts so often that the reader is left with many questions and ideas which could have been explored in somewhat more detail by the author.Having said that, I enjoyed the book immensely both for its deep history and for the pleasure of the author's own energy. Ambrose clearly loves the adventure of Lewis'journey, the countryside in which it played out and the telling of so many incredible tales.Robert Quinn-o'Connor (robo@critpath.org)"},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Steven Ambrose's treatise on the political motivations of the Lewis &amp; Clark Expedition will undoubtedly have huge popular appeal as the bicentennial of the Expedition approaches.The author has researched the motives behind Thomas Jefferson's historic decision to ask Congress to fund the Expedition, as well as his decision to select Captain Meriwether Lewis to command the voyage.The reader is escorted step-by-step along the journey -- immensely interesting by itself -- then further treated to an analysis of the miriad of small decisions made along the way. Any single poor decision -- in navigation, indian relations or daily survival -- could have changed history forever.Ambrose has concluded that Jefferson's decision to commission Meriwether Lewis for the &quot;Voyage of Discovery&quot; was perhaps the single most important point in American history -- the right man at the right time!Review by Mark Norrell (Pocatello, Idaho"},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I wish I could E-Mail Mr. Ambrose direct.

A great story by a masterful non-fiction writer. Ambrose transports you to the Lewis and Clarke expedition through the skillful use of detail. This is among my favorite books ever!"},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"While the main purpose of this book is a biography of Meriwether Lewis, the author includes all of the influential characters, events, and setting of the early 19th century United States, starting with the third President, Thomas Jefferson.Jefferson's vision of America is a country stretching from sea-to-sea. It is as if Jefferson had an almost divine image of America. This is a special land, entirely different from the Old World in Europe, which is precisely why it was so important for the United States to lay claim to the continent, and effectively remove the presence of British, French, or Spanish military forces.If Jefferson were alive today, I think he would not be pleased with the United States' military presence in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. Jefferson's Republicans would likely have held an isolationist view of our sovereign nation even up to today. Americans do not belong in the Middle East today any more than British and French forces belonged in North America in 1903.I was surprised to learn that Jefferson had originally thought that American Indians could be \\"civilized\\", and become active citizens of the United States, whereas African Americans could never fully \\"assimilate\\" in Jefferson's views. Throughout the journeys of the Corps of Discovery, Lewis and Clark presented each tribe with a special speech, to inform them that they \\"have a new father\\", and invited their chiefs to visit Washington and meet Jefferson.This story predates the Trail of Tears and other stories of American genocide against Indians. However, one quote from the book puts an interesting perspective on the attitude of Americans': \\"How can an Indian tribe lay claim to thousands of acres of land that they ride across twice per year?\\" Although Jefferson intended confine American settlers to the land east of the Mississippi, and allow the Indians to keep all land west of it, history has shown that no executive power was able to stop the progress of American Pioneers.The stories of Lewis's activities had a familiar feeling to me. For example, while preparing for the expedition, Lewis contracted a boat builder to construct a large \\"keelboat\\" to travel up the Missouri river. The contractor was very slow, constantly drunk, and failed to show up many mornings. It reminded me of contractors that I've dealt with in my business, who have no sense of the urgency required by the customer.As an outdoorsman, I was captivated by the adventures encounted by the party in the wilderness, all documented with great detail and passion by the author. I have traveled through the rugged rocky mountains, armed with the most sophisticated technology of the 21st century. Even now, it is no easy endeavor. However, this party of soldiers made their way up the rockies, navigating by compass and sextant, hunting with muzzleloader, camping without shelter, and sewing clothing from buffalo hides. Lewis was in his late 20's, the same age as I am now, and he was co-captain to a group of 30 or so army privates, and navigator in a wilderness that no white man had ever been in before. These feats alone are truly amazing!In addition, the author makes sure to mention the importance of Sacajawea during the trip. The majority of the party was made up of young adult men: American soldiers trained in hunting and survival. However, in the group was this teenage Indian girl, who spoke no English whatsoever, and had her baby with her the entire journey! How did she feel to have traveled for two years with this expedition?I strongly recommend this book to readers who have a thirst for history of early United States, and also for those who have a keen interest in wilderness exploration and survival. Many of the hunting and survival skills practiced by Lewis's hired hunter, George Drouillard, can still be applied by today's big game hunter and survivalist.This amazing book has turned me onto further reading about the politics of Jefferson and James Madison, and how the \\"original Republican party\\" was meant to shape this country's future. I look forward to learning more."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I loved it because of the wilderness aspect to it,also the inside look at Thomas Jefferson that you'd never find maybe in a straight bio.It was a great look that we can get at america and its frontiersmen and imagine our own forebears no farther back than maybe our great great grandfathers."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Brings life to the Lewis and Clark history lessons we learned in school.

After reading the mandatory introduction, you will immediately be brought back in history to another time. Join Stephen Ambrose as he takes you on a journey of filled with friendship and murder, peace and politics, and study and wonder.Ambrose takes an approach rarely seen in historical examinations of this sort. He wonders aloud. &quot;What must they have said that night...&quot;, &quot;...wouldn't it have been wonderful to be there with them...&quot;, &quot;what must have he thought as he looked up to the stars&quot;.

I was struck by the incredible challenges faced by these explorers, and the ease and speed of my journey, both to accomplish the same thing, travel from Washington to the Pacific Ocean and back again.The hardships encountered by the Lewis &amp; Clark party, and the commitment needed to complete the journey are nothing less than amazing, and truly inspirational."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"This is a terrific book for both entertainment and historical study.

The intricate details that Stephen Ambrose weaves into this book make you feel like you are in the story, tracking across the West right along with Lewis and Clark. I found it interesting how Ambrose started the book with the history behind Lewis as he was growing up, and how he got into the trip. I also liked how Jefferson was brought into the story as well. What these men went through was amazing. The hardships they went through and the things they saw are incredible. It is hard to think of someone doing something like this in today's day.

Stephen E. Ambrose does an exceptional job of making you feel as though you are along on the expedition with Lewis and Clark. Intimacy and detail are merged with adventure and suspense to craft an incredible sense of &quot;being there&quot;. After reading this book I developed a keen interest in the Native American tribes that he encountered, which led to an avid interest in Native American history in general. That journey has been extraordinary, and it is the mark of superb teacher (ultimately that is what Ambrose is) that he or she opens doorways to further knowledge."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I fell asleep twice trying to watch Ken Burns' &quot;Lewis and Clark&quot; on PBS. Conversely, I stayed up way too long at night turning pages of Ambrose's book - simply because I couldn't put it down. This is history the way it should be written - an important subject brought graphically to life in a form that is interesting, understandable, and entertaining. As for Ken Burns' video - I decided to travel the trail and see what it looks like for myself. Not thanks to Burns, but thanks to Ambrose."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I suppose I have never given proper credit to Lewis and Clark, or Thomas Jefferson, for the expansion of our country. I always looked at the whole event as just a back packing trip that we learned about in elementary school. Jefferson had a plan for the U.S., and it was to be that we would set our own course, not follow in another's path. In order not to follow in Europe's footsteps, the people had to band together and unite a continent as one strong nation. Ambrose did a brilliant job placing the reader right into the adventure. Reading this book reminded me of the frolicsome feeling that I got when I was a young boy reading Huck Finn. Each page filled my imagination and left me wondering how the next chapter would end."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I got a sense that what Ambrose describes in his book really happened-not just someone's interpretation of what happened in 1803-1809.

The only people who would not enjoy this book are those who can't read."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I am a junior in high school and we were required to read this for our summer reading. The first five or six chapters were such a listing of facts that I seriously struggled to get through it. At that point, I barely even wanted to continue. Every moment of Meriwether's existence was pointed out to me, much more than I needed or wanted to know. It didn't have any flow to it, but it did get better once they got on their way. That part of the book was much better and more enjoyable, making history, which I find to be boring, almost fascinating and seemed easier to understand than something in a textbook. But other than the fact I had to read this book, I don't understand who would read this for fun."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I liked the book. It was engrossing at times, a little slow at other points but very much worth reading. One question kept haunting me throughout the book; &quot;was Lewis homosexual?&quot;. Very little was mentioned about his sexual desires. My reasons are these: He did not partake the pleasures of any of the Indian women (and he was away a long time). He often entered into close male relationships but none female. One woman got away but he didn't seem to put up much of a fight. The author seemed to skirt around the issue and made a few casual references to women, but I felt like it was forced. Lewis went from being a near perfect person throughout the book until the end where he couldn't do anything right. Either the author had an overly inflated view of Lewis or maybe Lewis had some demons to wrestle with upon his return."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I feel like maybe I missed something, given all the hype that surrounded this book. But I found that it didn't seem to add much to the subject matter: it seemed like a rather weak summary of the explorers journals. I keep feeling like I would have been better reading the primary source material or a different survey of that material. I like Ambrose's other works and am a avid history reader, but this one really feel short. The subject matter may simply not as suited to Ambrose's style. Someone like Robert Kaplan (Balkan Ghosts), Rebecca West (Black Lamb and Grey Falcon) or William Dalrymple (From the Holy Mountain) would have done a much better job of weaving in what Lewis and Clark were seeing and experiencing within the context of their times and pulled in additional material to illuminate the subject matter."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Justifiably a number one bestseller, Undaunted Courage is a great (and ultimately tragic) personal story of Meriwether Lewis. The remarkable compilation of details by Ambrose brings to life a period and an epic adventure. Worthwhile alone as an unparallel introduction to the saga of the American West and Jefferson's role in making America an Empire of liberty. I found t his book so useful and so thought provoking that I hesitate to start in lest I quote a third of the book. Nonetheless, some observations should whet the appetite of anyone interested in the creation of modern America.Native Americans played a decisive role in making the expedition possible. Without the help of Indians, and in particular the intervention of several women, the Lewis and Clark could not have survived the trip, they would not have lasted the two winters (both in camps being fed by Indians). They could not have found the trail across the Bitter Root Mountains between the two great water systems of the Missouri and the Columbia and they would have had no horses with which to carry their goods between the rivers. In short the expedition would have failed the first year if it had truly been going into an uninhabited wilderness.Second, Jefferson was consistently driving America westward and was willing to manipulate and lie to do it. Modern liberals revere Jefferson as the most literary and intellectual of the Founding Fathers. Modern conservatives revere him as the advocate of limited government and limited taxation. Yet it was Jefferson who bought half a continent, misled the Congress about the purpose of the expedition to explore it and sent the Navy and the Marines to North Africa (from the shores of Tripoli was Jefferson's war) without Congressional authorization. He was a strong independent President with unlimited ambitions but a philosophy of limits that he simply ignored whenever it came into conflict with his goals of a vast America.Finally, Republicans should note the cost to Federalists of rejecting the westward movement of America (Federalists opposed the purchase of Louisiana, opposed sending Lewis and Clark west and generally communicated to most Americans that they stood for an east coast tiny America). The country and the future rejected the Federalists and they ceased to exist as a party. Republicans are in no danger of ceasing to exist but their response to the tide of immigration is as vital and ultimately defining as the Federalists response to the West. Had Federalists embraced the West they would have remained a competitive party. If Republicans embrace the tide of new Americans they will be a new majority.This is a book worth reading and thinking about. Ambrose is clearly one of our finest historians."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Most times I read a book, but there are certain projects I do that allow me to have an audio version playing.

His further innovation was to see new territories, not as colonies subject to the federal government, but as states in every way equal to the original thirteen. Indians were considered by our third president as fully capable of citizenry, once educated. Strangely, he never credited slaves in the same way, even though Jefferson realized that slave-holding dehumanized owners and set this country on a disaster course.So much did Jefferson want a continental nation that he fostered several failed explorations of the western territories, both by philanthropic subscription as well as by government commission. One expedition was recalled when the government discovered its leader was a French spy. Eventually, the Lewis and Clark expedition achieved Jefferson's desire to map the northwest territory and spur commercial development.Jefferson's eager and sweeping vision of America is described in Undaunted Courage, the recent history by Stephen Ambrose of the Lewis and Clark trek which followed the US purchase of the Louisiana territory from Napoleon. Jefferson was a member of the Lewis and Clark troop all but literally. He hand-picked Merriweather Lewis as commander, seeing in his fellow Virginian and former army paymaster a practical, meticulous, loyal, and educated leader of men. Lewis lived with Jefferson in the White House for two years as his secretary and aide, all the while receiving Jefferson's humanist tutelage in everything from science and politics to philosophy and Indian affairs. He even sent Lewis to study with the young nation's foremost botanist in Philadelphia to prepare for the trip.Captain Lewis picked his good friend Lieutenant William Clark to co-lead the expedition which included a 15-year old Sacegewea, baby on her back, as they journeyed across some of the wildest and most dangerous territory in an exploratory feat worthy of Christopher Columbus or Francis Drake. Along the way, Lewis made celestial observations; sent Indian chiefs to Washington, DC, to meet the President; transcribed the vocabulary of Native American nations; made the first maps of rivers, plains, and mountains; recorded many new-to-science species of animals and plants in meticulous descriptions and drawings; and sought to displace the British and French traders who had already established trading relations with tribes in the area. He delivered Sacegewea's baby; treated his men with mercury for their syphilis and for other ills with pills from Dr. Benjamin Rush (a signer of the Declaration of Independence); he barely escaped with his life from a grizzly; ordered his men flogged (after trial) for desertion and other misdeeds; built boats and forts; traversed rapids and mountains; and survived a fight with young Blackfoot warriors, killing several in the battle and escaping pursuit by riding almost non-stop for two days. He described vast panoramas, seeing buffalo as far as the eye could see; observing huge herds of elk, many beaver, and thousands of migrating squirrels; and writing of skies darkened by thousands of birds. Lewis' journals are filled with quaint and variable spellings and with acute observations. It was not uncommon for him to use hundreds of words in describing a single bird or the design and construction of Native American canoes. Lewis was feted in towns and cities on his triumphant return to DC where he spent many hours with Jefferson (one evening in the White House was spent on all fours as he and Jefferson together examined his maps of the heretofore uncharted territory). Jefferson received from Lewis plant and animal specimens, Native American artifacts, and even live animals.The most important mission of the journey was to record and publish the journals, opening the way for American commerce to displace European traders. The Lewis and Clark expedition stimulated the commerce all right, but Lewis never finished the task of publishing. He accepted Jefferson's appointment as Governor of Louisiana, but dawdled over a year before going to St. Louis to fill the post. He avoided editing his journals, dragging them around with him on his travels. He courted several women unsuccessfully and bemoaned his misfortune in letters to Clark. He drank heavily. Because of his failure to publish, Lewis' journals did not appear for decades, long after other travelers had given their own names to the many rivers and landmarks first mapped and named by Lewis and Clark. As a result, the true success of the Lewis and Clark expedition was not appreciated until late in 19th Century.As Governor, Lewis engaged in land speculation and tried to make his fortune by investing in one of the many fur trading companies then formed. He made political enemies and, when a bureaucrat in President Madison's administration called him to account for spending thousands of dollars of government funds, Lewis feared personal bankruptcy. He set out from St. Louis to DC to justify himself. After traveling down the Mississippi River, he took an overland route to avoid New Orleans, fearing a British attack in the years before the War of 1812. Enroute he was depressed (apparently a lifelong condition), and one gruesome night, Merriweather Lewis shot himself -- twice -- in a bungled, though eventually successful, suicide. He was yet in his thirties.Undaunted Courage is a fascinating look at America when she was young and at America's storybook heroes as they really were. America and its heroes remain impressive, warts and all.###"},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Interesting book.

I just finished it now. It is, quite simply, the most uneven book I have read.As so many others have noted, the first hundred-plus pages are bogged down in excessive detail of Meriweather Lewis's preparations for his exploration. They are a chore to read and caused me to put the book down for 15 years. I started anew two weeks ago, as its story is once again relevant to my reading interests (early American history). But even from that new angle those pages are slow going. Further, the aspects of preparation recounted seem arbitrary; many apparently were included simply because the author had them. If anything, this portion of the book should have been condensed into a third of its current length, with the remainder collected in an appendix providing detail on \\"Preparations\\". This portion of the book merits one star.My recommendation for readers is to limit the amount of time you spend on these pages, and read/skim with all deliberate speed to chapter 8 (\\"Down the Ohio\\"). It is here that the adventure begins, and Ambrose's retelling (aided by very good maps) is more than satisfactory. Somewhat surprising is the extent to which he relies on other secondary authorities - he often does not tell us what Lewis and Clark did but instead tells us what Donald Jackson and others said they did. This is odd for an historian of Ambose's experience (and reputation -- the book was published before his scandals broke).However, there are interesting insights sprinkled throughout this portion of the book (for example, the analysis undertaken to determine which branch of a river comes from the mountains and which from the northern plains; also, a reason for why the plains are tree-less (Ambrose credits Indian burning of the ground cover as preventing the growth of trees)). Scandals aside, his approach causes one to wonder whether these insights are his or are conventional wisdom among Lewis and Clark scholars. If they are his, then it is a shame that he did not use this independent approach throughout the book. Nevertheless, the story is a classic, and even though Ambrose could have told it better, it still tells well. I give this portion of the book four stars.In the last 50 pages the book again becomes bogged down in overdeveloped facts, here regarding Lewis's life after his return. A reasonable treatment of this could have been handled in 10 pages or less: After returning to the pre-Louisiana Purchase portion of the United States, Lewis was feted but when the cheering quieted he is adrift and then depressed. Thereafter, he accomplished next to nothing and had difficulty beginning productive activities. As a result, many lost patience with him, including his benefactor Thomas Jefferson. Here, again, I recommend a skim-and-move on reading style. This portion of the book merits one star."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Just like the great Lewis and Clark expedition, this book gets off to a slow start, but don't give up on it. It takes a while to lay the groundwork for this great true adventure in American history. And, being essentially a biography of Meriwether Lewis, it ends on the sad note of Lewis's suicide, leaving the reader melancholy at the sad ending of perhaps our greatest explorer. But what lies in between the start and the finish is a tremendous work of one of the great true adventure stories that has ever occurred.The first one hundred pages are somewhat dry and tedious, but the reader finds a new found respect for the attention to detail that went into the planning and preparation for this expedition. American schools teach very little of this great event and Ambrose superbly picks up where our history classes leave off.The reader learns that Lewis was, in effect, a jack of all trades when it comes to being an explorer. In addition to his already polished skills as an outdoorsman, Lewis readied himself by learning medical techniques, how to properly record animals, birds and fish, as well as flora and fauna, mapping, astronomy, mineralogy, and virtually every other necessary knowledge or skill that would be helpful in making the expedition a success.I don't want to give away too much of the book, so suffice it to say, once the expedition begins, Ambrose puts the reader right there with the Corps of Discovery at every turn. The descriptions of plants, animals, Indians and mishaps along the way are near perfection. If you have ever traveled the route, you will see in your mind, exactly what Lewis and Clark must have been seeing for the very first time.Ambrose has put together a true classic for every lover of American history. True life adventure is told here, only as can be told by one of Ambrose' reputation for interjecting suspense into true life events. You will not want to put down this book."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Undaunted Courage is a wonderful piece of literature. Both as a look at the history of our country and as an entertaining comparison between life now and then.Ambrose does a great job of foretelling the expedition with reasons for the trek across the continent and back. By providing background about the British, French and Spanish nation's motives for occupying the West, we get a good idea why this expedition was necessary. Along with other nation's motives, we are provided a good deal of information on Jefferson's own reasons for the expedition. Can you imagine how history would've changed had we not acquired the Louisiana Territory? Perhaps a battle on two fronts during the War of 1812? Being reacquired by the British? This book will make you delve further into the beginnings of our country at the least.If you are the outdoors type and enjoy camping, then you will have another great reason to read this book, as it does a great job of going into detail about the logistics of such an expedition. Food, shelter, clothing and Indian War Parties are all covered. Also, you will happen across all of the great Indian tribes along the trail and learn a little about each.At the end of the book, you will be amazed at how communication was accomplished on a daily basis between Lewis and the government in Washington. In addition, how business was conducted along the Missouri River would be a scandalis affair in present times. A real eye opener.I reccomend this book to all audiences."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Stephen Ambrose has skillfully reduced to 475 pages one of the great sagas of American history - the exploration of the U.S. northwest by Meriwether Lewis, William Clark and their Corps of Discovery. It had long been Thomas Jefferson's dream to obtain some definitive information about this territory and in Lewis he found the right man for the job. For some 18 months Lewis trained and planned for this expedition like a boxer for a fight. With Jefferson and university professors Lewis studied intensely - botany, zoology, celestial navigation, geography, medicine, and more - because Jefferson wanted to know everything about this area - about its geography, flora, fauna, rivers, mountains, climate, soils, birds, fish, animals, and about the people living there - their food, weapons, dress, customs, medicines, languages - everything.So Lewis prepared himself mentally and at the same time (eventually with Clark's assistance) he compiled lists of the supplies that would be required and identified the skills that the participants would have to possess to survive. He concluded that they'd have to be single, tough, strong, disciplined, and would have to include expert boatsmen, hunters, fishermen, woodsmen, carpenters, blacksmiths, gunsmiths - and interpreters with a knowledge of the indians, their languages, and sign language.Lewis began his preparations for this major undertaking in 1801 while living in the East Room of the White House and serving as Jefferson's personal secretary and confidant. By March 1804 Lewis had formed his Corps of Discovery and had it positioned and ready for departure up the Mississippi River. Lewis described in his journal that 'departure day' was the 'greatest day of his life' - and why not!? He was about to embark on one of the greatest exploratory journeys in the history of man. The journey would involve traversing some 8,000 miles up and down unmapped rivers, across prairies, over the Rockies twice, and confrontations with bears and some 50 different indian tribes and nations - some hostile. Their boats would have to be sailed, rowed, poled or pulled, and when they had to finally be abandoned in the mountains the corps would have to find indians willing to trade with them for horses. Not infrequently they would have to rely on the indians for food, as well, since over the course of the 2 years and 5 months that they were gone the 33-man corps was often on the verge of starvation.Lewis' job was to keep the corps together, healthy, disciplined, with good morale, and functioning, while he, personally, was observing, collecting, and recording in his journals all that information he knew Jefferson wanted. Most historians think Lewis did a good job, but he did have to confront many hardships and obstacles enroute, and in the end he was unable to complete one of the most important tasks that had been set before him - he failed to publish the journals that he'd compiled on the expedition. This failure cost him personally in terms of fame and fortune, and it deprived mankind in general, since the accounts of the expedition that were finally published by others lacked the personal insights, observations, and judgements that only Lewis, himself, could have provided.Ambrose has written an exciting book about 19th century history, heroes, and adventures - without, however, any Hollywood endings. Hollywood endings, we know, were invented in the 20th century!"},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"The great philosopher Brand Blanshard once recommended reading biography and history rather than fiction because the things that have happened and that individuals have done are as great and fascinating as anything a novelist could imagine. In this great book, Stephen Ambrose writes history that reads like fiction. The book is detailed, structured superbly, has psychological insights into Lewis, Clark and others; in short, everything you'd want from a good novel. I have read so many history books that are such dry, monotonous chronicles of fact but not here. Ambrose makes history come alive and I believe that an argument could be made that this is the way history should always be written: with passion, excitement and life, as well as detailed historical information backed by tremendous research.Adding to the enjoyment of this book is Ambrose's deep knowledge of the American context at the time. He delves into Jefferson, into Washington politics and has various insights into the America of the time. We have a portrait of St. Louis at the end of the book, when Lewis was governor of the Louisiana territory. Also, the quotes from Lewis about the various indian tribes, mountains and rivers is superb.A superb effort that could only be written by someone with a truly authentic interest and love for his subject.Greg Feirman (gfire77@yahoo.com)"},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"UNDAUNTED COURAGE is the type of history book one wants to find, if one is uncertain why history is important. Readable, exciting, sometimes emotionally-draining, informative, and erudite, it is history for people who wonder what history books have to offer.First of all, a reason to go rafting in the American Northwest. The journals, used as primary source material, reveal the pristine American wilderness as it will never be again, but the narrative is enough to want one to explore for oneself all the places mentioned.Second, the narrative immerses the reader in its times. Not only the journals, but the letters highlight an emphasis on health and injury, class backgrounds, education, language, and practical matters, like careers and marriage. There are discussions of international relations, featuring Jefferson's plans, involving Britain, Canada, and Asian trade, for the expedition. The expedition crew is also given their say, and their concerns and behavior are revealing. And, the scientific angle is fascinating; new boat technologies, biological classifications, anthropology, geography.Third, there is the debunking, particularly of the Sacajawea myth and her role in the expedition.This book is a great service to scholarship and readers."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"If you have ever read through reproductions of the actual journals of Lewis &amp; Clark, you may have stumbled along with the style of the authors' writing skills.

The book is as much a detailed biography of a remarkable journey, including its genesis, as it is a biography of Lewis the young leader. It is a dense read and requires many sittings. The reader often wonders, as L&amp;C must have, what new adventure lays around each bend of a river or encounter with Indians.One also becomes acutely aware of the roles of pure luck and good leadership in any undertaking this grand.Many reviewers express a preference for a 10,000 foot view of the topic.

I found the text beautifully written and appreciated the great lengths the author went to in order to report the events of the expedition honestly and accurately. Ambrose does an amazing job of recognizing and answering questions that lay people might think of in contemplating what America was like in the 1800s. The extraordinary effort and planning required to make a journey into the unknown wilderness, across the continent is completely dissected and wonderfully revealed in this extremely readable book.Strangely, considering the subject matter, this book is truly rivetting and every page is filled with excitement!

I strongly recommend it to everyone and anyone!"},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Ambrose actually followed the trail of Lewis and Clark in doing the research for this book. Even today, with 4 wheel drive vehicles, parts of the trail cannot be traversed, other than the way Lewis and Clark did it. Even today, it is still and epic journey. Much of the trail is still wilderness.The book describes Lewis from his childhood to his death by suicide. Jefferson was a neighbor. They became close friends when Jefferson hired him as his Secretary when he was President, and both lived in the White House together.Jefferson had tried to get a cross country exploration going in 1792, when he was Sec of State, and Lewis had volunteered then.Ambrose goes into much detail in the organization of the expedition. Lewis and Clark had known each other years before in the military, and were fast friends then.The trip had been organized prior to the Louisiana purchase, and with the purchase of Louisiana, (Jefferson had wanted to purchase New Orleans, instead got half a continent), the need for knowing what was out there was more critical.Many misconceptions abounded. Jefferson and others thought that prehistoric animals lived there, that there was a water route to the Pacific Ocean, that much of what is now Canada was part ot what we bought. They did not know how large the country was, expecting to complete the trip in a few months. It took over 2 years.Lewis's schedule was held up by a drunk boatbuilder.Only one man died during the entire trip. They had many troubles with Indians. Grizzly bears were a real problem.Sacagawea was critical to their success. She was a 15 year old wife of a Frenchman they hired. She had a child during the trip, and her life was saved by \\"Dr. Lewis\\" when she was sick. Turns out she was the brother of the Shoshone chief from whom they got their horses, vital to completion of the trip.Ambrose is critical of the splitting of the party on the return trip.John Colter, one of the men, left the party on the way back, and joined another party going upstream, and became the first mountain man. He is famous for discovering what is now Yellowstone National Park.Lewis became Governor of the Louisiana Territory when he got back. Clark became Sec of Indian affairs of the Lousisana Territory and was a general.Lewis never did publish his journals or all his documentation of the plants and animals he discovered and documented.Instead, others got the credit when they found and documented them. Lewis would have been on a level with Darwin, had he not committed suicide.Ambrose weaves a story that one does not want to put down."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"This book is the most exciting piece of non fiction I've ever read. Ambrose makes the reader feel as though they are right there with the expedition as they battle disease, starvation, treacherous whitewater, hostile indians and the environment itself as they struggle to cross the unexplored interior of the United States. The Lewis &amp; Clark expedition I learned about in school was seriously lacking in excitement when compared to this chronicle.The beginning of the book is somewhat tedious as Ambrose spends what seems like far too many pages listing off the various supplies obtained and preparations made for the voyage. Once the expedition begins, however, the book is hard to put down.The extensive use of the actual diaries of the expedition members lends a vibrance to the descriptions of the various tribes of Indians, wildlife, and natural obstacles encountered. The diaries also offer a glimpse into the personalities of these famous figures and their crew. The holes left by the diaries and other historical documents are deftly filled in by Ambrose. He further colors the characters, settings, and situations with well grounded inference.Additionally, the author's detailed treatment of the political situation in the United States at the time places this journey in great historic and political perspective.Highly recomended!"},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"&quot;Undaunted Courage&quot; is a wonderful journey through the past. It is detail and detail, mixed with adventure and adventure, with a pinch of suspense added in to create the feeling that you are there. The book has led me to a keen interest in Thomas Jefferson and his many little known but great contributions to America, which in turn led me to another journey through the past involving Thomas Jefferson in the book &quot;West Point&quot; by Norman Remick. Like &quot;Undaunted Courage&quot;, &quot;West Point&quot; is another monumental feat of research. I have to thank Mr. Ambrose for writing like the good and interesting teacher who stimulates the student and opens the doorways to further knowledge."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"For a fascinating and informative journey through American lore and history, Stephen Ambrose's &quot;Undaunted Courage&quot; is a great choice. It's a story of daunting physical and mental courage, and, the beginning of how the West was won. I feel I would also like to add my name to those other reviewers who recommend also reading Norman Thomas Remick's &quot;West Point: Character Leadership Education, A Book Developed From Thomas Jefferson's Readings And Writings&quot; which is less about West Point and more the epic of America's historical and philosophical genesis."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"&quot;Undaunted Courage&quot; is historian Stephen E. Ambrose's masterfully told and compelling account of The Lewis and Clark expedition, one of the most historically significant journeys of exploration in American history.Relying extensively on the Journals of Lewis and Clark, Ambrose has put together a highly entertaining, meticulously researched, wonderfully readable, and fast paced narrative that interweaves a fascinating biography of Meriwether Lewis with a spellbinding account of the Lewis and Clark expedition.Ambrose captures completely with his fast-paced narrative the key events of the Lewis and Clark expedition. With a keen eye for detail, he describes the formation of the Corps of Discovery; its ascent to the headwaters of the Missouri River and its many encounters with native tribes along the way; the crossing of the &quot;Great Portage,&quot; the Continental Divide, and the Rocky Nountains; and its encampment in November 1805 on the shores of the Pacific Ocean, at the mouth of the Columbia River. Also described is the expedition's return voyage, when the expedition once again searched in vain for a water route to the Pacific, and also when the expedition had its one and only hostile engagement with natives. Finally, Ambrose describes the aftermath of the expedition - how the Journals of Lewis and Clark came to be published, and the divergent (and, for Lewis, ultimately tragic) careers of these two great explorers.I found Ambrose's portraits of the key players in this real-life drama to be superb! Lewis is a born naturalist with a keen eye for scientific observation. He's also a gifted leader of men, ever conscious of his subordinates' welfare, and always gaining from them loyalty that is complete and willingly given. Clark, the &quot;co-captain&quot; (in reality the second in command), is a less gifted scientist, but equal to Lewis in leadership ability, and in many ways a more talented explorer and map maker. Jefferson, perhaps America's greatest genius of the Age of Enlightenment, is the man possessed with the vision to see that the voyage is undertaken. Sacagawea, the teenage Shoshone girl, kidnapped from her tribe, sold to Canadian traders, and the mother of a newborn son, is possessed with remarkable stoicism and diplomatic skills which become essential to the Corps of Discovery's survival. In addition, Ambrose proves himself to be a first-rate nature writer himself, with his breathtaking descriptions of the flora, fauna, and physical beauty of the American Great Plains, Rocky Mountains, and Pacific Northwest.&quot;Undaunted Courage&quot; is America's great adventure story, told by one of this nation's foremost contemporary historians and biographers. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Ambrose chose a huge sprawling subject and wrote a medium size book that does not sprawl at all. In order to accomplish this he had to write in an almost telegraphic style. This book is largely descriptive with frequent, but brief interpretive asides.Ambrose's admiration for Meriwether Lewis is great, but he is not remiss in pointing out when the brave captain was rash and showed bad judgement. One ominous theme that Ambrose keeps returning to is the mental illness that ran in Lewis's family. He is careful never to explicitly label an act of rashness as an &quot;episode&quot;, but he implies it.Anyone fascinated by native American cultures should read this book. It offers a tantalizing look at several tribes either at or immediately following &quot;contact&quot;. If you know anything about the later history of the tribes of the Upper Missouri and Pacific Northwest, this book just drips with tragedy and none of it is spelled out in a silly melodramatic way; Ambrose's restraint makes the impact that much greater.One thing that I found jarring about the writing in this book was Ambrose's irregular tendency to insert sentences in vernacular rather than standard written English. Lewis and Clark and their expedition are occasionally referred to as &quot;guys&quot; and what they are carrying is called &quot;stuff&quot;. This sort of casual voice seemed out of place to me and broke the mood of the narrative.If you don't expect history books to be particularly literary, but just to tell a good story, then you'll think this is a terrific book. If you are looking for a meditation on the ramifications of the L&amp;C expedition with regard to the settling of the American West, then this book is a little sparse on analysis, although it is good about reporting salient information. Having read it, I guess I feel prepared to read more in-depth account about smaller segments of this story."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I agree with the prior reviewer Norman Remick who is the author of &quot;West Point&quot; (I looked him up), another book about Thomas Jefferson and Something, who said that Stephen Ambrose is the best &quot;historical non-fiction novelist&quot;. It's a whole new category of novel based on historical facts, not on ones own imagination. Ambrose is a master at it."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"For an interesting and informative journey through an important piece of American history, I recommend &quot;Undaunted Courage&quot; by Stephen E. Ambrose. It's a portrait of physical courage. I also recommend &quot;West Point: ... Thomas Jefferson&quot; by Norman Thomas Remick for an interesting and educational journey through history that becomes the epic of the USA. It's a portrait of mental courage."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Ambrose's books are all excellent. Well written and expertly documented. This one is no exception. He traces the steps of Meriwether Lewis and William Clark on their famous journey across the wild America continent in the early 1800's. Much of his narrative is based on Lewis &amp; Clark's own journals, but the story is told in Ambrose's indomitable style that will keep you turning the pages to the finish. You will get some special insight into the relationship between President Thomas Jefferson and Lewis and how that effected the outcome of history. The book is highly entertaining and interesting to read. Ambrose is by far on the best historical writers alive today and his work should be required reading in every classroom. As for his supposed pro-America bias, some readers claim to detect, I don't understand how that detracts from his work. That he admires the men and women, who fought for and founded our country and shows them in a fair &amp; proper perspective, makes his accounts more creditable, not less. Read the book! It's Great."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"This is a fresh, new story of the Lewis and Clark Expedition which brought about major expansion of U.S. land and population. A thorough researcher, author Stephen Ambrose provides new insights into the character and motivation of those who conceived the Expedition and those who carried it out. Undaunted Courage is written in day-by-day \\"you are there\\" language... you feel the excitement, danger, brutal hardship and triumphs that this courageous band of thirty experienced during the two-year period of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, May 1804 to September, 1806.You experience fully these profound events in our history because writer Ambrose is particularly skillful at presenting vivid word pictures of our country at the time Jefferson became president, March 4, 1801. The U. S. Population was over five-million. Our smaller boundaries ranged from the Atlantic to the Mississippi, the Great Lakes and the Gulf Most people lived within fifty miles of water: the interior was a vast, unexplored wilderness.Nothing, in those days, moved faster than a horse, and as far as anybody knew, nothing ever would. That's why Jefferson promoted finding a water route to the Pacific. It took six weeks to move information overland from the Mississippi River to Washington D.C. Sixty years later, when Lincoln took office, information moved almost instantly by telegraph.New research brought to light in this best seller reaffirms the towering stature of the leading players, Thomas Jefferson, Lewis and Clark. Throughout the book, one becomes increasingly aware of the extraordinarily high degree of energy, intelligence, intuitive judgement and sheer physical prowess of these historical figures, particularly Thomas Jefferson, who stands out as a brilliant thinker-and-doer in the development and growth of this country, yet not without his own quixotic, very human foibles.For anyone with a genuine interest on how America came to be, this is surely a must-read book."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I took the advice of that author, Norman Thomas Remick, who wrote that sterling review of this book and, generally, complimented Stephen Ambrose as being the best. He is right. This book was great, and Ambrose probably **was** the best. I also went on to read Remick's book, &quot;West Point..Thomas Jefferson&quot; which is factually drawn from Jefferson's own readings and writings. It's important enough that everyone should read it. A real sleeper. What a shame it doesn't get more of a push."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"This is a well-researched and highly readable overview of the Lewis and Clark expedition. Ambrose deserves credit for taking such a daunting historical event and condensing it into a single volume. While the first part of the book perhaps goes a little overboard in describing the preparations and the role that Jefferson played, once the voyage sets off there's no looking back. The encounters with the Indians are fascinating. The reader really feels like he's along for the ride as the expedition makes its way towards the Pacific Ocean. With our roads and skies now filled with countless vehicles and airplanes, it's easy to forget just how massive the continent appeared to its occupants in the early 19th century. Ambrose does a good job of presenting the enormity of the task that these early explorers took on. Lewis and Clark tackled the continent's unknown dangers with gusto, and Ambrose has given us the opportunity to come along for the ride. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"This remarkable book fully captures the adventure of the 1804-06 Lewis & Clark Expedition. Author Stephen Ambrose makes readers feel like they are riding in a canoe up the Missouri River as a member of the expedition - encountering buffalo, Indians, and who knows what else? The author begins with a brief biography of Meriwether Lewis (secretary to President Jefferson) before describing the expedition's lengthy preparations, enlistment of crew members, and eagerness for discovery - plus hopes for political success with various Native American tribes. Then it's up the Missouri river from the then-tiny village of St. Louis, on a journey that would last two years (a year more than expected). After winter camp in North Dakota, the expedition crosses the Rocky Mountains with vital help from Sacagawea plus helpful Shoeshone and Nez Perce tribesmen. Then, after a second winter along the Oregon Coast, the expedition heads back, once again facing hardship, challenges, and danger. Finally, we read of their triumphant return and the expedition's aftermath.Historian Stephen Ambrose (1936-2002) employs readable eyewitness history drawn from journals and diaries of expedition members. The result is an easy and exciting read, with elements of navigation, politics, scientific discovery, and most importantly, a lovely sense of being there. Ambrose might have given a bit more attention to Rogers Clark and other key explorers, but we get a nicely balanced look - including critiques of Lewis' occasional and potentially fatal lapses in judgement. Not a perfect book, perhaps, but a superly readable adventure."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"1. I'm into American history, nonfiction etc... but I was expecting to have to \\"wade\\" through this book. But... it ended up being one of the most inspirational, exciting, easy to read nonfiction/ historical books I've ever read in my life.2. I learned new things and more importantly gained an new found admiration for those who came before us, in this great country of ours. Highly recommended, a true masterpiece by S. Ambrose."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Lewis and Clark, their expedition and its remarkable accomplishments are the stuff of legend in American history. Our literature is littered with remarkably good works by some of the most accomplished historians and from the start I must admit to being a huge Lewis and Clark fan. It is not just the romance of their accomplishment, nor the myriad of hardships incurred, but the sheer magnitude, length and focus of their exploration that captivates. For this to have succeeded as it did, all the stars in the heavens had to have been in alignment.Just possibly the most audacious member of this group was Thomas Jefferson himself. Jefferson was a most amazing enigma, a truly top shelf schemer. The more you learn about him, the more you want to know. He had determined early on that whoever controlled New Orleans was America's natural enemy. So what does this self proclaimed pacifist, this hater of confrontation do? He sets a course for the United States that amounts to a secretly financed invasion by the United States Army, the largest and best armed incursion by any nation, directly into Spain's globally recognized, sovereign, North American territory. Fate saves him though. On the continually revolving European chessboard, Louisiana reverts to France who then sells it to the United States. Amazingly, the acquisition is publically announced the day Meriwether Lewis starts his journey, but make no mistake, this armed invasion was going forward regardless of who owned the territory. Looking back with the benefit of hindsight, ya just gotta love Jefferson! What audacity; what plans for his country; what vision!Lewis and Clark's actual three year journey to the Pacific and back has been told many times. My personal favorite is The Way to the Western Sea by David Lavender. So after reading this, if you want more, go there. This book by Steven Ambrose is a wonderful addition to the expedition's legacy. Rather than writing a history, Ambrose writes a biography of Lewis. This approach enables him to inject his personal experiences of having traveled major portions of Lewis and Clark's exact journey. For the first time, through Ambrose, we really see what Lewis and Clark actually saw. Ambrose canoed what they canoed, trekked what they trekked and crossed the passes they crossed. The result is a marvelous flavor enhancer, materially stepping up the reader's experience. As Ambrose states in his introduction he had been obsessed with Lewis and Clark for over 20 years. Thank goodness because he instills a new vigor and, through his trail experiences, a personal intimacy, into this remarkable American accomplishment.That our nation was only 27 years old when this transcontinental effort that risked war with two powerful European nations was undertaken, takes one's breath away. The adjective \\"audacious\\" just keeps coming to mind. The term Manifest Destiny was coined in the late 1840s or early 1850s. But the concept was given life by Jefferson and legs by Lewis and Clark almost 50 years earlier. Steven Ambrose's version of these events is a story of vision yes, but it is also a story of the Corps of Discovery, of privation, courage, starvation, unrelenting toil, determination, fortitude and brotherhood. These men literally disappeared into the wilderness for years, traveling a route across the continental United States which no white person and only a few Native Americans had ever traversed.One cannot praise the Corps' accomplishments, or Mr. Ambrose's version of their journey, too highly. This is a remarkably good story, excellently told, that will envelop you."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Of all the Lewis & Clark accounts I've read, this is certainly the most enjoyable and readable one I have come across. The author has done a very fine job of research on this one. it is well foot noted and he supplies us with plenty of source documents. I do suppose you coud learn much more by going directly to the Lewis journals themselves, but the time and cost of doing so is quite beyond someone like myself. I must admit here to being an Ambrose fan, therefore do enjoy his style of writing. I do agree with a recent reviewer here, that is is probably not one the best works this author has turned out, but in this case, I personally do not care. He was able to give me information on the L&C adventure and that is what I wanted. The book does have the usual Abrose touch, i.e. his ability to make history come alive and even those not particularly bent toward reading \\"histories\\" will probably find this an enjoyable and informative read. I recommend this one highly."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"My knowledge of Lewis & Clark's \`Expedition of Discovery' before reading this was reduced to two factoids---Sacajawea with papoose-strapped-to-back diving into a freezing river to save Lewis' journals; and the Expedition confirmed there was no 'Northwest Passage' to the Orient. Stephen Ambrose has done a fine job in synthesizing the historical sources and fleshing the saga out into a more human story.The details of Ambrose's account are startling. I had no idea how much provisions and equipment Lewis brought with them. Wait til you read which items they ran out of first and what was left at the end.I previously was unaware of how important The Expedition was for the development of the West, American trade and commerce, and how it helped shape white America's relations with its resident Native Americans.Ambrose's portrait of the troubled Meriwether Lewis is thorough and thought-provoking. Lewis was all these things and more: Thomas Jefferson's Prot&eacute;g&eacute;e, an Experienced Backwoodsman, a Naturalist's Naturalist, Expedition leader, Governor of Louisiana, and a man who died much too young. Was it the sudden Fame or a bipolar disorder which led to his tragic demise?Ambrose deeply explores the intense and key role Thomas Jefferson played in the creation, planning and support of the Expedition.The author paints a picture of William Clark as a man you'd like to have known--- a strong, quiet leader who effectively blended wit with economy of words.Although there are a good number of excerpts of the actual journals, I was expecting to see more of them. Instead of threading historical quotes together, Ambrose does a great share of the writing, in a clear and lively style, making this work of historical fact read more like a well-told tale of fiction.Thanks, Cousin Sal for the gift of the book. I recommend it for anyone interested in this pivotal time in American history."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"This piece of work is one which should be studied in every high school in the country. The bravery displayed and the adversity faced by the members of this expedition are not to be believed.It is easy in this day and time to downplay the significance of this journey, however by reading this account, a full appreciation of the hazards faced by the expedition can perhaps be attained. No maps, hostile Indian tribes, constant hunger, wild animals and constant insect infestation (clouds of mosquitoes drove some mad), bitter weather, etc.The picture painted by Ambrose is vivid. A fascinating story told by a less talented writer and historian would not have been nearly as effective."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"This detailed book is a long read, but worth it. Ambrose takes you into the early life of Lewis from 1774 through the expedition and his encounters with the Corp of Discover. Throughout the journal, the realization is that he says almost nothing about the other expedition members, Sacajawea or Clark in detail. The infant son of Sacajea and Charbonneau, Jean Baptiste \\"Pomp\\", gets little if no mention, nor the difficulties of a native american teenage woman on this amazing journey. This book is about Lewis. Although some of the journal is missing, other writers have speculated based on facts of the lives of the Corp of Discovery members. Ambrose seems bent on characterizing Merriweather Lewis in a certain light, one with perhaps some hereditary mental disorder; taking his own life in the end after the journey. However, the facts that he did present were interesting, although I would have preferred to know more details about the Native American tribes they encountered."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"This is the story of the greatest adventure ever to take place in the United States. It begins with Thomas Jefferson's selection and training of Meriwether Lewis, Lewis' selection of William Clark, and their four-year expedition across the continent in search of the all-water route to the Pacific. Although they obviously found no all-water route, they brought back an unimaginable amount off scientific, geographic, and anthropological information on the as-yet-unexplored (by white man) western territory. The hardships they endure, the discoveries, the quarrels, dangers, and ultimately, Meriwether Lewis' troubled and tragic life following the expedition have everything to make an incredible story. And the fact that it's true makes it even better. A truly amazing tale, told very well, as always, by Ambrose."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I was sad when this book came to an end. The detailed story of Lewis & Clark was written for the average person who wants to learn about America and the discovery of the West. This book was well researched. Stepehen Ambrose, I wish you were still with us to give us more writings. I will use this book in my History Classes.( I think I will make everyone read itfor the semester and give me a 3,000 word essay!!) Rest In Peace Stephen Ambrose."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"There are few books that kept me up to the early hours of the morning, though this is one of them!

This book is a must read for everyone!"},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Ambrose relates the story of the Lewis and Clark expedition, using primarily the journals of the trip as his source material.Fascinating details that I was not familiar with, including the fact that Sacajawea, the female native American guide, was pregnant during the trip!"},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Having been born in South Dakota, raised in Minnesota, and with ancestors who lived in Nebraska, and North and South Dakota, I was fascinated with the story of this first exploration into these areas. As an adult, I have also traveled extensively in the West, and of course I have heard of the Lewis and Clark expedition since grade school, but I have never before encountered a book for the popular reader that gave this fascinating first-person detail on these important events. Along with the extremely interesting travelogue, (the reader cannot wait to see what happens around the next bend of the river or at the meeting with the next Indian tribe) a number of horrible tragedies occurred:In the first place, the Indian policy of Lewis, as well as Jefferson, leaves something to be desired. For all their promising of the carrot and stick approach, it does not seem that the carrot was very big or tasty in view of the contact the warlike tribes had already had with Canadian traders from whom they had received guns and alcohol. The mishandling of the Sioux and the Blackfoot was a calamity for the USA with repercussions for decades to come. It does not seem that the tribes who were friendly and helpful to the expedition with the exception of the Mandan were ever amply rewarded for their helping hand.It is a great disaster that the journals did not get published in popular form for almost 100 years after they were written. One wonders that Jefferson did not take more responsibility for getting them out during his presidency and Lewis' lifetime. Although a neighbor of the Lewis family, and cognizant of the family tendency for depression and mental instability, he did not protect his prized prodigy from the fatal effects of this weakness plus alcoholism and over medication with poisonous substances. I agree with the author that appointing Lewis as the governor over the Louisiana territory was a bad idea. He could not handle well the political intricacies and intrigues involved in his governorship. What a terrible end to a talented and valuable man. One wonders why Clark did not accompany his good friend on his last fatal journey. One also wonders why Russell did not send some responsible person along but allowed Lewis to take off with his depression, alcoholism, and other problems accompanied only by the black servant who obviously had no authority over his employer. Lewis obviously thought he was in financial ruin by the refusal of Madison's administration to pay the debts incurred, as he thought, at government expense. One wonders what Jefferson really thought when he heard of Lewis's tragic end, and also why Jefferson himself was not able to do much with the journals once they came into his hands.Another tragedy was the handling of York by Clark when he asked for his freedom as compensation for his valiant and faithful service during the expedition. An unfortunate detail is the fact that when Clark's commission finally came through, it was for lieutenant rather than the promised captaincy.As to the writing of the book, outside of a fair amount of uninteresting detail before the expedition gets underway, which might be of interest to some people, it is excellent as Ambrose always is. I would give it five stars."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I read Undaunted Courage prior to a western vacation.

That was only one of the objectives of that expedition. This book puts the crew (not just Meriwether Lewis and William Clark) into the well deserved category of true hero-explorer along with Columbus, Magellan, Marco Polo and the modern explorers of our planet's corner of the solar system.This book is truly exciting. I want to repeat some words that put the care and planning of this expedition into perspective - only one man died."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"What makes the muskrat guard his musk? Courage.The Cowardly LionA thin line separates genius and madness, recklessness and courage. For many great individuals, the very thing that drives their success is also instrumental in their downfall. At the youthful age of twenty-nine, Meriwether Lewis seemed an unlikely choice to lead one of the most important voyages of discovery since Columbus. Lewis's skill at military leadership on the frontier and intense intellectual curiosity was matched by his lack of political savoir faire and propensity for depression. Stephen Ambrose's Undaunted Courage is as much about human tragedy as it is courage.Ambrose's meticulously researched and crafted tale takes us through the entire journey of Lewis and Clark. Much more than a simple travelogue, the reader feels the extreme physical exertion, bitter cold, extreme heat, and debilitating sickness of their trip. One also gets a good look into the psyche of Lewis. His heroic strengths and tragic weaknesses are on full display.It has become fashionable to parade the faults and foibles of our heroes before a frothing public. As quickly as we place individuals on pedestals, we seek ways to tear them down. However, Undaunted Courage does not fall into this trap. Rather, it provides an insightful view into the life of a talented, courageous man who overcame his youthful inexperience and psychological maladies to spark the opening of the American West. Like any well-written tragedy, this story is marked by pathos. It does not end with the hero living happily ever after, but in a gruesome suicide in rural Tennessee.

Using journals and other first person witness accounts, the reader is treated to a detailed description of Lewis and Clark's expedition to the pacific. While the research was extensive, Ambrose does relegate Clark to a minor role as he concentrates more on Lewis and Jefferson which would undoubtedly upset Lewis who consistently emphasized the equality of the two captains. The reader should not be surprised, as the title emphasizes this point about the thesis.

Mr. Ambrose writes with an immediacy that brings the period of time to life and personalizes the participants including Jefferson. I was disappointed, however, when, on page 302, he placed the settlement of The Dalles in Washington instead of Oregon where it belongs. This concerned me because I felt there might be other errors that may also have gotten into the book undetected."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I read many biographies and history books; they comprise almost half of my pleasure reading. This book will probably be the best of that type that I'll read in 1998. Ambrose brings the expedition alive, to the point where you try to understand how you would attempt to keep warm, find your way through the wilderness without maps, and trek and canoe across the vast western half of the United States. That Lewis was so young when charged with so much responsibility says much of his abilities. That upon his return he failed to function successfully, with tragic results, isn't surprising when you reach that point in the book. I was also delighted to get so much of the Jefferson part of the story in this book, too, as I've long considered him one of the handful of best Presidents this nation has ever had -- the Lewis &amp; Clark Expedition being one example of his foresight."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"&quot;Undaunted Courage&quot; covers events of the late 18th and early 19th centuries that preclude and culminated in the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Included are the backgrounds of the expedition's leaders, and the tragic epilogue to the adventure for Meriwether Lewis.The group of exceptional people that participated in the expedition was referred to as the &quot;Corps of Discovery&quot; by Captain Meriwether Lewis.The newly formed and expanding United States of America were in an economic, political and cultural competition for control of the rich resources west of the Mississippi river. President Thomas Jefferson who had purchased the Louisiana territory in order to secure the nation's place in that competition, did so without actually knowing for sure its potential, since no one had been there to evaluate or map it. Jefferson needed someone to find out what it was he purchased from the French. He searched for and found in Meriwether Lewis a singular human being who proved to have the desire and capability to organize and implement one of the greatest explorations of all times. The exploration originated in the nation's capitol, began its penetration of wilderness at St. Louis on the Mississippi river, traversed the entire Missouri and Columbia rivers to the pacific coast and returned again to the Mississippi river, all in a 3 year span of time.In his book Steven Ambrose has undertaken the extensive task of compiling and chronicling the birth and execution of the Corps' incredible journey across the early 19th century American western wilderness. These compilations and interpretations probe beyond pure historic fact to explore the character and personalities of the expeditions proponents, participants and critics. Accomplishments of the Corps and the expeditions epilogue are worth the time it takes to read them as they give a more human, intimate meaning to the formation of our country and the character of its leaders.Stories of encounters with inhabitants of the territory, both human and animal are well presented; descriptions of the landscape, living conditions and hazards endured satisfy the most discerning reader's interest.Discussed are the expeditions goals which were to find if a waterway across the continent to the Pacific ocean existed that would open up global commerce; inventory the resources of the territory; open a dialog with native inhabitants of the area and persuade them that resistance was futile. Numerous other benefits would accrue to the U.S. as may be uncovered by reading this wordy but interesting volume.Probably due to the extensive amount of material covered and its length, this book may be for some a labor to read. However, a minimum of curiosity and discipline will provide the reader with insight not usually available from purely historical writings. It was not written as a novel, but if the reader will use a creative imagination and allow freedom of emotion during the reading, the expedition can become a real thriller.Stephen Ambrose, in much the manner of Captain Lewis, undertook the task of compiling the explorer's adventures and set them to print in this book, not a work of art, but a work of admiration."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I read Undaunted Courage in the summer of 1996 while I was on a backpacking trip in Montana near where the Corps of Discovery traveled. When I got back I checked out of the library the two one-volume editions of the journals--the ones by Bernard DeVoto and by John Bakeless. Either of them would have been great to have while I was reading Ambrose's book. If you haven't read Undaunted Courage yet, do it with a copy of the journals at hand."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I have always read history, and I am particularly interested in American history. But, I had never given Lewis and Clark much time or thought until I read Undaunted Courage. From the preparations for the journey to the expedition's return to St. Louis the book hums with excitement. It is filled with interesting characters--the mercurial Lewis, Cruzatte the one-eyed boatman, Drouillard the hunter, Jefferson the visionary, the scheming Manuel Lisa, Sacagawea bereft of myth, all are brought to life by Stephen Ambrose. Ambrose is a man who is so captured by the L and C story that he went over the route himself many times, and describes that magnificent country as it must have been nearly 200 years ago so that the reader cannot help but form images in their mind. And if the people and the scenery were not enough, this book has the sub-plots for at least five different movies--Showdown with the Teton Sioux, winter the lovely Mandan maidens, the miracle meeting with the Shoshone and Sacagawea's brother Cameahwaite (in my view one of the great happenstances of all history,) the wretched winter in the Northwest, the encounter with the Blackfeet. So why isn't there a good movie about Lewis and Clark? This book has fueled what will be a lifelong passion for Lewis and Clark. It makes my annual pilgrimages to Fort Clatsop so much more meaningful for me and the 60 eighth graders who accompany me each year. If you really like this book, I encourage you to follow it up with Dayton Duncan's &quot;Out West,&quot; which brings the great adventure into the 20th Century."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Usually I read from 9 to 10 p.m. or so. While reading Undaunted Courage, I noticed myself going to bed earlier and earlier -- so I could rejoin Lewis and Clark and the rest of the Corps of Discovery. The best proof of the book's quality is that now I yearn to spend a few vacations following in their footsteps; Ambrose has done it, and most of his readers will want to also. I don't call many books gripping, but this one is."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"This is an excellent acount of the transcontinental journeyof Lewis and Clark in 1803-1806, by prize-winning historianStephen Ambrose.

Stepen E. Ambrose has written a well documented piece. You find yourself in the boat with Lewis and Clark as they traverse the Ohio, Mississippi, and Missouri Rivers. You feel the excitement that Meriwether Lewis brought to the mission. After you read this you'll need to see the museum under the Arch in St. Louis, MO."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"You won't be able to put this book down. I never knew that I could become so addicted to a history book! The book inspired me to go out of my way to visit some of the landmarks of the American west. If you are interested in American history, Thomas Jefferson, Meriwether Lewis, or just the great outdoors, this book will treat you well! Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I think that this book is really interesting, but all it really seems to be is a large culmination of facts. It makes for an EXCELLENT piece of history, but I was looking for much more emotion and power when reading. I was continually waiting for someone in the story to get excited or upset about anything. It's pretty dry, but a very good piece of a history text."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"What our forefathers went through to allow us to live in this wonderful country is amazing. I have been reading novels for years and picked up this book while on a visit to Montana. Now I can't wait to read more American History."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I don't read very much historical nonfiction; in fact, I prefer stories about the future, or metaphysics, or theoretical physics, with alternate universes, and wizards, demons of the underworld, unicorns, etc. But over the course of my own travels across the Central and Westernish part of the United States, my imagination really turned toward the past, and more specifically, toward the Lewis and Clark expedition. I realized that out of any men who had ever lived, I envied the men who went on that journey the most.At times this envy would kindle a white-hot flame of injustice and rage within me. How is it fair that those men got to see the natural beauty of this gorgeous piece of our country before it was plowed over, over-hunted, genocided, and industrialized? How breathtaking it must have been! Lewis and Clark came from the civilized Western world and so saw the landscape as outsiders; they encountered and communicated with Native American tribes that had seen no white man before. They discovered (and ate) new plants and animals. They discovered the vastness of The Plains, the height of The Rockies. What adventure!So where's MY frontier, huh? And now they even took away our space program, gosh darn it! What's left for me?So when these rages would take hold of me, my only comfort was to search for some tool which could guide my imagination into the past to experience the whole expedition vicariously. I eventually decided on this book as my tool.It took me ... several ... months to read it, so I wouldn't say that Undaunted Courage reads like a novel. It might just be that I'm not familiar with its genre, but yes, I was sometimes VERY bored with this book. I wanted more emotion and fewer technical details. I don't really care to read seven pages about how many kegs of gunpowder Lewis had to prepare for the journey (I exaggerate somewhat, of course). At the same time, Ambrose really does give a complete picture surrounding the politics and practicalities of the expedition. And if you're interested in knowing the dirty, complex HISTORY rather than just hearing a happy bedtime story about two army buddies on a good-ol' fashioned roadtrip, well, what this book provides is very valuable. I now have a much better idea about the American scene in the early 1800s.Another thing that disappointed me, though, is that I never really heard the voice of the OTHER men on the expedition. I wholeheartedly agree that Meriwether Lewis is a phenomenal figure (and I had no idea about the range of things he did and just how invaluable he was before reading this book), but it got a little tiring being stuck in his point of view through the entirety of the voyage (or, when this was not possible, hearing speculations of WHY he didn't write about an event, or write during a certain time period, etc.--the focus was always on Lewis). I would have loved to hear more from the other men in the Corps of Discovery just for variety. This would have endeared me no less to Captain Lewis. (To be fair though, the subtitle of the book tells you what its focus is...)What the author is really good at is pointing out which details make the story truly astounding. That's right--! Don't let me make you think this is just a dry elaboration on Lewis's field notes. When Lewis's interactions with the Native Americans seem outrageously naive or contradictory, for instance, the author tells us why, reminding us of the standards for that time, how little was known about this part of the world, and how significant was each experience and the knowledge gained from it. Everything is put in perspective--and in perspective, it's much more amazing! All the background information is laid out for me so I can gain a full appreciation for each event which is described.I have to give this book the benefit of the doubt and say it probably reads more like fiction than other nonfiction would. I spent a lot more time on it than I was anticipating, but I also gained a lot that I wasn't even looking for. I think anyone who has an interest in the Lewis and Clark expedition should give this book a good long chance. And if you have the same yearning as I do, to imagine yourself as an explorer on a less adulterated continent, you won't be disappointed with the poetic descriptions of the countryside (stuck in among the mass of other details you may or may not like).And I'm not even as jealous now, after reading about all the diseases the Corps of Discovery had and how those were treated. :)"},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Major Robert Clark Floyd was the father of Sergeant Charles Floyd of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. (On page 118, \\"Captain Charles Floyd\\" was mistakenly identified as the father of Sergeant Charles Floyd of the Lewis and Clark Expedition.)In the context of this particular book, this error may seem like a small one to some. However, in the bigger picture (the significance to American history, and, in particular, the Floyd family genealogy) this error is certainly a large one. Therefore, this information is very important.I am merely stating what many historical documents and letters state and what many historians and many members of the Floyd family already know to be true. Unfortunately, I do not have the time necessary to properly list the irrefutable evidence today. However, I will definitely add that information to this review at a later time. At that time, I will also do a more in-depth review of this book.(Also, I have not yet had time to review all of the 377 reviews posted prior to this one, so I apologize if this information is redundant.)Again, Major Robert Clark Floyd was the father of Sergeant Charles Floyd of the Lewis and Clark Expedition."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I'm quite satisfied and happy with deal. The book is as described, fast delivery and nicely packaged."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"When Stephen Crane published this book he was praised for the accurate details of the fighting scenes. Veterans of the Civil War actually thought that Crane had fought in the war, but Crane only learned of the war by reading and studying about it in books. There was not much symbolism in this book other than the use of the colors red and yellow. Red symbolized death, of course, but to me the yellow symbolized a kind of peace from the turmoil of the war. Throughout most of the book the characters have no names, they are referred to as \`the youth', \`the tattered soldier', \`the dying man', or \`the lieutenant'. Crane never reveals where the battles are taking place, they are only referred to as \`the field', \`the hills' or \`the woods'.The main story line was that of a young man, Henry Fleming, who matured and went from being a coward to a war hero. While the war was thriving, Henry was having his own personal battle in his mind. He was terrified of what people thought of him after he ran from his first battle.I really enjoyed the book. Once the conflicts began, the book was hard to put down. Although the book was extremely short, the \`evolution' of Henry was very descriptive and in depth. The war scenes were immensely animated and showed how Henry and his fellow fighters thought, reacted and felt. Crane also did a great job on describing the internal conflicts that Henry was forced to deal with. I loved this book and would recommend it to anyone that loves war stories."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"This book gets inside Meriwether Lewis's head - and Thomas Jefferson's, too - in a delightful way. A fast, entertaining read that makes you feel like one of the brave expeditioners. Ambrose's thoughtful consideration of Sacajawea's contributions and lack of recognition make her the book's truly enigmatic character.

The book is impossible to really get into. There is little narrative and too much hero-worship. Hardly a paragraph goes by with out an &quot;Undoubtedly, Lewis would have...&quot;, &quot;Knowing Lewis' character...&quot; or &quot;We can only assume that in light of Lewis' commitment...&quot;If that's not bad enough, how many time do we have to hear that, given the detail of Lewis' journal for the pages we have, the missing time periods must be lost for surely Lewis would been consistent in his recordkeeping.This book should be about 30% shorter without the authors distracting &quot;commentary&quot;"},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I was disappointed in this book, which I listened to on tape. It was terribly wordy, and took every opportunity to drum in the obvious or reiterate the dangers, deprivations, triumphs, etc. It seems to be a characteristic of popular histories to assume that the reader has no imagination and lots of time, and that fattened-up-by-repetion-or-too-much-detail is better. I did think that the information delivered was interesting and balanced. Still, the L &amp; C expedition, as well as the lives of its participants and leaders, are interesting and inspiring enough not to need alot of commentary."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I am having a hard time reading this book.. I become stressed. The author editorializes WAY too much. He also tends to analyze facts with a late 20th century perspective, rather than within the context of the time events occurred. Also, he should stay away from political analysis -- he is very weak in these areas (e.g.: Jefferson and Burr). May be a reflection of over-reliance on Merriweather/expedition-focused source documents. Or... Is it possible that the author is so enamoured with his subject that he lost a bit of the biographer/historian's [necessary] objectivity?"},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I am deeply ambivalent about Lewis and Clark. Part of me applauds their determinism and the rugged individualism they displayed, a quality that is universally lauded as a virtue in the abstract but is almost always cruelly punished by an indifferent society when practiced. Then there is another part of me that wishes the Mandans or the Hidatsas or the Brule or the Piegans would've slaughtered the whole syphilitic lot of them. As Ambrose repeatedly observes, this would've left a river tribe in possession of the greatest weapons cache west of Illinois. Perhaps this might have postponed for a few years the berserk settlement of the West and the greedy and piecemeal state of land rights governance that evolved over the past 200 years.In any case, there is much to be learned here by the casual scholar, particularly regarding Lewis' upbringing and life in the Jefferson White House, as well as the personal and professional chaos that dogged him in the few years between his return and his death by presumed suicide. This is principally a tale of Captain Lewis - Jefferson is painted as the yeoman farmer in the manner that recent historiography has favored, Clark is a steady and uncurious sort, Sacajawea is little more than a footnote, John Colter rates no more than an occasional sentence. While this keeps the biography on target, it also robs the narrative of some dimension. As we follow the Corps of Discovery to the Oregon Coast and back, we become interested in their individual stories but the ultimate fates of the entire platoon (except for Lewis and Sgt. Floyd, the only fatality) are never revealed.Careful editing would've kept the book on target, as everything after the Winter of 1805-06 is treated almost as an aftermath than a continuation of a tale - and as any mountaineer might tell you, the most interesting stuff usually happens on the way down. For the most part Ambrose writes in a lively (if occasionally embroidered) style, although his personal voice can be distracting. For example, he tells us that if he were sinking in a boat on the ocean, he would want Lewis in charge. (I think I might prefer a SCUBA instructor or hot air balloon vendor.) But the tale moves along like the Missouri River itself - meandering in some places, urgent in others.The tales of political squabbling post-expedition are some of the best in the book and Ambrose successfully captures the mood of the government in the wake of his discoveries. It's interesting to see that then, as now, our Congressional delegation understands the natural world the same way a drunken frat boy understands a dewy and unspoiled freshman girl who has passed out in his room."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"It's a good book. But it starts off with the history of Meriwether Lewis and his relationship with Thomas Jefferson. Which the cover says... I missed that. It does very little background on Clark. Once the actual expedition gets under way, which takes awhile, it starts off ok.. but becomes quite repetitious. Paddle up stream, make camp, meet indians, trade with indians, repeat. Since I was really only interested in the actual expedition the first part of the book bored me. And expedition itself, though extremely harrowing in person, just wasn't a super great read. It never really grabbed my attention. Historically this was a HUGE event. Definitely a major historical accomplishment..... I just don't think this was the best book on it. I may try to read another book on the subject."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"IF I HADN\\"T READ \\"SEA TO SHINING SEA FIRST, UNDAUNTED COURAGE WOULD HAVE BEEN ONE SIDED, BUT READING BOTH WAS WORTH MORE.

This comes out in the second chapter when Ambrose takes a long aside to preach about the evils of slavery, the environmentally destructive farming practices of Virginia's gentry, and the plight of women in the late 1700's--none of which has anything to do with Lewis's later explorations. I can only think of a few reasons why Ambrose did this--one is so he could get the book on required class reading lists at PC colleges and universities that require that type of twaddle from authors, or he is an elitist and actually beleives this pandering garbage. It is too bad. Ambrose sticks in his little diatribes all through the book. If you can see your way past them to really learn about Lewis's explorations, it is a good read, but be prepared to have to thread your way through the PC flotsam. -Paul Foote"},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I picked this up hoping to learn a little bit about the Lewis and Clark expedition, but what I got was every little detail.

I'm sure there are many more scholarly and precise works on the Lewis and Clark expedition from 1803-1806, but this one has to be one of the most accessible for the general reader. The author did a great job with a complex historical event and summarizing it into a compelling narrative. I naturally found the portion describing the actual expedition to be the most interesting. The events leading up to the expedition and the aftermath were a little more slow going.

I may just be one of those odd people, but to me, the 200 year old mistakes and goof-ups were hilarious. Although he is descriptive, Ambrose does not mince words.Although this book was technically written as a biography of Lewis, you see a fair amount of Clark as well. This book was easy to remember, and it served as a window into the age: you can easily imagine Clark patiently yanking thorns from his feet at a fireside, Sacagawea laughing and crying as she meets her brother again, York dancing enthusiasically and all the men taking part in riding and shooting competitions while they wait for the snow to melt.For anyone researching Lewis and Clark, this is a must-read"},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"i loved this book. i knew i would before picking it up, and i wonder if that had anything to do with the 5 star approval on my part. ambrose can tell history like no other. i tried a few other lewis and clark books, but i like a good story rather than history books, and this one is both."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Read when Simon & Schuster first put the book on the shelves in 1997, I had to revisit this outstanding literary and scholarly work. Ambrose, who was known for his books in the mid-20th century, packs Undaunted Courage with both recorded facts and evocative excitement. The book is primarily about Meriwether Lewis and how he used his sensitivity to record, report and assist the U.S. become aware of the unknown territories west of the Mississippi River.Although Ambrose focuses on Lewis, he does an outstanding job portraying William Clark, who acted as the co-commander of the Corps of Discovery. Clark is described as a pragmatic, well-tempered military man. Although formerly a Captain in the 1790's, the U.S. Army would only re-instate Clarke as 2nd Lieutenant for the mission westward. Ambrose makes very clear to the reader the solidarity of Lewis & Clark's leadership, as Lewis instructs all of the members of the Corps that Clark's rank equals his own.Determined, intense, and extremely sensitive, Meriwether proves to be a genius at observing every minute detail of the landscape on which they traveled, as well as sensing true intentions of Mandans, Sioux and other Native Americans they encountered. But, again, Ambrose makes it very clear that without the steadfast personality of Clarke, the Corps of Discovery would have probably failed miserably.Ambrose uses President Jefferson as the third component of the trinity, as he is portrayed as omniscience and omnipotent by Lewis and Clark to the Native Americans they encounter. Jefferson, the creator of the Corps of Discovery, is referred to as the Great Chief.Ambrose did not include too much information regarding the fourth cornerstone of the Corps: Sacagawea. The one-time Shoshone princess had been adopted into the Hidatsa tribe as a child. At only 16, she was able to speak several American Indian languages, as well as French and English. Though labeled simply as a linguist, Sacagawea mastered diplomacy to a point to keep the Corps alive after multiple encounters with Native Americans. Ambrose mentioned in passing her having a child. To cross half of the North American continent alone is enough to immortalize anyone. To accomplish it as 16-year-old mother nursing an infant should have upgraded Sacagawea from linguist to tri-captain.Aside from discounting the unsung heroine, Undaunted Courage is a masterpiece and should be on the shelves in every American library."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Undaunted Courage is just a great piece of American history by one of the great modern American historians. Typical of Ambrose, this story has more detail than you want at some times (do we need to know how many pencils were carried on the raft?) but it really does give you a window into a whole different time and place.I learned so much about the journey, the opening of the West, and the post-journey lives of these adventurors that I'd never even considered.Great book for fans of American history, the American West, and Ambrose."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"\\"Undaunted Courage\\" is an outstanding narrative of the Lewis &amp; Clark Expedition of two centuries ago. Pure history written like a novel, this is a difficult book to put down.I must admit that my knowledge of the Corps of Discovery had been superficial. From the pages of \\"Undaunted Courage\\" I learned much.This book begins with the background of Meriwether Lewis and the vision of Thomas Jefferson. We read much of Jefferson's interest in botany, zoology and geography as well as of his relationship with Lewis.Ambrose takes us through the preparations for the journey. The collection of boats and supplies and the recruitment of explorers, followed by the descent down the Ohio and up the Mississippi move the Corps to the point of embarkation. One thing that I had never thought of was the need for winter camps. In our day, winter is an impediment to travel for a few days at most. The Corps, by contrast, went into winter camps at Wood River, Illinois, Fort Mandan in North Dakota and Fort Clatsop on the Pacific.Ambrose takes us through the challenges of the expedition, both from the land and its inhabitants. The challenge of mountains and rapids tested the mettle of the Crops. The Corps interacted with a succession of Indian tribes, which often viewed each other as enemies. The goals of avoiding conflict and laying he groundwork for an American fur-trading empire were only partially achieved. Despite dangerous divisions of forces, no explorers were lost to hostile fire. Although open warfare was avoided, they left behind an Indian Country in disarray and suspicious of American intentions.Well deserved attention is given to Sacagawea, the Shoshone interpreter without whom the expedition would probably would have been lost. The communication process was so cumbersome that it is amazing that the Corps got on as well as it did. Sacagawea would speak with the Indians and would interpret into Hidatsu to her husband, Touissant Charbonneau. Charbonneau would speak to George Drouillard in French, who would speak to the Captains in English.Another interesting thread running through the story is that of the barter between the Corps and the Indians. When many of the items brought to barter failed to satisfy, the explorers were forced to trade their own equipment for necessities. The variety of trading skills among the tribes leaves the reader with an insight into the universal commercial spirit.Toward the end of the book, Ambrose follow the unraveling of Meriwether Lewis. Driven by drink, disease and depression, Lewis failed to complete the publication of his journals and performed poorly in his role as Governor of Louisiana en route to his tragic end.True, Lewis and Clark did not achieve everything possible on their journey, but their record was memorable. Overcoming winter and summer, Indians and animals, the Corps of Discovery earned its place in the annals of exploration. \\"Undaunted Courage\\" is a narrative worthy of its subjects. Come, travel with the Corps of Discovery across the pages of this book."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"A biography of Meriwether Lewis, this book is truly wonderful. Blending the usage of journals, events, and commentary, Undaunted Courage gives a wide-ranging account of Lewis's life, from his greatest success, the Corps of Discovery, to the smaller matters in his life. A bit to comprehensive if you're looking for a simple biography, and a bit narrow if you want the whole Corps of Discovery (while included, this book is about Lewis), but if you're looking for a detailed history of one of America's finest men, this is your book."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Undaunted Courage is a must read or listen for anyone interested in exploration and history. As Ambrose highlights, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark made a remearkable journey up the Missouri River to find a \\"direct and practical\\" passage to the Pacific ocean and the western part of America. It is clear Ambrose has a true understanding of what Lewis and Clark must have experienced during thier two and one hlaf year journey.Doctor, outdoorsman, taxidermist, writer and diplomat, Lewis comes to life in this remarkable journey that Ambrose tells us in Undaunted Courage. Ambrose provides the reader a great flavor for the immensly productive Lewis and Clark expedition. Not only does the pair find a route to the West, but they documented several hundred new species of plants and animals and created, if only for a short period, diplomatic relations with the various Indian tribes along the way. Undaunted Courage is a great title for this amazing trip.Ambrose gives us the post expedition difficulty Lewis goes through. For such a great master of a variety of things, it is hard to understand why Lewis is unable to get his life on track after the expedition with so many great opportunites available to him. Unfortunately, there is no insight provided as to why Lewis is unable to more readily function in the aftermath of the expedition. This was the one piece of the book that left me wondering.For a great trip up the Missouri, read this one and enjoy it."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Like all of his books, Ambrose does his best to make history come alive. The book starts with the birth of Meriweather Lewis and ends with his death. It tells the story of the Corps of Discovery's mission to the west coast and back and also gives good supporting information about everything having to do with the United States at the same time. Ambrose focuses more on Lewis because during the same time he was writing this book, someone else was giving a detailed account of the life of William Clark. The book does however give more than a glimpse into most if not all of the members of the Corps of Discovery. Ambrose writes the book the way every history book should be written. Throughout the entire book, you feel like you are walking with Lewis; you want to be right along side him as he sees the White Cliffs, the herds of buffalo and elk and the Chinooks. I have no reservations in recommending this to anyone who would like to learn more about the United States and those who helped form it."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I grew up along the Missouri river in central North Dakota. All my life I heard about Lewis and Clark's amazing expedition to the Pacific. I've visited The Mandan villages and fished on Lake Sacagawea.Some have called this book a biography of Meriwether Lewis while others say that it is a history book. I say that it is the best of both....As a biography of Lewis, it is well balanced, portraying Lewis as a brave and intelligent commander (he was the ranking officer, but he treated Clark as an equal). It also portrays Lewis as a depressed man who frequently lashed out in anger and frustration, putting the mission and his men in jeopardy. It also does not try and cover-up his tragic last years and his suicide....As a piece of narrative history, it is a riveting account of the expedition and a stunning look at America before cities and the destruction of it's forests and wildlife. Based on the journals or Lewis & Clark, Jefferson, and others.Highly Recommended!!"},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"For anyone unfamiliar with Lewis and Clark, or that time period of American history, sigh in relief! This book is not only a great read, but orients you to the trip Lewis and Clark made overland out to the Pacific Ocean. High readability; however, pay attention to the title: this is a book about Merriweather Lewis' expedition west. Anyone looking for much on Sacajawea or York will have to look elsewhere, which is fine with me. Lewis deserves his own book. The author loves his subject---with that it is easy to stay with the story. Its not a heavy read at all. If you are even a bit curious and don't want to get in too deep, this book is perfect for you! It was for me."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I literally devoured Ambrose's tale of the Lewis and Clark expedition.

He unfolds the new American West gradually, just as the Lewis and Clark Voyageurs encountered it, that you are transported up river and over mountains with them. All the hardships, misgivings, painful mistakes, and lucky accidents are explored and explained. And what was particularly interesting was what happened to Lewis after the journey. How his life and luck were never the same--as if he was now out of place in both the East and the West. What a sad end to an American hero. The stuff of movies. Great reading--if a trifle long (my only complaint)."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Ambrose recounts one of the great true stories in the american experience. He not only tells the facts meticulously, but gives insight into the personalities and lives of the people involved in this expedition. This is a story that is nearly mythical in its accomplishments and consequences, and Ambrose does an admirable job with the material. The only fault is with the first three chapters on the backgrond of Merriwether Lewis. They tend to be ponderous like a history textbook and of a different tone, as if they were added as an afterthought."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Anything Stephen Ambrose writes is wonderful, but this one is riveting, and it is evident the author has done his homework. Arguably the most definitive work on the subject of Lewis and Clark, it makes the journey come alive for the reader, perhaps because Ambrose took the trip with his family and spent time retracing the route of Lewis and Clark.

The two or three lines of &quot;facts&quot; about the Lewis and Clark Expedition which you learned in 7th grade multiply and become humanized on every page. Ambrose is a writer for the general reader and he is fast becoming the best at doing it in this country. From the political biographies to a series of books which rightfully honor the American soldiers' efforts on World War II, the historian not only convinces us that he cares but makes us care, too. The story of Merriweather Lewis has been marginalized in our general histories for too long.

On to Citizen Soldier."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"READ DEVOTO'S EDIT OF THE JOURNALS INSTEAD!Here is my issue with this book; I read DeVoto's edit of the journals and loved it. I wanted more. There was so much left unsaid in the journals such as background information, explanations of sickness, sounds, what was the ultimate fate of the Mandans.In the last several decades there has been countless hours of research done by many historians on various aspects of the trip. I wanted this information in one book instead of spending months locating and reading the various articles and small books by these other historians.Ambrose didn't give it to me. I had a difficult time finishing this book. I think it can be broken up into 3 areas that he wrote about. First, he gives you a Wikipedia quality retelling of the story. There really is no comparing the journals themselves to this second hand retelling. The journals themselves give the best, most exciting, and clearest version of the trip. Ambrose's retelling is boring and poorly written.Second he gives you his personal opinions and speculation about the trip. This tripe felt like a middle school history teacher, not an accomplished historian. He frequently ends chapters with what if's or a critique of Lewis's actions. Worthless.The third bit of it was what I was here for. The information missing from the journals. An example is the loud noise heard by the party near the mountains. If my memory serves me correctly this is not explained in the Journals or Courage, however after reading a book about David Thompson, who was also in the area at this time, it seems likely that the sound was in fact frequent, intense avalanches. This is what Ambrose is supposed to tell, and he did to a bit of it, but he left out most of what I wanted to know, and what he did put in was the work of other historians.And while I'm at it, what kind of book is this anyway? A history, a biography? I'm not sure Ambrose had decided himself, just look at his long apologia at the beginning. He knew what he was writing didn't really fit into Lewis and Clark scholarship. He was in two minds when he wrote this book. Half of him wanted to tell the story of the trip to his kids around the camp fire, the other half wanted to narrate the life of Lewis. Both came off half cocked.So, 1/3 of the book is good stuff, 1/3 is Wikipedia, and 1/3 is worthless.3/3 of the journals are priceless.This is POP HISTORY and it sucks.

Thank you."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Undaunted Courage, by Stephen Ambrose.This review will focus on some of the incredible country encountered by Lewis and Clark (L&C;) and some of the awesome weather experienced. This will also bring in a bit of a comparison with Alexander Mackenzie a bit further north.Lewis and Clark's voyage up the Missouri River--following the Louisiana Purchase--is a great story. It established, at least in part, the U. S. Claim to the Oregon Territory. Jefferson had also hoped for a major river coming down from Canada and thereby giving the U. S. a claim to the Canadian Prairies. L&C; reported there was no such river.Lewis and Clark traversed much of North Dakota and Montana, an area immediately south of Saskatchewan and Alberta. Lewis took particular interest to note what rivers came south into the Missouri There were a few, but they were relatively small. However this interest indicated a sensitivity to the British presence not too far north.Canada was a hotbed for fur traders and explorers, primarily due to the Hudson Bay and the North West companies. The dominant motive of the explorers was a search for the so called Northwest Passage. One explorer, Alexander Mackenzie, was of particular importance. He took many tortuous trips across Manitoba, Saskatchewan and into northern Alberta, all by water. The last part of this northern odyssey brought him to the Clearwater River in far northwest Saskatchewan. The Clearwater was the end of a historical 12 mile portage from the Churchill River. As one moved north through the forest, one would suddenly break into the clear at the rim of this canyon, with a magnificent view. Alexander Mackenzie reported that from this \\"precipice, which rises upwards of a thousand feet above the plain beneath it, commands a most extensive, romantic and ravishing prospect.\\" The Clearwater would then flow downstream to the Athabaska River and places north.Two of Mackenzie's trips stand out. The first one started at Fort Chipewyan on Lake Athabaska in 1789 and led to the discovery of the Mackenzie River to the Arctic Ocean. The second trip also started at Fort Chipewyan and used the Peace River and other rivers to reach the Pacific, 1792-93, near Bella Coola, BC, about 300 miles north of Vancouver, and 12 years ahead of Lewis and Clark. This event, when finally published in 1801, caused great concern in Washington. At that time four countries--Great Britain, Russia, Spain and the U. S.--had an interest in the area called the Oregon Country. Hence, this trip by MacKenzie surely contributed to the launching of the Lewis and Clark odyssey.While there is no doubt that their trip was one of undaunted courage, it was also one of great luck. This is based primarily on their heading into the mountains, crossing the Montana and Idaho divide (due west of the northwest corner of Wyoming) about the middle of August. When they left the last tributary of the Missouri they had no idea what kind of mountain territory lied ahead and how they were going to get out of these mountains. And winter was coming.Lewis and three others had moved ahead of the main party to scout their situation. Their supplies were limited to what they could carry. They had no horses. Lewis had hoped for an easy portage to a major branch of the Columbia. All he could see instead, when he reached the divide, was \\"immense ranges of high mountains, still to the west of us- - -.\\" But the next day they immediately ran into a friendly band of Shoshones, and indeed, they had a large heard of horses with them. And the following day, after much exchange of gifts, and much partying, the Indians agreed to take 30 horses and go with him to meet Clark and help bring their supplies over the divide.However, this may well be the absolutely worst spot to have crossed the continental divide. There were no good options on how to proceed, once across the divide.* If the troop went south, past the \\"Lost River Range\\", they would soon discover that \\"losing rivers\\" is exactly what happens. The runoff disappears into extremely porous volcanic rock. Hence one would have to carry all their water supply across these treeless, lava deserts. If they somehow made it through that hazard, the Snake River and the impassable Snake River Canyon awaited.* If they went due west, the option was the Salmon River, through what is now called The Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness Area. The Smithsonian Guide described this area as \\"the start of Salmon River Canyon, an enormous gash as it cuts across central Idaho. \\"It is the second deepest gorge in North America, and it joins the deepest - the Snake River Canyon.\\" Indeed Clark explored this river a short distance before agreeing that it was impassable.* The third option, which was the one they took, was to head north, through country described by the Shoshone Chief as follows: \\". . . the road was a very bad one - - - and that they had suffered excessively with hunger - - - as there was no game in that part of the mountains which were broken rocky and so thickly covered with timber that they could scarcely pass.\\" To take this option they had to retreat across the divide, then cross it again. \\"As the party ascended toward the Divide, the going grew worse. \\"On September 3, it snowed.\\"They were desperately searching for a better stream to get them down from the Bitterroot Mountains. Remarkably this was to be another Clearwater River. After a week or so of terrible indigestion from a diet heavy to roots, and about ten days building new canoes they were ready to get out of the mountains by October 6. Although far superior to the Salmon River, the Clearwater was still very swift with many rapids. One of the troopers was so petrified running these rapids he deserted. The canoes and the remaining troopers survived and reached the Snake River by the 10th. While they still had much dangerous river mileage to navigate, the worst was over.The fact that they survived--what today would have been surely considered to be a very risky trip plan--was testimony to their outstanding leadership, to their woodsman ability, to their incredible boat building capability and to their ability to handle white-water.The fact that they survived was also testimony to the skills and savvy of a Shoshone Indian maid - Sacagawea. She was married to a French Canadian trader, Pierre Charbonneau, who had been hired on in 1804 as a scout for their party. She knew about the Shoshone customs and schedules and could translate for them.The L&C; troop had survived the terribly cold and windy winter at what is now Mandan, ND. They were now faced with a different type of terrible winter at Fort Clatsop, near the mouth of the Columbia. While not as cold, this site was always close to freezing and always wet. It is hard to say which was more miserable. Finally the fact that they survived was also testimony to their incredible luck. They were fortunate not to have met the fate of the Donner Party, a little bit later in the century, and a bit further south. This sad party became trapped by a series of blizzards, ten in all, starting late in October, 1846."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Undaunted Courage was a thoroughly enjoyable book to read.

Ambrose wrote the whole book with these notions in mind, thus sprinkling it with misleading melancholy and tainting it with one-sided opinions. You don't get the other side at all.Real students/historians of the Lewis & Clark journals and related materials who I know get a bit angry about all this.The other side is documented in an online book ... which presents quite a story (nonfiction) about the so-far thwarted attempt to exhume Lewis, and it offers a chart of the dates of Lewis's writings to rebut one of Ambrose's major claims. (It also includes a love story with blatant sex that'll probably shock a lot of people.)It's a shame Ambrose withheld (or rejected) a lot of the weighty evidence about Lewis's character and mysterious death. For me, his decision to do so casts doubt on the veracity of his other works.The interested reader's only other \\"complete\\" option is to get the great set of the journals relatively recently published by the Univ. of Nebraska Press, edited by Gary Moulton, which cost about $600.Other very good books on this are the biographies of Lewis by Dillon (I forgot his first name) and Vardis Fisher.

The author portrays Lewis as a great leader, but also uncovers his many character flaws, including his unpopular tenure as the governor of the Louisiana Territory, followed by his suicide.Once you read this book, you will probably become a big Stephen Ambrose fan like me.I highly recommend this book as well as Ambrose's \\"The Wild Blue\\", \\"Nothing Like it in The World\\" (about the construction of the transcontinental railroad), and \\"Crazy Horse and Custer\\".Mitch Paioff, Author, Getting Started as an Independent Computer ConsultantThe Wild Blue : The Men and Boys Who Flew the B-24s Over Germany 1944-45Nothing Like It In the World : The Men Who Built the Transcontinental Railroad 1863-1869Crazy Horse and Custer: The Parallel Lives of Two American WarriorsGetting Started as an Independent Computer Consultant"},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I would recommend this book/audio to anyone.It is fasinating to any one interested in US History and elploration of American.

Ambrose through his World War II works. Every American child knew about Lewis & Clark and the Louisiana Purchase (Thank you Schoolhouse Rock), but this book brings to life the true and amazing task these men went through to help open America into the vast and great nation she is now.After the 1803 Louisiana Purchase from France, President Thomas Jefferson, a man of knowledge and curiosity himself, issued a continental exploration Corps of Discovery to travel to the Pacific Ocean. If you could imagine walking across your own state, now imagine walking (horse/canoe allowed) across the country, no roads, no cellphone, no Walmart, no bathrooms, no electric lights, wild animals...the grizzlies read like monsters, potential attacks from hostile natives, the weather...it is unimagenable that any human could have survived or endured such hardships!It is important to realize that Lewis and Clark were the leaders, but also traveled with a large group of brave men, unique and talented in their own respects, including the female Native American Sacagawea and her baby, plus the sad tale of York, Clark's slave who shared the pain, dangers, and loyalty, but received none of the rewards, promises, or respects afterwards...this subject raises my ire, so I will not continue on York's betrayal by Clark.Regardless of whether you read this as pure history, this book reads like an adventure tale like Krakauer's Into Thin Air, a testament of man versus nature, the book is also a cultural exploration as the \\"White man meets the Red man\\" no disrespect meant. On so many levels this book will offer insight, information, and entertainment that few books balance so well. So you might as well read a good tale and actually improve your own academic knowledge.Thank you and keep reading.John Dae Min"},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Ambrose wrote a very complete book here. Obviously extensive, well researched, and with a good flow - this book is worth reading. My pick with this book would be it moves along a little on the slow side, but so did Lewis &amp; Clark on this voyage.High Points:Descriptions &amp; Interpretations from the original journals - superb.Multiple points of view, Lewis, Clark, the members of the corps of discovery, native americans, etc. Ambrose brings these to life.Intricate step by step accounts of the trip.Improvement Points:At times it just moves along too slowly - Ambrose could have made it a bit more concise.Confusing ending, did Lewis commit suicide? Was he muredered, Ambroses' guesses leave something to be desired.All in all this is a good book which should be read by any aspiring student of history.Joseph Dworak"},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"The mystery of the U.S. West and the persona of the explorers who revealed its splendor are eloquently told in this book. Thomas Jefferson's interest in exploring the western territory extended back a half a century as his family had been awarded land west of the Appalachian Mountains. A week after Congress had approved funding for the expedition, Jefferson began writing his scientific friends about the matter. He had selected Captain Lewis to lead the discovery mission. While Lewis and Clark are linked permanently in American history, the two were distinct individuals. In 1803 they were not even intimate friends. An invitation by Captain Lewis to William Clark changed all that. Clark was chosen, in part, due to his competence and because \\"his word was his bond.\\" Clark was a woodsman who was familiar with rugged territory. From the President's perspective it was the Lewis expedition. The book goes on to describe the personalities and the personal weaknesses of the people involved. He adds a discussion about the intellectual property resulting from discoveries made on the trip.

In process, he examines Lewis' relationship with Thomas Jefferson, the third president of the United States. Ambrose quotes Henry Adams who described the American of 1801: \\"Stripped for the hardest work, every muscle firm and elastic, every ounce of brain ready for use, and not a trace of superfluous flesh on his nervous and supple body, the American stood in the world a new order of man.\\" Ambrose adds, \\"he could have been describing Meriwether Lewis.\\" Only men such as Lewis could lead a voyage up the Missouri River to the Rockies, then continue the expedition over the mountains, down the Columbia River to the Pacific Ocean, and eventually return home to Washington (DC). This was a journey worthy of Homer's Odysseus. It is important to keep in mind that Jefferson set quite specific objectives for Lewis to achieve, including the creation of a number of maps of territories (e.g. Oregon, Washington, and Idaho) which the new nation would later claim for itself.Lewis is best understood as a scientist, not as an adventurer. In his detailed records he describes native peoples, wildlife, flora and fauna, weather, landscape, science...indeed virtually everything and everyone he encountered throughout the expedition. We also learn a great deal about his partner, William Clark, and Sacagawea, an Indian maiden who accompanied them. In fact, we learn a great deal about the entire social, political, economic, and scientific \\"world\\" at that time which was in turbulent transition. Lewis viewed his expedition as a failure because it did not reveal an all-water route to the Pacific. (There was none.) Also, contrary to Jefferson's hopes, most of the Great Plains obtained by the Louisiana Purchase were unsuitable for farming and there was no river flowing down from Canada into the Missouri. Fulfillment of Jefferson's Grand Vision was thus denied...or so Lewis thought. Throughout his adventures, Lewis' courage was indeed undaunted. However, although a national hero after having completed the expedition, he was unable to cope with various problems and died an ignominious death. With skills few other historians possess, Ambrose brings this remarkable man and his remarkable era to life. On rare occasion, I describe a book as a \\"magic carpet\\" which transports me back in time to human experiences which would otherwise be inaccessible. This is such a book."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Slow to start, but riveting as it progressed through Lewis &amp; Clark's journey.

Ambrose grew up in Whitewater, Wisconsin, the epitome of small town life, and felt suffocated until he left to attend the University of Wisconsin at Madison. It was here that he earned a bachelor's and later a Ph.D. in American History. He is best known for his book D-Day and the biographies of both Presidents Nixon and Eisenhower. After reading the journals of Lewis and Clark and later following the expeditions trail, Ambrose has brought this historic movement, also known as the &quot;Corps of Discovery&quot;, to the public.Although the book seems to be very slow at first it later turns into a real page-turner. &quot;Undaunted Courage&quot; is a predominantly biographical account of Lewis and Clark, mainly Meriwether Lewis, from a Virginian planter at the age of eighteen to his fall after the expedition. Ambrose also explores what he believes to be the tragic end of Meriwether Lewis contrary to the opinion of other respected historians. Lewis suffered from bouts of depression which became more severe after the failure of the expedition. It was his extreme depression along with alcoholism and debt that Ambrose believes caused Lewis to commit suicide.Hired by President Jefferson to explore the uncharted American west, find a water route to the Pacific ocean, and to have good relations with the Native Americans, Meriwether Lewis set out with fearlessness. After recruiting William Clark, and several other men who were promised land at the end of the journey, Lewis embarked on a two and half year journey. Lewis reports the progress of the expedition to the President with unwavering devotion.In this biographical account Ambrose also explores his own experiences on that famous trail and the journals of both Lewis and Clark, using direct quotes, and also offering his own alternative routes which he believes could have changed the history of America had they been chosen by the famous duo. Ambrose's admiration for the duo brings to light the trail blazing fearlessness of both Lewis and Clark from the way in which their militant expertise guided them through unknown territory to the way in which they fearlessly handled the many Indian tribes along the way. Ambrose does an excellent job of displaying the determination of these two men.Ambrose's own expertise lends to the feeling of realism of each reader. This historical work of art disguised as an adventure is so breath taking that one can't help but to feel a part of it all. This is a must read for not only any history buff but for anyone who has been mystified by the stories of Lewis and Clark. There will be no unanswered questions left."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"This is a book that takes a while to get into but once you are in you don't want to get out. The start of the book is slow going where they talk about the life of Meriwether and the preparation that is required for the trip. Then once you get to the trip it is incredibly interesting to find out how we met with some of the Native Americans for the first time."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"A wonderful bedtime read.

A must read for any student of American history. Ambrose weaves the tale and the excitement builds as the men overcome early obstacles to finally make way on the river. Any person who enjoys the outdoors will love this book"},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"&quot;Undaunted Courage&quot; is a remarkably detailed account of the Lewis and Clark ventures, known as the &quot;Corps of Discovery&quot;, which relies on the journals of Lewis, Clark, and others that accompanied the expedition. Stephen Ambrose, also the author of New York Times bestseller D-Day and the biographies of Nixon and Eisenhower, successfully recreates this American journey to the Pacific for the reader by using direct quotes from the journals from start to finish. This allows the reader to fully understand the emotions and the actions behind the friendships, hardships, and first encounters with Native Americans and unknown land, the members of the expedition endured. During the tour, Ambrose critques and analyzes decisions made by the crew and then offers an alternative route that, if taken, may have changed history forever.The main goal of the expedition was Jefferson's quest to find an all water route to the Pacific ocean and to make peaceful relations with the Native Americans. Jefferson was confident that Meriweather Lewis, his personal secretary and close friend, was the best suited man for the job. Jefferson and Lewis had the utmost respect for each other, and Jefferson trusted that Lewis would use his best judgement to ensure that the expedition be a success. Lewis felt his long time friend, William Clark, would best be suited to be his equal on the journey, and together they would lead a crew of men to the Pacific ocean and back. Lewis and Clark chose their crew based on prior military experience, reputation, and endurance, and promised the men land once the expedition was completed. This served as an incentive for the men, however most were excited to have the opportunity to explore the unkown.Lewis and Clark both had complimentary skills that would be necessary for the success of the expedition. Lewis was knowledgeable about medicine and botany, and a skilled writer, while Clark was useful in mapping their progress. However, Jefferson and Clark both noted that Lewis seemed to suffer from depression, possibly genetically inherited from his father, but not thought to be too serious. Ambrose points out specific dates that Lewis quit writing in his journal, possibly due to depression.Once the journey concluded, and an all water route was not found, it became apparent that Lewis's depression was more serious than suspected. Lewis felt that the expedition was a failure, and that he had disappointed Jefferson, alos he was unable to find love. He turned to excessive drinking, lying, and put himself into debt. The only failure he was responsible for was his failure to realize the significance of his discoveries. Lewis's failure to realize this may have possibly contributed to why people today are unaware of the contributions this hero has made to history.However, once you read Ambrose's &quot;Undaunted Courage&quot; you will rediscover history and have answers to questions you thought you would never have. You will find this book hard to put down because of the excitement and surprised Ambrose induces by introducing us to material that will allow us to put pieces of history together that bring us to the present day. I must say that the book does begin slowly, however once the expedition is on their way, it is a page turner right to the very end."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I, a 30ish female mystery reader, purchased this book because the cover caught my attention and to prove to myself that I could read something besides brain candy. Basically the same reason I read &quot;A Brief History of Time&quot; by Stephen Hawking, and &quot;The Dancing Wu Li Masters&quot; a few years ago. This book may turn me into a permanent non fiction reader by choice. I read the early chapters with the attitude of a school girl preparing for an exam and laid the book aside for a few months. Last week I picked it up again as a nighttime sleep inducer and found myself enthralled for hours. My excitement has increased with each new chapter and I'm trying to draw it out because I don't want to reach the end. My husband has suffered through my reading incredible sections aloud and my new desire to visit many of the places discussed. I wish to thank Stephen Ambrose for the tremendous effort to bring this story to life. He has enabled me to see the continent as it originally was with the excitement of an early explorer searching for knowledge. I was transported."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"The first fifty pages or so starts with the obligatory background info which makes for fairly slow reading. However, once the expedition starts I could not put the book down. Ambrose does a masterful job of highlighting his own work with quotes from the actual journals of Lewis and Clark. His personal familiarity with the terrain and his obvious fascination with the subject matter makes me want to retrace the footsteps of the Corp of Discovery myself! This book is a masterpiece of understatement. The Lewis and Clark expedition was the &quot;lunar landing&quot; of the 19th century."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Wow, what a great way to learn about some of the early history of our country. It's a tremendous, high-quality, adventure of a read !"},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"This is an admirable work (perhaps Ambrose's best) that profiles early American exploration sponsored by Jefferson. I read the hardcover in 1996. Lewis and Clark were heroes - and so were their party.At the time (and now) my only disappointment was any real examination of pathfinders who preceded Lewis and Clark. There were many: some succeeded in reaching the Pacific before them - Alexander Mackenzie in 1793 (with French voyageurs).There's no mention of French traders on the Missouri (from 1700). No mention of La Verendrye (who visited the Mandans in 1738). No mention of his sons (who saw the Rockies in 1742). No background on Charbonneau (a Frenchman, husband of Ambrose's patron saint Sacagawea).It's as if Ambrose wanted to erase the French (or diminish them). Yet history contradicts his narrative.Nonetheless, this work is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Like all of his books, Ambrose does his best to make history come alive. The book starts with the birth of Meriweather Lewis and ends with his death. It tells the story of the Corps of Discovery's mission to the west coast and back and also gives good supporting information about everything having to do with the United States at the same time. Ambrose focuses more on Lewis because during the same time he was writing this book, someone else was giving a detailed account of the life of William Clark. The book does however give more than a glimpse into most if not all of the members of the Corps of Discovery. Ambrose writes the book the way every history book should be written. Throughout the entire book, you feel like you are walking with Lewis; you want to be right along side him as he sees the White Cliffs, the herds of buffalo and elk and the Chinooks. I have no reservations in recommending this to anyone who would like to learn more about the United States and those who helped form it."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Undaunted Courage by Stephen E. Ambrose-Book ReviewThe book Undaunted Courage by Stephen E. Ambrose was written about the expedition that Lewis and Clark lead across the newly acquired Louisiana Purchase. The story starts from the very beginning of the expedition, with all of the years of preparation, thought, and planning, and political expectiations for this potentially dangerous trip that had a goal of reaching the Pacific Ocean and then back again to Washington.The book goes into great detail about the struggles and triumphs of Lewis and Clark. The author expresses his opinions of what Lewis and Clark are feeling at certain points, and what might have been going on in their minds every time they made a decision. This book has the most information about the Lewis and Clark expedition than any book I have ever read before, and was very well detailed, hiding nothing back.This book wasn't the most interesting book I have ever read about the history of Lewis and Clark, but it was by far the most informative. The author did all of his research before writing this book, and I feel comfortable knowing pretty much all there is to know about the expedition. The book could have been more interesting, but over all, I would recommend it to anyone wanting a good book on the Lewis and Clark expedition.This book I will give 4 stars. I recommend it to ages of 13 and older. Just because of the fact that this book was a little more difficult to read than some of the others I've read. But over all, I think author Stephen E. Ambrose has written a great book."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Undaunted Courage. Ambrose tells of the Corp of Discovery's expedition with pin point accuracy and inciteful reflection interpreting significant encounters. I felt as if I were one of the party members rowing along, portaging a canoe or fending off grizzlies. It made me question my own toughness as I imagine their encounters, victories, suffering and frustration."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I don't read history. Public schools cured me of that. But there was so much hoopla about this book when it came out, and there seemed to be such a high adventure factor involved, I bought it and read it. It is wonderful. A real page turner. I couldn't wait to get back to it when I put it down to work or sleep. So many amazing things. And they're all true."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Undaunted Courage is a tribute not only to the great mission of Lewis and Clark, but also to Ambrose's ability as both storyteller and researcher. This book made the entire experience of the Lewis and Clark Expedition (nearing it's 200th anniversary) come alive from the page. The tome is packed with excellent facts and background not only about the two adventurers themselves, but also about their aides, equipment, food and supplies, and the Indian cultures that they encountered. However, the book is, as a great many well-researched texts are, dry in many places and a good deal lengthier that it needs to be. In all, however, it paints a wholly accurate portrait of the great deeds and harrowing adventures that Lewis and Clark encountered, and their lives afterward."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"A highly readable and thorough account of the L&amp;C expedition. I especially enjoyed the insight into Lewis' personality and character.

After reading the book, I am certain I will look at the country in a different way."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"With nonfiction adventure novels such as Into THin Air and The Perfect Storm and Godforsaken Sea being the current rage, it is refreshing to read an adventure story that is about more than some macho quest. The men (and women) in Undaunted COurage were shaping history and building a nation. If modern day adventure is defined as hardship by choice, then old time adventure is hardship by choice and with a legitimate purpose. Ambrose captures the flavor of the era and the hopes of Jefferson and the nation for the expedition. THe book is both a riveting adventure tale and a look at a nation that was as yet to be defined and explored. The bok is thus intersting as history and will also appeal to those seeking a certain adrenaline rush as the adventurers confront the unknown. I give Ambrose full marks for capturing both of these on paper. He is clearly a great historian and seems very capable of profiling the psychological complexities of his subjects. However, Ambrose's prose, while very good and readable, is not up to the standards of some of his contemporaries. He also needed a better editor. But, I thoroughly enjoyed this book and consider it one of Ambrose's best."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"This book is a must read for anyone interested in American history.

This book filled in a lot of gaps in my knowledge of this great historical occurence. 4 stars because of some rockiness in the flow of the story, and not finishing by telling what happenned in the rest of Clark's life.

Stephen Ambrose was able to able to take what can be mundane history and transform the book into a \\"real life\\" adventure. From reading this book I learned so much about Meriwether Lewis and the Lewis and Clark expedition that I did not know. And this is, I hope, the authors goal in drafting a book like this. The quality in which Ambrose was able to teach may best be explained by the one mistake that I made in reading the book. I noticed that there was an afterword in the book. I do not normally read the end of the book before I have read the complete book, but I read the first sentance of the afterward and learned that Meriwether Lewis . . . (well I do not want to spoil the ending for others.) Let it be said that I did not know the story ended the way it did."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I have read a few of Steven Ambrose's earlier works. They held my attention through out. Somehow, this did not. Although Captains Lewis and Clark must have displayed great leadership and vision, it did not come through in the narration. I had to force myself to read through to its conclusion."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Stephen Ambrose's \\"Undaunted Courage\\" is a moving look at the Lewis and Clark Expedition that shines a spotlight on Meriwether Lewis, the young Army officer who led the expedition (with William Clark) after serving as President Jefferson's personal secretary.Ambrose approaches his subject with the muscular prose befitting such a heroic journey, offering a detailed look at Lewis' preparations for the expedition, its launch in St. Louis, the subsequent addition of the Shoshone woman Sacagawea to the Corps of Discovery and the many adventures that befell the explorers on their trip to the mouth of the Columbia River and back again.In the process, Ambrose weaves Lewis' biography into the larger narrative of the expedition, which proved to be the greatest accomplishment of his all-too-short life.As Ambrose makes clear, the expedition's primary goal was to find what proved to be a nonexistent water route to the Pacific Ocean. In the end, the explorers' accomplishments were much broader in scope than their debunking of what had been a centuries-old belief in the Northwest Passage.A man of many talents who was trained by some of the greatest scientific minds of the day before setting out on his journey, Lewis the explorer also left his mark as a botanist, zoologist and ethnographer before his life took a tragic turn after the expedition drew to a close in 1806.Lewis was a renaissance man of sorts, combining leadership abilities and military know-how with the skills of a scientist, artist, sociologist and psychologist. Yet he also was a troubled man who died in 1809 at the age of 35, an apparent suicide.Ambrose's penchant for waxing rhapsodic about the expedition's greatness can become tiresome. But any deficiencies in \\"Undaunted Courage\\" pale by comparison to the overall strength of Ambrose's prose, the depth of his research, the sharpness of his analysis, the insight gained by his own travels along the expedition's route and his obvious devotion to the legacy of Meriwether Lewis."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I love this book.

To read this book is to truly knowwhat the motivations for the journey were and how inevetableit was that the west was settled.My only criticism of the book is that the last few chaptersseemed hurried, as if Ambrose were so sad about the fate ofLewis that he couldn't bear to write more about it."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"After finishing this book I felt almost like I had been on the expidition. I was tired, depressed and happy to be back. This book could have been many things, but mostly it is a prosaic account of the Lewis and CLark expedition that casts little illumination on the people and actions involved. I never found myself fully engaged in the story and never really got a feel for what it actually meant. Jefferson looms in the background but functions mostly as a bookend to the journey itself.I think I expected more perspective, and certainly more flair in the writing. In truth, I found myself nodding off frequently while reading this - not a good sign when one is reading about one of the great adventures of the 18th century."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Ambrose provides a detailed account of Lewis &amp; Clark and their Corps Discover team's trek as they slowly make their way across territory that was previously unexplored by Americans. He gives a full account of the daily life of various discoveries made and important concerns regarding the most direct but naviagatable routes, as well as the treachours aspects of their 2 1/2 years plus journey of the newly purchased Lousina Territory and onward to the Oregon coast.It is most interesting to read how Lewis and Clark and the team dealt with &quot;savages&quot; and other more friendly Indians as they experienced their cultures. They faced extremes in weather with temperatures -20 or -30, various diseases/illnesses, mosquoitoes, lack of food to the point of near starvation and other dangers of river and horse travel over very rugged terrain, at times to the point of leaving the team in complete and utter exhaustion.I highly recommed this book and without question give it 5 stars and it no doubt is in the same league with other of Ambrose's other excellent works."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"This book is unfortunately hacked to pieces in the abridged audio CD. 20 hours are cut down to 4. Lewis and Clark race across the country in a few hours, then Ambrose summarises the ending. The stories of exploration are fascinating, but I spent too much effort trying to fill in the missing pieces. The unabridged version is probably much better."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Yes, Ambrose provides an entertaining romp through the era of the great Lewis and Clark Expedition. But he commits an awful disservice to readers (and Meriwether Lewis) by painting Lewis as a manic-depressive drug addict who committed suicide. I've read all of the available journals from the expedition, various bios on Lewis, and I've researched various archival material, so I know better than to believe Ambrose's opinion. Ambrose twists the truth, and he omits obviously important material from his book so that his opinion will seem to be fact. Some \\"historian.\\"Did Lewis kill himself? The answer is currently unknowable. My best advice is to read Vardis Fisher's \\"Suicide or Murder?\\" If you can afford to buy and read the set of journals edited by Gary Moulton, you, too, will know better than Ambrose."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Certain deeds are so familiar to us that we lose our sense of perspective on just what was accomplished. Thus, during the recent anniversary of the Moon Landing, I'm sure everyone had a moment where they were sort of taken aback and realized--Holy Cripes! Those guys went to the Moon in a vehicle that's less advanced technologically than my car. Similarly, the journey of Lewis and Clark is one of those things that lurks in your consciousness from grade school on, but you never really think about what they did or what it meant. Stephen Ambrose has provided the perfect remedy for that oversight with this excellent book.Structurally the book is a biography of Meriwether Lewis (1774-1809) with heavy emphasis on the 28-month, 8,000-mile expedition that he lead (ending in September 1806), at President Thomas Jefferson's behest, along with William Clark (1770-1838). Along the way, Ambrose, writing in a nearly conversational style, weighs in on the many controversies surrounding the journey and the participants. He synthesizes the extensive scholarship about the trip, provides ample samples of the journals they kept and draws upon his own personal knowledge of their route. What emerges is, first of all, a sweeping but detailed portrait of the trip, of the hardships and difficulties they faced and of the fortitude and courage that they demonstrated every step of the way. Second, and more importantly, he puts the whole venture into perspective for us. We share in Jefferson's vision of an America that stretches from ocean to ocean; familiar as this is today, there was no certainty that it would become a reality at the time (early 1800's). Ambrose nearly overwhelms us with the sheer volume of physical geography and species of flora and fauna that these men discovered. From April through November of 1805 they were in territory that was completely unmapped. (Had their journals and maps been published more rapidly, virtually every river and physical feature from the Missouri River to the Pacific Ocean would bear the names that they originated.) Finally, as the story wends it's way to the tragic conclusion, when a lonely, debt burdened and deeply depressed Lewis shot himself to death in a travelers lodge on the Natchez Trace, one can't help feeling that America had lost one of it's greatest heroes.Ambrose has done a great job of recapturing the drama and the deeper meaning of a chapter from our history that is all too easily taken for granted.GRADE: A-"},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"This book was very dissapointing. I started it thinking I was going to learn some history and get a good adventure story at the same time. Instead, I got really bogged down about half way through the book in all the minute details of Lewis and Clark's trip-- first they walked here, then they walked there, then one tripped, then the other yawned, etc. After a while it was all the same, and I didn't much care what happened to them.

While clearly a fan of the two explorers, he does not hesitate to note his opinions, which he discusses in detail, of errors of judgement and the fortunes of luck. He notes clearly that the success of the journey, and of their safety, rested on a occasional encounters with small numbers of friendly native Americans, most of whose names are lost to history. The stories of the teenage boys who led them eastward back across the mountains was especially poignant. While not a comprehensive book detailing the full scope of politics of the time, the book weaves the journey into the national debates and conflicts between Jefferson and Congress. Contains an excellent biography for further reading. In addition, there were several excellent maps (although the inclusion of current state lines would have been useful)."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"If you have any interest in the outdoors at all, read this. You will come away with a great appreciation for the courage, skill, determination, and luck of the men of the Corps of Discovery."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"This book, which appears to be meticulously researched, chronicles perhaps the greatest adventure in which Americans ever participated that did not involve a war. All through this book, I could imagine myself as a member of this party experiencing this marvelous foray into the uncharted and unknown. All in all, a very fine book by a writer who possesses great skill. It is pleasing to see (by the number and enthusiasm of the reviews) such interest in this work of history."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Fascinating account of Lewis, Clarke and Jefferson...great flow and style"},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Although the book is concerned with Lewis and Clark, the underlying current leads the reader to glimpses of Thomas Jefferson and, by reading between the lines, one can see Jeffersonian ideas as we have not been used to in other books just a about this president."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Ambrose brings one of the most thrilling journeys of American history alive for the reader. I found myself able to imagine the plains covered with buffalo and the rigors of travel. I walked each of the 8,000 miles with the Corps of Discovery and was fascinated with every turn of the Missouri. The characters come alive as does the science and politics of early America. This book is a must read for anyone interested in the history of early America and the opening of the west."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"This is a labor of love, culminating 20 years of personal involvement. I am very glad indeed that Mr. Ambrose finally decided to write this book. As in other writings, the author leaves no doubt about his likes and dislikes. Clearly, he likes hte Indians better that most of his characters. As to their misdeeds, &quot;all is forgiven&quot;. Only stealing doesn't sit so well. One must remember that Mr. Ambrose write about Meriwether Lewis and Thomas Jeffersom - and not primarily about the expedition. Therefore, I cannot figure out why he will not take a better guess at the last year's of Lewis' life. Clearly, the man had achieved his life's goal and was now rudderless and without purpose; that would explain why he never touched the journals again: all that had taken place in another life. The maps are awful. But the story is incredible, showing what a man can do if he gets off the couch...."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Ambrose's study of Lewis was very instructive, in that it details a man's life, his many failings and achievements. Lewis never reached his potential, however, he acheieved more than most men would if they lived three lifetimes. Book should be read by all who are interested in the history of the United States and the price paid by individuals to create the nation we now know."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I don't see how anyone could rate this book as less than the most enjoyable biography of the 90's."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"This book is a must read for anyone who has even a passing interest in American History. As a teacher of U.S. History, this book has helped me understand and appreciate the importance of this momentous journey in regards to the eventual settling of the frontier."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Ambrose's treatment of the Lewis and Clark journey is meticulous in most aspects. So much so, that I actually came away with LESS respect for Lewis than I had before reading the book.Lewis was born into privilege, and used his unearned station in life to secure the assignment of the century - explore the vast reaches of the Missouri and Columbia rivers watersheds. He treated the Indians as children, his men as minions, and finally himself as an undaunted fool by killing himself. The details in the book are well-researched and the trek is described in such detail that the reader gains a full, day-to-day understanding of the trek.However, the last 80 pages of the book could have been cut in half with no real sacrifice. At that point it kind of droned on about Lewis as a bureaucrat and a loser in that role. The other salient comment I have is that I kept expecting a table listing all members of the party and perhaps a little detail about each. After all, they really made it happen while Lewis was off killing any animal that moved.This all sounds negative, but the book was very well written about a historical - if ill-fated - figure we have all been taught to admire."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"What a word picture Ambrose paints of this wonderfull and dangerous experience. I understand that he has been to a lot of the locations that the L&C; expedition traveled.We are planning a paddlewheel excursion of the Columbia and Snake rivers out of Portland this spring. This book and other accounts of this expedition will give us a better appreciation of this historic event."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Great book. Inspired me to keep a journal. Outstanding research, great narrative, and complete. A must read."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Detailed and fascinating account of the journey. Many primary sources make this an intriguing account of the struggle to reach the coast . . . and get back . . . alive! The the personal diffences and similarities between Lewis and Clark keep creeping up in the book. Ambrose puts this peice together in a form that holds the reader as well as would a fictional story, well done.It also makes watching movies like \\"Almost Heros\\" (Chris Farley and Matthew Perry, 1998) really funny, too."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Undaunted Courage, along with the equally excellent Band of Brothers, stands as one of the late Ambrose's greatest achievements. Ambrose always succeeded in making history come brilliantly to life, wiping all the cobwebs from dry academia and inspiring his readers to share in his unbridled passion.In many ways, Undaunted Courage may be his finest work for Ambrose writes using no first person source material. With his canon of WWII histories, Ambrose was able to interview living history and record those unique experiences for all posterity.With the Lewis and Clark expedition, his task is far more daunting as he attempts to breathe life into an epic journey that occurred two hundred years ago.Using journals, and as always, a wide and exhaustive bibliography, Ambrose, as in all his work, makes the past personal and immediate. Using his interpretive powers, he manages to portray Lewis and Clark as three dimensional characters with warts and faults. He also makes their journey breathe with suspense, tension and the overwhelming beauty of the natural world. Ambrose never lets the reader forget the sheer awesome task that Lewis and Clark set out to do. Their struggles for survival on the expansive frontier make for an often white knuckled page turning experience.Undaunted Courage is simply an excellent and entertaining read."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Ambrose did a fantastic job of chronicling the journey of Lewis and Clark. When I first heard about it, I knew I had to have it. It's one of those books I had a hard time putting down to go to bed. A lot of history and a lot of great information about America's past"},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"For anyone who is seduced by wide skies, un-impeeded winds, and elbow room, this book transports you like no other. Because much of it is from the original journal of Meriweather Lewis, it smacks of authenticity. Few contemporary writers (Mary Taylor Young, with her new book, Land of Grass and Sky is one) can match Stephen Ambrose's upfront, clean, picture-painting prose.This book and Land of Grass and Sky are two must-reads for anyone who cares about and wants to understand better our Western expanses."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"PUTS YOU INSIDE LEWES AND CLARKS BODY AND MIND.

LEWES ENDING IS A TRUE WASTE AND SHOWS HOW MEDICINE HAS ADVANCED IN TWO HUNDRED YEARS. A REMARKABLE JOURNEY."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I was given this book as a gift by my future Father-in-Law who is a big Lewis &amp; Clark fan. I started reading because...well he was my future father-in-law, come on! What I wasn't prepared for was the way in which Ambrose is able to project his love of Lewis &amp; Clark and the Corps of Discovery onto the reader.Ambrose is able to skillfully blend the text of the original journals with his own prose in such a way as to keep you feeling a sense of dialogue within historical non-fiction.His descriptions of the sights that the expeditioners saw and excite the mind and inspire a person to want to follow the trail. If you ever thought that the Lewis &amp; Clark journey was not worth much more than the paragraph it gets in most history books, you'll be pleasantly surprised and intrigued to find a lot more depth here.The book does slow down near the end, however. Once Lewis &amp; Clark return to St. Louis from their amazing journey, the book becomes extremely anti-climactic."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"This book tells a truly amazing and inspiring story. The fact that a group of less than 30 men and 1 woman were able to make it to the Pacific and back, with all the obstacles they faced, is amazing. Without this type of bravery and free-spirited exploration, the expansion into the West would have been slowed.I also couldn't believe how brazen these explorers were in some situations, and how they seemed to have no fear.This book is inspiring in that it shows what can be accomplished by individuals if they put their mind to it.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"This is a wonderfully researched book and well-executed as solid, novelistic nonfiction. But I had a problem: Ambrose didn't know how to build to the climax of reaching the Pacific. In fact, I had to go back a few pages to confirm that the ultimate destination had been reached! This was a shame, and I blame the editor as much as the writer for not structuring an effective denouement to an otherwise admirable work."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"The book details the Lewis and Clark expeditions beginning in 1803, and ending with their last voyage in September 1809. There are illustrations and drawings, along with maps tracing the journeys through a wild and wooly American frontier. The book is very descriptive and very lengthy, at 521 pages. From the beginning, Stephen Ambrose describes Meriwether Lewis as an adventurer, a naturalist, and ever eager for a new adventure. The oil painting by Charles Peale was a nice touch. There was a lot of information regarding Meriwether's boyhood and growing up in young America. I got the impression that he was a pretty rough and tumble kid, just the sort of personality you'd expect from a person of the frontier. Even his mother was pictured as a self-sufficient individual. I liked the part about her killing the deer and having it prepared by the time the men returned home from &quot;hunting&quot;. If I were going to live in the wilderness with Indians in the woods, I would've wanted her there. Stating the book is long is a tremendous understatement. It is immense, full of detailed descriptions of the players at the time, the equipment, armaments, the vessels, everything. Maybe a bit overdone. There are also references to events and relationships with present day situations. For example, Lewis' Newfoundland &quot;Seaman&quot; delighted everyone in catching and killing several black squirrels, providing for the hot meal that evening. It was a good imaginative representation of the time period and the first journey. I don't feel it was necessary to add that there are almost no black squirrels left today. We humans know we have dealt most wild animals a terrible hand. My objections though are few. The descriptions of the land, the journey, and the cultures that were encountered were well written. This is the kind of book that should be read at a slower pace, stopping at times to reflect on what it must have been like back then. Besides getting to know Lewis and Clark, the book affords a personal view of President Thomas Jefferson. I highly recommend the book for anyone who likes an adventure, and especially is proud to be an American."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"As an amateur student of Thomas Jefferson and his life, the tale of the Lewis and Clark Expedition has always intrigued me. I have not found a better telling of that story than Stephen Ambrose's book, Undaunted Courage. The book provides a vivid account of early America and insight into what Jefferson and others did and did not know about our country during that time. Anyone interested in Jefferson history should read this book.The story of Meriwether Lewis, William Clark and the men of The Expedition is a gripping tale told in vivid detail with a sense of adventure. I would love to have made the trip with them, although I would have probably died en route. These men were rugged frontiersmen and soldiers the likes of whom I have not met in modern day America.The following passage from the book shows how different an America Lewis and Clark lived in and how much effort Mr. Ambrose put into this work: &quot;In addition, it seemed unlikely that one nation could govern an entire continent. The distances were just too great. A critical fact in the world of 1801 was that nothing moved faster than the speed of a horse. No human being, no manufactured item, no bushel of wheat, no side of beef (or any beef on the hoof, for that matter), no letter, no information, no idea, order, or instruction of any kind moved faster. Nothing ever had moved any faster, and, as far as Jefferson's contemporaries were able to tell, nothing ever would.&quot;We are fortunate that much of the Lewis and Clark field samples and journals survived and that Mr. Ambrose has taken such care in giving us this historically accurate account of The Expedition. Anyone who as seen the newly minted year 2000 golden dollar coins and been curious about the Indian maiden, Sacagawea, on the coin should read this book. Lewis and Clark very likely would have been killed during the trip without her help.This is a great book, read it."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"This is an interesting, well written book. However, books like these are problematic for the Kindle because of the difficulty in flipping back and forth between the references, maps, and text. When you look up something in the reference section (which is at the end of the book), Kindle marks this spot as the furthest point read. So when you open the book again or start reading the book on another synced device (e.g., phone, laptop), it goes to the reference section not to the page you last read (this makes it difficult to find the page you last read unless you memorized the page number before closing the book). Similarly, it is not user friendly when going to a map (front of the book) and back to the page that was being read. I suggest a hard copy of the book for the best experience."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"This is perhaps my favorite biographies/historical pieces!!! (Next to Hannibal - which is too long and too boring for most people by far!!!) This is about the Lewis and Clark Expedition. It's astoundingly well-written and really puts you into the time and mindset of what it took to be one of the first astronauts!Why is it put that way?...because going West in those days was the same as going to the moon was in the 1960's! It took the whole nation to pull it off. People really thought there were monsters and who knows what past St. Louis. Thomas Jefferson sought to find men of \\"courage undaunted\\" to pull off the mission. Captains Lewis and Clark were drafted. They were considered the best of the best...two of the most courageous men in the United States. Great book! It was given to me by my mentor years ago. Just sharing!!"},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"One of the best historical books I've read. It's full of detail and human interest, and brings out the character of Lewis,and, to a lesser extent, Clark. Of particular importance to me are the excellent maps. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to know about the great exploration by exemplary leaders."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Point: The life of Meriwether Lewis was filled with the most fascinating adventures, highest of achievements, and the most bitter of sorrow. A man in himself can never fully recover from his past, no matter how illustrious or infamous.Path: Ambrose tracks the life of Meriwether Lewis from beginning to end, while focusing primarily on the incredible journey from Coast to Coast during the years of 1803-1806.Sources: Ambrose thoroughly does his homework and acquaints the reader with the journals, letters, articles and accounts surrounding this amazing life.Agreement: This was a fascinating book for two reasons. First, the endeavor was one of the most daunting and challenging ever faced. Second, the author was thorough and interesting. Some of the greatest tales ever told are not over exaggerations, but under exaggerations! What Lewis and Clark saw and experienced can never be fully imagined. It was also revealing in regard to what those from the Enlightenment would call the \\"noble savage.\\" Neither the \\"civilized explorers\\" nor \\"primitive Indians\\" acted in noble ways when faced with immoral opportunities.Disagreement: Lewis' final depression which brought upon his suicide was given many names, but it appears to me that he was haunted by his failures and turned to his own sources of comfort - alcohol, drugs, and finally death.Personal App: This tale pushes me to reach for the unknown - wherever it may hide.Favorite Quote: \\"Finally the party returned, with Cruzatte, who absolutely denied having shot the captain and swore he had never heard Lewis call to him.\\" (after Lewis was shot in the backside by one of his own men! No wonder he never admitted to it.)"},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Stumbled onto these reviews as I was ordering this book for my son to read. Every young man with an adventurous spirit should read this book.As someone mentioned, the first third or so is a bit of a slow read, laying out the formative years of Lewis and the extensive trip prep. Once they hit the river it's hard to put down. What makes the book transform into an experience that comes alive is the array of anecdotal insights culled from a massive research effort. You begin to appreciate how many times the whole trip could have gone south and they would have never been heard from again. Also, if you're a camper you'll laugh at the Murphy's Law nature of the journey.If you like this book, I found another Ambrose book even more interesting - the awkwardly named \\"Nothing Like It in the World\\" about building the transcontinental railroad. It's nice to read this one first though because of the natural chronological progression of the two narratives."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"First, let me say I thoroughly enjoyed the majority of this book. I knew hardly anything about the expedition, and learned a ton. If you're looking to do the same, this book is a must read. The struggles these men endured where amazing, and to think that they lived to tell about it is beyond belief.The only problems that I had with this book is that it spent a little too much time on Lewis' life before and after the expedition. I believe the first 80 pages could have, at the very least, been cut in half. There are some things that we did need to know about Lewis' background and the state of American affairs at the time, but there were other things that made it absolutely necessary to know about because they had an effect on the expedition. I also found the last 80-ish pages to be dull as well. Again, there are things that we need to know about the outcome of the expedition, but we learned way too much about Lewis' affairs after the expedition. Maybe it's just me, but I found a lot of to be rather dry and dull.When you actually get into the meat of the book, it's fascinating. I wish more time had been spent on the actual expedition. This might have been from a lack of information, but it's my understanding that when Lewis did not enter into his journal, Clark or other men from the expedition did."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Before reading this magnificent book, the only thing I knew about Lewis and Clark was from fragments of the History Channel or PBS Ken Burns specials. The book is worth reading and re-reading..it is that good. Stephen Ambrose offers such a delicious distillation of the great adventure that was the \\"Corps of Discovery\\" and \\"Lewis and Clark\\" and the times they lived in that you hate to have it all end after 484 pages of illumination. There isn't a page that doesn't deliver something exceptional.For the particulars, there are plenty of excellent reviews here. Suffice it to say that this extraordinary man, uniquely outfitted to successfully accomplish this unimaginable 2 1/2 year feat of exploring eight thousand miles of wild, extremely dangerous, and uncharted lands of the \\"Upper Missouri\\" and the \\"Great Northwest\\" territories, was in the end, undermined by an inadvertent flawed decision by Jefferson to appoint him as governor of the Louisiana Territory. Add to that the near impossible task of managing frontier politics and you have the making of a Greek Tragedy...which it was."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"This book is a great read, however it is a little slow at times. Very detailed and thorough and Ambrose makes you feel like you are right there with the Corps."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I have read a lot of his work. I find it accurate and interesting. I have a History minor and especially like Revolutionary times, Civil War times, and World War II. The development of our county is of special interest. I live near where the exploration started and have visited some of the sites at its beginning."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I feel as if I am traveling with the Lewis and Clark expedition. I am walking with the early Americans as they move westward. I am frustrated by the slowness of communication and thrilled by the visions of my contemporaries, like Thomas Jefferson, and the unbridled excitement of individuals exploring new territory. The author writes with the art of a true storyteller and inducts the reader into past history as if it were unfolding in the minute."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I found this book enlightening since it included a number of \\"plates\\" with relevant map information for the period of the travels. The author has put the details from many sources into the actual adventure that this became. I never understood the geographic limits of the Louisiana Purchase, and this exposes it with clarity. Good book."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Ambrose did a spectacular job bringing the early 19th century alive in these pages. It is evident, with the citations, the footnotes and bibliography that this was well researched and a labor of love.I knew right away in the intro as he mentioned how he took annual camping trips with family, friends and students to various parts of the Lewis and Clark trail that this meant a lot to him as the author. He didn't disappoint.He painted a great picture and provided well balanced background info to all the major characters (Lewis, Clark, Jefferson) and went well beyond just the journey to the Pacific Ocean and back. I appreciated the background info on Jefferson's debate with Congress over funding for the trip.And Ambrose did a great job showing all the painstaking efforts of making the journey. It was absolutely amazing how much time and energy everyone took to make this happen.I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 because from time to time, I felt a bit overwhelmed with the information that Ambrose presented. and Felt I was on a bit of information overload from time to time.I just recently drove through Yellowstone and saw many signs about the Lewis and Clark trail and plan on rereading this books this coming fall."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I listened to this on audiobook and it was well read and abridged to the most salient points. I learned more of the Native American tribes than I thought I would, which is a strength of this book."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Stephen Ambrose is an amazing author - hands down the best account of what really happened - and when and where it happened - as Lewis & Clark progressed west, and back. It starts by giving the full background of how Lewis was handpicked by Thomas Jefferson for the expedition, how Lewis picked Clark to be his equal and right hand man along the journey, and the immense preparations taken for the trip. The details given throughout the book help the reader to paint a vast picture in their mind as they read. You can easily \\"see\\" each portion of the journey. When I was in grade school, Lewis & Clark were just 2 men who wandered west. There is SO much more to the story and I can't believe how bad I was jipped in grade school. A must read for any history buff."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Excellent, easy read. Very enjoyable. Ambrose always tells a tell remarkably well and it's full of fun facts I was unaware of before now."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Reads like an adventure story as much as history. From Thomas Jefferson, expedition preparations, the Ohio and Missouri Rivers, winter in the Great Plains, the Columbia River and Oregon Territories, its a great adventure from first to last. I can't believe this hasn't been made into a movie."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"A friend loaned me his copy...I finished it this morning at roughly 6 AM, and I'm now ordering a copy of Ambrose's amazing work. Jefferson's time in office/these events, being huge pieces of American history, weren't given enough attention when I was in school.. Jefferson, Lewis, Clark, et al - amazing people. Of course, this is an amazing story! For those scared of facts and figures, this doesn't read like a textbook. I'd say casual reading, but it's hard to put down. Buy the book, read it, and appreciate what people were able to overcome 200+ years ago the next time you're unsure what to pack for a trip to a place you've never been."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Almost all American school children are at one point or another presented with the story of Lewis and Clark and their epic trip across the West. This book finally gives us the true details of the journey. From the tedium of planning to Sacajawea's proper place in the expedition's success, Ambrose takes material culled from Lewis and Clark's journals and his own experience on the trail and crafts a fascinating story of these two men and their adventure across the wilderness. Even Lewis's deterioration and eventual suicide is dealt with clearly and with as much accuracy and compassion as history allows. A phenomenal undertaking and one that will be hard to improve upon."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Stephen Ambrose writes about one of the greatest expeditions in American history. The story of Meriwether Lewis is exceptionally well documented. Ambrose brings the story to life from his youthful days as an aid to Thomas Jefferson through every detail of the Lewis and Clark expedition and his years following as Jefferson's appointed Governor of the Louisiana Territory followed by his tragic suicide. This book is a testimony of courage and leadership, of human possibility even in spite of human weakness. A fabulous read."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Pure and simple, this highly-readable book is a great read, from cover to cover. I was shocked by the tragic last few chapters of Meriweather Lewis' demise -- a story that is certainly never taught in our grade schools! A mesmerizing tale of adventure and captivating enough for a beach book for anyone with even a marginal interest in American history."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Were it not for fascinating books of American history, like this one, episodes of our illustrious, and tragic, past might be easily forgotten. That the Lewis and Clark expedition is an interesting story is an understatement, but what sets this book apart from other interesting books of history is that Ambrose does not allow the reader to shelter himself/herself from the hard personal questions about leadership and personal tragedy. I found myself reflecting on my own style of leadership, and my own personal failures and triumphs. A novel of exploration could not have been better written nor conceived."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"This book reads like a best selling novel, only it's true. If our high schools would use books like Undaunted Courage, history classes would become real for students. I've read several Ambrose books and for me this was the best. I very seldom read books twice, but after two months I zoomed back through this one."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I just read Undaunted Courage by Stephen Ambrose and I can't get enough of the Lewis and Clark expedition.

You've gotten me re-interested in one of my passions in life--the study of American History!Steve in Berea, Kentucky"},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Ambrose is a great storyteller of history. His narrative of UNDAUNTED COURAGE reads like a novel, he paints colorful pictures of the land and wildlife and his characters come to life. I've read just about every book Ambrose has written (his work on W.W. II is unsurpassed), however, I believe this is his best work. This is really what Ambrose loves. His family has spent years of summers following in Lewis and Clark's footsteps.Some people buy a cd for just one song; some see a movie because of one scene from the previews. I think you would buy this book just for pages 464-465 (hardcover edition). The power of these two pages stirs deep poignant emotions of life and death. They are the two best pages written in any history book I've read. Buy it and see for yourself.

It gives a biographical account of Lewis that details the life of a Virginian plantation owner through childhood into his adult years. The importance that land played to plantation owners accounts for Lewi's strong interest in expanding knowledge about land in North America. This land was an untapped resource, Jefferson, as well as other educated people of the time were anxious to discover and obtain what the United States had to offer them. Ambrose clearly emphasizes the political aspects of the expedition. These were to find an all water route to the Pacific Ocean for the benefit of trade. As with all military endevors, the costs of this venture had to be justified. Jeffereson as well as Lewis had to &quot;sell&quot; their proposal to those who were opposed to the idea. Like all things, some, mainly the Federalists in this case, thought the United States already owned enough land. Ambrose does a magnificant job of including the misconceptions about the land, Native Americans, and the expedition itself, without making the reader feel that the American forefathers were uneducated. In fact, Ambrose does quite the opposite. He portrays the vast amount of knowledge that these men knew about their world. The fact that they were hungry for more knowledge of America proves just how educated they were. The wonderful details of everyday life on the expedition included from letters and journal entries allow the reader to feel present. These are the things that make the book different from ordinary history books. We are able to see what Lewis was actually like, how he treated his men, what he thought of Indians, and perhaps more importantly, what he thought of the world around him. Lewis was entering a world that had not been written about, explored, or tamed by any other white man. His descriptions of what are ordinary to us in modern society provide a new appreciation of the United States and all which it stands for."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Going into reading this book, I knew very little in the way of details about the Lewis and Clark expedition, and give Ambrose credit for vividly capturing what America was like in its early days (just the concept of time/space in absence of modern transportation and communications makes you appreciate the context of this point in history). In addition, in reading the story, one truly appreciates just how amazing an accomplishment the expedition was in traversing great distance across the country and back, all the while persevering through unknown trails, sometimes hostile Indians, sickness, forces of nature and the challenges of maintaining morale and discipline over the long haul. Finally, the vision and conviction Thomas Jefferson displayed, not only in green lighting the expedition, but in imaging a cross-continental US at a time when the country was comfortably a wholly east coast entity, is pretty wondrous.Sounds like I should of loved the book, right? Well, the details are compelling and the stories are evocative, but somehow the book fails to come together in a more than the some of the parts fashion. Other reviewers have rightfully pointed out that part of the dissatisfaction of the book is that at the end of the day, Lewis was an enigma whose life didn't have the fairly tale ending that his accomplishments would seem to point to. But more fundamentally, I must say that I find Ambrose's writing style to be bloated, using ten words when two would have accomplished the point. Moreover, his approach was too much that of the historian, conveying all of the facts at the cost of telling a compelling story, full of drama, intrigue and doubt of what await around the bend. It's a shame, because a little better structure (e.g., Ambrose couldn't seem to decide whether Jefferson or Lewis was the main protagonist for good chunks of the book) and a lot crisper editing, would have made an interesting history lesson into a compelling read."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"One elaborate sentence governed the emergence of the American West. It was penned by President Thomas Jefferson to Captain Meriwether Lewis, in 1803: &quot;The object of your mission is to explore the Missouri river, &amp; such principal stream of it, as, by it's [sic] course and communication with the waters of the Pacific ocean, whether the Columbia, Oregan [sic], Colorado or any other river may offer the most direct &amp; practicable water communication across this continent for the purposes of commerce.&quot; With Jefferson's pronouncement the stage is set for Stephen E. Ambrose and Undaunted Courage, his masterful re-telling of the story of the Corps of Discovery, as the expedition members were called, and especially of Lewis, its 30 year-old commander.Foregoing a college education to take over running of the family plantation in Virginia, Lewis was at an early age already an established member of the community. When the Louisiana Purchase became reality, it was to Lewis, his Private Secretary and friend of two years, that Jefferson turned to head the expedition.Accordingly, in May, 1804 Lewis, joined by William Clark and 29 others, crossed the Missouri and began his famous trek to explore the vast plains and mountains beyond the then-limits of civilization. Twenty-eight months later they emerged from the wilderness to a country that had never really expected to see them again.Early chapters are devoted to circumstances surrounding the outfitting of the expedition. Then, in Chapter 8 we set out on this tremendous voyage of discovery, a monumental undertaking that would prove to be a watermark of scientific knowledge of the new continent, achieving high praise for some, and grave disappointment to others. (Lewis had difficulty obtaining success after the expedition, committing suicide in 1809.) Ambrose calls him &quot;the greatest of all American explorers,&quot; and this fine book brings Lewis and his company to life. I think you will enjoy it."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"I want to offer a more reserved review of this book (i.e., one that is not nearly as gushing as many), for which I will probably be flamed. Most readers seem to love the book, and I too was anxious to get into it each evening and finished it with a new appreciation and interest for the L&C; expedition, but I have a few criticisms of the book itself (along with some deserved praise).Ambrose did succeed in doing what he was so good at, which was to take a big-scope historical topic and push it down to \\"our level,\\" all in a conversational and personal tone that makes the reader feel that Ambrose is sitting with you by the fireplace, sharing something interesting that he just read in the newspaper. It's pleasant at times, but at others it seems inappropriate. I felt that there were too many places where Ambrose injected his personal conclusions and suppositions into the narrative (e.g., the topic of Lewis' death is a mystery that will never be solved or settled yet Ambrose really seems to have framed much of the entire book as a set-up for his own theories of Lewis' brilliant despondency, and, really, do any of us really care about Ambrose's haughty 21st century critique of Lewis shooting a potentially superior enemy combatant in the gut?).Ambrose relied heavily (as one must) on the Lewis and Clark journals, from which he quoted often. As a professional historian, he missed an opportunity to add real value to his work by giving the reader more context and perspective from outside of the journals. For example, Ambrose does point out the one precious journal entry of Lewis that sets out a \\"day in the life\\" narrative of a hunting trip. Ok. But I wish that Ambrose would have offered more of that, just based on our very best speculation and knowledge. What did these guys do every night? What did they wear (and wear out, and then what did they wear?)? What were the nightly camps like, exactly? I have no idea. For the investment of reading this book, I can now hold my own with the average tourist in line at a Lewis and Clark related site (as I experienced recently), but I don't really know if I am much more informed beyond that. In the end, this book is really just a heavily annotated and digested edition of the journals.Of course, the journals do not provide the biographical context nor any prelude or postlude information, but if it is the journey itself that you want to know about, then the journals are what you should read. In reviewing the journals recently, I noticed that the authors (L&C;) virtually stopped writing in the last few weeks of the journey, as they raced down the Missouri to St. Louis. Ambrose did the same in his book - only he failed to point out his reason (that is, that L&C; gave him no material to work from). I thought that he was simply as bored with the topic as his readers would become.Anyway - this is a good book that serves as an adequate introduction to the topic, or as a one-stop summary of the L&C; expedition that could carry you a lifetime if you never plan to read anything else. It is not, and should not be regarded, as the definitive work on the topic. For that, one should consult the originals, Lewis and Clark."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"The book makes you feel as though you are with the Corps of Discovery, every step of the way.

The journey, made when America's image was still being created, showed early 19th-century America at its best -- deploying the scientific legacy of Enlightenment and the potential for a respectful exploration of the lands and peoples of the American interior.Stephen Ambrose restrains his sometimes-annoying habit of celebrating every American exploit and trains his sights on an event that captures the imagination of Americans and others fully two centuries later. As with other epic journeys in real life, the Lewis and Clark expedition was a team effort requiring the talents of many. From the inspiration granted by President Jefferson, to the organizational and scientific skills of Lewis and Clark, to the language and negotiation skills of Sacagawea, to the efforts, strength and resilience of the 40-some-odd others in the \\"Corps of Discovery,\\" the expedition relied on the bravery, endurance and intellect of all.The modern idea of \\"roughing it\\" involves driving an RV over an interstate highway into a pre-constructed campsite with electricity, running water and waste services. The Corps of Discovery schlepped a 55-foot boat and tons of supplies by hand up uncharted rivers, across plains cloudy with misery-inducing mosquitoes and among possibly-hostile natives. Losing only a single man, Lewis and Clark managed to reach the Pacific, map the interior of the continent and return with a wealth of information about the inhabitants of the land -- human, floral and faunal. Ambrose's description of the supplies that L&C; took along (including plenty of poisonous mercury pills to combat the team's anticipated venereal excesses) were hilariously instructive. What would *you* bring on a 3-year voyage to chart an unknown and probably dangerous land?Ambrose is at his best in this book, describing the courage and adaptability of Lewis and Clark without shying away from the trip's disappointments. From the point of view of the participants, the trip was somewhat of a bust -- no easy passage to the Pacific, and a loss of some samples and notebooks. The sad fate of some of the trek's participants underlines the reality that heroism is less seen in constant nobility and perfection than in facing the rugged, unknowable slog that requires simple endurance and the will to soldier on.What an inspiring book!"},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Ambrose tells the story about Meriwether Lewis, a close confidant of President Jeffereson, who Jefferson sent to explore the Americam West. Lewis teamed up with William Clark and although Lewis was commissioned as a captain and Clark as a lieutenant, Lewis magnanimously shared command with him. Along with the rest of the expedition and guides and interpreters they picked up along the way, Lewis and Clark heroically reached the Pacific Ocean.They mapped uncharted territory that no white person had ever seen. They sought a water route to the Pacific along the Missouri and Columnbia Rivers but, such a route was not available forcing many miles of portaging. They had to deal with many different Indian tribes and, until well into the return trip, they successfully avoided any armed conflict. Indeed, they picked up a young Indian woman and her white husband along the way and the two joined the expedition. She was heroic as she travelled with them while five months pregnant and bore a child along the way. She was invaluable as an interpreter and interceder.The journey was full of obstacles which the expedition overcame. There were no telegraph lines back then and travel was by boat or horse. There were no roads, only Indian trails. Often rivers forked and they had to guess at which was the river they were following and which was a tributary leading to another desination. By losing communication, they had to be filled in on whether Jefferson was still president when they returned because they had no news for the entire time they were west of St. Louis. This is a marvelous tale, well told by a great historian."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Don't buy the abridged audio version.

Ambrose himself goes to great length to point this out. One wonders if some reviewers caught on to this conspicuous difference. Undaunted Courage is worthwhile reading and a lot of fun. The best parts of the book focus on Lewis's Virginia roots, his relationship with Jefferson, and the leadership qualities of both Lewis and Clark during the expedition. The writer highlights the exceptional and worthy contributions Lewis made to natural science during their journey. Ambrose's treatment of the tragic decline of his subject toward suicide is balanced, thoughtful, and respectful. If there is a weakness to this book it is the familiar tendency of Ambrose to slip into slang to keep his material readable. Popular history has its trade-offs, I suppose.This biography might be disappointing to serious historians but won't disappoint the average reader."},{"Title":"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","review":"Stephen E. Ambrose was a preeminent popularizing historian whose focus was on events in American history that were both impressive and successful. Events that would impart a feel-good, patriotic warmth, suitable to be recalled by any 4th of July speaker.Band of Brothers: E Company, 506th Regiment, 101st Airborne from Normandy to Hitler's Eagle's Nestwas both a wildly successful book, as well as TV series, which related the history of one company of the 101st Airborne Division, from the Normandy D-Day landing all the way deep into Germany. He wrote several other books on America's victory over Nazi Germany. He also wrote a biographyEisenhower Soldier and Presidentand a history of the construction of the transcontinental railwayNothing Like It In the World: The Men Who Built the Transcontinental Railroad 1863-1869. \\"Undaunted Courage\\" tells the story of the Lewis and Clark expedition, when America was still very young. The expedition was authorized and funded by President Thomas Jefferson, in part to gain a better understanding of what he had just purchased from France, called the Louisiana Purchase. The land acquired in the purchase is 23% of the lower 48 states today. Stephen Ambrose has received numerous honors, and I recently saw that part of Interstate-10, near Bay St. Louis, MS, is named in his honor. Which prompted this re-review of one of his classics, written 15 years ago.It is a \\"meaty\\" book of 500 pages. The first 80 or so pages set the historical stage for the expedition. The vast majority of the book depicts the expedition itself. Lewis and Clark, and their men, departed from camp, along the Mississippi just north of St. Louis, in May, 1804, and followed the course of the Missouri river deep into present day Montana. They winter camped with the Mandan Indians in present day North Dakota. Ambrose relates the drama with verve. Details, such as the caloric intake requirements of each expedition member are so telling in terms of the exhausting work in moving their canoes upriver. Later, on the far side of the Rockies, they descend what would be classified as Class VI rapids today, without accident, and of course, without those mandatory safety helmets of today. In particular, this book has inspired me to see the Bitterroot Range in Idaho that the expedition had to struggle over. As is well-known, the expedition did make it to the Pacific, spending the next winter at the mouth of the Columbia River, between present day Oregon and Washington states. They managed to return to St. Louis in the summer of 1806, confirming that it is a lot easier going back down a river. Kudos were indeed in order for the expedition's leaders; however the denouement for Meriweather Lewis was not a glorious one. He was haunted by depression, and although there is still considerable controversy over the circumstances of his death, Ambrose comes down on the side of suicide as oppose to murder.Alas, the biography of Stephen Ambrose is not as untainted as the glorious episodes of American history that he prefers to focus upon. I didn't realize that when I first read this book, and feel \\"hoodwinked,\\" if not more. The evidence is now rather overwhelming that Ambrose was a chronic, serial, plagiarist. Furthermore, on numerous occasions he has played free and fast with the facts, for example, on the number of times he met with Eisenhower, and the dates, for Ambrose's biography of him. The biography of Ambrose at Wikipedia is full of additional material on this matter, and Google can retrieve some equally good articles in Slate magazine. Such information tends to totally discredit the \\"Undaunted Courage\\" account of Lewis and Clark's expedition. Sure, I felt good, and still want to see the Bitterroot range, but what was fact, and what was embroidery will remain a nagging question, awaiting a more honest author. A similar situation occurred with Greg Mortenson'sThree Cups of Tea: One Man's Mission to Promote Peace . . . One School at a Time. I was admittedly \\"taken in\\" by both accounts, and wonder now why I did not read each more critically. I note that Amazon reviewers have now posted numerous critical accounts on Mortenson's book, but in general, this has not occurred to Ambrose. Why? Well, in the meantime, saved from the ultimate ignominy of a lone star by the inspiration to see the Bitterroots, I'll give it 2-stars."},{"Title":"The theory of the leisure class,: An economic study of institutions","review":"Sad to say, the Dover durables of midcentury and beyond are gone (if not forgotten); but when this value-price line was introduced in the mid-'90s, this book in particular was very welcome. Herein (though not exclusively) we find Veblen supplying an alternative to Nietzsche, specifically *Beyond Good and Evil*. This is a book about morals, or the lack of them; but coming from a man who all-but-assaulted his estranged wife with &quot;notions&quot; one ought not to expect a rousing defense of bourgeois morality. Rather an unstinting defense of some other way of life (such as is provided in his impossibly rare *Instinct of Workmanship*) what we have here is a Grand-Guignol treatment of the &quot;life-lie&quot; Veblen calls conspicuous consumption, which just might happen to exclude Symbolist &quot;vitalism&quot; (and as to the provenance of the concept &quot;dolicho-blond&quot;, consult Veblen's essay on the American small town).

So it was with Einstien and theoretical physics, and so it is with economics and Thorstein Veblen as described in this book. Mr. Veblen descended from Norwegian immigrants to the US, and lived in the Midwest from the late 1800s to early 1900s. With a keen eye and insightful mind, he took in the huge economic growth of the US and the beginnings of mass consumerism and corporate advertising in the American population. What he saw was the formation of a middle and upper class that had both idle time and money to spare. Together, this created a leisure class that defined respect, social standing, and self-worth in terms of \\"pecuniary emulation\\", i.e. spending money on stuff and entertainment just because one could. Like a zoologist examining wild animals, Veblen picks apart the rituals, clothing, speech, and consumption habits of this newly rich. All of this is recorded and explained in extraordinary and sometimes comical detail in this book. Upon publication, this book became the first great work of economics by an American author, and made Veblen famous.

No doubt he did see ' social phenomenom' that were emerging and succeeded in finding the 'name ' for them. 'Leisure class' and ' conspicuous consumption' are part of the everyday vocabulary of the description and analysis of 'social life'. I know that Veblen was particularly hard upon the nouveau riche, those trying to prove by buying and having more that they were as good or better than ' old money'. However I wonder if in ' work ethic' America there is not also another kind of phenomenom, of people of great wealth feeling a special social obligation, as multibillionaires Gates and whether for good purposes or not, Ted Turner have displayed in recent years. I also have a problem with making the concept of ' leisure' an entirely pejorative one. What about those ' surpluses' at the state of the agricultural age which Lewis Mumford said were so key in creating civilization? Isn't it true that in many societies those who do not have to do productive work were freed for higher work of mind and spirit? I wonder then that is whether Veblen's condemnation of the 'leisure class ' is too ' blanket' a one in many ways. And this without denying the truths that great wealth often corrupts, leads to arrogance, and indolence, folly and waste. For years the conception of the US was of a society in which the middle class element was predominant, a society reflecting an equality of opportunity and the fact that the majority of people had been able to in time and through work raise themselves to a good level of life. The decline of the middle class in the sense of the growing gap between very rich and very poor is a fact of life in America. Perhaps this makes Veblen's analysis of a certain part of American society more pertinent. But again I think that there is a counter- tradition emerging in which many of the very wealthy assume that the way to real respect in the eyes of the public is in doing good for others."},{"Title":"The theory of the leisure class,: An economic study of institutions","review":"Conspicuous consumption describes the phenomenon of buying a product or service not for its utility or necessity but because of its prestige factor or impressive social value. Mr. Veblen's book is described as a satire, pointing out the hypocrisy and shallowness of the leisure or wealthy class. I am only partly through this book but I am finding it very thought provoking.If Mr. Veblen thought that consumption had a negative conspicuousness, indicative of a hypocritical nature among the wealthy of his day, I can only imagine what he would think of our entire culture today. It seems to me in our present society we have taken conspicuous consumption, beyond the hypocritical and the satirical and into the realm of the obnoxious, the immoral and even the criminal. This really isn't an economics book, nor would I say that it is scientific or academic in nature.It is more the thoughtful extrapolation of an intelligent, thoughtful and educated individual. Thorstein Veblen is more academic than Mark Twain and not quite as humorous. But he is very entertaining and extremely thought provoking. His style is much like Galbraith's - wordy, circular and humor so subtle that if you are not paying attention you could easily miss it. I am enjoying this book.Richard Edward Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:\\"Hobo-ing America: A Workingman's Tour of the U.S.A..\\""},{"Title":"The theory of the leisure class,: An economic study of institutions","review":"I have found it quite amusing to read Veblen's book is depicted as a classic by those who like it (you know, considering that he, more than once, states that the appeal of classics is due largely to the leisure class scheme). Perhaps the unique, brilliant, at times repetitive and dull, at times invariably amusing, and always surprising tone and ideas Veblen has made their indelible mark, but I think that perhaps he would have said that those who admire his book solely as a classic cannot properly understand its message.From his anthropological analysis of the rise of the predatory and peaceable instincts to his ridicule of contemporary (ca. 1900) institutions and customs (I think his theories on clothing apparel, sports, and religion stand out) to his very serious critique of waste and exploit, Veblen wrote an incredibly interesting, unconventional theory. Undoubtedly, to my apprehension, direct and vicarious conspicuous waste (the most famous variant being direct conspicuous consumption) is the most interesting concept presented in the book, yet this is exclusively associated with the rich and what they do. No doubt, the rich's excesses must have been what prompted Veblen to write the book in the first place, but I think the more universal message is overlooked. He repeats this over and over: the leisure class scheme of life pervades society.I do not know if those who appreciate the book see that Veblen makes the case that conspicuous waste is EVERYWHERE. Those who command the scheme are those who we might identify to be the rich, sure, but how can we deny we are not all part of it? Veblen says that \\"any consumer who might, Diogenes-like, insist on the elimination of all honorific or wasteful elements from his consumption, would be unable to supply his most trivial wants in the modern market.\\" To him, I am sure, stripes on a shirt would have seemed wasteful, and a regrettable vestige of some eccentric attempt at invidious pecuniary emulation. Veblen's notion of waste is constructed to be universal, but in varying gradations (which is why he identifies waste most prominently with the leisure class).All this being said, Veblen is quite far from being perfect. The book does consider that there are motives and actions that are not guided by the leisure class' predatory instinct, but is at times vague in dealing with such things. Moreover, some of his explanations are on occasion convoluted or simplified so as to make them fit his general framework. Notwithstanding, anyone who has any interest in reading a great theory about how the rich ultimately dictate many of society's customs and institutions by inciting the lesser instincts that make consumerism possible, or in being amused by a sardonic critique of how wasteful our society can be, should turn to this book.A word of caution: To make a point, Veblen uses a language that would be today considered tedious and cumbersome, perhaps needless and excessively verbose at times, so be ready to deal with that. (I think that, unless pointed out, the fact that it is inferable that Veblen does this to make a point might go unnoticed. At the end of the book he states that usage of proper, preferably archaic language is observed precisely because it is useful and not up to date; this language is preferred because they \\"argue waste of time and exemption from the use and the need of direct and forcible speech.\\" The way in which he writes his book is the last, perhaps most subtle, sardonic bit of satire he offers us.)"},{"Title":"The theory of the leisure class,: An economic study of institutions","review":"Some of the most influential and important studies of America and American life have been authored by visitors from other lands. One such example is this political study of economic man, The Theory of the Leisure Class. Authored by Thorstein Veblen, an immigrant from Scandinavia who settled in the Eastern US, this book examines the behavior of the rich and wanna-be rich in the US at the end of the 19th century.Defining the growing upper class of Americans who owned land, dressed nicely, showered daily and read the latest gossip as the \\"leisure class\\", Veblen proceeds to dissect their behaviors and actions and its causes and effects. The author shows how much of this behavior had no practical economic benefit, but instead served to advertise social success instead. As such, this is one of the first major works to apply Darwinian thought to social evolution and human behavior. Terms such as conspicious consumption and consumerism would spring forth from this book and those that followed in its wake.The book itself is quite easy to read for an economics treatise. Few are the numbers, fewer are the equations.

Turns out the guy was from Wisconsin, not Sweden, and that he was a master satirist, not an economist or sociologist, and that he died in 1929 at the ripe old age of 72. He gets a special award for using the word &quot;honorific&quot; over and over, and another commendation for making breathtakingly sweeping generalizations about human history and social development, and about contemporary (circa early 1900s) industrial relationships with ZERO (!) reference to data, and a dismissal of any need for any empirical verification of his conclusions. The conclusions themselves loop around themselves like a biplane seriously out of control, and in the end this mainly entertains. And in the propwash, we get new terms that have joined the English language: Conspicuous consumption, conspicuous waste, canons of respectability, and even skiing terms like &quot;traverse&quot; which could also, in our &quot;post-predatory&quot; culture, be a legal term from common law pleading.

Wrong.Thorstein Veblen - 1857-1929 - and I only checked these details after reading this book - was one of many children of Norwegian immigrants into the USA. They were, or may have been, ripped off, though his father seems to have made money afterwards - I'd guess via a gift of land from the US governement, though if so he seems to have been ungrateful. 'The Theory of the Leisure Class', published in 1899 when he was about 42, caused a stir - or at least that's the story. It precedes Ida Tarbell on Standard Oil by a couple of years.Veblen's writing style is agonisingly plodding, repetitive and dull. He includes a few Latin and other tags. This must have been a deliberate attempt to project an educated image. He took time to explain his use of some English terms (e.g. 'invidious'). Part of his effect is achieved by using words in slightly the wrong sense. He used 'evolution' rather than 'change' - it sounded more up to date. His typescript (or MS) must have been the sort publishers' readers dreaded. I can't quote a sample here for space reasons.----His model of human history is very simple indeed. There *WERE* two types of people and societies:[1] The sedentary village, low on force and fraud. He calls this 'quasi-peaceful'. There's a law of status. (pp 215 & 236). 'Savages' (undefined) have this sort of lifestyle.[2] Barbarians, who hate manual work, and prefer 'exploits'. They are ferocious, self-seeking, clannish, disingenuous. They like hunting. A predatory type. Veblen often calls them 'peace-distubing dolicho-blonds'. (He himself had very dark hair - remember Norway and Sweden separated at about this time.)---------However, *NOW* (about 1900) there is industry.[3] Veblen takes progress as given: 'as populations grow denser..', '.. stage of society..', '.. as the community advances in wealth and culture', are typical phrases. These days, the collective interests of modern industry work against the ferocious or selfish aristocrat type (p 227).4] There is a 'hierarchical gradation of reputability. Ownership on a large scale [is]... the most reputable of economic interests. [then] banking .. law.. the lawyer is exclusively occupied with the details of predatory fraud..' (p.231).-----------Veblen means by the 'Leisure Class' property and company owners, financiers, bankers, lawyers. In other words, anyone not concerned with direct manufacturing. Much of his book is concerned with the way they spend or waste money, and the way other people attempt to follow or imitate their behaviour.What is of value in Veblen?I have to say I was struck by the small number of piquant examples of oddities in spending and consumption; I'd expected more. Dogs as useless deferential mouths to feed; clean clothes uncontaimnated by evidence of work; William Morris's Kelmscott Press. Of men - walking stick, and powdered wig (from Alexander Pope?) On women, bodices, bound feet in China, and general feebleness, were signs of wealth in the husband. He has an odd passage about public parks - men keep the grass tidy, and this is an example of conspicuous consumption, because they are more expensive than cows.He doesn't seem to know about Chinese mandarins' fingernails, British sumptuary laws, rose gardens and knot gardens and huge country houses as statements of things which are attractive, but unnecessary. He doesn't know about follies, or for example the Hell Fire Club and the Parthenon, both of which in their ways offered employment. Moreover he doesn't seem to understand the economics: a US department store would not stock very cheap items - there's not enough money in them and will reduce other sales. They will cater preferentially for richer custiomers - and offer, say, sherry, wine, champagne, brandy and other glasses, just to make more money. Veblen's examples are a mostly natural outcome of normal economics. As further evidence, consider that, if Veblen was right, any conspicuous waste might happen: burning of notes, buying of things just to destroy them.As to the 'leisure class', Veblen, surprisingly, barely considers inherited wealth. New England had many sons and daughters waiting to inherit and the 'leisure class' would seem to fit them perfectly. But Veblen concentrates on other targets. Like Marx, he assumes factory owners just sit back and collect loot - he doesn't seem to realise such people *may* work extremely hard. Similarly, many younger sons of British wealthy families went off to die in various white man's grave parts of the world. For that matter, the 'wolfish earls' in 'Shakespeare' weren't exactly leisurely.Veblen comes across as a man who moved directly from a peasant society into a much more technologically advanced one. (This must be common now, with uncontrolled mass third world immigration into some modern societies.) It's not surprising such people gawp, and feel fear, and boost their egos with cautious contempt. But I don't think ultimately this book delivers very much."},{"Title":"The theory of the leisure class,: An economic study of institutions","review":"It's true to say that Veblen's book is one of the great classics of economic theory; however, such a description suggests (at least to non-economists like myself) that the book will be either dull or remorselessly technical. On the contrary, &quot;The Theory of the Leisure Class&quot; is stylishly written, endlessly startling (for example, Veblen analyses religion as an outgrowth of the gambling instinct), and very, very funny. Its expose of &quot;conspicuous consumption&quot; (yes, Veblen was the one who invented this famous concept) is as relevant today as it was in 1899, if not more so. Whether or not you agree with all that he says, it's thought-provoking and exciting stuff."},{"Title":"The theory of the leisure class,: An economic study of institutions","review":"This opus by Veblen exposes the real meaning of the pecuniary advancement of the working and merchant classes, and the formation of elites based mostly upon money and asset valuation. The transfiguration of the traditional social and individual ethical values that this phenomenon produced, is portraited with clarity and sarcastic intelligence by the author in the book, first published in 1899.Now a classic of economic theory, as well as a text book of social science, it describes the tendencies of consumerism, leisure and the &quot;materialization&quot; of the ideals of the aspiring new princes (or noveau rich) of society. Veblen's vibrant satire of the tendency of the modern individual to believe that real accomplishment is all about aquiring a condition of ostentatious wealth and status, and his analisis of the inception of modern class structure in America, still stand, a century after, as recommended reading for historians and economists.If you are a fervent follower of advertisement, fashion, &quot;glamour&quot; and other modern expressions of consumerism , then you will find a surprisingly fresh portrait of yourself in this book. It worries me that the leisure class and its shallow views and values as described by Veblen, may still today represent elites in America and their religion, as analyzed by professor Lash in his last book &quot;The Revolt of the Elites&quot;. I highly recommend Veblen's best book, to scholars and sociologists at large."},{"Title":"The theory of the leisure class,: An economic study of institutions","review":"Known by his contemporaries as the only social theorist to apply Darwin critically, in 1899 Thorstein Veblen published The Theory of the Leisure Class: A Economic Study of Institutions, which was to become the basis from which all further American leisure history and theory stemmed. In his study, Veblen is primarily concerned with the &quot;new rich,&quot; whom he regards as social parasites that retard the growth of modern life. Thorstein Veblen wrote The Theory of the Leisure Class from a perspective that was largely isolated from his own culture, which either aided in his understanding of the Leisure Class or perhaps negatively influenced his opinions due to his exclusion from it. In The Theory of the Leisure Class, Veblen essentially confines man and woman's existence on the planet as a struggle to change and adapt with the growth of their communities. Through this belief, Veblen develops a theme that amounts to the idea of a certain &quot;dominant&quot; type of individual. This individual develops a social structure through dominance in which social advance is sought by others. She/he will feel the discrepancy between the modern life and traditional life during the process. Though Veblen's rhetoric is sometimes anxious, sometimes negative, he actively pursues a specific account of the origins of the Leisure Class through individuals. The struggle for individual advancement eventually expands to include society, and the more individual struggle for advancement in society leads to the accumulation of surplus goods.Surplus of conspicuous consumption by the Leisure Class gives the class license to indulge shamefully in pure conspicuous consumption, where their occupations eventually become leisure itself. These &quot;professions&quot; of the Leisure Class by nature render it closed, and impenetrable by outsiders.Thorstein Veblen wrote the Leisure Class represented the new phenomena of conspicuous consumption compared to pre-Industrialized wealthy communities as well as contemporary working-class ones. But as intellectual inquiry into the topic of leisure has progressed over the past one hundred years, leisure has come to hold a number of definitions and meanings."},{"Title":"The theory of the leisure class,: An economic study of institutions","review":"The basic premise of this book is that modern humans have inherited an instinct to compete with each other for material resources. This competition takes place within the context of a small groups that share the spoils of the competition amongst themselves. (Other primates essentially do the same thing). The theory hinges on the question of what happens when a group of people have access to essentially unlimited resources, but still have the competitive urge. Veblen's answer is that they simply compete amongst themselves to see who can afford to be the most wasteful (like the scene in that Woody Allen movie in which two guys start ripping up dollar bills to impress each other). He refers to such waste as \\"conspicuous consumption\\".According to Veblen, the urge to consume conspicuously explains a lot of human behavior, including fashion, sports, and religion. In all cases the consumer wants to demonstrate to his peers that he can't possibly be involved in doing anything useful. A particularly funny consequence of the urge to consume is the notion of \\"vicarious consumption,\\" in which really rich people acquire other people (essentially servants and wives) to do their consuming for them. To emphasize the point they dress up their vicarious consumers in preposterous outfits and require them to perform pointless tasks with high precision (think of a butler in a tuxedo serving a 12-course meal or some such).In this vein, anthropomorphic religions essentially worship the richest guy of all. God is imagined to be so rich that he sits on a throne all day while people in silly clothes (clergy) do nothing but tend to his fabulous mansions (churches). It's an intentionally funny image, although Veblen is careful to say that he's not poking fun at the spiritual aspects of religion, just the form in which modern humans choose to express them.An interesting subtheme is the alliance between the \\"leisure class\\" and the poor, something we see happening today in American politics. In Veblen's theory the alliance occurs because the two classes essentially share the same mindset (obsession with status).Overall the book is fun to read, except for the writing style, which is reminiscent of essays written by high school students who are studying for the SATs."},{"Title":"The theory of the leisure class,: An economic study of institutions","review":"This may not be a book to read for recreation, unless you like 1890s verbal locutions, but there are other reasons to read it. The emergence of the economic analysis of Western society might intrigue you. You might discover the origins of such still useful terms as 'leisure class' and 'conspicuous consumption,' among others. You might be curious about author Thorstein Veblen's status-conscious, anachronistic world of working men and idle wives, which reflects upper-class society in his day. Published in 1899, this is a classic in sociology and economic literature, although it is a veritable dreadnought of density. It discusses property, ownership, status and leisure in a turn-of-the-last-century American context. Though scholars call it a 'satire,' the book is neither witty nor ironic. Instead, it is a stolid analytical daguerreotype of a world long gone. We suggest that if you tackle Veblen's old-fashioned, slow-flowing prose, you should do it for the background you may glean and the scholarly satisfaction you may feel when you are done. Instead of Alexander Pope's, 'What oft was thought but ne'er so well expressed,' this book presents what oft was said and usually better, but not as early."},{"Title":"The theory of the leisure class,: An economic study of institutions","review":"This is one of the most thought provoking books I have read in a long time. Veblen leaves no stone unturned in his dissection of America's upper class and the unconscious traditions that lead them, and us. It is not hard to understand the volcano that erupted with this books publication. The Penguin edition is also set in an elegant Caslon typeface that reads beautifully."},{"Title":"The theory of the leisure class,: An economic study of institutions","review":"Like the wealth of nations or Leviathon this book is both an economic, and social text. Very good perspective if somewhat harsh and disassociated. Percuinary emulation is something everybody should understand to avoid becoming a mindless yuppie clone - good advice."},{"Title":"The theory of the leisure class,: An economic study of institutions","review":"This book, although written over 100 years ago is still valid. Even though Veblen attempts to press the application of his thesis a bit too far, the thesis istself still has merit for the 21st century. His thesis, although not stated as such is biblically rooted in Ecclesiastes 4:4, \\"And I saw that all labor and all achievement springs from man's envy of his neighbor.\\" Interesting perspective on society... worth the read!"},{"Title":"The theory of the leisure class,: An economic study of institutions","review":"Mr. Veblen is a refined person in the use of the words he uses to address and explain the economic habits of the refined people of the upper-class of the beginning of the last century. He spares no expenses in detailing in a very polite manner the idiossincracies of the noble and very rich when deciding what to buy, what to use and how to behave, going also to all lenghts explainning how these habits mold and form the habits of the not so rich and noble strata of the society. His theory of the leisure class reachs significance when compared to the rationality which some economists, classics and neo-classics, ascribe to the human being as an economic agent. I was quite surprised by the elegant style of Mr.Veblen and the fine irony (which he does not admit) with which he treats the rich and noble of his time. Sure, this is a book which could be also serve well times ahead and before Veblen's time."},{"Title":"The theory of the leisure class,: An economic study of institutions","review":"I was extremely pleased with this book. It reduces the notion of society to a popularity contest in which fashion becomes the perfect expression of everyone's desire to be praised and noticed. As the American economy shifts from being a breadbasket to being the entertainment capital of a devil in blue jeans world, this book, from a much earlier historical period, shows how America always had the potential to achieve this kind of greatness. More than any other book, this one allows total enjoyment of the thoughts which it expresses.

Why this book is still not in print is beyond me. It was first written and published in I think 1924. Even though it was written over 80 years ago, it does not read like it is an ancient hard to digest read. Foster Damon was a great writer and his work reads as if it was written today and not so long ago. What's good about this book is that Damon breaks down each of Blake's work's and opens up the characters and symbolism. Instead of being put off by the sometimes overwhelming imagery Blake uses, Damon gives us the \\"End of a golden string\\", and with it one can start to understand and make sense of Blake and his work. Damon is not a dry bone Scholar or academic. He comes at Blake with an appreciation of Blake's otherworldliness and more hidden ideas. Damon had an interest in mysticism and was also a established poet in his day. He was also an academic at Brown University. So if anyone could gain insight into Blake he was the man.One idea that Damon prize's from Blake made me nearly fall of the chair when I read it. Not because it, these days, is so hidden or unknown, but this was written in 1924 when these things were not made so explicit. One only has to think of Aleister Crowley or Austin Osman Spare and how they hid in their works ideas and beliefs that in society would have invited great criticism and censor. Damon bravely links the idea of Blake's Mysticism and sexual occultism as being the leaping board to inspired states of mind from which Blake tapped into and created his great poetry and art. I found this book in a second hand book store. Reading this book along with Thames & Hudson's complete illuminated books on Blake and you will have opened the door to the world of Blake and his very Gnostic ideas and beliefs. This book is expensive and I think it should be republished. There is nothing better available to really get an in-depth understanding of Blake."},{"Title":"Fun while it lasted","review":"Barnaby Conrad shares a life in this autobiography that will have you shaking your head in amazement and a little jealousy.

(Author even has included some drawings of workshops and references from ancient civilizations along with footnotes on what the drawings illustrate these historical workbenches to have done) The author has obviously done plenty of homework.I initially purchased this book because I'm looking to make a functional workbench for my newly-remodeled shop. After reading part way thru this book, however, I've decided to abandon some of the ideas I had for my bench in favor of some older-style workbench features that will, frankly, serve a better function than what I initially had in mind. Although the author does a great job illustrating progression of workbenches and their specific functions (lots of illustrations here...this is a good thing), I find a certain nostalgia in creating something that is unique to my needs, but also contains some reference to history.To each his own.

Inspirational. Great photos and illustrations, well written, fascinating history, deep insight into the various uses of benches and the techniques of holding workpieces.I bought this to inspire the design of my own bench.Now this book might not be for everyone, so I am breaking this review into bits:Beginner: will educate you to the history of woodworking and inspire you. Making your own bench is probably beyond you at the moment. If you have a love of woodworking, this will fire your enthusiasm.Novice: can give you ideas for the future. There are sketches in this book, but not plans, especially not detailed router diagrams with measurements.Intermediate: (you can design your own projects) get it. You should seriously consider making your own workbench, to your own requirements and style. This book will show you many possibilities and get your thinking.Advanced: well you should definetely get it, and make yourself a variety of benches to suit different applications.I really enjoy this book. I have designed my own bench with the many, many ideas from this book. I have many innovative concepts, and specific requirements - for example, I carry my bench into the courtyard, and so have a hole in the middle where I can put a beach umbrella to keep the sun off (not to mention fact that it must be light enough to lift). I also work with leather, jewelry, metal, and beads, so I need adaptability for hammering, soldering, velvet lining to prevent beads escaping, etc etc you get the picture.This book gave me many many ideas for various means of clamping a work to the bench .. things that I can make myself, which is great. For example, there is a detailed diagram for cutting your own woodscrew, to build your own vice.Hmmm... a bit of a warning to power tool users, however, this is not really aimed at power tool users. The benches are designed for traditional woodwork, although the techniques are still useful for you if you want to build yoru own router bench.Note there are benches for carving as well, Japanese approaches, medieval benches ...Overall I am very pleased with this book and I would recommend to anyone. Furthermore, I would recommend it as a present, I don't know anyone who works with wood who would not be pleased with this one, although as a present I would first recommend some of the books such as Art of Fine Tools or the Handplane book.Note that I bought this book as part of the boxed set, which is excellent value and you save on shipping since it is one item not 3."},{"Title":"The Workbench Book: A Craftsman's Guide from the Publishers of Fine Woodworking (Craftsman's Guide to)","review":"If you're a serious woodworker, you need a serious workbench.

When I set out to build my workbench, I didn't know what kind I wanted to build. &quot;The Workbench Book&quot; gave me all the information I needed to decide what kind of bench to build and how to build it. But what really surprised me about the book was that even if I wasn't planning to build a bench, it would have been well worth reading simply for the interesting story of the workbench. Scott Landis' knowledge, experience and love of the craft of woodworking, and his respect for the workbench, made the book a joy to read.

This is both a history book and a woodworking book, and I still loved it. I never liked history in HS or college, but if I had had Landis, I would have been a history major. The book is captivating virtually from cover to cover (although I found the latter chapters a little less enthralling than the first 3/4 of the book). I plan to build a significant workbench, and I bought this book thinking it would help me with ideas and planning. It did so much more than that, I'm stunned. The insights it gave me about different ways of working with wood have expanded beyond the previous limits of my imagination.Landis' approach to describing the workbench from an historical perspective highlights the changes in tools that have occurred over the years and how benches have evolved alongside. I started reading the book as a devoted user of power tools who would put up with some hand tools if absolutely necessary. I ended with a much clearer understanding of how hand tools, working in conjunction with the appropriately designed and build bench, could enhance my woodworking pleasure and accomplishments. lol, I've even started buying high quality planes.If you enjoy history, get this book.If you want to gain better insight into ways to work wood, get this book.I you are looking for bench plans, this has some, but I wouldn't buy it for the plans.

In his \\"The Workbench Book\\", Scott Landis captures the artistry, craftsmanship, and utility behind the design and construction of this most fundamental of woodworking tools. The book begins with a brief history of the workbench (from Roman times to the present) which serves the more detailed part of the book well by providing a context for understanding the layout and design of more modern workbenches. What makes this book truly outstanding however is that Scott Landis choose to eschew the narrow, personal perspective, instead focusing on the workbench philosophy and design detail of a diverse group of master wood craftsmen. This approach allows us to appreciate different bench designs not as simple woodworking projects themselves, but as the foundation of diverse disciplines to the wood craft.

Of course, if you only use hand tools, a bench designed in the 1700's would work as well now as then. Most of the workbenches in this book were designed for hand tool use, but many will work fine with portable power tools.In addition to the benches themselves, the \\"accessories\\" for benches are covered.

Well, the main reason is that I've just finished reading this book for the \\"umpteenth\\" time and I've just ordered \\"the other 'must-have' workbench book\\"-- the one by Sam Allen, from amazon.com...and I really want to build my dream workbench--soon!Landis's book is brilliant and, having browsed it, for years, and read it from cover to cover at least 8 times, I can state *categorically* that everything you really need to know, or even think about, before building a superb workbench is covered SOMEWHERE in this beautifully-illustrated tribute to one of the woodworker's most basic tools--the bench.It doesn't much matter what kind of woodcraft you are most fond of, or forced to do...carving and sculpting, modelmaking, cabinet-work, carpentry, joinery, instrument-making...there is something here for you to think about before you lay down the bucks for timber, or even before you put pencil to paper to design \\"the bench of your dreams\\". [The benches in the book are mostly directed at, but not entirely limited to, woodworkers...]If you actually find the bench of your dreams within the covers of this book [and who WOULDN'T!?--it's that comprehensive!] and expect a hint as to how big it might be, or what size of workshop it would suit, then you'd better be prepared to think again--and read the book again, and again...There are very clear hints about how to solve ALL of the problems you might face in designing and building your own individual bench, or its concomitant accessories [holdfasts, dogs, vises, board-jacks, storage compartments--you name it!] Consideration is given to work specialities and even to base designs to suit different flooring types of workshops around the globe. The book is very short, however, on DIY-style \\"projects\\". So...*you* pick up the ideas, *you* design, *you* build...The author is quite up-front about saying that you will probably need some sort of half-decent workbench to build a 'great' workbench.This book may not be the first-stop for a newbie woodworker, who just wants a good sturdy \\"bench-with-vise\\" to start making shavings, or even for the more experienced woodworker who has a specific bench project in mind. However, with a good collection of magazine and web articles on benches and, preferably, a bit of construction experience, this book will probably address your dreams...but perhaps not by next week. Be patient, read a lot and keep learning. Buy the book, of course, so you can have a \\"target\\" to aim at. You might not know what you want, or need, until you have considered all of the brilliant ideas contained within the covers of Landis's book.[Warning!--I've so far only designed and built one free-standing workbench in my life. Naturally, it was designed upon the ones upon which I had learned woodworking. It took me about a week to build and was made almost entirely of salvaged timber--ancient jarrah posts and weathered 5/4 and 4/4 boards from old 'piano crates'. The metal front vise alone (even 20 years ago!) cost about the same as my present, small, commercially-made bench supplied with two useable wooden vises!]"},{"Title":"The Workbench Book: A Craftsman's Guide from the Publishers of Fine Woodworking (Craftsman's Guide to)","review":"i've been building furniture for over 10 yrs and have always used work tables as opposed to having a nice work bench. figured it was about time to make a proper work bench and began accumulating a few books for research. was disappointed in this one because it doesn't appear to follow the usual taunton formula which is lots of pics of many different designs. a lot of space was devoted to the history of workbenches which i didn't find particularly helpful to building a modern bench.(keep in mind 100 yrs ago they were using work benches in a different way) There was also a section on japanese style workbenches. interesting, but how many of us here in America are going to squat on the floor while working, or hold pieces with our feet? the book seems to be slightly off its focus. lastly, on a smaller note, the typeset for this book looked like something from an old newspaper. really irritating! bought this book based on the quality of other taunton books, but if I'd had a chance to look at it first would have passed."},{"Title":"The Workbench Book: A Craftsman's Guide from the Publishers of Fine Woodworking (Craftsman's Guide to)","review":"good condition and very nice book, i'm reading it...some problem cause it's written in english but there is a lot of pictures"},{"Title":"The Workbench Book: A Craftsman's Guide from the Publishers of Fine Woodworking (Craftsman's Guide to)","review":"Still great to look through for ideas or just for the pleasure of looking at the benches shown.

Have you ever used someone else's peculiarly selected PC customizations? It's called a personal computer I think because it is.The great WB takes like years of pondering and then you build it. This book plus others have helped me morph my WB into my own Ferrari. Here's how I finally proceeded:You have to start with the chassis. I transferred my notions from various sawhorse and table configurations to the one I built. I desired portable + heavy. The \`chassis' was a Sam's club inspiration. For $99 I bought the 6', 2\\" thick maple topped, steel legged work bench. I bought 4 heavy duty down lock, up lift casters. I framed the steel legs of the bench with mortised oak 4x4's and attached the casters to the 4x4 frame. The unit rolls easily and when down locked/uplifted the 300# bench is completely stable on the down locked legs.I could not see the need for the lower cabinet. 360 degree access was more important. I turned the lower steel frame cross member of the bench into a big piece-stock storage shelf. I can add another full length if I ever want to. I added a tier of tool access custom oak cubbies below the top and length wise on one side.Quick action vises are critical to preclude cranking. I first built in one twin screw end vise as typical, and then added an e-bay 1920's forged 1.5\\" screw end vice that has two 1.5\\" steel bar guides. It's more stable than the double screw end vice. The two end vises extend to effectively create an 8' bench. Then I collected side vises from e-bay auctions and got some great old ones that are far superior to new ones (an old Record side vise, an old Record patternmaker vise, a side vise with a date well over 100 years old that's the best of the lot and most recently an old black smith-bench mount hip vise ... you can never have enough vises)."},{"Title":"The Workbench Book: A Craftsman's Guide from the Publishers of Fine Woodworking (Craftsman's Guide to)","review":"The author, Scott Landis, is a thoughtful writer--something I appreciate in an author. He conducted a lot of interviews and he amassed excellent photographs. He will give you an opportunity to think some if you care to. He will give you the opportunity to better understand the evolution of workbenches over numerous centuries along with the corresponding technology of the day, and help you appreciate their compatibility. In a nutshell, a tool is the inspiration of someone with a job to do and a workbench is arguably the woodworkers foremost tool. Surely the reading of the book will help you formulate a reasonable design for your own workbench, but there is so much more here that to recommend it just for that purpose does not do the book justice. Bottom line: If you would like to gain a throughtful perspective about workbenches and the work/lives of the people who used them, you may enjoy the book whether you have a new workbench on your horizon or not! It's a good read.I will be watchful for more by the author, Scott Landis.

The workbench is often the red-headed stepchild of the modern shop. We spend thousands of dollars on power tools we use once a year, and then when it comes to a workbench, we lay some plywood on cheap steel legs and proceed to spill paint all over it. No other shop item is as vital to good work done efficiently as is the proper workbench. But the fun of this book is trying to pin the tail on the donkey - what makes a \\"proper\\" bench?The inspired touch of this book is to approach the subject chronologically - what's the oldest dedicated bench we know of? By going back to the benches of the Renaissance, and one modern interpretation of their absolute minimalist simplicity, we can see the essence of \\"benchness\\", if such a thing exists. The plainest of heavy tables, rock solid, for planing boards. No vices please - just hold fasts.By starting off at this ground zero, all subsequent benches are placed in context. Additional vices and features and fixtures are introduced and explained, and bit by bit we find ourselves in the modern workshops of people like Frank Klausz, with glorious benches that take the form to it's possible limit. Vises are gone over in excrusiating detail, along with all the possible positions they can occur in.This is the most important of the 3 books (often sold as a boxed set) that discuss worbenches, toolboxes, and workshops. Get this one first, and you'll refer to it constantly.

The book is beautifully produced. The photos are beautiful and the text is wonderful.I chose the words \\"working guide\\" above carefully. The pretty pictures aside, the real value of this book to me was in being walked through just how many different ways a bench can be used. As I read it, I found myself constantly comparing my own work habits against what I was reading regarding why certain bench configurations evolved. It also made some of my own bench frustrations clearer.In the end, and as a direct result of reading this book, I've decided on a heavy open-framed (weighted, actually) bench a foot lower than what I've been using, 6' long, 30\\" deep, no tray, no storage, with a torsion box top and conventional (Record-type) woodworkers vise. I'll supplement with a pair of low (12\\" - 15\\") assembly tables 30\\" square each. That's pretty specific, but as I considered my own work and habits while reading, the formerly attractive shaker benches, euro benches, and even the intriguing Japanese beams have lost their attractiveness.This is that rare type of book that has long-term and deep implications for how you work if you read it with real intent.

This was the 13th Tarzan novel and the 4th Pellucidar story and not surprisingly ends up being one of the better offerings in both series. Originally published as a seven-part serial in &quot;The Blue Book Magazine&quot; in 1929-30. The story fits better into the Pellucidar series, where it works mainly as a sequel to &quot;Tanar of Pellucidar,&quot; and it is Tarzan fans who would be more lost in this one than readers of the Pellucidar books. The plot is standard fare for a ERB novel, involving a rescue mission, with the key difference between not so much Tarzan's involvement as the idea that the person who needs to be rescued is not a damsel in distress but David Innes, first Emperor of Pellucidar.Innes is being held in the dungeons of the Korsars, and Jason Gridley (inventor of the Gridley wave that allowed ERB to &quot;receive&quot; the Martian stories from John Carter, which accounts for the other major ERB series) persuades Tarzan to come along fr the fun. Gridley builds a zeppelin and uses it to descend into the land of Pellucidar (do not get me started on the physics involved in a lighter than air ship descending to the Earth's core. Once in Pellucidar Tarzan and Gridley have their separate adventures, and ERB seems to go out of his way to come up with new races of people (e.g., the Horibs) and prehistoric type creatures to beleaguer both of the book's heroes. The romance, of course, happens with Gridley, who meets Jana, the Red Flower of Zoram. Even everybody gets back together and they remember why they came to Pellucidar in the first place.&quot;Tarzan at the Earth's Core&quot; is a solid ERB pulp fiction yarn all things considered. What makes it work is that Tarzan has some competition for the role of hero in the story. He is more of a major supporting character than the lead, because Gridley is the leader of the expedition and even disadvantaged in the jungles of Pellucidar, where Tarzan finds himself quite at home, even with that weird burning sun in the sky that never sets, manages to hold his own for the most part. Burroughs also includes the set up for the next Pellucidar novel, when Lieutenant Wilhelm Von Horst, the mate of the zeppelin, vanishes. Unfortunately he would have to wait until 1935 to be rescued in &quot;Back to the Stone Age.&quot; Meanwhile, Tarzan would go back to his usual run of episodes back in Africa."},{"Title":"Tarzan at the earth's core","review":"Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote a number of series. Some series consisted of as few as two or three novellas. The Tarzan series stretched to 24 volumes. Almost all of the series were interrelated in some way or another. Clark A. Brady maps out the complex interrelationships in Appendix C to his \\"Burroughs Cyclopaedia\\" (available from Amazon.com). \\"Tarzan at the Earth's Core\\" makes the clearest connection between two Burroughs series. It is the 13th Tarzan novel and the 4th Pellucidar novel.The Tarzan stories represent some of Burroughs' best work. The Pellucidar stories do not. Burroughs stretches credulity in all his stories, but he takes it to the limit in the Pellucidar stories. In the Pellucidar seriest Burroughs employs a preposterous concept (a hollow Earth with an inner world where time stands still) and adds insult to injury with highly improbable plot twists. This makes the quality of \\"Tarzan at the Earth's Core\\" all the more surprising. It stands as the absolute best Pellucidar story and one of the best Tarzan stories. Ironically it stands near the middle of both series.David Innes, the hero of the Pellucidar stories, is in trouble. Jason Gridley, inventor of the Gridley Wave, hears the radio distress signal from the center of the Earth, and organizes a rescue party. Many stalwart adventurers, including Tarzan of the Apes, enlist in the expedition. Where Innes got to the Earth's core in a mechanical mole, Gridley's party travels there in an airship. Read the book to find out how they fly an airship to the center of the Earth and confront the many perils of the savage world they find."},{"Title":"Tarzan at the earth's core","review":"In this book, Burroughs had an interesting conceit of crossing his most famous creation into one of his other worlds, thus establishing a patchwork universe where Mars, Venus, Pellucidar, Caspak, Tarzan, and almost all ERB's other stories take place. This book is exciting and colorful but suffers from a single glaring flaw. While in almost every ERB books there is a love interest, in this one, it seems merely perfunctory. Jana and Jason never establish any chemistry during their brief time together, and Jana is a resourceful and blandly attractive if also vapid and petulant heroine. Given the fact that the love story does little but weigh the story down--Jana at one point reflects Jason would not have abandoned her as Tarzan seemed to, though there is no reason she should think this--it probably would have been best to remove it altogether. Probably her uninteresting presentation is why Jana is never mentioned again after this book. In At the Earth's Core, Pellucidar, Tanar of Pellucidar, Back to the Stone Age, and Savage Pellucidar, ERB has his Inner World heroes romance and succeed through sheer determination with their love interests. Here the love story is just dead weight that gets in the way of an otherwise enjoyable adventure story. That said, though, the book is engaging and at least partially makes up for an otherwise unsatisfying romance at its core."},{"Title":"Tarzan at the earth's core","review":"I found myself less tolerant of the Red Flower of Zoram this time around, perhaps because by forty I had myself been in relationships where you never know if she loves you or thinks you are a jalok. And there seems little reason for it. When David Innes insulted Dian or John Carter insulted Dejah Thoris, those were some heavy insults, for all that the heroes didn't intend them. Jason's crime seems rather minor. I actually found myself wishing she'd just get over herself.OK, now that that's out of the way...This is a wonderful adventure story. Pellucidar is it's old horizonless, timeless self, and we see new areas and new peoples. Tarzan is in fine form, and has to deal with a problem he's never had before: he gets lost in the jungle! There are savages, pirates, reptile-men, pterodactyls, and ape-men whom the Lord of the Jungle finds strangely familiar. There are a few many coincidences near the end, but all in all, you can do worse, but might not do better."},{"Title":"Tarzan at the earth's core","review":"Tarzan at the Earth's Core by Burroughs is a heart warming tale of loyalty, romance, and adventure set in the hollow earth setting of Pellucidar. Like all of the other tales set in this world it is full of prehistoric creatures of the various periods and peopled by the most anachronistic cast of characters ever assembled. There are pirates, Vikings, cavemen, and intelligent apes as well as some wonderful made up races such as the evolved reptilian race that enjoy feasting on human flesh. Tarzan, of course, finds himself at home in the jungles of this world, and the supporting characters are heroic and delightful to become acquainted with. Even if you have never read a novel set in this world, a fan of pulp should do oneself a favor and pick this one up. It may not be the best place to start on your journey into hollow earth, but it is at least a start."},{"Title":"Tarzan at the earth's core","review":"PAGES WERE VERY YELLOW MAKING IT HARDER TO READ.I have been an ERB fan since I was a kid in the 50s.

Now they use the internet. Heidi Campbell does an impressive job of showing how people find religion online and offline. And when people go online, religion changes. People are weaving together a variety of religious experiences. They're creating networked personal religion instead of belonging to only one denomination and congregation. This is an on-the-scene account, impressively combining reportage and theory."},{"Title":"Exploring Religious Community Online (Digital Formations)","review":"For centuries religion was limited to the spoken word backed up by a precious few documents laboriously copied by hand. It should be no surprise that when printing was invented, the first document to be printed in volume was the Gutenberg Bible. Then as radio and subsequently television became available so did the religious use of the new media. With each advance the ability to communicate expanded in volume and shrank in cost.It should then be no surprise that as the new electronic media became available the churches began to take advantage of the new possibilities offered. As Catholic Archbishop Chaput said, 'For us to miss the opportunity new technologies give us to preach and educate and inform would be harmful to the mission of the church.'This book discusses research on how religions have used the Internet and e-mail to expand their ministry. And how individuals have used these same media to find what they seek in religion."},{"Title":"Exploring Religious Community Online (Digital Formations)","review":"This well-researched and helpful book illustrates how quickly the landscape changes in the digital world. Just about the time you think you have scaled the mountain and reached the peak, the mountain itself changes locations. In this case, Campbell's book is a dissertation on religious communion online, and she uses three e-mail based groups (listservs) as her ethnographic research base.I remember the heady days of listservs. I was on a few throughout the nineties, and was sometimes a passionate and even over-zealous participant. I remember one listserv in particular, something on theology and the emergent church, that kept me coming back to my computer every few minutes to see if a new comment had been posted. The amount of intellectual energy and emotional ardor invested in the discussions was extraordinary. Some debates would get my heart racing, and it is definitely the case that many of the discussions (conducted during the years while I was in seminary and on the field in global missions) shaped how I think of faith and the church yet today.So reading Campbell's book was like an exercise in nostalgia, the only problem being that I would not have expected to feel nostalgia reading a book written in 2005 and research in the early part of the 21st century. It is moments like these when I realize just how quickly our culture and media are changing around us.On the other hand, things may not be changing as quickly as I think. I was also reminded while reading Campbell's book of all the wonderful collections of correspondence (letters) I have read over the years, like Flannery O'Connors Habit of Being, the letters exchanged between Hannah Arendt and Martin Heidegger, Robert Lowell and Elizabeth Bishop, the massive collection of letters Melancthon wrote to statesmen, scholars, and clergy all over Europe, and so on ([...]). People have been writing letters to each other for millennia, and in doing so were typically seeking the same list of attributes of community listserv participants seek in their listserv participation: \\"relations, to be connected and committed... to be see as valuable as an individual and as part of a community... consistent communication, intimate communication, where individuals share open about their believes and spiritual lives... and gather around a shared faith that influences how they see others and how they see connections between the epistolary relationship and their other relationships.\\" Which is simply to say that it seems to me that people by and large use listservs for the same relational purposes they made use of letters for in the past--as a \\"supplement rather than a substitute for an individual's involvement in the local.\\" Interestingly, \\"also used as a baseline... to describe or even critique [the world beyond the letter exchange].\\"Campbell takes the wise approach of an ethnographer, asking not whether an online group can be a community, but \\"What type of community does an online group represent?\\" The majority of the book is a report on and analysis of three listserv's she observes over a multi-year period, including a Pentecostal-charismatic group on the gift of prophecy, an evangelical group that offered care and support for its members, and an Anglican listserv that functioned as a way for far-flung Anglicans to interact around a range of issues. If you have never participate in a listserv before, these chapters can make essential reading for understanding the content and function of listserv groups.In the early part of the book, Campbell sets the stage for clarifying how we are to think of such groups as online community. I found her reference to Michel Bauwens taxonomy of emergent spiritual practices on the web to be especially helpful (see the full essay at [...]. Bauwens defines three emergent types of web-based spiritual practice. I offer definitions here, and since I'm a sci-fi nerd of a fairly major sort, I also include reference to movies or books that I think portray these:1. God Project- Technology is seen as having God-like aspects, a crude substitute for godlike powers. One very recent example of this would be the movie Tron:Legacy [...], where his dudeness Jeff Bridges sits in Zen-like meditation for decades waiting for release from the cyber-world he constructed and then traps himself in. People who think technology can provide them with this cross between magic and tech are called, I learned, technopagans. I wish Campbell would have done ethnographic research on this group!2. Electric Gaia- Technology is a necessary adjunct to make improvements in consciousness possible. I think the movie Avatar was taking a stab at this one, as was perhaps the movie Inception. In literature, one of my favorite recent novels in this genre is Cory Doctorow's Makers. In this model, the \\"noosphere\\" emerges as a kind of global consciousness that busts people out of isolation. I find this the most intriguing category personally, even as I sometimes think most of us who envision it have to utopian a vision of what technology of this sort can accomplish.3. Sacramental Cyberspace- Presents the internet as a place to further the aims of a particular religion. Clearly, this third category is the one most often thought of and out of in religious communities, and it is the category best represented in Campbell's ethnographic research. William Gibson has also been working with this category in his more recent near-future novels. The movie The Social Network does as well, not furthering a religion per se, but initially it seems to say that Facebook is set up to further the aims of Harvard or Ivy League-ness.For my money, the next ethnographic research dissertation that needs to be written (maybe it has and I just haven't read it) needs to be researching (1) or (2) above. As far as how to apply Campbell's research to the present era (2011 instead of 2005), we would need to take into account how participants are creating community online using the new social media of Facebook and Twitter.

A definite recommend.Alexandra Kealey"},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Howard W. Campbell is an American playwright and poet who lives a quiet and secluded life in Greenwich Village. It is many years after the end of World War II. Campbell's cover is finally blown: he is uncovered as an evil, pro-Nazi radio propagandist. The truth is that Campbell really worked as an American spy in Germany during the war. Campbell's mailbox becomes innundated by pamplets from modern day krypto-Nazis and Campbell becomes a much hated man. What can Campbell do but turn himself over to Israeli agents and be tried for his war crimes and crimes against humanity?Campbell, himself, suffered personal tragedy during the war. He fell in love with and married a German woman named Helga who had died during the war. All Campbell wants is to be reunited with his beloved Helga (obviously impossible). This a very powerful and sad, yet comic, novel. Vonnegut analyzes the guilt that people often feel when they become so involved and overly identified with an evil cause. That person may actually come to believe that he really did and said horrible things (and Campbell did just that) and forget that he was really working for the other side. Vonnegut tells his tale in a poignant, frightening, and often comic way, for which the author has been justly celebrated."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"A brilliant book that examines the evil that humans are so easily capable of doing to their fellow humans.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"I am a Vonnegut fan, and this is another in a long line of good books by KV."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"This is the least surreal of the 8 or so Vonnegut novels I've read. It is a much more traditional narrative than most of his works.This is not to say that it inspires less thought, though. I felt that it was a beautiful story that kept me thinking about it's lessons long after I finished.If you like Vonnegut but are looking for something more traditional, this is the book you want! It invoked emotion and thought equally as I read it.Incidentally the movie it inspired is worth watching after you enjoy the book (in contrast to the others based on his novels...)"},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Vonnegut's intriguing writing style continues in Mother Night. Very fat and interesting characters coupled with a precise probing of issues of conventional morality lead to a short, easy, and worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Intellectuals don't always resonate with intellect and occasionally the wisdom from the common man or woman far exceeds that of those who profess to be oh-so-educated and learned.Kurt Vonnegut was a soldier and American P.O.W. during World War II and the horrors and absurdities he experienced in the fire bombed city of Dresden, Germany (as he helped collect the dead) as well as a sense of humanity generated by it resonate in his many stories and books. MOTHER NIGHT is a very good book, a fast read that carries a tone of conscience, compassion, humor, and a profound need for decency throughout. It tells of just and unjust causes with just and unjust results, of a need for the humane with an underlying appeal for hope.I came to find Vonnegut's work in the late 60s and being of the era enjoyed them then and smile whenever I leaf through one now. Was I naive then? Probably. Did I come away satisfied from reading his work? Definitely.Vonnegut was a national treasure then. Still is, under th dust.If you're new to his work start with Slaughterhouse Five and work your way through his books when you have the time or inclination.You'll be entertained and might even be moved, two benefits that academics seldom achieve with their own tomes.I'll take a readable story everytime."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"The great thing about Vonnegut is that he makes it very easy to read his books, with or without an education. It may appear to some that he over simplifies or is self indulgent in his tales, which may be true, but we live in a generation of oversimplification. And a lot of people's minds are simple as well, so it only seems fitting, to keep it within our reach.The times may have changed since his war, but not by much. And it is sad that few are able to identify with a man of his age and experience. For me, there is no war as great as Vietnam or the Holocaust. Just an invisible war on terror, which is just as meaningless as any other war.So what he says is as important today as any other day.the novel is a good one, has a great plot and ends well. It doesn't leave you feeling like you don't know what happens at the end. I will probably read it again someday. But I will never understand it the way he did when he wrote it, because I have not experienced the misery that is war."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"If you've never read a Vonnegut book before, then just go ahead and put this into your cart. Also add his other titles because you'll want to pick up another one after you've finished reading Mother Night. Yes, these books were written many decades ago, but the critics are correct in saying they still have relevance in today's time. Enjoy the read and reflection into today's environment."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"it was quick read, and i enjoyed it very much. it's gives an interesting perspective on a lot of issues of world war II and human nature."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"An interesting--almost crazy--ride through the later years of Howard Campbell, American-born, German playwright-turned-Nazi-broadcast propogandist, then-re-turned-American-spy.Vonnegut once said, humbly, his writing was just 8 to 10-line jokes strung together. There is slapstick and farce here; great fun and entertainiment. What saves this from craziness is Vonnegut's ability to write so well about noble things such as love and kindness, friendship and decency. So one laughs and one thinks and one feels as he reads here. . .and in almost everything else Kurt Vonnegut wrote."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"While Slaughterhouse-V may be Vonnegut's most famous and enduring work, Mother Night is my personal favorite. It describes the story of Nazi Propaganda broadcaster who is on trial in Israel for war crimes. Protagonist Howard J Campbell is forced to decipher what is real and what is merely appearance as he tells his story while awaiting the verdict in his jail cell. The majority of the book consists of flashbacks to earlier times that allow the reader to see all sides of Howard's story; the good and the bad. Vonnegut's voice is a little bit different than his ordinary satirical voice in his other notable works of literature. He tries to be more real, and there is nothing more real than a man awaiting his destiny on trial while also trying to decide if he can live with himself after all that he has done, weather it was out of fear, love, loyalty, or some combination of the three. The book is gripping, profound, and suspenseful until the very last page. It is truly Vonnegut's most underrated classic."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"I have read all but one of Kurt Vonnegut's novels, and the ones I own are falling to pieces from the number of times I have read them. They all are very powerful pieces of work. This one in particular changed my life and outlook in such a splendid way.The novel centers around the idea of the difference between who you are and the perception of yourself unto others. However, despite how powerful a book this is for that particular issue, I love it for a different reason.Kurt Vonnegut's novels do not deal often with Love. There are characters that love each other in many of his books, but a real love story and in depth look at people in this respect are missing. The story and look at Howard Campbell's feelings about Love are so beautiful to me.I never could put into words exactly what it was I wanted out of love, though I knew it was different than what those around me seemed to want. Kurt Vonnegut puts it into the exact words I have used since reading this so many years ago. \\"A country of two\\".To me this novel should be noted not just for the stunning show of perception creating reality, but also as a masterful and meaningful look at how important love can be to a person who doesn't find meaning in much else."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Each of Vonnegut's books draws me in more and more than the last, and of the half-dozen I've read, this is the best in an outstanding group. There is a point--questions of morality that apply globally and personally and strangely--that does not get in the way of a story, which is told with such excellent craft that you may appreciate it for its sheer art and structure...though there is more to love than that achievement alone. I laughed. I should have cried and wish I had. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and more--I was deeply affected by it. If you want a plot synopsis, read the jacket cover...but it should be a crime to spoil any of the twists and turns in this book that doesn't need them, though employs them deftly nonetheless."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"This is one of Kurt Vonnegut's greatest pieces of literature that offers the reader a look into what happens when you pretend to be something you are not. Whether you make a new face for yourself believing it to be for the right reasons or not, there are always consequences. Having agreed to become a spy within Nazi Germany, our protagonist is so effective at spewing propaganda that when the time comes no one believes the actual truth of the matter regarding Howard Campbell Jr.His life after the war in a cramped New York apartment is both terrifying for him and depressing, if not boring at times. The real poignancy of this story comes from the interactions between what our main character is supposed to be (a brutal Nazi supporter), truly is (one of the greatest spies of WWII), wants to be, and what happens because of the choices he has made in his not-so-real life."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"They talk about the banality of evil, but what about the banality of good? What if the only way you can do good is by being so perfectly evil that nobody would ever expect you to be otherwise? And furthermore, what if you find that after submerging yourself in the evil for so long, that you just don't care? That some stains don't ever come out, even if your intentions are just?The only Kurt Vonnegut novel I had left to read (that I know of), I'm not sure why I avoided this one for years, unless my weird phobia about buying books with movie covers on them took a ridiculous hold on me and wouldn't allow me to get it. Reading it now, though, what strikes me is how bleak it is, unlike a lot of his other books. While Vonnegut never totally wrote about happy smiley topics, his novels were generally sprinkled with bits of dark humor that allowed you to laugh at least and made the darkness that much less oppressive. The coating on the spikes so it doesn't hurt as much when you breath in.That's not really the case here. Tackling WWII again from a different, less personal angle (instead of \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" and it's man on the spot point of view), it feels slightly more detached and sort of numb. Howard Campbell is an American that winds up living in Germany in the days before the war, writing plays and the like. He eventually winds up writing a lot of anti-Semetic poems and radio broadcasts and is considered one of the prime war criminals to have ever made it out of the war alive. The only thing is: all his anti-Semetic outbursts and writing were actually code, as he was spying for the American government and they were handing him what to say, with clues and orders embedded in the phrasing so that anyone listening would be able to discern the actual meaning. However, the government refuses to acknowledge that he worked for them and when the authorities of the world want to arrest him, he's got no one to stand by and back him up. Thing is, he's not quite sure if he wants to be let off the hook.This is an odd one. While its still funny in parts, it's a depressing kind of fun or the kind where you find yourself wincing because you're glad it's not happening to you. Like watching someone getting punched in the face and the other guy breaks his hand in the process. It lacks the focused anger of \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" but there's still a simmering sense of futility underneath the whole thing. Campbell technically made the right decision, or did he? He helped the war but because of what he did millions of people died in the process and the book deliberately doesn't take a stand.Campbell as a voice is very matter of fact about everything, alternating between a dry recounting and a bemused acceptance of his fate. Every single character in the book either has something terrible happen to them or is a terrible person (or both) and as usual with most Vonnegut books, what happens to you really doesn't depend on whether you're a good person or not, but simply on the whims of life. Campbell is constantly reminded of what he did, by the resurgence of his writings, by white supremicists, by Israelis coming after him, by all the memories that keep following him and won't allow him to forget.It's a strangely flat novel but the flatness only underscores the horror of the morally mixed times, how you can allow evil by doing good or how good may not matter if the evil is great enough. Campbell wanders through life letting things happen or allowing people to do things to him and whether or not that contributes to his ultimate fate is up to the reader to decide. It lays the questions out there without giving any kind of answers or hints of answers, and unlike most of Vonnegut's novels there's no hope at all, just a clenched fist closing in on nothing. And the hand is getting tired.Worth reading if you're a Vonnegut fan but it's definitely a bit different in tone from the others. How you feel about that is up to you."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Is Howard W. Campbell's conscience clear? Should it be? Can Campbell function as an allied agent while spewing hateful propaganda over German radio? Is the good he does spying greater than the harm he does supporting Nazi power and by extension the Holocost and WWII itself?This is Vonnegut's most conventional novel (though none of them is sci-fi really) and Campbell's eventual exile and self-doubt is beautifully and convincingly rendered. Among other things, we are asked if Campbell's attitude--having no politics but a \\"nation of two\\" with wife Helga--is sufficient in a time of war. To what extent is he responsible for his actions regardless of his intentions? And what is he to do about it, both during the war and after? Could he have done anything differently or better? Would doing nothing have been better?Aside from the moral conundrums there is a strongly realized and written novel here that holds its own with any other writer's work, with rich characters and scenes that might surprise the reader of other Vonnegut novels with its conventionality. In particular, Campbell's long exile in New York mourning Helga (and to a lesser extent himself) is often poignant. His nearly domestic relationship with George Kraft during this time is charming. Of course Kurt Vonnegut also puts Campbell in conversation with fellow Haifa prisoner Adolf Eichman, as only K.V. would do. One of Vonnegut's best."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Although I must maintain that this is not Kurt Vonnegut's best book, it is a very good and certainly enjoyable one, with a biting moral to boot. It also marked a departure for Vonnegut from the science fiction mold that he cast his first two books in. This is also the first time that he dealt with what was perhaps the central experience of his life in his fiction (his experiences in World War II.) The premise of the book is this: a man purporting to be a Nazi radio propagander is actually an American spy. However, after the war is over, the American government refuses to admit that he worked for them, and he is charged as a war criminal. This begs the question: which one was he, really? This is a central question to keep in mind throughout the book, and the ending is startling. It also raises one of Vonnegut's best questions:We are who we pretend to be, so we better be darn careful who we pretend to be."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Howard W. Campbell, secret agent for the US and a Nazi propaganda artist faces execution by a War crimes trial in Israel circa 1960.

Vonnegut leaves us with a story of a man plagued by his on ambiguity and the consequences of associating one's self with the wrong cause. Very good story, very insightful writing; Vonnegut shows mastery."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"I have tried to read Vonnegut's books on many occasions, and have never been able to finish them. I found _Mother Night_ to be very readable...First, it is a short book. The author's style adds to this by the wonder of the 1-2 page chapter.Next, I found myself much more interested in the story he tells here than in others I have attempted.So, what's this book all about? It tells the tale of a man who served the Nazis in his heart and in his very being as a radio propagandist. However, this man was an American by birth and was solicited by the American government to serve as a spy, sending coded messages through the very same radio broadcasts in which he mocked and criticized American actions (especially Franklin Delano Rosenfeld). We read his \\"memoirs\\" as he sits in a Jerusalem jail in 1961. We discover what he has lost over the course of the war and the afterwar era.As I said, I enjoyed this book, both for its story and for the writing used. It's an enjoyable read!"},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Though it doesn't often get mentioned alongside Vonnegut's other masterpieces, I've always felt that Mother Night may actually be my favorite Vonnegut work, even if I can't explain why. Certainly, the central concept - in which an American becomes a prominent propagandist for the Nazis as a front for spy work which he himself doesn't understand or have any proof of - is a fascinating one, and the moral complexity of the situation is never lost on Vonnegut. And undoubtedly, the pain and emotion of the book is as strong as any of his works, if not somewhat more so, as he deals even more directly with the horrors of World War II than he did in Slaughterhouse Five, confronting head-on the world of the Nazis and attempting to understand exactly how these events could have happened. And sure, there's Vonnegut's wonderful motto to the story - \\"We must be careful what we pretend to be, lest we become it\\" - but there's so much other good writing, including what may be one of my favorite passages the man ever wrote:\\"There are plenty of good reasons for fighting,\\" I said, \\"but no good reason ever to hate without reservation, to imagine that God Almighty Himself hates with you, too. Where's evil? It's that large part of every man that wants to hate without limit, that wants to hate with God on its side. It's that part of every man that finds all kinds of ugliness so attractive.\\"It's that part of an imbecile,\\" I said, \\"that punishes and vilifies and makes war gladly.\\"In the end, it's hard to pinpoint exactly what it is I love so much about Mother Night, simply because there's so much to get lost in here, from a tragic romance to a bizarre (and funny) satire of racism, from a study of evil to a lament for humanity. Mother Night depicts a man who has done horrible actions, and even though he may have done them for what seemed like good reasons, that doesn't make it any easier to live with. Add to that Vonnegut's typically wonderful, off-kilter world, his gallows humor, his sweet hopeful cynicism, and you have an unrivaled and sadly overlooked work by a man who was one of the world's great writers."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Prerequisite for Mother night is Palm Sunday, where Vonnegut bemoans the lost of his family's ties to German culture. Motehr night, like Speer's biography (and Arendt's interview with Eichman) is about how easily a seemingly ordinary person, this time Vonnegut imagining himself as an American in Germany before and during WWII, can fall into fascism out of opportunism. Sister book to this one (complementary) is Slaughterhouse Five, which Vonnegut did not have to invent because he was there for the show."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"A classic! Easily one of the best books ever written, and possibly Vonnegut's greatest work. The story of Campbell was so compelling, the first time I read it I finished it in one sitting. I am now reading it again for the fourth time, and it still enraptures me. Vonnegut's style is superb, and the skill with which he weaves this tale is astounding. The ending shocked me, and it still haunts me every time I read it. The only regret I have is that I can only give it 5 stars."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"It's been some time since I finished reading Mother Night, so all I am left with is a smoldering memory of what I thought of the book at the time. Since that's what I have to work with, bear that in mind as you read this review. Like most Vonnegut books, this takes on a different level of writing than many of the books out there. As such, they're generally better than most anything you'll pull off the shelves of your local bookstore.Mother Night is no different, despite the fact it's not one of his best works. In his own words, Vonnegut describes this book as sub-par, or at best, average. For him, maybe I agree. But the book on its own merits is still quite good. Vonnegut has a way of writing that few can attain. He is both deep yet easy to read, a feat accomplished by few writers.In brief, the book is about an ex-Nazi radio host who is long removed from the war and generally trying to stay below the radar of modern times in America. His guilt or innocence is up to the reader to decide. There is more to the story than I suggest here. Readers of Vonnegut know that nothing is ever that simple in his books. Maybe that's because nothing is ever that simple in life to begin with. Vonnegut captures that in his works.The book is good, but not vintage Vonnegut. It moves well enough, but can be a tad slow at times. Overall, this is probably a 3.5 star book. Since there is no 3.5 rating, I am left to give it 4, since it's probably only fair to compare it with other fiction, and not only against his other works. Overall, for Vonnegut, I would say this is a solid 3: average, solid, enjoyable.Overall, not his best work, but worth the read nonetheless."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"So easy to read.....so deep.....so perfect a tale of pretending and its potential consequences. I wish I could add something new to the many excellent reviews here. Can't!"},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"I give this book a 4 stars...It is great.The wonderful dry humor that is so true is matchless. It is really perfect.The story is about Campbell an allied agent who was a sort of a double agent Tokyo Rose of Nazi Germany broadcasting propaganda and at the same time relaying coded messages to the allies.Guess what happened to him after the war... read the book."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"I began reading Vonnegut on the suggestion of one of my English teachers. Thus, far I have read six of his novels. Mother Night is the first one I've read which has any possibility of actually occuring (it's not science fiction).An American living in Germany becomes a spy for the Allies, loses everything that matters, thinks he regains it, then is crushed once more! Dark humor. check. Odd love scenes. check. great style. uncheck.The novels that made Vonnegut a name for himself such as Cat's Cradle and Slaughter-House Five are certaintly amiss here. His anthropologist side even faded a little bit. In fact, some of the plot was so cheesy it was strange to remind myself that one of my favorite authors wrote it.If you love Vonnegut pick this book up. It won't take long to read and you can decide for yourself. The book does deserve a 4/5 which is what I'm awarding it. It wins this due to just the right amount of cheek. However, I rather re-read Galapagos or Slapstick."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Mother Night is one of Vonnegut's best and especially after reading Breakfast of Champions, this one surprised me. Vonnegut has best range of a writer that I have ever seen( or read in this case). In Breakfast Of Champions, he throws you into the modern day world and doesn't expect you to really take any of this seriously. In Mother Night he takes you on the journey of Howard W. Cambell Jr., through his time as a playwrite and author before the war, through his happy times with his wife,Helga, through his recruit ment by a dissapearing american soldier,and so on.Anyway I thought it was going to be hard to take this into heart, but I ended up beleiving every word. Mother Night is not only a great Vonnegut book, but a great read in itself, pick it up you won't be dissapointed.Hiho."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Mother Night is almost insanely profound, and equally insanely easy to read. Never before have I read a book so packed with material for thought in such an easy to digest package...imagine eating cotton candy and getting the same satisfaction (and nutritional content!) as you would had you eaten a five-course meal. I just finished re-reading it, and am still somewhat in awe. The harried musings of a man who obviously has seen much, and is disappointed in what he sees, but with a shrug of the shoulders. This book made me stop to ponder until it hurt, and supplied me with my new favorite quote...&quot;It's a hard world to be ludicrous in.&quot;You can read this easily in one sitting, and puzzle over it for a lifetime."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Man, if any of his books really reflects his views on war, government, and patriotism, this one leads the pack. He lays the satire on pretty thick. Unlike _Bluebeard_, he handles the fictional biography idea well. The book is structured very nicely. Like _Bluebeard_ though, he provides one of the more satisfying conclusions to his story. Many of his books are weak when the end hits."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"This is an excellently written book by Vonnegut. These memoirs of a Nazi propagandist will force you to question the way you live your life. Are we who we pretend to be? Could doing evil thing for a good cause possibly make you an evil person? Is there anyting worth living for other than love. If these questions interest you, please read this book. The themes of this book will make you think."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"&quot;Mother Night&quot; is one of those books that is hard to put down. The main character and his life as a playwrite is excellently done by Vonnegut, with his usual twists, turns, and sudden revelations. This book is a must to read!"},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Howard Campbell's &quot;contributions&quot; to World War II are put under a moral microscope that is unable to yield a verdict of good or bad. With a set of characters that epitomizes the term &quot;black humor,&quot; Kurt Vonnegut examines the motives of the U.S. and German governments as well as the limits of the human conscience. Vonnegut creates darkly humorous characters, such as the Black Fuhrer, to surround Campbell in his struggle to reconcile his past and the consequences of his actions. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has been interested in the moral complications of the World War II ideologies of the western world. It is fascinating and disturbing and will make any reader study his/her own conscience."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"What can I say about this book? I loved it! Hell, I wish I wrote it!!"},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"I have only read about 4 other Vonnegut books and this one is hands down my favorite. Vonnegut has given us one of his most interseting characters and most thought provoking plot. I read this book once but I remember it like I've read it three or four times. If you have never read any Vonnegut, this is a good place to start"},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"When I first read this novel, directly after readingCat's Cradle, I was disappointed. There was something there that I felt that it lacked. The normal Vonnegut wit and humor only surfaced momentarily. But after much recollection about this, I feel that it is indeed a truly tremendous and well thought out story about a man discovering his own inhumanity. I highly recommend this novel to the experienced Vonnegut reader, others should be weary. (Also see the movie! A great adaptation."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"I once heard this wonderful little quote:\\"Valor is to do unwitnessed what we would like to do in front of the whole world.\\"I think this quote applies very aptly to the main character of this book--he traded his wife, his career, and his sanity for a hidden role in a noble cause. At this point many (possibly including the author) would disagree with me. After all, was he not a Nazi? If Germany had won the war, would he not have continued to rant on in his propanganda-filled shows?Unlikely. Considering how even Russia found out about his status as an American spy, I dare say that his secret would not have remained one for long in the mirror scenario.The ultimate result of his choice would have been ignominious death no matter what the outcome of the war.Finally, what about \\"you could never have served the enemy as well as you served us?\\" The veracity of that statement is moot to debate because we are not given exact information on the nature of messages he sent. Even if the statement *was* true, the fault would lie with his recruitor and FDR, not himself. The path of being a Nazi propagandist was paved by those two--Campbell could have easily been a neutral playwright through the war, and emerged unscathed in either outcome of the war.Thus, my contention is that Campbell was a true hero."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read. The story of Howard Campbell is compelling. All of the differing supporting characters are interesting. Since most of the other reviews are so good, I'll just say that this is a book that is a joy to read and is easy to read. It is relatively short and Vonnegut writes in a style that makes you want to finish the book in one night. Also of interest is the movie Mother Night starring Nick Nolte which stays very close to the book and features a cameo by Vonnegut."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"MOTHER NIGHT was first published in 1961. It's amazing how little things have changed.Howard W. Campbell, Jr., Vonnegut's major character, is an American who has lived in Germany since his father was transferred there when he was eleven. As an adult he is making a good living as a playwright when he is approached by a man named Frank Wirtanen who recruits him to spy for America. Wirtanen warns him that America will never admit they recruited him as a spy. Campbell becomes one of the most famous propagandists in the Nazi party, but during his broadcasts, his coughs and verbal pauses and other mannerisms send important messages to the Allies.At the end of the war he is captured by Bernard B. O'Hare as a war criminal, but Wirtanen comes to his rescue and helps him escape to America where he is living in a run-down attic.At the beginning of the novel Campbell is about to stand trial in Israel, having been outed by a Russian spy named Kraft-Potapov. Prior to his arrest, he is reunited with his wife Helga who he thought was dead. He is also celebrated by a collection of weird American neo-Nazis led by a crazy dentist named Lionel J.D. Jones, who thinks he can prove Jewish and negro inferiority using their teeth. Jones also publishes a newspaper called The White Christian Minuteman.When Campbell's address is revealed in The White Christian Minuteman, all kinds of so-called patriots come looking for him, the foremost of whom is Bernard B. O'Hare, now a failed businessman who has devoted his life to the recapture of hero/war criminal Campbell.Irony runs rampant. No one is who he/she seems to be. For me the climax of the book was when O'Hare confronts Campbell. Campbell says to O'Hare, \\"There are plenty of good reasons for fighting, but no good reason ever to hate without reservation, to imagine that God almighty Himself hates with you, too. Where's evil? It's that large part of every man that wants to hate without limit, that wants to hate with God on its side.\\"Here we are in 2007, forty-six years later, and we've still got politicians and commentators reviling \\"evil-doers,\\" and Swift boaters portraying silver star winners as unpatriotic. It seems like we should've learned something in all that time."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"This is the sixth novel that I have read by Kurt Vonnegut, and like I expected, it did not fall short of the high expectations that I have had for all of his works.Howard Campbell is an American agent in Nazi Germany during World War II, and he has been assigned the job of being a propagandist on the radio and getting to know the people behind the Nazi government. Supposedly, he's sending secret codes to the U.S. military over the airwaves, although he is unaware what exactly he is sending.After the war he is protected by the U.S. government from trial despite the fact that he became very infamous during the war for his hate speech and propaganda. He isolates himself for several years in New York, where he is discovered by a Russian agent in disguise, who in turn tells the Israeli government about Campbell living in New York. The rest of the book is basically about Campbell dealing with this threat and the lessons he learns about putting on a mask and being someone that you are not.&quot;We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be.&quot;In my opinion, this is not Vonnegut's best novel (Sirens of Titans is), and neither is it his worst (the worst that I have read so far is Breakfast of Champions). What makes the other novels a tad bit better are the messages given in them; I wish the theme in this book was a little stronger. However, it was a very enjoyable read and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"As an avid Vonnegut reader, I found \\"Mother Night\\" to be particularly frightening and questionable...but in a good way. He points out the weaknesses of a government while also causing us to question morality. Howard Campbell was a Nazi, but a United States Government spy. Unfortunately, his actions caused a chain of events, leading to the death of many Jew's and causing a rise in nationalism for Germany. Only one other person knew he was legitamate in his actions, the man who recruited him. His life in radio propaganda used secret codes in his script. But then how do we consider a man who helped in the war effort by becoming the enemy? It's like answering the question, \\"Is it alright to steal a loaf of bread if your family is starving?\\""},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"To the best of my knowledge, there really is no other writer quite like Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. Mother Night appears to be a rather straightforward, albeit quirky, novel at first glance, but as one delves down into the heart of Vonnegut's prose one finds grounds for contemplation of some of life's most serious issues. This novel is the first-hand account of Howard Campbell, Jr., a most remarkable character. Campbell is an American-born citizen who moved to Germany as a child and became the English-speaking radio mouthpiece for Nazi Germany during World War II. In the fifteen years since the end of the war, he has been living an almost invisible life in a New York City attic apartment. He misses his German wife Helga who died in the war, sometimes thinks about his pre-war life as a successful writer of plays and poems, and perhaps just waits for history to find him once again. As we begin the novel, he has been found and is writing this account from a jail cell in Israel, awaiting trial for his crimes against humanity. While he is reviled by almost everyone on earth as an American Nazi traitor, the truth is that he was actually an agent working for the American government during the war; this is a truth he cannot prove, though. Thus, in this 1961 novel, the hero is ostensibly a Nazi war criminal.The primary moral of Mother Night, Vonnegut tells us in his introduction, is that \\"we are what we pretend to be\\" and should thus be pretty darned careful about what we are pretending to be (a secondary moral being the less enlightening statement \\"when you're dead, you're dead\\"). In the eyes of the entire world, Campbell is exactly what he pretended to be during the war, a traitorous Nazi purveyor of propaganda who mocked and demoralized allied troops as well as regular citizens. Internally, Campbell hardly knows what he is anymore; he claims no country, no political values, wanting only to live in a \\"nation of two\\" with his beloved wife Helga once again. A series of significant events forces Campbell out of the cocoon of his past fifteen years, and his thoughts and actions along the way provide big juicy morsels of food for thought: taking personal responsibility for one's actions, the harsh truths of war and peace, the sometimes vast differences between truth and fact, individual redemption before self and society, finding direction and a purpose in a world gone mad, etc. Vonnegut's scythe-like dark humor cuts deeper than mere satire, aiming directly at some of the darker sections of the human heart, areas which most individuals too often ignore or refuse to acknowledge. The gallows humor can be quite funny on the surface, but it is in actuality a scalpel which Vonnegut wields to open up the heart and soul of the reader for self-examination. Mother's Night, the title of which is taken from Goethe's Faust, is a relatively short but very powerful novel."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"\\"My name is Howard W. Campbell, Jr. I am an American by birth, a Nazi by reputation, and a nationless person by inclination\\" are the opening words to Kurt Vonnegut's tale of an American playwright living in Germany who, once World War II begins, becomes a Nazi radio propagandist. He becomes infamous for his disgustingly brutal radio shows which distributed wicked Nazi propaganda. He was thoroughly hated by the Americans, and loved by the Nazis. But there is one thing that you should know about Howard W. Campbell. He is an American spy. His radio shows are the medium for transmitting secret codes out of Germany to aid the American cause in the war. He was one of the most effective spies of World War II, and one of the only ones to survive the war. But after the war, he is simply discarded in a small New York attic apartment, with enough money to live the rest of his days there, but with no more direction to his life. He lives his life simply there, away from civilization and anyone who might recognize him as a war criminal, until a white supremacist discovers where he is located, and he once again must face his past. Mother Night is not a traditional war book, for rather than concentrating on the brutal aspects of combat, it focuses heavily on the equally gruesome subject of hate. Vonnegut also dissects the schizophrenic mind of a spy after the war has ended who has not only lost the trust of everyone he loves, but most importantly, his identity altogether, as he realizes he is a \\"nationless\\" person. The narrator is constantly questioning his identity, which has been muddled by his spy experiences. Vonnegut also discusses the minds of the Nazis, how ordinary and often intelligent men and women could be prompted to become the vicious killing machines that they were during World War IIMother Night is a sharp, funny book thats humor is both satiric and farcical. It is a very entertaining read with twists and turns at every corner, including a surprise ending that is sure to catch the reader off-guard. Although Kurt Vonnegut is more well-known for his novels such as Slaughterhouse Five and Cat's Cradle, Mother Night is truly an overlooked classic that offers an entertaining read for not just fans of war books, but any reader looking for a hilariously addictive and heart-breakingly poignant book."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"&quot;Mother Night&quot; by Kurt Vonnegut is a probing tale (a parable perhaps) about the difference between appearances and reality.&quot;Mother Night&quot; is actually one of three books I have recently read (or reread) that deal with the dichotomy between appearance and truth. &quot;Mother Night&quot; is clearly the least subtle book as far as advancing an argument...yet it is far and away the most powerful. Vonnegut navigates this ethical minefield in an entertaining, yet sobering manner.&quot;Mother Night&quot; tells the story of an American playwright who is enlisted to be a spy within World War II Germany. The playwright becomes part of the upper crust of Nazi society. Working as a talk-radio personality, he encodes top secret information in his pro-Nazi broadcasts. In so doing, he helps to bring about the eventual victory of the Allies.The war-time story-line of &quot;Mother Night&quot; is told in retrospect by the playwright who is living a secluded life in 1960's New York City. The reason he must live in hiding is that his Allied contact person during the war disappeared. He has no one left to testify to the fact that he worked for the Allies.The story takes off in grand Vonnegutian style as the &quot;protagonist&quot; of the story is discovered simultaneously by Nazi-hunters, Soviet agents, white supremacists, and a woman claiming to be his ex wife.Through it all, Vonnegut asks hard questions about what action, motivation, intent, and reality have to do with reality.I found this book to be eye-opening. It is engagingly told; containing passages of great beauty, sorrow, and even humor. I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Mother Night is perhaps the darkest of Kurt Vonnegut's novels in terms of it's storyline and sense of humor. Most of the humor within the book comes from Vonnegut's use of situational irony. The main character, Howard Campbell Jr., spent WWII as a double agent. He was a fairly famous German radio personality (dispensing all sort of pro-Nazi propoganda), and did his best to raise German morale during the war. At the same time, he was sending out coded messages for the allied troops over the radio. When the end of the war came, the US wouldn't aknowledge his part as an agent. Thus, Campbell became a war criminal. The novel, in large part, deals with Campbell's treatment after the war. This is where the irony comes into play. I won't go into what happens to Campbell (so as not to give away crucial elements of the plot. However, when reading, it is as Vonnegut states earlier in the book: be careful what you pretend to be [sic], for what you pretend to be is what you are. This story sticks out amonst Vonnegut's works as one of the most original, and suprising of his books. It is also a good introduction to the philosophies that are embodied in most of Vonnegut's other books. I believe that this particular novel is a good starting point for anyone interested in Vonnegut. (aside: do you ever feel like one of those little kids from Reading Rainbow when you're doing a book review?)"},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"... With this simple thesis that Vonnegut lays out in the introduction to his stellar \\"Mother Night,\\" we are entered into the morally complex world of Howard W. Campbell, Jr. You see, Campbell acted as a spy for the U.S. during WWII, but he was so deep under cover that even the American government has no evidence that he was actually working for them, that the broadcasts he was making on Nazi radio contained coded messages for American intelligence. There is only one man who can save Campbell from his trial, and he has no idea who he really is or how to contact him. Now, looking back on his life, Campbell begins to understand how morally suspect he is, no matter what his intentions were. In posing as a Nazi Campbell was party to some terrible atrocities that he, as well as the reader, must come to terms with and decide if he is a hero or just as bad as the villains he was ostensibly helping us fight. Is his plight tragic or deserved? Vonnegut, in top form, weaves together a compelling tale with his typical blend of dark humor and drama in what is, in my most humble opinion, his best novel ever -- and with a canon that includes \\"Slaughterhouse Five,\\" \\"Breakfast of Champions,\\" and \\"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater,\\" that is really saying something. An absolute must read."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"I don't see much point in describing the plot, because no plot summary can give you any adequate idea of what this amazingly powerful book is really all about. But then it's also hard to describe what it's all about, except to say that it encompasses themes of good and evil, responsibility and innocence, remorse and redemption, and the all-important question of whether our intentions can truly justify our actions. It's difficult for me to describe the effect this book had on me--perhaps I can convey some idea of its impact by saying that I frequently found myself raising my head from its pages with the words &quot;oh, _man_&quot; upon my lips and subsequently staring into space for several minutes while allowing the sentence I had just read to work its way through my system. At times I felt as though I'd been kicked in the gut...but it was well worth it. Few books I've read have been as profound or as thought-provoking. Don't expect it to make you happy--but expect it to make you think very seriously about the human condition and about the actions that even the best of us benighted beings are capable of."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"I recently read \\"Mother Night\\" for the second or third time. In the first readings I saw the novel for what it pretended to be--a story about a World War II spy, perhaps too dedicated and what happened to him after the war.In the last reading I recognized a story more representative of the today's world where the consequences of being dedicated--to both good and bad policy can have disastrous effects. Just a casual look at the economic problems of the last few years and the behavior of people on both sides of every issue leads one to question blind dedication that is often accompanied by a failure to see the big picture.Leaders today seem to be all too anxious to align themselves with certain causes, policies, and constituents. In some cases, it is doubtful they even believe strongly in them but there is personal gain to be gotten and so they believe. Vonnegut's warning: Be careful what you pretend to be.\\"Mother Night\\" can be read as an interesting piece of historical fiction or it can be seen as social commentary about taking positions that might grant immediate rewards or even make sense in the short run but that will later lead to problems. We are all being asked to lend our support to causes, to take a bigger role in politics, to become more active in the world around us. Vonnegut didn't tell us not to do these things but he did warn us to be careful.I recommend \\"Mother Night\\" because of the novel approach it takes to bringing these situations to life. It is an interesting story and a compelling problem that we should all be aware of, whether we are the ones doing the pretending or just following a pretender."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Vonnegut starts out this book with a warning : \\"We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be.\\" This story follows the life of an American playwright, Howard W. Campbell Jr., who happens to live in Germany during the Nazi regime. He is confronted by the Americans to work as a spy, sending secret messages through a radio broadcast. He agrees to this but at the same time his broadcasts are filled with propaganda, all in favor of Hitler and his actions. True to Vonnegut's style, the plot gets more and more twisted as the story goes on, ending with Campbell in an Israeli prison. This was a wonderfully well written novel with action and intrigue that made it hard to put down! Each time I finish one of Vonnegut's novels, I find myself longing to head back to the library to find another one."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Kurt Vonnegut must be the most deceptive author in history. His books have such a lithe and jocular style to them they feel like beach-reads, but you always finish them with a knot in the pit of your stomach.There's a great deal of well crafted sugar to make the medicine go down, but you still always taste it.Mother Night is by far the darkest of the Vonnegut novels I've read. Even more so then Slaughterhouse-Five. But where Slaughterhouse dealt with the hell that is war, Mother Night traces the purgatory that follows it and the lost wandering of one man that did both the greatest of good and the fiercest of evil.In each chapeter he gives you the set up for a joke, but intead of a punchline, he tells you the dog just died. It's dark, but always told with that knowing grin and that understated sleight of hand that makes all of his work so easy to overlook, but impossible to ever forget."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"This may be one of the most difficult to read of Vonnegut's novels. The themes of absurdity and fatalism are presented in a dark manner. Although the narration itself flows easily like a natural conversation and Vonnegut presents his themes in no uncertain terms (pages 224-225, 251), the characters are difficult to warm up to because each is traced with evil. The protagonist, Howard W. Campbell, Jr, was a \\"beacon\\" for Nazi propaganda and associated with the most notorious of the Nazi anti-heroes. The story goes back and forth between skittish encounters and tragic events that depict the illusion of an individual's purpose on earth. Entertaining, enlightening, but heavy.A key in interpreting this convoluted and dark novel is Vonnegut's dedication \\"to Mata Hari.\\" Some brief research into the life of Mata Hari reveals some obvious parallels with the confessions of Howard W. Campbell, Jr. Mata Hari's haunting legacy is whether she was guilty of espionage or not. Mother Night starts with the same question regarding Campbell. Similar to Hari, Campbell had been generally viewed as an artist, a free-spirited bohemian prior to his war experience. Also, similar to Mata, Campbell's relationships and liaisons with powerful men took him across international borders frequently, which eventually would lead to his downfall.In both cases, it is pointless to speculate whether or not Campbell or Hari were spies. Both were not only helpless in the face of the war machine (\\"gear teeth\\" in the \\"cuckoo clock of hell\\"), but also navely ignorant of the gravity of their respective situations after their arrests by the military. Hence the behaviors of both seem unfathomable, considering that each had actively determined the course of their life and constructed their own legendary persona, but also seemed pre-determined to be pawns in the immense storm of war.Mother Night is a two-fold investigation of self-deception and fatalism. Fatalism seems to be a product of the funny mind games we play with ourselves when we rationalize that what we are doing not only right, but our only choice. Possibly, fatalism is a product of learned helplessness, where we no longer feel our actions can make a difference. Therefore, we tell ourselves lies to make our actions seem justified and we are lulled into inaction. In the end, the damage is done and the lesson is that our lies may be more influential than our truths."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"If you've never read any of Vonnegut's books, this is a great place to start.

Perception is reality and you are what you pretend to be, as far as everyone else is concerned. There are important lessons in this book. This is not the usual comical Vonnegut.

To hide this fact he takes the job of broadcasting english-language nazi propaganda to american troops as &quot;the last free american&quot; (and uses coughs and hiccups in the antisemitic rants he broadcasts as a way to transmit secret info to american intelligence services.) The result? The most important american spy of the war is universally despised as a traitor and lives his life hiding from vengence-seeking victims of the Nazis... from soviet spies who want to prove the US &quot;harbors nazis&quot;... and even worse, from neo-nazi nutcases who want to crown him as a new Fuehrer.

It is different than the majority of his works, as Vonnegut does not rely on obvious comedy, or space travel. In this account of an accused Nazi war criminal, Vonnegut lets the reader deep within Campbell's mind, in order to allow the verdict to waver back and forth between guilty and not guilty. This is a brilliant novel, and it deals with issues deeper than Vonnegut lets on. A must for Vonnegut fans..."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"This deserves to be a modern classic, right up there with Slaughterhouse Five, The Naked and the Dead, Catch-22 and 1984. It is a disturbing and relentlessly insightful book about the human condition. A man agrees to act as a Nazi propagandist during WWII in order to be able to transmit coded messages to the Allies. But when we look beyond the good intentions, there is still the question of which side he aids most - the side he proclaims to profess to, or the side he secretly tries to aid? As mr Vonnegut writes himself in the introduction: &quot;We are what we pretend to be, and therefore we must be very carful of what we pretend to be.&quot; Read it - don't see the film."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Once again, Kurt Vonnegut has managed to capture the true irony, the true vitality,and dare I say it, the true silliness of the human condition. In &quot;Mother Night&quot;, Vonnegut displays Howard W. Campbell Jr., an German-American playwright living in Germany during WW II, who heads the Nazi propaganda machine while acting as a double agent for the Americans, slipping haphazard information into his propaganda broadcasts. The irony is that Campbell has no interest whatsoever in States, but finds the center of his existence in his marriage to Helga, a German actress who stars in his plays. The story is narrated by Campbell from an Israeli Jailhouse in Jerusalem, and one cannot but feel for this foppish romantic clown, who has committed the greatest crime known to humanity; he has loved with abandon"},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"For quite a while I had been planning on reading some of Vonnegut's books, but I kept forgetting and grabbing other things from my TBR list. But when a month back I saw the author interviewed in two of my favorite shows regarding his new book \\"A man without a country\\", I was once more enticed to follow-up on the idea of reading his works.It seemed to me that \\"Mother Night\\" was a good place to start as any, even though most people's starting point would probably be \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\", which I will hopefully get around to reading soon. In \\"Mother Night\\", Vonnegut presents us with an extremely interesting setting, which contains a whole array of \\"gray situations\\", since Howard W. Campbell, Jr. tells his story as an American spy working in the German publicity machine during World War II. What makes the case even more interesting is that the narrator is not really clear regarding the events that developed during that period. Logically, one would expect Howard to say he hated what he had to do in order to support the US, but in fact we are faced with a scenario that allows for a lot more ambiguity than that. And even though, I have only read this novel by this author so far, I believe that this is one of his most salient characteristics.Besides the interesting storyline, I was pleasantly impressed by the author's writing style, using short chapters that are somewhat linked in their main topics, but that are not completely linear. This reminds me of the work of one of my favorite Latin American authors, Eduardo Galeano, who uses a similar approach to writing. If you are interested in reading about the history Latin America and like Vonnegut's style, I highly recommend Galeano's non-fiction book \\"The Open Veins of Latin America\\".Coming back to Vonnegut, I recommend \\"Mother Night\\" to all those that enjoy stories in which ethics and the concept of what is wrong and what is right play a central role. As to me, I am already looking forward to my next Vonnegut read."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Vonnegut begins Mother Night with an introduction stating that this is the only story of his that he knows the moral, which happens to be: \\"We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be.\\" For an author whose novels often read like a Jacob's Ladder toy, amusing in their seeming lack of logic, it seems odd that he would write a novel with a clear and straightforward moral. However, what Vonnegut accomplishes in Mother Night is to rescue post-modernism from its more nihilistic tendencies, and makes it clear that our unreal selves can sometimes have real consequences.Mother Night is apparently the diary of Howard W. Campbell Jr., written while he was awaiting a war crime trial in Israel. Of course Vonnegut is using the theme of a found text while claiming he only edited the manuscript. Much like the characters in his books, the authenticity of the novel itself is amorphous.Through the course of the novel Campbell informs us that he was once a playwright turned Nazi propagandist who transmitted broadcasts espousing the Aryan philosophy across Europe. Similar to Reifenstahl's claims, Campbell states that his own politics are nonexistent, and that he was merely doing his job. In fact, he purposefully makes these broadcasts so over-the-top that no one could possibly see them as anything but ridiculous, but in a world where people like Hitler and Himmler somehow took over an entire country, Campbell's melodramatic broadcasts are viewed as genius. Soon he is contacted by an undercover U.S. agent who he affectionately calls his \\"Blue Fairy Godmother.\\" This agent forcibly recruit's Campbell as a double agent, and using Campbell's broadcasts the Blue Fairy Godmother is able to transmit secret codes to the allied forces.Vonnegut states in the book that the reason people are able to commit atrocities and still see themselves as a good person is the modern condition of schizophrenia. This leads to the question of whether or not Campbell is making up the Blue Fairy Godmother. Could the Blue Fairy Godmother be Campbell's own form of schizophrenia?By the end of the book Campbell turns himself into the Israeli authorities so he can stand trial for war crimes. In a sense, it doesn't really matter whether or not Campbell was a double agent because his actions had very real and harmful consequences regardless. He stoked the coals of the Nazi propaganda machine, and regardless of whether he is guilty under the law, Vonnegut uses Campbell's own admission of guilt to show that he is morally guilty. Whether or not Campbell was a double agent he is guilty of pretending to be a Nazi sympathizer. For a post-modern novel this is a very hard edged morality tale. Oftentimes post-modernism is criticized for moral relativity (interestingly enough, those who I've heard use moral relativity the most are conservative historians who wish to defend historical figures who have done questionable acts, slavery being a prime example). What Vonnegut accomplishes in Mother Night is to make it clear that while the \\"self\\" is amorphous and changing, our actual actions have a clear impact on others and cannot be fortified from morality."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"All I need to say is that this is the only book that I have EVER read twice! I'm sure I'll read it a few more times in my life. I never ever read anything twice or even think about it. I also watch the movie here and there just to refresh my memory, but it doesn't do justice to the book."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"One of Vonnegut's best-layed out novels, &quot;Mother Night&quot; was a world apart from what he had written before. Not to say that &quot;Sirens of Titan&quot; wasn't fantastic; it is probably, in the end, the better book. But here Vonnegut went beyond his substantial imagination to begin to broach two subjects which have haunted him throughout the rest of his career: the horrors of war and the fakeness of most people. Here, his hero spends time as an German immigrant spying for America by reading Nazi propaganda over the radio. His pre-inserted stutters and coughs are really secret messages, but nobody knows that. Indeed, after the war he finds himself a fugitive, and the book asks us to decide which is more important: His helping the Americans or making the Nazis believe in their cause. A fascinating book with lots of surprises, it began a cycle for Vonnegut which would combine harsh reality with an other-wordly imagination, all topped off with black humor. A fantastic recipe"},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Whenever I am between books, like if I have just finished one and am waiting for another one to come in the mail or just taking a week or two break from heavier reading, I will read this book.

I've read all of Vonnegut's books and enjoyed them all, but this one gets pulled off of my book shelf more than anything else. To borrow a quote from the book itself \\"We are what we pretent to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be.\\""},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"The usual Vonnegut: brilliant and iconoclastic. Very easy to read because of the short sentences and short chapters, but one needs to be alert to what is going on, who is who. The ending may leave you a bit up in the air. It would be worthwhile to see the excellent movie with Nick Nolte as Howard Campbell, Jr. The movie dialog is basically straight from the novel, but a few key scenes are left out. Look for Vonnegut in a scene."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"This is my third endeavor through the works of Kurt Vonnegut and it seems that 'Mother Night' plays out as a more conventional novel in terms of structure and theme. It's sheer brilliance is evident straight from the introduction; where Vonnegut asks that we be good at what we pretend to be, because that's who we will become. He also sets up the dark humor presented in the book by inplicating a second moral, simply stated: &quot;When you're dead you're dead.&quot; 'Mother Night' follows the narrative of Howard Campbell, war criminal, throughout his years following the time when he was an agent of the United States in Germany during WWII. Vonnegut, as commonplace in most of his novels, satirizes war and it's absurdity, love, race, and the meaning that we attribute to our lives in a meaningless world where there is essentially no escape. However, the book, unlike typical Vonnegut, focuses on one primary theme; that of the significance of truth. For the characters in 'Mother Night' becoming spies has left them with no country and no hope. What essentially keeps them (among them Campbell) is curiousity. However, as will be revealed during the course of the novel, even this will be crushed as lies become lies and then become truths, and Campbell will remain frozen in his tracks, a victim of the country that he helped and separated from his nation of two, the only nation that had any significance.A well-written narrative, funny and thought provoking. We laugh, but only a bit tentatively, as we watch the 'truth' unfold and wonder if it was worth knowing at all."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"One of the many wonderful angles of this book is the way Vonnegut is able to raise questions worth answering. One that's been talked about quite a bit is whether or not people can serve evil and still be considered good, even to themselves. As the narrator, Howard W. Campbell Jr. raises this question quite often by being ruthlessly honest with himself concerning his vitriolic radio addresses and other actions, and how they might have impacted the genocide that was occurring around him. In this way, Campbell seems to me a pretty reliable narrator, earning our trust by not trying to shift blame for his actions as an American agent. But I think Vonnegut also means for us to question some of Campbell's other actions that set up his future misery. In particular, Campbell seemed to be guilty of too much \\"uncritical love,\\" the term he gave the love that his wife, Helga, showed him.Campbell doesn't detail much of his thought process or how he wrangled with his decision to become a spy. Major Wirtanen, his recruiter, thinks he should because Campbell loves good, hates evil and believes in romance. That's true, but Campbell also says the best reason of all was that he would \\"have an opportunity for some pretty grand acting. I would fool everyone with my brilliant interpretation of a Nazi, inside and out.\\" And that's it. Next thing you know, he's a spy. There doesn't seem to be a whole lot of introspection there, just uncritical love for himself and his own acting ability, finally getting to act out his own play instead of just writing it.Also, there's the uncritical love he returns to Helga. Although Vonnegut closes his introduction by saying, \\"make love when you can. It's good for you,\\" he seemed to show through his portrayal of the romance between Campbell and Helga (and later Campbell and Resi) that uncritical love, while it can be intensely gratifying, can lead to trouble later on. Campbell notes how \\"mindlessly\\" the two clung to each other, and the scant evidence he provides of the relationship outside of the bedroom seems to back that up. He says that the two only heard \\"the melodies in our voices. The things we listened for carried no more intelligence than the purrs and growls of big cats.\\" Helga actually believed everything Campbell said on the radio -- and this actually made Campbell happy. He had no problem with his wife seeing him as a Jew-baiting Nazi, even though he was completely different on the inside. If he had told Helga that he was a spy, perhaps she would've been able to keep him grounded when away from his work as an agent, reassuring him that he was only performing a duty, an act, that he really was a different person. Likewise, although he doesn't present any evidence (perhaps because he didn't want to), Helga appeared to be just as patriotic toward the Nazi cause as Campbell pretended to be. Apparently, this didn't bother Campbell either. In reality, neither of the two cared what the other did or said -- they were star-struck lovers, and Campbell's uncritical love of Helga came back to haunt him (for the rest of his life) when she was killed in Crimea. His desperation manifested itself in his easy acceptance of Resi as Helga later on in the book. Campell was so eager to give his love away that he couldn't (or maybe didn't want to) distinguish betweent the sisters. This, too, came back to haunt him through Resi's betrayal and death, making Campbell more despondent -- despondent enough to set up the conclusion of the novel."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Mother Night is one of those books I pick up during idle time. It's one of those books that calls to be read multiple times. It reads much smoother than Slaughterhouse, which is perhaps why I am more drawn to it. For those who have yet to pick up a Vonnegut book, I would recommend Mother Night as the first to be read. I feel this way because it is, as far as I'm concerned, Vonnegut's &quot;easiest read.&quot; (After Mother Night, I would recommend Galapagos as the next to be read on the way to Slaughterhouse. Vonnegut declared Galapagos his best novel I might add)My copy of Mother Night is filled with doggy ears marking witty, vivid, and droll language used by Vonnegut. I find myself peeking into my copy when I need a laugh or two.In conclusion, I might say that if I were forced to choose one book to read for an eternity, Mother Night would not be it. But if I were allowed 5 books, it would easily make the cut."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Kurt Vonnegut's novels are famous for their commentary on society, and their examination of morality, and ethics. Mother Night is no different; placing the reader into the mind of an ex-playwright turned propagandist, and a former nazi.The story is told from the point of view of Howard W. Campbell Jr., now living in seclusion in 1960 Manhattan. Campbell lived in Germany during WWII and is approached by an undercover American spy, who instructs Campbell to infiltrate the Nazis, and act as a propagandist. He is told that his broadcasts will provide the US with intelligence, depending on his enunciation, and the nuances in the speech. Campbell does as he is told, and when WWII ends, his contact disappears and he is wanted for war crimes. He flees from authorities and hides in America.Throughout the novel, Campbell seems to be the only character who feels remorse for his actions, although he did nothing wrong. Campbell's deep-seated feelings of remorse and guilt despite his innocence increase as the novel progresses, and when his innocence is finally proved, he makes a surprising choice."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"This is not a classic KV book in the sense that there is no science fiction element, but everything else one has come to expect from KV can be found. Even in such a serious book Vonnegut finds a way to add his dark humor without disrespecting his message. And as usual Vonnegut offers an original perspective on a topic that is commonly used. Any Vonnegut lover should make sure that this book gets entered into their library. This may not be Vonnegut's best (my opinion it is Cats Cradle) but it is still an incredible read. My only problem is the same problem with most of his books; they are too short. It always feels like he has so much else to say, but I guess we cannot get greedy. This is a book for everybody."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Wow....I just finished Mother Night yesterday. It was very interesting and well written, as Vonnegut's novels seem to be. It was a departure from his usual crazy sci-fi. That does not mean it was bad, however. It was a great book because it had some great depth and philosophical things to say. It was such a page-turner that it only took me one day to read! And I usually don't like to read! Anyway, I give the book 6 stars, and this book is just another example of Vonnegut's genius in writing."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"This book is fantastic. The plot itself is worth the price of the book but the ending will throw you for a loop, I know it did for me.The book is a very quick read and doesn't really have alot of historical facts or detailed descriptions. This book is no different than any other Vonnegut book in that its very ambiguos. We never find out why the Nazi's decided to give Campbell his own show or why the OSS decided to use Campbell as a spy.Despite this the book is a very fun read. Its funny and often hilarious (especially when describing aging racists in America). I would reccomend this book to any reader of any age. Its, quite simply, a good story."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"In the end, you are what you pretend to be [so be careful what you pretend to be]... What a message. What an impact this book had on me... Many people might see a weak story here, and indeed I do, too, but the underlying message is highly important. And indeed, the books gets engaging at points by having a fast paced story at times, with a lot of... not action... but drama."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"It's vintage Vonnegut, but doesn't bristle like Slaughterhouse 5, B of Champions, or Galapagos.

And I love Vonnegut's writing so much, I'm soon going to read this book again!"},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"This book is about a man named George W. Campbell, Jr. who is an American by birth and German by heart. He is telling his story from a jail cell in Russia. Campbell tells of his life before moving to Germany, the great love between him and his wife, Helga, his experience of neing a spy for the United States in World War II as a radio broadcaster, and how he was hunted afterwards for being accused of being a traitor to humanity. There are many strange events that take place that will either make you think or giggle. In the end, Campbell's love for his Helga is his only inspiration to go on. I think this book will provide much humor to you as does many of Vonnegut's works do. It also mentions many incidences and ideas that happened in World War II. I recommend this book, especially to readers who enjoy historical fiction."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"I take my title from a piece by Kurt Vonnegut, \\"Why They Read Hesse.\\" The \\"they\\" was the youth of America. His answer was that Hesse tells them the things they want to hear, like bad is bad. He forgot to also stress, if I remember correctly, that Hesse writes in simple sentences with few words. You can read it on a bus or a treadmill at the gym. Complexity and intellectual challenge aren't the main things here.Vonnegut himself was a lot like that, and Mother Night is maybe the clearest example of this. It is a morality tale with all the ambiguity and subtlety of a topless bar. He starts with a conventional, but interesting, dilemma, that of the undercover agent who is two things at once, and the question is whether the inner is more real than the outer simply because it is inner. Vonnegut as usual attempts to cut this Gordian knot of the demands of duty with the sword of his 1960s hippy morality. And it's not such a bad approach--do no evil, don't think about the big picture, we are what we pretend to be.So the protagonist willingly accepts his punishment as a traitor despite having the exonerating evidence at hand because he realizes he was what he pretended to be--that his pretend acts had real results. That works great--a \\"good\\" person pretended to be \\"bad\\" and so did \\"bad\\" things and hence was really bad once we use Vonnegut's miracle quotation-point-removing morality.But if \\"we are what we pretend to be,\\" is a bad person who pretends to be good actually good? If my hypocritically simulated sacrifice inspires others to sacrifice themselves for values they believe in, am I really good? Is the coward general who roars \\"come on brave boys, follow me!\\" and then doubles back once they start running a hero?I wish it were so. But I don't think it is that simple. Although it wasn't my principal aim, I ended up being lauded as some sort of hero sacrificing myself for the truth. And that led others to make real sacrifices--and the funny thing is, this ended up wrecking my whole plan in the first place!--for things that I also believe in. Even if I set this in motion, I can't say that this makes my acts \\"good.\\" I don't think Vonnegut was really up to thinking through the actual complexities of moral action in this world. It isn't simply about your \\"effects\\" it is about your self-hood, your authenticity. Campbell had that. Vonnegut didn't know how to deal with that.One last thing--the new cover looks exactly like the logo for the Victor mousetrap. Is that intentional? Did they see Campbell as being trapped like a mouse in a larger plan he didn't understand? [42]"},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Kurt Vonnegut views concerning wars.

Some of it is humorous. Some of it is scary. And all of it shows the workings of the author's rather strange mind. It's refreshing to read a novel like this and it is also frustrating. It is so exaggerated, absurd and satirical that there were parts of it that made me laugh out loud. Often, all I could think of is how the author's mind worked in such a deranged way. I found that refreshing.Yes, this was a satire. It's not supposed to ring true. It's supposed to make me think. And, yes, it did that. And yes, the author is a bit of a genius.

He does a good job of putting the book in a realistic historical perspective and makes some great statements about war, espionage, the human soul, and misguided racism and politics. I wouldn't call it his best work, but the worst thing he's written would still warrant at least 4 stars, and this gets 5."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Ah. Vonnegut. Vonnegut humor, yes! Draging the effects of World War II into the Sixties, he shows how it truly changed anyone's and everyone's life. The main character no longer belongs to America, or Germany.

Excellent excellent book. Bravo, Kurt Vonnegut, bravo!"},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"'Mother Night' is the story of Howard W. Campbell Jr. Nazi propagandist, racist, war criminal, and American spy. The story, told by Campbell from his prison cell in Israel, is of his success as a playwrite in Germany before the war, his recruitment by US intelligence, the devistation of the loss of his wife, the utter lonliness and apathy that plagued his life after the war, and the web of political intrigue that surrounds him before his trial. The style is similar to Vonnegut's other masterwork, 'Slaughterhosue Five,' in which Campbell also makes an appearence, and is told with the same wit and wonderful insight into the human soul. Truly a classic and a pleasure to read!"},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"If you're looking for the definative Vonnegut book - this is it. His finest if not one of the finest novels ever written.

The overall story is somewhat sad, frustrating, and depressing, but, Vonnegut still somehow finds ways to insert humor, beauty, etc....so that ultimately, Mother Night in no way bogs down the reader, or puts you in a sour mood. I'm amazed at how Vonnegut can, at times, find gems of beauty in ugly situations. His unique description of the dream-like stairway to a roofless night sky in a ravaged, war-torn land stands out in my mind vividly to this day.Excellent writing throughout... highly recommended reading."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Here is the fictional autobiography of Howard W. Campbell, Jr., as given by the awesome Vonnegut.Without giving away key plot points, I'll recommend this book right off the bat. Here is Vonnegut, yes if you can believe it, decrying the state of humanity, witfully and ironically too. There is a given moral sense to Mother Night, which Vonnegut states in the Introduction: \\"We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful what we pretend to be.\\"And Mother Night is a story of how Howard W. Campbell, Jr. and his associates must and do and will deal with said moral.Mother Night is quite moving, in the way that so much Vonnegut is; in that here is a hero or anti-hero, a lead if you will, who is shaped rather than shapes his or her time. And how that shaping baffles, sparkles, crushes, devoures, stimulates and paralyzes.Given an opportunity to be someone else, and taken to the fullest, for a good cause (or not), where are you then? You only have yourself....in the end....to blame....Again, highly recommended."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"I've been on a Vonnegut binge as of late, reading a novel a week in what has become a sort of obsession. Mother Night is by far his most compasionate novel. It's a bittersweet tale of a misunderstood American Nazi Propagandist spy (working for the U.S., only nobody can know this) named Howard W. Campbell (Jr.) After the war, he is forced to live in solitude in any place he wishes. He chooses New York City, where his hopes of being lost in the crowd go unfulfilled. He lives the rest of his days in peace and solitude. That is untill he gets a knock on the door from some old war buddies. Now, one would imagine that living with the pain and anguish of causing millions of deaths would get to a person after a while. Only this is not the case for Howard W. Campbell (Jr.). He seeks solace in a love lost. In some of the most heartbreaking scenes ever written on a piece of dead tree. Mother Night is a must read for anyone looking for insight into the human condition (as are all Vonnegut novels!).Pick up Mother Night, and prepare to become a die hard Vonnegut fan all over again."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"I generally get around to reading this book once a year.

This is perhaps the finest literature penned in English. Read it. You will laugh when you really think you should be crying."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Though this is the most humorless of the Vonnegut novels I've read, I also believe it makes a rather profound statement about the true meanings of good and evil. Though this is only my interpretation, I believe this novel is a statement against those who would put the nature of right and wrong in rigid, unnegotiable divisions. It encourages the reader to take a moment and think before judging a situation solely on personal biases. A quote from this book that particularly struck me, and I believe reflects the theme of the novel is this:&quot;Say what you want about the sweet miracle of unquestioning faith, I consider a capacity for it terrifying and absolutely vile!&quot;I hesitate to give this book five stars only because I reserve that rating only for books that leave me with the feeling that I won't read something that good for quite awhile. Nonetheless, an excellent book that has my recomendation."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Authors have long had a great flaw in portraing good and evil in humans. The characters portrayed in art almost always seem to be either good or evil. Vonnegut, one of the best observers of human nature manages in this book to portray we humans as we really are, a composite of many things.Our hero, Howard, is a American spy in Germany during WWII. A profession that would be the most nobel and great characters in anything but a Vonnegut work. Here he faces a delema, his cover is that of a Nazi propagandist. He is in fact the finist most convincing Nazi propagandist. The question is which side did he help more.On the other side of the coin is a absurdly insane American Nazi dentist/embalmer. Yet oddly enough this character has gaps his his racist record. He never writes his insane essays about the inferior teeth of jews and blacks while he's married and loved.There is an American war hero turned alcoholic who's drivin to take what little joy in Howards life away from him.A Jew who survives Hitler by forging papers and joining the SS.A camp survivor who wishes nothing more then forget the whole bloody thing and get on with his life and his mother who gains wisdom through her suffering.Vonnegut turns the world inside out in what I consider the best literary treatment of human morality ever written"},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"This is a wonderful tale with the adage \\"damned if you don't, damned if you do\\". In this witty and sarcastic novel, we see an American/German agent Howard Campbell Jr. in the (then present) 1960s in prison in Israel. He is penning his autobiography (a common writing style that Vonnegut was fond of), and reminisces back to the pre-war times as well as a large chunk of the book about the time after the war and up to his capture. He was recruited by the US to serve as a spy, broadcasting his messages during his anti-semite and anti-American German broadcast. While Germans praised his radio broadcasts, Americans and Jews despised and reviled him. What makes the situation worse is that nobody really covers for Campbell after the war. He is more or less cut loose to just deal with the aftermath on his own.Campbell is an odd duck. He seems so lost at times, that it appears he almost wants to get caught. When he goes into hiding in New York, he doesn't even change his name. What is different about this novel compared to others is that Campbell is really the main focus and there isn't much fleshing out of tangent characters. Instead tangent characters appear as archetypes that Vonnegut is quick to deconstruct. In fact, this is one of his signature styles, used more in this novel than in others such as Bluebeard and Sirens of Titan. Despite the lack of characterization of supporting characters, the character Campbell is complex enough to satisfy many Vonnegut fans.The story moves forward, explaining the reasons behind his acceptance of such a self destructive espionage assignment, and the reason for his capture. The novel works towards an ending that is among the best in my opinion of any Vonnegut novel. The final two lines are worth reading the entire novel just to get there. Please don't look ahead and spoil it!I would say this is a very good Vonnegut work. I would NOT recommend this as an introduction to his work for any first timer. Instead try Player Piano, Bluebeard, or even Sirens of Titan (one of my favorites) or Slaughterhouse Five. This doesn't quite grip one as much as the main body of his work, but it is definitely among his best. I did read it over two days, picking it up every chance I got. But it didn't cause me to skip real life in favor of reading as did Slaughterhouse Five or Cat's Cradle.I highly recommend this for anyone who has read another Vonnegut novel. Even if this is your first Vonnegut, it's not the toughest to get into and absorb. That would be Cat's Cradle. Which is probably the most rewarding of any of his works.PS: Howard Campbell Jr. appeared in Slaughterhouse Five, years before Mother Night was written."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"This book left me feeling a bit disturbed, though I enjoyed it - as it was extremely well-written.

Did he become so good at what he was pretending to be that he really started to feel that way? Hmmm...I guess that was the purpose of the story - to leave you guessing.

He starts to cooperate with the US army but not out of any moral ground. He doesn't hate the Nazis, he doesn't love them either. All he cares about is his writing and his wife. And that's enough for him. But his skills are demanded by both sides. The Nazis want him for the Propaganda, and the US as a spy. So he starts to work for both.

Here is the best book I have read so far this year. American Howard W. Campbell Jr. winds up living in Germany in the pre-world war years, due to family circumstances. When war breaks out there, he is an unassuming playwright. He is recruited as an American spy agent, and agrees, without much conviction, to give it a try. He is wildly successful, not only for the Americans, but for the Germans as well. His role there as a radio propagandist earns him legions of devout young followers, and he quickly rises in prestige among the German Reich. And his own identity, if he ever really had one, becomes murky in the life that has taken shape for him. The story follows him as decades go by after the war, and he is living an unassuming life in America again, except for his status as a Nazi war criminal. He has seemingly been abandonded by his Amercian government.The book is short, and is packed with powerful moments. It is impressive how the imagery and moods are so effectively laid out with each short scene. Every few pages evokes emotion that should have taken many chapters to achieve. Campbell is a brutally honest character when it comes to his analysis of his own nature, feelings, actions and intentions. The story is told in the format of a journal he is writing about his experiences, while awaiting his war trial. Verdicts are left to the reader, as to what his responsibility truly was. I found him to be a very tragic figure, all in all, perhaps unable to sort out for himself what his true identity and nature was.Broken down, this could be another case to support the \\"war is hell\\" theme. But it is, at its heart, a study of human character. It is, I believe, a celebration of the written word. Vonnegut throws that party like few I have read."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"I love this book. I think it is an excellent and somewhat terrifying examination of the concept of moral responsibility. The narrator is conscious of the harm he can cause if he manipulates the truth so he consciously realizes that he is even more guilty of atrocities than those who truly believe in their cause and commit evil out of ignorance or some kind of deep psychological disturbance (or blind faith). Wow."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"It's hard to overdo the superlatives when reviewing Kurt Vonnegut, so when describing the classic \\"Mother Night,\\" \\"unparalleled\\" comes pretty easily. This is an extraordinary novel that will smack you like a two-by-four between the eyes on many levels. There's man's inhumanity to man in the unthinkable atrocities of Hitler's Germany, told unvarnished yet without the more typically requisite hand-wringing. And then there's the deeply emotional love story told, I thought, with a passion uncommon in Vonnegut's scalpel-edged cynicism and black humor. But most extraordinary in this masterpiece is the dissection of moral dilemma, told from the viewpoint of protagonist Howard W. Campbell. Campbell was born in America but lived in Germany since childhood, rising to become Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbel's chief radio voice of The Third Reich - an American spewing hate for America and for Jews while heaping praise upon his jack-booted Nazi masters. A man justifiably despised by Israel and the west as a traitor and monster, except for one cruel Vonnegutian twist: Campbell is a deep - very deep - undercover agent for the US, who throughout the war infused his hate-speech with coded messages greatly aiding the war effort of the ally forces.Campbell tells his story in 1961 while in an Israeli prison cell awaiting trail as a Nazi war criminal. From his days in Germany treading a dangerous path between the fascists and the shadowy spy master who pulls his strings to a cloistered secret life in New York City following the war, Vonnegut spins a tale that is wholly immersive - a haunting story of a man who has played both on poles for so long that his morale compass can no longer distinguish north from south. And if Campbell's life and head wasn't already muddled enough, Vonnegut delivers one final mean twist via the Soviet Union that is as ironic as it is unexpected.A few years back, the talented Martin Cruz Smith wrote a scorching soul-searcher, \\"December 6\\" of an American ex-pat in Tokyo immediately prior to Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor. Looking back, and taking nothing away from Smith's extraordinary effort, it seems clear that \\"Mother Night\\" influenced and inspired Smith in crafting his own treatise of the kind of moral vs. patriotic conflict that war can produce. \\"Mother Night\\" is that kind of book - one that you'll remember, one that will haunt you - one of those rare books you'll want to keep handy to refer back to from time to time. A milepost of American fiction from a 20th Century master - a classic that is long overdue in replacing Charles Dickens or Willa Cather in the fiction our kids are fed in high school English classes."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Another reviewer of this book titled his review &quot;Vonnegut: You can't read just one!&quot; Might I add that should you choose only one - This is it! In legendary Vonnengut style this book is humerous but dark. But compared to most of his other writings, the storyline of this book is very tight. And the fate of life, to which, the main character Howard W. Campbell Jr. is entitled, is almost too cruel to bear. This theme appear to be one of Vonnengut's favorites - the cruelty and irony of life. And as always he makes the point in humourous style. But in this novel much more is at play. It leaves one wondering about evilness as such. Are there such things in life for which no regrets are valid? Vonnengut tends to answer yes. But what is there of life, when you're left back with that? There is the sarchastic humor in which Vonnengut is a true master, covering up the fact that even good things gives you no pleasure when you've got the &quot;evil-mark&quot; upon you for life.This is probably one of the darkest novels I've ever come across, but also one of the very best. It forcefully presses some very important questions in a dark but nevertheless very humerous way. I really can't recommend it too much. I don't think anyone can read it without being deeply moved. But it ain't a book to make the sun start to shine. It's more like Monty Python signing &quot;Always Look on the Bright Side of Life&quot; to cheer up Jesus during his crucifiction. It'll never turn too bad for a good laugh. But that's excactly how bad it turns out for Howard W. Campbell Jr in this book. Read it for yourselves!!!"},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Kurt Vonnegut was a brilliant satirist, and much of this book is hilariously funny. Yet it has also something important to say about the moral questions raised by World War Two. Published in 1961 (Vonnegut's third novel), this anticipates his more famous war novelSLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVEby eight years, but it is no less unconventional in its view of the issues. Towards the end of his introduction to the 1966 edition, Vonnegut writes: \\"If I'd been born in Germany, I suppose I would have been a Nazi, bopping Jews and gypsies and Poles around, leaving boots sticking out of snowbanks, warming myself with my secretly virtuous insides. So it goes.\\" This is offensive, certainly -- but because it is flippant or because it is true? I can imagine few other authors who would have had the courage to say this; but I also know that although, with the self-canonization of hindsight, we might like to portray ourselves as heroic resisters, the reality in most cases would probably have been quite different.The book is presented as the confessions of Howard W. Campbell, Jr., written in an Israeli jail while awaiting trial for war crimes. Living in Germany during the interwar years, Campbell achieved some success as a playwright, mainly vehicles for his actress wife Helga. [He also kept a journal, entitled MEMOIRS OF A MONOGAMOUS CASANOVA, in which he told of his \\"conquests of all the hundreds of women my wife, my Helga, had been.\\" In this, at least, he was a romantic.] Just before war breaks out, he is recruited by an American spy master to offer his services to the Nazi hierarchy as a propagandist. So he spends the war making daily broadcasts whose content is virulently racist, but whose pattern of hesitations and speech mannerisms contains coded information for his own people. He is all too successful. At the end of the war, his father-in-law, now the chief of police in Berlin, says to him: \\"I realized that almost all the ideas that I hold now, that make me unashamed of anything I may have felt or done as a Nazi, come not from Hitler, not from Goebbels, not from Himmler -- but from you. You alone kept me for concluding that Germany had gone insane.\\" He succeeds so well that although the American authorities save him from hanging and enable him to go to ground in Greenwich Village, they can make no public acknowledgement of such a vilified figure.Campbell describes the next fifteen years as a purgatory worse than hell. But most of the novel focuses on the events that bring this to an end, as his address becomes known both to Israeli agents and to a neo-fascist group determined to exalt him as a hero. Although hilariously over the top, Vonnegut's satire of these American racial and religious extremists strikes quite a few targets even today. But Vonnegut uses the extremism to contrast with the much more reasonable morality growing within Campbell himself. Facing down a freelance assassin determined to rid the world of Evil, he says: \\"There are plenty of good reasons for fighting, but no good reason ever to hate without reservation, to imagine that God Almighty Himself hates with you, too. Where's evil? It's that large part of every man that wants to hate without limit, that wants to hate with God on his side.\\"No, Vonnegut is not a Nazi, and though writing with humor, he does not condone. But he condemns extremism on ALL sides, and sees human beings as a lot closer together than their ideologies might proclaim them."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Vonnegut plays with shades of gray throughout this novel. Roughly it's about an American spy who during WWII was an excellent propaganda machine for Germany. There's excellent tension within the character of Campbell, and throughout the novel I found myself torn between if he was guilty or innocent. All of the characters exist in gray, and for the main supporting characters their good and/or evil title is rather ambiguous. There are a few haunting phrases that pop up multiple times, usually in German, that tie the story together beautifully. Vonnegut's language is, as usual, gripping and very difficult to put down, even after you've finished. On top of that the ideas he shoves in your head are hard to let go of. If someone's pretending to be evil for a good cause, how much better is that than just being evil? Especially if they have the same exact negative effects?The only other Vonnegut novel I would put immediately above this one is Cat's Cradle.I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to rethink the definitions of good and evil, in disjunction and conjunction.Nibble: \\"It was typical of his schizophrenia as a spy that he should use an institution he so admired for purposes of espionage.\\""},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"It is rare that I consider a book unimpeachable--that also has the dubious horror of being anointed as a sacred cow or a platitude in the making. But there is a reason that Vonnegut's work is acknowledged as ageless and incomparable. He really is just that. MOTHER NIGHT is his third book, written in 1961, and the first book written in the first person, which allows the reader to descend deeper and deeper into the protagonist's mind. Vonnegut's past history of surviving the 1945 bombing of Dresden while underground in an abattoir has provided a lot of meat for several of his novels, and this one is a riveting example. This isn't one of Vonnegut's shaggy dog or science fiction stories. It has more of a reality-based feel to it. Every sentence is necessary and carefully wrought. His satire is on full display, but love and humanity are intertwined. His ability to embrace the skeptic with the sentimentalist seems effortless.The primary theme is penned in Vonnegut's introduction, written five years after the hardback was released.\\"We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be.\\"After the editor's note written by the (fictional) editor of this confessional story, we are introduced to Howard W. Campbell, Jr., the protagonist and narrator of his story as an American spy and former playwright and poet living in Germany during WW II. He is imprisoned in Israel for war crimes of treason and crimes against humanity; he was so good at his job that no one presently believes his patriotism and service to America. Campbell gave impassioned radio broadcasts, delivering prolific anti-Semitic messages to all of Nazi Germany. His \\"code\\" to the Americans was conveyed in mannerisms, emphases, coughs, and verbal stumbles. He became a minor celebrity to the Nazis.He loved and adored his German wife, Helga; together they were a \\"nation of two.\\" As a playwright, he understood \\"lies told for the sake of artistic effect\\" and that lies, in art, can be \\"the most beguiling forms of truth.\\" He never told Helga that he was a spy. He was separated from her, and she was presumed dead, and he later emerged in Greenwich Village to attempt to live in anonymity, although he kept his name. Helga--or someone like Helga--re-emerged, also. And a variety of white supremacists found him and wanted to herald him and protect him from harm. Only Vonnegut can combine slapstick with white supremacy and hold your heart in his teeth.This book had me in thrall from the first to last page. I paced periodically while reading--re-reading sentences, phrases, paragraphs. I was captivated by Vonnegut's ability to turn every truth upside down and every lie inside out. The revelations of truth were in every contradiction and the fullness of humanity in every insanity and evil act. This book will make you question what is right and what is true about the things we think we believe and believe in.Vonnegut was a prescient writer in his day, and his work is still ahead of its time."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Kurt Vonnegut was treated by psychiatrists but, since I'm a veteran, too, I believe his troubles might have been entirely PTSD. Vonnegut was obsessed with Europe in WWII and wrote much about it. One of his finest novels -- the only one that wasn't sci fi or fantasy -- is MOTHER NIGHT, made into a 1990s movie starring Nick Nolte. It's worth seeing, although Nolte was miscast.But, as usual, the book is much better. MOTHER NIGHT is the story of Howard Campbell, an American who is in Germany, married to a German woman, when WWII breaks out. Under Army Intelligence orders Howard acts as a \\"Lord HawHaw\\" in Germany during WWII and sends code signals to the Allies during his broadcasts. His apolitical (and much loved) wife is the daughter of a fanatic Nazi, and Howard is pulled this way and that until he doesn't understand his own loyalties, becoming bewildered and confused. After losing his wife in the war Howard wants to die and turns himself in to the Israelis as a war criminal, but ironically, is released when the US Army vouches for him. He returns to the US for the first time since about 1920. You should not expect a happy ending.Now and then Vonnegut throws in comic relief to lighten an essentially bleak story, especially his lampoons of white supremacists in America and the hilarious name of a Nazi, \\"Kraptauer\\".DON'T MISS THIS BOOK IF YOU HAVEN'T READ IT. Superb psychology, and in a way it's Vonnegut's own story, because of his ultra-German upbringing in a German neighborhood in Indianapolis, where every block had a string quartet and someone who could recite Schiller's poems and direct Lessing's plays in German. Although he hated Hiler he was raised to be proud of being a cultural German, as every child should be of his/her own heritage. How conflicted Kurt Vonnegut must have been! Why didn't the Army send German Americans to the Pacific, as they sent Japanese Americans to Europe?"},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Vonnegut tells the reader at the beginning of this book that it is one of his only books for which he knows the moral of the story - you are what you pretend to be.In Mother Night, Vonnegut tells the story of Howard W. Campbell Jr., an American who lives in Germany prior to WWII and is recruited by the United States to act as a spy in Nazi Germany. Campbell becomes one of the most valuable Allied spies of the war, but acts as a Nazi radio propagandist during the war, serving the Nazis as well, or maybe even better, than he does the Allies.The novel covers the fallout in Campbell's life from his decisions. It is a dark story, but it is told in a manner typical of Vonnegut, using humor and a free-form style to lighten the mood. You get to witness many characters' judgements of Campbell, but none are decisive. You are left to decide for yourself what you think of Campbell.Fantastic. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"This early work is quite uncharacteristic for Kurt Vonnegut, far more conventional than almost any other Vonnegut novel. It's unfortunate and surprising that he didn't write like this more often, because this relatively obscure novel just might be the best Kurt Vonnegut ever wrote.Unlike most of his work, it has no elements of SF or the fantastic: no aliens, no synopses of novels by Kilgore Trout,no silly drawings thrown in for the hell of it, and no narration from a ghost as in Galapagos, although the narrator is about as near a ghost as a living man can be.What it lacks in these areas is more than compensated by characters, often an afterthought in Vonnegut, but in this story rich and fully realized.Howard Campbell is a marginally successful American playwright who became to the world world a notorious and legendary Nazi propagandist while secretly being an agent of the OSS (the predecessor of the CIA) whose broadcasts were filled with vital intelligence eagerly decrypted by American agents. After the war, Campbell was secretly repatriated to the US, but, for reasons that are never made clear, the truth was never revealed, so when Campbell's life of obscure retirement is interrupted by the exposure of his identity, he is treated as a traitor by most while being hailed as a hero by a small group of crackpot Nazi sympathizers.Ultimately, he is abducted by Israeli agents and put on trial as a war criminal. The novel is presented as his memoirs written from an Israeli prison cell; memoirs which focus on his life as a spy and the loss of the great love of his life, an actress named Helga who was killed on the German equivalent of a USO tour.The question at the book's heart is whether a mask, presented to the world long enough, becomes a reality rather than a mask. Campbell is told by a friend that, even if he were a spy, his broadcasts couldn't possibly have been more valuable as intelligence than they were as propaganda that kept German spirits up. Vonnegut himself seems to answer the question, saying in a brief foreword that the moral is, &quot;You are what you pretend to be, so be careful what you pretend to be.&quot; But is that what the novel really says? Campbell perhaps has ultimately done more evil than good, but he is not an evil man. At one point he meets a character who is willing, even eager, to pretend to be something she is not; Campbell is unwilling to accept the imposture.Some amusing comic relief is provided by the neo-Nazis Campbell finds himself unwillingly thrown in with, who are treated as more ridiculous than sinister."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Vonnegut did an excellent job in this story. There wasn't any science fiction in this book like many of his others, but the character Howard Campbell was great. The story has great twists to it and it makes for quick reading. I had a hard trying to put this one down, and I think it is a must read for any Vonnegut fan."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"I just finished re-reading this book, and it was even better the second time around. This book is mostly about plot and morales, and less about charcters, although our main charcter is quite interesting. Jaded by the war, he has nothing to do with the rest of his life but hide. I dont want to give away any plot points, but the moral of the story is clear and brilliant &quot;We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be&quot; But towards the end of the book, as Campbell is giving to the man who hate him, he says &quot;Where's evil? Its the large part of very man that wants to hate without limit, that wants to hate with God on its side&quot;. Thats why i read Vonnegut."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Vonnegut is one of those writers whom everybody either loves or hates--there's very little middle ground. He's like vanilla Coke.&quot;Mother Night&quot; is situated right on that narrow little line. It's a book that just about anyone can enjoy, even the most ardent foes of Indiana's favorite son. It was his third novel and, as such, represents the sort of pre-caricature phase that ended with the breakaway success of &quot;Cat's Cradle&quot; two years later. Here you see Vonnegut at his most human and, in some ways, his most vulnerable as he switches off the bombastic humor and lets his reader see the man behind the curtain.Of course, the characteristic Vonnegut still shines through, but it's muted by a disarming candor about love lost and the stagnation it breeds. If you don't know anything about Vonnegut, this is a great place to start. If you love him, this book will make you melt. If you hate him, well, it might at least give you pause."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"This book started a bit slowly compared to other Vonnegut novels, and I suspect that is because the tone is a bit more muted, the humour more subtle. This is to be expected in a novel that positions the Holocaust as one of its central devices, and once I understood how the story was being approached I appreciated the difference to other Vonnegut efforts. It does pack all of the outrageous turns of fate and plot that you might expect, but they don't hit you with a laugh out loud momentum. Instead they hit you with a deep insight to the ambiguity of the characters, their lives and situations that carry forward the very profound central theme. Vonnegut states that the moral of the novel is that we are what we pretend, so we should be very careful about what we pretend to be. His tale illustrates this to perfection."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"The twists in this book blew me away. Never have I gasped while reading a book before. Perhaps my second favorite Vonnegut book behind bluebeard."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Initial Thoughts:I read this book for my Literature and War class.I've never read any of Kurt Vonnegut's other works but after this book I'm sure I will. After reading the description on the back, it was hard to imagine how an author could include humor in a situation where an American spy ends up in an Israeli prison, but Kurt Vonnegut had me laughing out loud. It was one of those laughs were you weren't sure if it was appropriate or politically correct, but it was so darn funny you just couldn't help it.Spoilers!Howard W. Campbell, our main character, was an American spy posing as a German Nazi. Throughout the book we get a lot of insight about what he did as a Nazi and why he was so effective. Howard really struggles with comprehending whether he was acting as an American or if he really had crossed the line into Nazi territory. This is where the \`chilling shade of gray' phrase comes from.Howard discusses his life before, during, and after the war up to the present time. The chapters weave together through the past and the present in such a fluid way, it was unlike anything I've ever read before. There are twists and turns I honestly did NOT see coming which kept the book exciting and turned it into a really fast read.I may have a weird or awkward sense of humor because I found most of this book hilarious. I'm not sure if anyone would agree with me so I've been trying to justify why I found it so funny and my conclusion is this: the Nazi view is so unlike my own, and their ideals are so ridiculous, I just couldn't help but laugh.Don't get the wrong idea though, this book did have its funny parts, but the war and the death is still a very present aspect. From Howard's point of view we see the deaths of Jews and Germans, something that to my knowledge hasn't been explored before in the same book. On one page you're learning about Howard's experience in a Jewish camp and in the next you're hearing about how a German he knew is killed. It was a wild experience to have these two events relayed so closely together and it puts this war into a new perspective.Conclusion:For whatever reason I loved this book. I was shocked by the ending, but I know I'll read it again. I'm definitely going to look into more of Vonnegut's work and I can't believe I haven't read more of him already!I also wanted to mention that the drawings on the front and back cover were made by Kurt Vonnegut, which I think is super cool! I also really enjoyed the Introduction and the Editor's Note and the names of the chapters. I think I just really like Kurt Vonnegut.Anyways, I'd recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in WWII, or an interest in spies. This book was a super fast read, I think it only took me five or so hours.Rating:4/5 stars"},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Vonnegut is tied as my favorite author along with Philip k Dick, however that doesn't mean I have loved all his books. But I must place this one under the \\"love\\" column. It has Vonnegut's trademark sarcasm and satiric voice going in full force along with his mastery of subtle humor. I would strongly recommend reading this book along with others of his; more specifically Breakfast of Champions, Cat's Cradle, and Slaughterhouse Five."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Poignant, satirical exploration of war, politics, love and society. The ease and enjoyment of reading these pages belies the breadth of life's mysteries which are touched in this sardonic tale."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"What I took away from this book was the idea that you'd better be meticulous with the maintenance of your own character, because you have very little control over anything else. While the protagonist was impacted by events not of his own making, it also was true that anything that he built turned against him, and every petty crime or minor indiscretion that he committed was granted a life of its own, grew to immense proportions, and returned to wreak havoc upon him. In the midst of all that, he maintained a great equanimity.I enjoyed the book immensely. It was humorous, farcical, and had a lot of plot twists. It was episodic, with each chapter/episode being a few pages long, so it moved along quite quickly. I haven't read much Vonnegut, but this is the one I enjoyed most, and would definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Mother Night is a short read but loved every page. I was skeptical at first, at first it seems like it's going to be regular book about the confessions of a Nazi war criminal.This is a book about serving evil too openly and good too secretly, and what it can do to a man pretending to be someone he's not."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Kurt Vonnegut cracks me up. But after reading most of his novels, I think Mother Night is my favorite. Unlike some of his other works, it appears to be the most focused and clean. It zones in on Vonnegut's strengths: historically based (WWII) characters that give us social commentary and a main character with so many flaws that he becomes both sad and hilarious. I especially appreciated the point of view: 1st person narration from a jail cell, telling the back story to explain to the reader why this guy's in prison in Israel. It's also a daring perspective to take: that of a Nazi propagandist. How do you sympathize?-- but you do! Also, I laughed out loud at the dialogue in the final showdown between the narrator and the man who'd dedicated his life to killing him. It is ridiculous and thoughtful at the same time. How does Vonnegut do it? He was a master humorist and storyteller."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"one of his best books; a great read as is most of his work.

After finishing the book, I still have no Idea if Cambell was a real person or not. (I don't think so, but the author made him feel like a real person.) My only complaint is that the plot was never clearly defined and it constantly shifted in time. But other than slight lack of focus(which works in a way since it is the last written words of a probably soon to be convicted war criminal possibly about to be hanged, making the story all the more realistic.) Overall this was a great book with all issues such as morality and responsibility. In fact, I loved the idea that a man working as a spy could serve the side he is spying on far more than he could ever serve the ones he is spying for... all unintentionally. Vonnegut loads the story with humorous ironies also."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"I love KV. I bought this book because it received 5 stars where books I truely love like Blue Beard, did not.

I finished it and reread the introduction and then it became clear to me why this was unlike any Vonnegut book that I had ever read. It's subtitled &quot;The Confessions of Howard W.

I was actually convinced that his character was a real person to the extent that I attempted to research any existing records pertaining to him. This is a great love story and war epic that deserves to be ranked with the greatest works of Ameican fiction."},{"Title":"A Dooryard Herb Cookbook","review":"This is another great book by Linda Ours Rago. It's also a companion book to DOOYARD HERBS. The author has a distinct style of writing and makes you wish that she lived on your street so that you could drop in for some cake and tea, and of course some gardening advice.This is not just a book with recipes. Mrs. Rago tells us in the beginning of the book that &quot;Herbs are the soul of flavor,&quot; and advises us that fresh herbs are best. She encourages the reader to grow their own plants, and helps by giving some simple designs for herbal gardens. A list is also provided of the various herbs that are used in the recipes so you can check and see if you have them growing in your garden or packaged on your pantry shelf.The herbal blends in stores are pricey, but here were given the specific herbal blends for: Herb Salt, Herb Pepper, Instead Of Salt, Herb Sugars, Fine Herbs and the Herbal Blends for Poultry, Lamb, Pork, Beef and Seafood. I was also happy to learn the ingredients for Italian and French Herbal mixtures.The recipes are presented in monthly groupings. Each month of the year is discussed and appropriate recipes are presented. For January, Linda says &quot;After a lingering purple sunrise even the little herb garden is ice-edged with cold, as though the magic of high summer never was.&quot; Among the recipes given for this month are four kinds of soup, including Savory Lentil Soup and Herb Soup With Cheese. One of my favorite recipes from the book, Oatmeal Pound Cake is also in this section and the author goes on to say that, &quot;January baking calls for something to nibble with a steaming cup of tea. This is a rich satisfying pound cake with a crisp outside. What I also like is the addition of rolled oats and yogurt to help fortify us against the weather.&quot;This enjoys a special place with the favorite books that stay near your most comfortable chair."},{"Title":"Candide and Other Stories (World's Classics)","review":"This book has the title &quot;Candide and other stories&quot;, but the exciting part is the other stories. Yes &quot;Candide&quot; is a great work and perhaps the best satircal work of the 18th century, but it alone does not do justice to Voltaire's genius.Like a lot of people I had read &quot;Candide&quot; years ago for school and was impressed with the work. However, I soon forgot about it and never really thought about Voltaire's other works. As I was browsing Amazon one day I saw this book and thought it was time to revisit this old friend. Boy was I lucky.Three of the &quot;other stories&quot; are every bit as good as &quot;Candide&quot;. &quot;Micromegas&quot; is a fine SciFi work from the 1740's. It comes complete with a Saturnian and Syrian and relates their struggle to understand the Earth's philosophies. &quot;Zadig&quot; unfolds in a similar manner to &quot;Candide&quot; but may be even more biting. Finally &quot;The Ingenu&quot; holds special interest for Americans as it chronicles the problems encountered by a young Huron &quot;Savage&quot; as he relocates to &quot;Civilized&quot; France. The final story &quot;The White Bull&quot; is not in the same class as the rest of the works in this book, but still is a fun read.It was nice to see my old friend &quot;Candide&quot;, but even nicer to meet the new friends that are here. If you are considering buying one of the other copies which have only &quot;Candide&quot; the extra works here make this version so much richer."},{"Title":"Candide and Other Stories (World's Classics)","review":"Voltaire is a master saterist, not a comedian. As with all satire, it hslps if we understand the contemporary world in which the author writes, but Voltaire's skill raises Candide above this level of satirical writing. He is masterful in the use of comedy to poke fun at the customs, mores, and beliefs of his time and show us the silliness to shich theunenlightened mind can go in the pursuit of perfection in an imperfect world. As a commentator on human culture he is followed by Mark Twain. Not that Twain can match Voltaire in his skill, only in some of his perceptions. This is an \\"old\\" book by new world reckoning, but as a masterpiecce well worth the time and effort of exploaration it is a timeless masterpiece. I highly recommend it to both believer and non-believer."},{"Title":"Candide and Other Stories (World's Classics)","review":"Everyone has their own idea of the perfect book, a list of approved characteristcs they think will cohere into something magical. Instead of psychological realism or detailed descriptions of nature, I like brisk, multiplying narratives, stories within stories, digressions, picaresque journies, a profusion of character and incident, dreams, exoticism, strange lands, bookishness, adn relentless violence. 'Candide' has this, and more, and is therefore my perfect book. Like anything that is theoretically perfect (an equivalent in film might by Losey's 'Mr. Klein') is that one is left a little unsatisfied - after all, where's the element of surprise? There are further grounds for grumbling - Voltaire can often come across as an annoying, opportunistic jack-of-all-trades; while the sheer excess of plot, narrated in the same urbane toneslessness, always risks becoming monotonous. But such quibbles are ungrateful. 'Candide' is one of the few classics that is genuinesly entertaining and uproariously, blackly comic. The Enlightenment values today are less convincing than the deadpan depiction of pervasive evil and the randomness of human destiny. The book is full of horrific incident - earthquakes, massacares, gang-rapes, mutilation, burnings, etc. - and yet comes across as almost breezy, and always laugh-out-loud-funny. I wish Bunuel had filmed this."},{"Title":"Candide and Other Stories (World's Classics)","review":"Where else can one read the narration of an optimist who looses his friends to death, escapes the European mainland, discovers utopia, returns to the mainland, and reunites with friends who were believed to be dead, while infused with the philosophical and political wit of Voltaire?

Micromegas -- an 18th century science-fiction story with a Sirian and Saturnian finding insignificant life on this insignificant planet3. Zadig -- a sort of oriental tale like \\"The Thousand and One Nights\\"4. What Pleases the Ladies -- a long risque poem which gives one a few different ideas on what pleases the ladies5.

In spite of the disasters and disappointments that befall mankind, Candide and an array of companions attempt to make sense of their personal tragedies while shoehorning it into the Leibniz theory.Candide is well-written, and sprinkled with cute and clever irony. I also enjoyed the references Voltaire makes to his personal enemies in Candide. However, the optimistic theory that prompted this satire has been rejected, which leads me to believe there isn't much purpose for this book any longer. Really the only reason left to read Candide is to become 'culturally literate', I suppose. Don't get me wrong; the ultimate message of this book is a good one. However, I hope readers don't think Candide's lesson must preclude optimism all together, or love, or friends, or God. That fact is obscured to make a literary point.The only interesting question that remains to be asked from this book is: why does such cyncism accompany 'enlightenment'? Both French and American societies are rife with it after all, so much that I doubt even Voltaire could manage much of a smirk. All he could do would be to join the choir and tend the garden he has sown."},{"Title":"Keeping Spiritual Balance As We Grow Older: More than 65 Creative Ways to Use Purpose, Prayer, and the Power of Spirit to Build a Meaningful Retirement","review":"Collaboratively compiled and organized by Molly and Bernie Srode, Keeping Spiritual Balance As We Grow Older is an anthology of 65 ways to creatively use prayer and the power of spirit to preserve meaning in one's life post-retirement.

Now and then a gem shows up, but most of them are pretty stock stuff. Old books, though, can be a wealth of material, and that is one off many reasons for the success of Portland's Powell's Books. Among its exhaustive collection, a remarkable book came my way, Naotaka Hirota's The Lure of Japanese Railways. a masterpiece that is more than just a railroad book, but rather a photographic window into another time and place: Japan, circa 1969.Following a brief introduction by the photographer, the book is divided into four sections; a short series of color plates, a vast number of black-and-white plates, a technical appendix on the status of Japan's railways, and a section of captions. Most images are either double truck or full page, grouped by titled themes, and are accompanied by only a small plate number for a caption. Stylistically the photos take center stage, with the text playing a minimal and highly supportive role: this is a true photographer's monograph and nothing else.Hirota is a contemporary of American railway photographers like Richard Steinheimer. His work has been noted occasionally in U.S. publications, including 2003's Starlight on the Rails. Hirota lives up to his contemporaries well; his images display a thoughtful creativity and a playful composition that raises the book's subject matter to a far higher level than most railroad books achieve. Hirota has a keen photojournalist's eye and virtuosity, and is as adept with human interest subjects as with abstracts, motion-heavy images, and scenic landscapes. There is excellence here.The subject matter itself is extraordinary, a time capsule of a \\"modern\\" 20th century Japan. Teakettle steam engines take diminutive passenger trains to rural stations; massive steam locomotives assault snow-laden lines; sleek white bullet-nosed Shinkansens speed at aircraft-like velocities past iconic Mount Fuji. Hirota doesn't miss the context either, and in some cases puts the context right up front where it can't be ignored. Plate six, for example, places a field of yellow flowers in soft focus for over 80% of the frame; it's only at the very top that you see the white-and-blue Shinkansen streaking by in a blur. The bold imagery is a delight to behold. In a somewhat less provocative example, Hirota places workers and commuters in the forefront of images throughout the last half of the work.The Lure of Japan's Railways doesn't come without flaws. Many images are printed double-truck, which in a book this size is sometimes awkward; the center of plate 31's speeding Shinkansens gets lost in the fold, robing the image of much of its impact. Overall reproduction is excellent, although I wish that the black-and-white images were printed on the same gloss stock paper as the color images up front. The book originally came with a dust jacket, but some examples I've seen at booksellers have long since shod theirs.In the end, The Lure of Japan's Railways is more than just a railroad book, or even a railroad photo book. It is an excellent work that stands as a remarkable touchstone of 20th century photojournalism. Anyone with an interest in photojournalism would do well to have the book, and it would be welcome as well to those with an interest in industrial photography, railroads, or the culture of Japan."},{"Title":"Ace of Knaves","review":"This book, from 1937, comprises three short novels (or novellas).\\"The Spanish War\\" is in fact the Civil War, and the story concerns a scheme to finance Franco with forged bonds.The background is, as usual, accurate. Charteris was actually in the Canary Islands when Franco was there plotting with the Germans. At that time, the British government was bent on appeasement (or more accurately, as subsequently declassified documents now show, active collaboration). But the author (as shown by the Saint's embittered opening speech, which &mdash; characteristically &mdash; also manages to embrace the British licensing laws) was a fan of neither Franco nor Hitler. Charteris (along with Tolkien and H.J. Eysenck) was one of those known later as \\"premature anti-Nazis\\".In \\"The Unlicensed Victuallers\\", the Saint deals drastically with smugglers, and in \\"The Beauty Specialist\\" with a particularly vicious blackmailer. These two stories are somewhat grimmer than usual, but the last especially is among my favourites.Hoppy Uniatz figures prominently, and Pat, Orace, Peter and Claud Eustace are all here.P.S. For a list of &mdash; and discussion of &mdash; all Charteris's Saint books, see my So You'd Like To... Guide."},{"Title":"Rosanna of the Amish","review":"This book gives a nicely written look into the life of a young girl being brought up in the Amish tradition. It focuses on Rosanna's life and that of her family, and allows the reader a glimpse into what traditions and values the Amish instill in their children. The story goes into detail about such things as holidays, prayers, weddings -- even down to how they set their tables! A thoroughly enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Rosanna of the Amish","review":"While this book may not be for everybody, and it might not include all the aspects that a reader might expect - kind of a one stop shopping to tell everything that is necessary to understand this sect - it nevertheless tells you what the Amish are really like and why they wear the unusual clothes they do, as well as preach against the \\"worldly wisdom.\\" You get to follow Rosanna through her childhood, youth, courtship, and marriage, and child-rearing. Not only that, you see how her Amish life will differ from that of her Catholic friends, especially when they visit from their Philadelphia home.While this is not a modern day presentation, it is really useful as a historical piece. Just don't get bogged down by expecting a thorough intellectual examination of the Amish. The book is not intended for that. It is written as a honest, sympathetic and straightforward reflection of these folks from a religious, social, and economic snapshot. The traditions of the Amish are celebrated, and it's done very nicely. Recommended!!!"},{"Title":"Rosanna of the Amish","review":"I loved this book....and was sorry to see it end. The author (son of Rosanna) wrote a beautiful yet simple and compelling biography on the life of his mother, and the people closest in her life. I felt privileged reading this story - almost as if I were a member of this close-knit community. This story of honor and simple values would be wonderful today as it was then. Probably the most surprising statements which helped me to put it in perspective were comments made about Lincoln.....while I would prefer to believe this was a modern day story - stage coaches were in use and Lincoln was the President of the day. I highly recommend this book as an insight into the wisdom of how people should hold respect for one another, how families could work together for each other's good......and how communities can thrive without the aid of much of the electronic gadgetry of our modern times. This is a book of simple wisdom and peaceable lives. I am so grateful to son Joseph for his writing. There is even a very few pages at the end of the book, telling a bit about him......I highly recommend this book and hope you find value in it as I certainly did."},{"Title":"Rosanna of the Amish","review":"The author is the son of the main character, Rosanna. Rosanna is the daughter of an Irish immigrant who is born around 1840 (my estimate as it is never given in the book). Rosanna's mother dies following Rosanna's birth. She is given to an Amish family on a temporary basis. When her father dies some months later, she ends up being permanently adopted and rasied by this old order Amish woman who later marries and bears more children.The author tells this interesting story, all the while weaving information about the lives of the old order Amish. I found this an interesting read. Explanations for why the Amish do things the way they do are given. There are details about their religious services, weddings, and funerals. Why they refuse to buy medical or fire insurance, why they refuse government aide, and why they refuse to fight in American wars is all explained.The author ends up going to college and later leaves the old order Amish to become a Mennonite. The old order Amish don't allow attending college as the author chose to do, to further his formal training as a teacher, so he had to change religious affiliations.What is missing from this book is a true spirit for Rosanna as a woman. Specifically, there is not much emotion or thoughts about certain things such as what it is like to mother children. There was virtually nothing about the experience of pregnancy, childbirth from her point of view, or how she could balance all that work and rearing so many children. The emotional aspect of losing her only daughter when she was just a toddler was not really elaborated on. I understand that it may be the custom to not verbally express emotions but I refuse to believe that emotions are not experienced...then again, if she was quiet about expressing her emotions I guess she would not have told her son therefore making these thoughts impossible for him to know and write about. Also missing was an explanation for what an Amish childhood is like, how much do they play and work? How much do they contribute to the laborious farm work the families accomplish? How does a busy Amish mother have time to pamper and enjoy her newborn baby? Also I'd like some parenting information such as common philosophies such as \\"is corporal punishment used\\"?Something else that I would have appreciated is a bit of an overview of the differences between the different orders and about the differences with the Mennonites. A better explanation of when and why people are ex-communicated, banned or shunned would put things more in perspective. There is nothing about this except a couple of sentences of inferred information. To get that information will take further research and reading.The account of the old order Amish is tastefully and respectfully written about in this book. I think this would make a great read aloud book for young children or as a book for a young person to read to themselves, perhaps if learning about American history or just to satisfy a curiosity about the Amish. There is nothing in here that is controversial such as sexual content. Since they live such a clean and virtuous life, there is nothing that needs censoring here for young children.The old order Amish are portrayed as a content, happy, and peaceful people. If we each changed a few things we non-Amish do to follow in their footsteps we'd be all the better for it."},{"Title":"Rosanna of the Amish","review":"I remember my mother reading this book to the family when I was a child so when I found it in the bookstore I had to pick it up.I found the book interesting and the Amish a fascinating group of people. The book tells about the Amish and about growing up Amish. The Amish live a totally different type of lifestyle than most of us are used to and this book explains some of their reasons for why that is. In living close to them I was able to compare what the book said with what I saw them doing.If you ever find this book I recommend reading it."},{"Title":"Rosanna of the Amish","review":"Rosanna of the Amish is the story of a young orphan raised in the 1800's among the Amish of Pennsylvania. Beginning with it's first pages, the story reaches out and pulls you in. From it's descriptions of the Amish worship to the simplcity of daily life, it brings the often secluded world of the Amish to life, not only describing how things are done, but in many cases why...I couldn't put the book down once I started and to date have read it numberous times. It is a classic that bears reading and re-reading."},{"Title":"Rosanna of the Amish","review":"First written in 1940, this book tells the story of the author's mother, an Irish girl who was orphaned as a newborn and raised by an Amish neighbor after her father and older siblings move away. Rosanna grows up to be Amish in everyway, and over the years, she does get a chance to see her Catholic siblings from time to time and the difference in their lives.I enjoyed the character Rosanna and reading about her life. Her characterization, and that of other characters was good, but not outstanding. What makes this book so enjoyable is how naturally the author brings you into the Amish lifestyle. We learn about dress, selection of ministers, the bann, courtship, worship services, etc and very much feel like we're part of the scene. There are some differences compared to the Amish of today (and between different groups), in the exact specifics of dress, most using generators and having bathrooms today, etc, but the fundamentals of the group and their basic principles are the same.To anyone who is fascinated by the Amish or enjoys reading other Amish books, I would definitely recommend this one. This book has the advantage of being written by one who grew up in the community. It conveys the lifestyle very well and is an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Rosanna of the Amish","review":"I thought this was one of the most interesting books I've read all school year. I've always wondered about the amish society, but until I finished this book this afternoon, I didn't have any clue as to what the amish believed.Joseph Yoder makes it possible for people like me to really enjoy a school book.I really think that if you have any questions about the amish to go straight to this book and read it."},{"Title":"Rosanna of the Amish","review":"I read this book almost thirty years ago, and read it again this year. My memories of a great story about the Amish were completely confirmed on the second reading. Joseph Yoder tells a very sensitive and caring story about his mother, Rosanna, and the family and Amish community in which he grew up. The reader must accept that the book was first published many decades ago and therefore was written to different standards than today's family stories. I credit the author with refraining from judgement when it comes to doctrinal differences among various Amish and Mennonite groups. The fact that he left the Old Order church of his childhood for a less conservative church, yet was still fully accepted in the community of his youth speaks for the respect he retained in the Old Order group. If you are looking for a completely family friendly story with great information on the Old Order Amish of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, you will not find a more enjoyable read.Rosanna's Boys"},{"Title":"Rosanna of the Amish","review":"The book was in great condition and was exactly how they described it.
